Tonight Will Be Fine Lyrics
Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past
We swore to each other then our love would surely last
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast
Now I am too thin and your love is too vast

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while

I choose the rooms that I live in with care
The windows are small and the walls almost bare
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer
I listen all night for your step on the stair

But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while
Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory

And I know from her eyes
And I know from her smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while1Embed
