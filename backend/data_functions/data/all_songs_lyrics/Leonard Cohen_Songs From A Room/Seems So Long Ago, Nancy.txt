Seems So Long Ago, Nancy LyricsIt seems so long ago
Nancy was alone
Looking at the Late Late show
Through a semi-precious stone
In the House of Honesty
Her father was on trial
In the House of Mystery
There was no one at all
There was no one at all
It seems so long ago
None of us were strong;
Nancy wore green stockings
And she slept with everyone
She never said she'd wait for us
Although she was alone
I think she fell in love for us
In nineteen sixty one
In nineteen sixty one
It seems so long ago
Nancy was alone
A forty five beside her head
An open telephone
We told her she was beautiful
We told her she was free
But none of us would meet her in
The House of Mystery
The House of Mystery
And now you look around you
See her everywhere
Many use her body
Many comb her hair
And In the hollow of the night
When you are cold and numb
You hear her talking freely then
She's happy that you've come
She's happy that you've come3Embed
