The Old Revolution LyricsI finally broke into the prison
I found my place in the chain
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows
All the brave young men
They're waiting now to see a signal
Which some killer will be lighting for pay
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
You whom I cannot betray
I fought in the old revolution
On the side of the ghost and the king
Of course I was very young
And I thought that we were winning
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing
As they carry the bodies away
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
You whom I cannot betray
Lately you've started to stutter
As though you had nothing to say
To all of my architects let me be traitor
Now let me say I myself gave the order
To sleep and to search and to destroy
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
You whom I cannot betray
Yes, you who are broken by power
You who are absent all day
You who are kings for the sake of your children's story
The hand of your beggar is burdened down with money
The hand of your lover is clay
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture
You whom I cannot betray2Embed
