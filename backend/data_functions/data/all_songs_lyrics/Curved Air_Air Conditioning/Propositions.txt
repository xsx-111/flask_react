Propositions LyricsSee red but I call myself up
A paying proposition
Gonna find a man
A paying proposition for your pantomime
I found a nice way to die
Ah, ah... hey, hey
See red but I call myself up
A paying proposition for your pantomime
A paying proposition for your pantomime
I found a nice way to die
Ah, ah... hey, heyEmbed
