Stretch LyricsStretch the mildest morning
When I got to be out of bed
Crazy dreams still floating
In the mist around my head
This was meant for you
That was meant for me yeah
T his was meant for you
That was meant for me, yeah
Since I met that frown
Saw others think they're fair
For me I prefer those lovin' smiles
And a dozen it must hove been
This was meant for you
That was meant for me, yeah
This was meant for you
That was meant for me, yeah
Stretch the mildest morning
When I got to be out of bеd
Crazy dreams still floating
In the mist around my head
This was mеant for you
That was meant for me yeah
T his was meant for you
That was meant for me, yeahEmbed
