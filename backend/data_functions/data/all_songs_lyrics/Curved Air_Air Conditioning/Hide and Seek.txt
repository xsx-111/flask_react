Hide and Seek LyricsNight time come and lay and hide and seek
(I have got to find you)
Streets to search and I am here alone
(Try to doubt the unknown)
Walk in the streets
I call your name
And no one comes
Running through the town
I call your name
I know no one here
Shadows forming where the night begins
(Just the breeze comes in)
Doors all closed and window curtains drawn
(All the people are gone)
Walk in the streets
I call your name
And no one comes
Running through the town
I call your name
I know no one here
Doors all closed and window curtains drown
(All the pеople are gone)
Streets dеserted and I am here alone
(Try to doubt the unknown)Embed
