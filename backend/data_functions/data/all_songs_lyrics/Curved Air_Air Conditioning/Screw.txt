Screw LyricsSee the screw slowly turn around
See it sink without a sound
Feel your head slip with every turn
Feel the steel knob begin to burn
All is lost now, it seems that way
All is lost now, it seems that way
Seeing a face through broken glass
Seeing the patterns of your past
Feeling the earth shake, try to walk
Losing your reason, try to talk
All is lost now, it seems that way
All is lost now, it seems that wayEmbed
