Situations LyricsThough I am no longer alone
Everybody seems to take my mind away
I love you but it isn't as I planned
I promise you I've done the best I can
Haven't touched any other man
Situations seem to have been kind to you
I've wished to be beside somebody else
But actions are the proof of love, not thoughts
See what a fool I've been
I haven't lived my dream
Seems that it will be a long time
'Fore my mind will take in the reality
That life is not as simple as it seems
And night's the only place to keep a dream
Soft green sun color still
Warm breeze, high-floating birds
Every year has brought more fear
Younger days seem to be easy
Full of fun and things to keep my mind awake
But now I have to think for someone else
Cannot even think straight for myselfEmbed
