It Happened Today LyricsYesterday you know it never really happened
Tomorrow you know it never really had
You, you're only what you think you might be
I am only what you think I am
It happened today
It happened today
It happened today
It happened today
I know that you're afraid of what might happen
Uncertain what to give and what to take
Already you've forgotten why you came here
I can see exactly why you came
It happened today
It happened today
It happened today
It happened today
What I was I find it hard to be now
Now I am and very soon you'll feel
You keep tellin' me the time is tellin'
I tell you the time will tell in time
It happened today
It happened today
It happened today
It happened today
