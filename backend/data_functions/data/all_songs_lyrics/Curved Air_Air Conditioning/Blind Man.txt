Blind Man LyricsI'll be your purse if you will come back
And set the blind man to his door
If man's best friend will be my friend
Until the bitter end
Days and nights which chuck and turn
Walk by through them to me all the time
The world can blend
I'll be in company
I will follow where you lead
Our paths will never cross us
The sounds and smells of wind and rain
With help I know we'll get there
Loneliness is the friend I knew
Has ceased the script at last
The emptiness I always f–µlt
Has been replaced by youEmbed
