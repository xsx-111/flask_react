Trust LyricsExcuse me please as I wipe a tear
Away from an eye that sees there's nothing left to trust
Finding that their minds are grey
And there's no sorrow in the world that's left to trust
Sitting on top of a white cloud
Looking round for someone there to trust
Changing your mind as you go through time
You grasp at straws
There are written laws that say you must
With tired eyes you follow the man
That has in his hand a banner that says 'dust to dust'
Finding that his mind's gone wrong
And there's no sorrow in the world that's left to trust
Sitting on top of that white cloud
Looking round for someone there to trust
You're changing your mind as you go through time
You grasp at straws
There are written laws that say you must
Going away in the morning
You're seen walking
You're going away, away
Going away
As the sun is rising
You're seen walking
You're going away, away
Going away
Excuse me please as I wipe a tear
Away from an eye that sees there's nothing left to trust
Finding that their minds are grey
And there's no sorrow in the world that's left to trust
Sitting on top of that white cloud
Looking round for someone there to trust
Changing your mind as you go through time
You grasp at straws
There are written laws that say you mustEmbed
