Bracelets Of Fingers Lyrics
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, land of love

These are a few of the
Things I find joy
Bracelets of fingers
Since I was a boy

Fly to the moon and I'll get there quite soon
If I wait awhile
Cradled in branches that stretch out their arms
I must wait awhile
Bending my mind as I pick up
The flowers in May
Hearing the laughter
That turns into tears every day

Fly to the Moon on the curve of a spoon
I turn upside-down
Tumbling through leaves as I scatter the seeds
On an eiderdown
Love, love, love, land of love

Fly to the Moon and I'll get there quite soon
If I wait awhile
Daylight arrives with a turn of the skies
I must wait awhile
Clouds building castles, the wind comes
And blows them away
Tears in the water
Make circles for me as I play

Fly to the Moon on the curve of a spoon
I turn upside-down
Tumbling through leaves as I scatter the seeds
On an eiderdown

Love, love, love, land of love

These are a few of the
Things l find joy
Bracelets of fingers
Since I was a boyEmbed
