Private Sorrow LyricsHeaven's rain falls upon
Faces of the children who look skyward
Twisting metal through the air
Scars and screams so you might know his fury
See shells whistle
Let your mind drift away
See shells whistle
Let yourself hide away
Men walking tall, looking so small
Green trees of life disappearing
Mouthing the sounds, face clowning the frowns
Black the lips of command
Torn in the heart, you're playing the part
Courage, it is so demanding
Loud brass in bands, marching through lands
Life snatching hand is near
Heaven's army falls upon
The skirts of Mother Earth and then flies skywards
Twisting wings through the air
Lift the souls so you might know his fury
See shells whistle
Let your mind drift away
See shells whistle
Let yourself hide away
Dressed in white silk of rain, you marry the pain
As you kneel in a church of bright steel
A new morning arrives, you share the same skies
Umbrella ring a land full of peace
As the memory fades on the edge of a blade
You'll return you 're sure that you will
From the frame in your hand, a smile expands
Hangs from a thread of glass tearsEmbed
