Loneliest Person Lyrics
You might be the loneliest person in the world
You'll never be as lonely as me
Yes you might be the loneliest person in the world
You'll never be as lonely as me

All the sky it seems dark
As I'm walking through a park
But the face it is too bright to see
Or the sun might rise high
On an orange kind of sky
But the day it seems too dark for me

Yes you might be the loneliest person in the world
You'll never be as lonely as me
Yes you might be the loneliest person in the world
Your name it would have to be meEmbed
