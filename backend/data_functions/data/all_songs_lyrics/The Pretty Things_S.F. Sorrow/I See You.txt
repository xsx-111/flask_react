I See You LyricsAs evening shadows chase the sun
The night is here my day is done
Through dark forests of my mind
A light is shone - it's you I find
I see you
On a dark and windswept street
The faces I see of the people I meet
With their eyes they build a shrine
That takes me back to the forests of my mind
I see you
Silent shadows creep on walls
Catch the wind it's yours to catch
She's going away
As I look into the sea
The waves they break and part for me
As my mind slips into sand
The water returns with the warmth of your hand
I see you
Taking the steps, the steps to see...
Taking the steps, the steps to see...
Taking the steps, the steps to see...
Taking the steps, the steps to see...
Taking the steps, the steps to see...
Taking the steps, the steps to see...
Taking the steps, the steps to see...
Taking the steps, the steps to see...Embed
