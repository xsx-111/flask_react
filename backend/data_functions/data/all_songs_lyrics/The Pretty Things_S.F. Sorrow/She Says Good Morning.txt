She Says Good Morning Lyrics
She's there waiting at the gate
Painted by the dawn
She's there waiting at the gate
As the velvet night sky is torn

She says, "Good morning"
I smile and say the same

She stands, waiting at the gate
Smiling at the rain
As I turn to wave to her
I wish I could remain

She says, "Good morning"

She's there waiting at the gate
Morning all she sees

Threading through a web of gas
The rain precedes the storm
Coughing on my way to work
Her smile keeps me warm
She said, "Good morning"
I smiled and said the same

She stands, waiting at the gate
A picture in my brain

Good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good
Good morning, morning, morning, hey!
Morning, good, good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good, good morning
Good, good, good, good, good morning...Embed
