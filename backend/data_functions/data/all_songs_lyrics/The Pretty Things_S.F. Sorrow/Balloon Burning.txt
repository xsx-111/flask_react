Balloon Burning LyricsNew York -
Grey and Sorrow there to meet her
Night sky hangs
Around to greet her
She throws down
Lifeline of kisses
Anchored to the ground
Balloon descending
Then I see balloon is burning
Turning round burning
This balloon, burning
Fragments of my life
Falling
Sky on fire
All consuming
Then I see balloon is burning
Turning round burning
This balloon, burningEmbed
