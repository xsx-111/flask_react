The Journey LyricsCity it leaves without traces
Blind sparrow's carry me
Resting my head on a rainbow
High in a tree
Laughing at me
Crying at me
Seeing through me
In mirrors of tears I'm reflected
White naked figures twist the key
Turning my thoughts into shadows
Playing on the walls of me
Laughing at me
Crying at me
Seeing through meEmbed
