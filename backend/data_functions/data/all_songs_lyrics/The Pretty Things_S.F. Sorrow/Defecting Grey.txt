Defecting Grey Lyrics
Sitting alone on a bench with you
Mirrored above in the sky
Wondering if you will say goodnight
Leave me a grave of goodbye?

Night sky hangs in blackness
Night threads, patterns weaving
Somebody going tells you they are leaving
Casting gardens of shadow
Lights flash, someone is driving
Gears change, car on a highway going my way

Sitting alone on a bench with you
Talking 'bout your life and mine
I find and bet you just don't like snakes
They are just no friend of mine

You've seen it all, but you're foregoing
You passed it by, but you're not knowing
You've had it all before, you're going home
You've seen them dying, now they're all alone
Sitting alone on a bench with you
Dipping my eyes in the stream
Breath from your lips chases shadows away
Clearing the mist from a tree

Sitting alone on a bench with you
Just as you get up to leave
Holding my breath as I touch your hand
Left with the brush of your sleeve

See you in the morning
Just as dawn starts dawning

Sitting alone on an empty bench
Mirrored above in the skyEmbed
