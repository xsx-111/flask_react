I Love You More LyricsThere's something I just can't describe
Something controlling me deep inside
Whenever I start to feel this way
I just can't think of the words to say
Every now and again when I'm feeling sad
Oh, I think of you and it makes me glad all over, glad as can be
And that's when I remember just what you mean to me
I love you more than you could know
It's just sometimes it doesn't show
I love you more than you could know
It's just sometimes it doesn't show
Oh, but don't play, don't play
Don't you play with my heart this way
And don't say, don't say that you feel any other way
It's times when I can't get to sleep at night
That's when I wish I could hold you tight
But if you were here right now with me
I'd tell you for sure what you mean to me
I love you more than you could know
It's just sometimes it doesn't show
I love you more than you could know
It's just sometimes it doesn't show
Oh, but don't play, don't play
Don't you play with my heart this way
And don't say, don't say that you feel any other way
(i love you)
I love you more than you could know...1Embed
