Your Love Takes Me Higher LyricsBaby, well let me tell you something about love
Let me tell you that I've had enough
I've had enough of your playing away
And then I've only got one thing to say...
But I'm walking in the sun
Only your love takes me higher
It's the kind of love that leaves
Me burning with desire
If you think of me, if you care
Stop your fooling 'round
Because it's going nowhere
I could do no harm
Baby, well let me tell you the one thing that's true
I've got to try to get through to you
I've had enough of your playing away
And now I've only got one thing to say...
I would do anything to be
Only your love takes me higher
It's the kind of love that leaves
Me burning with desire
If you think of me, if you care
Stop your fooling 'round
Because it's going nowhere
I wonder why that poor fly died
Ask me, I will recommend
Something that will surely put
Your troubles at an end
All this heartache's more than I can bear
It's still going nowhere, nowhere...
When I see your eyes
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere...
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere...
Only your love takes me higher
It's the kind of love that leaves
Me burning with desire
If you think of me, if you care
Stop your fooling 'round
Because it's going nowhere
Ask me, I will recommend
Something that will surely put
Your troubles at an end
All this heartache's more than I can bear
It's still going nowhere, nowhere
(it's the kind of love that leaves me burning with desire)
(stop your fooling 'round because it's going nowhere)
(something that will surely put your troubles at an end)Embed
