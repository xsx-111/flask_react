Found LyricsWell, tell me one thing, is there madness in this reason?
And tell me something that I never knew before
The consequences of my actions aren't confusing
They're just wanting the direction
That I've never had before
I was happy, now I'm walking on the water
I was laughing, now I'm floating in the air
'cause I found you
These gut reactions are the best thing you can go by
Premonitions are the second, that's for sure
(that's for sure, oooah)
I'm caught by your eyes, they just surprised me
Overpowered me
I stand here waiting in the calm before the storm
I'm delerious, as happy as you're crazy
It's nothing serious or difficult to cure
'cause I found you
Yeah, I found you
Your smile is like the ocean, your kiss the seven seas
Your eyes like magic potions, they just enrapture me
I promise my affection for all eternity
You are my resurrection, you mean the world to meEmbed
