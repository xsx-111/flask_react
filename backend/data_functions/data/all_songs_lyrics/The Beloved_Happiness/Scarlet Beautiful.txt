Scarlet Beautiful LyricsScarlet beautiful, with your eyes so blue
Got to tell you that I'm in love with you
My angel, innocent saint
Innocent maybe, but angel you ain't
No, oh it just gets better each time
Well, scarlet beautiful, my guiding light
Invisible on a cloudless night
One kiss and you're in for the kill
Oh, just hold me, do what you will
I know it just gets better each time
Oh, it just gets better each time
Oh, it's just love, love, love, love, love...
It makes you smile, it makes you strong
Just love, love, love, love, love...
It feels so good it can't be wrong
It's just love, love, love, love, love...
Holding on...
Scarlet beautiful, heaven can wait
I can feel it, oh it feels great
See the stars explode as they cross the sky
It's beautiful, we kiss goodbye
Oh, it just gets better each time
Oh, it just gets better each time
Yeah, must be love, love, love, love, love...
It makes you smile, it makes you strong
Love, love, love, love, love...
Oh, feels so good it can't be wrong
Love, love, love, love, love...
Twice as nice, oh twice as long
It's just love, love, love, love, love...
Holding on...
Love, love, love, love, love...
Love, love, love, love, love...
Oh it just love, love, love, love, love...
It makes you smile, it makes you strong
Love, love, love, love, love...
Feels so good it can't be wrong
Love, love, love, love, love...
Twice as nice, oh twice as long
Just love, love, love, love, love...
It's holding on...
Sweet love, love, love, love, love...
Sweet love
Oh, it's beautiful!Embed
