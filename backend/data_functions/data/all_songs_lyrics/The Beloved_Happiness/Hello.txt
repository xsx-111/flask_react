Hello LyricsSo welcome to the world, yeah
All you late-comers
Just step onboard
I'm happy, glad you came
So welcome home again!
Sometimes I feel we must be going mad
Hello Peter, hello Paul
Saints and sinners, welcome all
Tommy Cannon, Bobby Ball
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Consider, if you will
This great big question
Unanswered still
Oh, can you spot the difference
That lies between
The colour blue
And the colour green?
Sometimes I feel we must be going mad

Willy Wonka, William Tell
Salman Rushdie, Kym Mazelle
Hello, hello, hello, hello
So welcome to the team
Oh, have you worked it out yet?
Yeah, the riddle, I mean
What's the answer?
It's plain to see
Blue is blue and it always will be
Sometimes I feel that the whole world's going mad
