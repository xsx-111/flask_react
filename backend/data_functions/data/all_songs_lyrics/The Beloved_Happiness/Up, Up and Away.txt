Up, Up and Away LyricsStep inside for some more of
What you're missing or just unsure of
Say goodbye to those dull days
Inspiration will take you more ways
Up, up and away, hello new day!
Oh, you're gonna feel so crazy
You're gonna touch the sky
You never felt so hazy, you've never been this high
Just look around you, well it ain't no lie
H a p p y
Come back down from your grey cloud
Feel born again, say it out loud
Don't you know hope can be found
Take your foot out your mouth, come back down
Up, up and away, hello new day!
Oh, you're gonna feel so crazy
You're gonna touch the sky
You never felt so hazy, you've never been this high
Just look around you, well it ain't no lie
H a p p y
Yeah, give the world a message that the word is yes
It's quite impressive, it's real fresh
A little understanding is the reason why
H a p p y
Up, up and away, hello new day!
Up, up and away, oh, hello new day!
You're gonna feel so crazy
You're gonna touch the sky
You never felt so hazy, you've never been this high
Just look around you, well it ain't no lie
H a p p y
Yeah, give the world a message that the word is yes
It's quite impressive, it's real fresh
A little understanding is the reason why
H a p p y
Up, up and away...
Up, up and away...
Up, up and away...
Up, up and away...
What we need in this world is a love'n'harmony
Positive emotions they will, set your spirit freeEmbed
