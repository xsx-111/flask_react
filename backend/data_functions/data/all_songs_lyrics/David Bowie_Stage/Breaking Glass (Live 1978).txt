Breaking Glass (Live 1978) Lyrics

Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen

Oh don't look on your carpet
I drew something awful on it
See

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you

Oh don't look on your carpet
I drew something awful on it
See

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you

I'll never touch you
I'll never touch you
I'll never touch you
I'll never touch you
I'll never touch youEmbed
