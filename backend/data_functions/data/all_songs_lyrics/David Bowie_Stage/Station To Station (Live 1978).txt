Station To Station (Live 1978) Lyrics

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, lost in my circle
Dredging the ocean
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in my room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are you, you drive like a demon
From station to station

The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, raise your glass, raise your glass high

It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

I must be only one in a million
'Cause I can't pass a day without her
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here


Yeah, it's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
The European canon is here
And yes, it's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
The European canon is here
And yes, it's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
(Whoo-hoo) It's too late
The European canon is here
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains
