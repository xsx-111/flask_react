Blackout (Live 1978) Lyrics

Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
(Your scalding face)
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
It's too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
(Your fearful hands)

Get me to a doctor’s, I've been told
Someone's back in town, the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I’m under Japanese influence and my honour's at stake
The weather's grim, there's ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood, and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

If you won't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain, kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain, in the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)
Get me to my feet
(Get me some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (Wo-ooh!)
(Get me some protection)
Oh get me off the streets
Get me some protection
Oh get me on my feet
Give me some direction (Wo-ooh!)
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
Get some direction (Wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets
Get some protection
Get me to my feet
Give me some direction (Wo-ooh!)
