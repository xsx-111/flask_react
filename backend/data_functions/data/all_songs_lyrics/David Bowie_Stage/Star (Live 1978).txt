Star (Live 1978) Lyrics
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock and roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that
He tried
I could make a wild mutation as a rock & roll star

So inviting
So enticing to play the part
I could make a transformation
As a rock and roll star
Ooh yeah
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I’d send my photograph to my honey and I'd c'mon like
A regular superstar
I could play the wild mutation
So inviting
So enticing to play the part
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock and roll star
Get it on yeah, ooh
Ooh yeah
I could do with the money
I’m so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like
A regular superstar
I could fall asleep at night
As a rock and roll star
I could fall in love all right
As a rock and roll star

Rock and roll star
Rock and roll star
