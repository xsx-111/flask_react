Hang On To Yourself (Live 1978) Lyrics
Well she's a tongue twisting storm
She’ll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

Well come on, well come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we’re going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

Oh we don't dance, we don't talk much
We just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Even though the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed
We're The Spiders From Mars

Well come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Come on

Well come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we’re going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Well come on, come on
We’ve really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think you're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Oh come on

Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, hey
