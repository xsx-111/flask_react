Fame (Live 1978) Lyrics
Fame makes a man take things over
Fame lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts you there where things are hollow
Fame

Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame

Fame what you like is in the limo
Fame what you get is no tomorrow
Fame what you need you have to borrow
Fame

Fame, it's not the flame, it's just his game
Enough to keep you insane
Fame

Sha-be-do-da-day, sha-be-de
Sha-be-do
Sha-be-do-da-day, sha-be-de
Sha-be-do
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you're far too cool to fool
Fame

Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain
Fame

Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?


Ha, good evening
We'd like to thank you for coming
We'll see you in about ten minutes timeEmbed
