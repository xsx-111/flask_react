Satellite of Love Lyrics
Satellite's gone up to the skies
Things like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I like to watch things on TV

(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
Satellite of

Satellite's gone way up to Mars
Soon it'll be filled with parking cars
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
Satellite of
I've been told that you've been bold
With Harry, Mark, and John
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday through Thursday
With Harry, Mark, and John

Satellite's gone up to the skies
Things like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
(Bom, bom, bom)
Satellite of love
Satellite of

Satellite of love
Satellite (satellite) of love (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Satellite (satellite, oh-uuh) of love (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Satellite (satellite) of love (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Satellite (satellite) of love (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Satellite (satellite) of love (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Satellite (satellite) of love (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Satellite (satellite) of love (Ah-ah-ah-ah)6Embed
