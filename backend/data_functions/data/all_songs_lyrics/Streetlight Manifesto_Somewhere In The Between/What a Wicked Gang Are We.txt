What a Wicked Gang Are We LyricsWhen I look back, that's when I see everything was wrong
And you looked sad, that's when I said I'd write you a song
Everybody's got their reasons; everybody's got their ghosts to fear
When I look back, all I see is I've done something wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, all I see is I've done something wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, all I see is I've done something wrong
Oh! My Dear! My tis of thee! What a tangled web we weave!
Everyone is the one until the one falls down
Then we're all just "please please please"
The painted rust will only fool the fools for just so long
Eventually, that's when they'll see everything was wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, that's when they'll see everything was wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong, that's when they'll see everything was wrong
So here's to the boys who fight all the wars you will never fight for yourself
And you can ignore who-ever you want to, but in the end
Oh! The Shame! Humility! What a wicked gang are we!
Like a liar looking down on a thief looking down on a killer looking down on a creep
Oh! This sinking ship will only hold its course for just so long
Eventually, that's when they'll see everything is wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong that's when they'll see everything is wrong
Wrong, wrong, wrong that's when they'll see everything is wrong2Embed
