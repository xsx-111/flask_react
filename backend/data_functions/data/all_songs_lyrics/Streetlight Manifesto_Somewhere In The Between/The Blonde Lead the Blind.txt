The Blonde Lead the Blind Lyrics
The blonde lead the blind, but now I begin to see
All the things you missed when you were dismissed
Because learning always ended at three
And time after time, you pass along liability
And all the things you say, they only give you away
Because you're on the same level that you were that day
Oh! Friend! You look too deep at the cover of the magazine
But the words inside they come across deprived
And they force feed shit, but you still subscribe
And you watch, but you don't see
You touch, but you don't feel
And you'll rue the day they'll try to take it away
But they know you'll never fight it if they keep it the same

Did you lose faith?
Yes, I lost faith in the powers that be
But in doing so I came across the will to disagree
And I gave up, yes I gave up and then I gave in
But I take responsiblity for every single sin
GO!

Soon everyone will see, and everyone will know
That the things we hid were irrelevant and it's all just part of the show
And the blemishes and scars that made us who we are
We're told to cover up, but we've taken enough
And we're not going to stop until it's taken apart
Come one, come all to observe the fall
Free tickets to the free for all
And it never ends, it goes around again
And we're all big players in the scheme of things
And I hope someday you'll find
All the answers to the questions on your mind
In time you will cross the line and you'll realize that everything you thought was right
Did you lose faith?
Yes, I lost faith in the powers that be
But in doing so I came across the will to disagree
And I gave up, yes I gave up and then I gave in
But I take responsiblity for every single sin1Embed
