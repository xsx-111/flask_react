One Foot on the Gas, One Foot in the Grave LyricsIt's in the air you breathe and it's also in the water
It's something you can't see, you've been warned of by your mothers
You've had enough deceit, you know enough to see, join the others
When you could hardly breathe you were wondering why you bothered
And they gave us seven days to renounce our wicked ways
Too late to make amends because we both know how this ends
So do the right thing or do nothing
(What will you do when they come for you?)
Or just do what is easier
(What will you do when they come for you?)
That is what I read, what I swear they said to me
Nine times out of ten they lied to me
And after all they had the gall to say
"No one will save you now."
We want it, they got it
They claim we'll die without it
But something tells me they are wrong

So what will you do when they call your name and you're not ready to go?
Everyone will stare at you and tell you what you know
That you're in too deep and you can't quite keep your secrets, one and all
We might just make it after all on our own
We might just make it after all
But we had one foot on the gas and one foot in the grave
Everyone was laughing when we said we had it made
Everyone was laughing when we said we had it made
They gave us seven days to renounce our wicked ways
Too late to make amends because we both know how this ends
Started with six or seven, moved on to eight or nine
(What will you do when they come for you?)
Nobody seemed to notice, nobody seemed to mind
(What will you do when they come for you?)
Little miss dismissed can't miss like a detuned radio
I cannot believe you when you tell me what you know
And nothing will be broken if your house is made of stone
But you know as I do it will never be a home
We want it, they got it
They claim we'll die without it
But something tells me they are wrong

So what will you do when they call your name and you're not ready to go?
Everyone will stare at you and tell you what you know
That you're in too deep and you can't quite keep your secrets, one and all
We might just make it after all on our own
We might just make it after all
But we had one foot on the gas and one foot in the grave
Everyone was laughing when we said we had it made
Everyone was laughing when we said we had it made
It's in the air you breathe and it's also in the water
It's something you can't see, you've been warned of by your mothers
You've had enough deceit, you know enough to see, join the others
When you could hardly breathe you were wondering why you bothered
Too late to make amends because we both know how this ends

So what will you do when they call your name and you're not ready to go?
Everyone will stare at you and tell you what you know
That you're in too deep and you can't quite keep your secrets, one and all
We might just make it after all on our own
We might just make it after all

But we had one foot on the gas and one foot in the grave
Everyone was laughing when we said we had it made
Everyone was laughing when we said we had it made1Embed
