We Will Fall Together Lyrics
I once knew a guy, obsessed with the afterlife
Oh what a terrible day that was, he realized he'd wasted all his time
Time was ticking by, and he'd been left behind
And as the clock tick-tocked his heart did stop and everything he had was fucked

And we know not what we do (Can you hear them call?)
Will we ever make it through?
As they watch us fall from the sky to the ground to the sea
Woe is me, woe is me, no one will save you now
We can only look away (away!)
We'll not be victims there'll be no victims of to speak
And only then will we be free
And up will rise the meek

And when we fall we will fall together
No one will catch us so we'll catch ourselves
And when we roam we will roam forever
No one will understand what we meant

The beaten and the bruised, forsaken, the abused
Oh what a glorious day we'll have rising up and claiming all our dues
The day will come as sure as the ever-setting sun
All of those that self-imposed will find themselves so indisposed
And we know not what we do (Can you hear them call?)
Will we ever make it through?
As they watch us fall from the sky to the ground to the sea
Woe is me, woe is me, no one will save you now
We can only look away (away!)
We'll not be victims there'll be no victims of to speak
And only then will we be free
And up will rise the meek

And when we fall we will fall together
No one will catch us so we'll catch ourselves
And when we roam we will roam forever
No one will understand what we meant

Now, with the line drawn in the wet sand
You need to tell us where to stand
Sitting waiting watching rotting everything they warned us of is true
Now tell me what we're all supposed to do
They're coming after all of us with everything they've got
With the fury of a soldier who will answer to his God
So how will we fight? All we have is logic and love on our side
And when we fall we will fall together
No one will catch us so we'll catch ourselves
And when we roam we will roam forever
No one will understand what we meant3Embed
