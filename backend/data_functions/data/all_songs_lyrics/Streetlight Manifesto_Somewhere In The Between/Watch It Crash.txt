Watch It Crash LyricsLast night I woke alone with a whisper in my ear
Recanting all my aspirations and my fears
And when the sun came up that voice had disappeared
But it would linger on for years
It said "We can't just blame it on our mothers
Claim everything they did was always wrong"
And there ain't no turning back when our train is off its track
And there's nothing we can do but watch it crash (watch it crash)
And there ain't no right or wrong when we know it won't be long
And there's nothing we can do but watch it crash
So mercy, mercy, mercy me
Praying for the death of a man I'll never meet
Though everyone will know the truth they'll still just make believe
Mercy mercy me
"We can't just blame it on our mothers
Claim everything they did was always wrong"
And there ain't no turning back when the train is off its track
And there's nothing we can do but watch it crash (watch it crash)
And there ain't no right or wrong when we know it won't be long
And there's nothing we can do but watch it crash
So mercy, mercy, mercy me
Praying for the death of a man I'll never meet
Though everyone will know the truth they'll still just make believe
Mercy mercy me
That's all they came for, that's all they took
That's all we had to offer, only dirty looks
And when they realized we'd given all we could, that's when they finally understood
Mercy mercy mercy me
Haunted by the memories of things we'll never see
Guilty for the statements that we'll never get to speak
Mercy mercy me
"We can't quite blame it on our mothers
Claim everything they did was always wrong"
And there ain't no turning back when your train is off its track
And there's nothing we can do but watch it crash
And there ain't no right or wrong when we know it won't be long
And there's nothing we can do but watch it crash
Watch it crash and there's nothing we can do but watch it crashEmbed
