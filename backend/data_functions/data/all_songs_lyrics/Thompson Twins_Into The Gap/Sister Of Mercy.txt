Sister Of Mercy LyricsShe lives in a big white house
All the rooms are lemon, and she's devoted to life
Of keeping this house just right
The weekends perfectly nice
And she doesn't talk when he comes home at night, no
No sister of mercy
Oh don't cry for me
No sister of mercy
It's all right for me
Twenty five years she's just the same
She's a lonely woman, quiet in her ways
Then he comes home one night
She kills him with a knife
She's the one who's a living in paradise
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
Oh don't cry for me
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
It's all right for me
Now she sits in a big white chair
In a room that's not so different to the one back there
She turns her face to the light
But sheâ€™s blinded by her life
You can hear her cry alone at night
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
Oh don't cry for me
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
It's all right for me
So have mercy on that woman, you don't know the way it's been
You don't know the trouble her eyes have seen
Can you feel the kiss of life
When you come home at night?
Well, you better not turn your back on a paradise
Woah
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
Oh don't cry for me
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
It's all right for me
Sister of mercy (Sister of mercy)
Sister of mercy oh, oh
Sister of mercy (Sister of mercy)
Sister of mercy oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
Oh don't cry for me
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
It's all right for me
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
Oh don't cry for me
(Sister of mercy) No sister of mercy
It's all right for meEmbed
