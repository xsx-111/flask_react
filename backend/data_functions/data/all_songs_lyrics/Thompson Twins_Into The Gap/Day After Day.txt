Day After Day LyricsI'm always treading on dangerous ground
And everything seems to be upside down
Are you practicing for judgement day?
Or do you really mean those things you say?
(Chorus)
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
There's a panic in this heart of mine
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
I'm looking for something that's just too hard to find
I'm not the man you wanted me to be
He's kept alive inside your fantasy
But now the magic me is fading fast
Let me remind you of the face behind the mask
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
There's a panic in this heart of mine
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
I'm looking for something that's just too hard to find
Can't you see there's just no promised land, doesn't happen that way
I hope you'll try and understand there's nothing I can do or say
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
There's a panic in this heart of mine
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
I'm looking for something that's just too hard to find
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
There's a panic in this heart of mine
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
I'm looking for something that's just too hard to find
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
There's a panic in this heart of mine
Day after day (day after day), night after night (night after night)
I'm looking for something that's just too hard to findEmbed
