Who Can Stop The Rain? Lyrics
I was dancing in heaven, you were keeping time
Then I read your letter, sent shivers down my spine
Said our love was over, I was not the one
If it lasts forever, forever wouldn't be much fun

Who can stop the rain?
Who can stop the rain from falling?
Who can stop this pain that's drowning me?

I could hear the sound of laughter, I thought that love was in the air
I was drowning in that golden age, you really seemed to care
I was haunted by a dream of giant human beings
I wait alone for hours, love is never what it seems

Who can stop the rain?
Who can stop the rain from falling?
Who can stop this pain that's drowning me?
Oh-oh


Who can stop the rain?
Who can stop the rain from falling?
Who can stop this pain that's drowning me?
Oh-oh
You always had fantastic plans, that I always knew
And now you want to leave me out, so it's raining just for you
Those changes that you wanted make you ten feet tall
I tried to move those mountains, but mountains never move at all

Who can stop the rain?
Who can stop the rain from falling?
Who can stop this pain that's drowning me?
Oh-oh
Who can stop the rain?
Who can stop the rain from falling?
Who can stop this pain that's drowning me?
Oh-oh
Who can stop the rain?
Who can stop the rain from falling?
Who can stop this pain that's drowning me?
Oh-ohEmbed
