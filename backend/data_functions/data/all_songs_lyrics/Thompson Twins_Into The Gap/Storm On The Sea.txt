Storm On The Sea LyricsThis party is over
And we, we are alone
And I feel so helpless
There's nowhere to go, but
To storm on the sea
No stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
The room is so quiet
Hush, don't you cry
Daybreak is dawning
Cold in the sky
So don't tell me your name
I can't stay here
Can't a cruel light of morning
Drive me away
To storm on the sea
No stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
To storm on the sea
No stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your door
To storm on the sea
No stranger to me
Light on the shore
So let the wind blow
Carry me home
Lead me to your doorEmbed
