Worried Mind Lyrics
You promised me love
That would never die
That promise you've made
Was only a lie
Now after you've gone
All alone I've pined
For all that I've got
Is a worried mind


And when I was down
You just left me there
I needed you so
But you didn't care
You found a new love
And a home so fine
But all that I've got
Is a worried mind

A worried mindEmbed
