Bye Bye, Love Lyrics
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'm going to cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I think I'm going to die

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy and I'm so blue
She was my baby 'til he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Oh, whoa, oh

Bye bye love (Well)
Bye bye happiness (What you say?)
Hello loneliness
I think I'm going to cry

I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And that's the reason that I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me
Oh...
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I think I'm going to die

Yeah (I think I'm going to die)
Well (I think I'm going to die)
Well (I think I'm going to die)
What you say? (I think I'm going to die)
One more time (I think I'm going to die)
Yeah (I think I'm going to die)
Repeat that please (I think I'm going to die)1Embed
