Half as Much Lyrics
Well, if you loved me half as much as I love you
You couldn't worry me half as much as you do
Whoa, you're so nice to me when there's no one else around
But you only build me up to tear me down
Oh, but if you missed me half as much as I miss you
Well, you couldn't stay away half as much as you do
Whoa, I know that I could never be this blue
Well, if you only loved me half as much as I love you

I know that I, I know that I could never be this blue
Whoa, if you only loved me half as much as I love you
Well, as I love you, oh, as I love you
Oh, what did I say?Embed
