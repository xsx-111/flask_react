You Win Again Lyrics
What can I do?
You win again

The news is out
All over town
That you've been seen
Just a running 'round
I know that I
Should leave, but then
I just can't go
You win again

This heart of mine
Could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trustin' you
Was my great sin
What can I do
Oh, you win again, yes

What can I do?
You win again
I'm sorry for (Sorry for)
Your victim now (Victim now)
'Cause soon his head (Soon his head)
Like mine will bow (Like mine will bow)
He'll give his heart (Give his heart)
But all in vain (All in vain)
And someday say (Someday say)
You win again (You win again)

You have no heart
You have no shame
You take true love
And give the blame
I'll guess that I should not complain
I love you still
Well, you win again

I love you still
You win again
Win againEmbed
