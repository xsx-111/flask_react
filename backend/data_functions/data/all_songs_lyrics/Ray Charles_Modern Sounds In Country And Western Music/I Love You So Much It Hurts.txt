I Love You So Much It Hurts Lyrics
Oh, I love you so much, it hurts me
Darling, that's why I'm so blue (I'm so blue)
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you (Losing you)
You know, I love so (Love you so) much (Much too much)
It hurts me
And there's nothing I can do (I can do)
I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever
Because I love you so much, it hurts me so

I love you so much, it hurts me
And that's why I'm so blue
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night
Afraid of losing you

I love you so much, it hurts me
And there's nothing I can do (I can do)
I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever
I love you so much (So much), oh, it hurts me (So much)
It hurts me so
(It hurts me so)Embed
