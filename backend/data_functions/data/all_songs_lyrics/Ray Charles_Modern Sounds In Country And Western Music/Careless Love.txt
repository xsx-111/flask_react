Careless Love Lyrics
Well, I say love, oh love, careless love
I say love, oh love, oh careless love, oh
Love, please tell me what have I done
For you to hurt me all in fun

Well, you know that I once was blind but now I see
I say that I once was blind but now I see
Well, you know I once was blind but I'm so glad, so glad I see
That that old love has made a fool of me

Well, you know what a big fool I have been
Let me say what a big fool I have been
Let me say what, what a big fool that I have been
But I'd be, I'd be one all over again

Well, you know if I could ooh like a morning dove
Well, if I could ooh like a morning dove
Well, if I could moan, if I could moan like a morning dove
You know I'd moan for everyone in love

That's why I said love, oh oh oh love, careless love
Oh, I said love, oh oh love, careless love2Embed
