Tragedies Blows at Horizon LyricsA black day dawn at horizon where winter hearts our battlefields
The ultimate frostage desire snowflurry drifts these plains
Since the blast of primaries we've conquered against the storm
Throning with will and the sound of battle never ends...
Tragedies blows at horizon: we ride as one our battle rages on...
Tragedies blows at horizon: we die as one our battle rages on...
Thundering columns of fire majestic against the breeze
Gleaming my scepter at hand the wind altogether silent
Frozen of heart awaken from a time and risen
By the dying evening breeze the sound of battle never ends
Tragedies blows at horizon: we ride as one our battle rages on...
Tragedies blows at horizon: we die as one our battle rages on...Embed
