Withstand the Fall of Time LyricsDarker and darker
Skylines of red grew my horizon
On the edge of my vision
A giant grim-faced realm
Flaming suns crested the horizon
Shadows born a cloudless day
Believers of the rise and set of the moon
Darkened twilight into night
Hardening claws of cold tell me
We are closer to colder times
Through the days of bitterness
Still the tundra lay untouched
In the final of that day
And all centuries after
In eternity and time the same
Still the tundra lay untouched
Blacker and blacker
Blinded by shades from centuries behind
Shadows of a dark that used to be
Under heavy winters reign
The blackening sky never end
As we stand the fall of time
Yet winds of cold will always blow
Without tomorrow
Hardening claws of cold tell me
We are closer to colder times
Through the days of bitterness
Still the tundra lay untouched
In the final of that day
And all centuries after
In eternity and time the same
Still the tundra lay untouchedEmbed
