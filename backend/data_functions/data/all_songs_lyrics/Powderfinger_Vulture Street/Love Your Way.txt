Love Your Way Lyrics
I got to keep moving to stay warm
'Cause I'm freezing in this room
And if I prove no good here
I'll skip to where I should

It's only an imaginary
Vigil that we keep
You salvage what you need
I'll take the love you leave

And I love your way
And I can't explain
What made me change

I'm wading in deeper
Ever deeper as I go
I drown the whole idea
As I drift away from you

It's only an imaginary
Vigil that we keep
You salvage what you need
I'll take the love you leave
I love your way
I can't explain
What made me change
I love your way

And as the memory gathers dust
And buried in its crust
Are the remains of what we've done
And the seeds of what we just begun

The tapping of the rain
Beats a corrugated drum
And the city glow
Well, it pulses on to the city hum

And as the memory gathers dust
And buried in its crust
Are the remains of what we've done
And the seeds of what we just begun

The tapping of the rain
Beats a corrugated drum
And the city glow
Well, it pulses on until the day is done
And I love your way
And I can't explain
What made me changeEmbed
