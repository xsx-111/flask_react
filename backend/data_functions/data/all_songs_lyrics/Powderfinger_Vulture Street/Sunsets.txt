Sunsets Lyrics
Sunsets over the beaches
From now on
Each day
Looking for new ways
To go on

Maybe I should drop by
Maybe I should have called
Maybe I should have followed you
And beat down your door
Maybe it's gonna be breakin' you
Every time you fall

But to shower you with pity
Will do you no good at all
No good at all

Slow burn
Watching the world turn
From my arms
New way of measuring each day
Until it's gone
Maybe I should drop by
Maybe I should have called
Maybe I should have followed you
And beat down your door
Maybe it's gonna be breakin' you
Every time you fall

But to shower you with pity
Will do you no good at all
No good at all

Sunrise, building a reprise
In my heart
Regret, tight around my chest
Plays its part
Until it's gone
Yeah, until it's gone

But to shower you with pity
Would do you no good at all
No good at all
Now we're watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset
Over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches
Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset
Over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches

Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset
Over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches
Watching the sunset, sunset, sunset, sunset
Over the beaches, beaches, beaches, beaches2Embed
