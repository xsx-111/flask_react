Roll Right By You Lyrics
Your gentle pace, it provides a rhythm
For the unwashed few of us
Lock and loaded, past is a prison
For the crimes of the universe
Well, are you in the situation
To decide whether you really care?
Come on, you know that it's hard to complain
About the way you live

So please
Don't let it roll right by you
Just think
If the same thing happened to you
Would you be, would you be
Happy to walk in my shoes?
Would you be, would you be
Happy to walk in my shoes?

I'm already tired
Of your chronic compassion fatigue
The final turd in the dungheap
Of every post-modern disease
Well, do you have the information
To decide whether you really care?
It's hard to believe you'd look me in the eye
And turn away again
So please
Don't let it roll right by you
Just think
If the same thing happened to you
Would you be, would you be
Happy to walk in my shoes?
Would you be, would you be
Happy to walk in my shoes?


So please
Don't let it roll right by you
Just think
If the same thing happened to you
Would you be, would you be
Happy to walk in my shoes?
Would you be, would you be
Happy to walk in my shoes?

Well, are you in the situation
To decide whether you really care?
Oh, come on, you know that it's hard to complain
About the way you live, about the way you live
Are you in the situation?
Well, come on, you know that it's hard to complain
About the way you liveEmbed
