How Far Have We Really Come? Lyrics
Despite the miseries
And the lessons learned from history
The pattern still repeats
Never to surrender, don't you ever retreat

So how far have we really come?
'Til the ones who are leading us
Make peace their resolution tonight
Make peace your resolution tonight

There's an arms race to be run
Building bigger, better dagger-headed bombs
So let's drink to the daughters and sons
Never to return to their mother's arms
No, no, no, not coming back

So how far have we really come?
'Til the ones who are leading us
Make peace their resolution tonight
Make peace your resolution tonight

For every battle lost and won
Are these the ones that we offer up?
For every battle lost and won
Are these the ones that we offer up?
So how far have we really come?
'Til the ones who are leading us
Make peace their resolution tonight
Make peace your resolution tonight
So how far have we really come?
'Til the ones who are leading us
Make peace their resolution tonight
Make peace your resolution tonightEmbed
