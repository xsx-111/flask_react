Leg of Lamb Lyrics
You're a head case with a smile
Can't stop to make up your mind
Education is so lame (It's so lame)
When you bitch and you moan
You're a loose girl, I'm a guy (Hey)
You're a truth freak with a lie
The situation is so strange
It's a TV show (Click)

In a hotel on the phone
You're gonna leave me, I should've known (Should've known)
And I was thinking, it's so sad
I didn't want you to go, oh
You want to follow the laws of man? (Yes sir)
Bloody apron, leg of lamb
It's so hard to win
When there's so much to lose

Infiltrate the walls that are caving in
It ain't a bad thing
This ain't reality
Infiltrate the walls that are caving in
It ain't a bad thing
Think of it as natural (Ah)

Second Avenue, raising Cain
I'm a sinner, ring my bell (Ring mine)
I'll tell you what, I'd get up
If I knew I had fell3Embed
