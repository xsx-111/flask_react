Monsters in the Parasol Lyrics
The walls are closing in again, oh well
The walls are closing in again, oh well
I've seen some things I thought I'd never saw
Covered in hair (Hair)
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
And my mind is out here on another wave
Covered in hair (Hair)

She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow

You've got a monster (Distress) in your parasol (Why, yes)
You've got a monster (Divorce) in your parasol (Of course)
You've got a monster (Displeasure) in your parasol (My treasure)
You've got a monster (Your pain) in your parasol (Drives me insane)

Paul's sister is an alien, oh well
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well
I'd seen some things I thought I'd never saw
Covered in hair (Hair)
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow

You've got a monster (Distress) in your parasol (Why, yes)
You've got a monster (Divorce) in your parasol (Of course)
You've got a monster (Displeasure) in your parasol (My treasure)
You've got a hole (Your pain) in you I never saw (Drives me insane)
In your parasol, in your parasol (Insane)Embed
