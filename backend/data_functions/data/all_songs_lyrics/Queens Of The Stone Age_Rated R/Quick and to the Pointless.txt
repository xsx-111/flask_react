Quick and to the Pointless Lyrics
I don't even know what I'm doing here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh!

A little girl, walking down the street
Godverdomme, you gotta be with me
I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Ah! Ah! woo!

Het leven is hard, de mensen worden bang
I'm so old, you're so young
I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Goddamn! Ah! Ah! woo!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ik denk van ja, maar nee
Little girl, listen to what I say
You know, I know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Goddamn! Ah! Ah! woo!Embed
