Better Living Through Chemistry Lyrics
The blue pill opens your eyes
Is there a better way
A new religion's prescribed
To those without the faith
A hero holding a knife
And blood is not enough
Is it too late to go back?
Is it too late to go?

There's no one here (There's no one here)
And people everywhere, you're on your own

Let's see if I'm hearing this right
You suggest I should take
A never-ending supply
To carry out the day
Your idols burn in the fire
The mob comes crawling out
I'm reclaiming my mind
Destroying everyone
There's no one here (There's no one here)
And people everywhere, you're all alone3Embed
