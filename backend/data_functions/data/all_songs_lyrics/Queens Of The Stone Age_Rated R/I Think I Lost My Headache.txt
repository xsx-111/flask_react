I Think I Lost My Headache Lyrics
You know why
They called and just let it ring
No reply
The door was open I swear
Ain't no use in picking up
You know why

It's all my head I know
So they tell me so
Until my head explodes
Into my head it goes

Tastes so good
Oh, but I knew it would
Tastes so good
Burn like a match house
Medicate just to make you soft
Love is blind
Catch and release me
What the hell were they thinking of
You know why

It's all my head I know
So they tell me so
Until my head explodes
Into my head it goes5Embed
