In the Fade / Feel Good Hit of the Summer (Reprise) Lyrics

Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the hall
Countin' and breathin', I'm leaving here tomorrow
They don't know, I never do you any good
Laughin' is easy, I would if I could
Ain't gonna worry
Just live 'til you die, I wanna drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone who
There's nothing to save and I know
You live till you die

Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know

Losing a feeling that I couldn't give away
Counting' and breathing', disappearing' in the fade
They don't know, I never do you any good
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could
Ain't gonna worry
Just live 'til you die, I wanna drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone who
There's nothing to save and I know
You live till you die

Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know


Oh
Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol (Cocaine!)
Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol (Cocaine!)
Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana...8Embed
