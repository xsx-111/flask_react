Tension Head Lyrics
Every day I wake up
Feeling this way
I take it downtown
With all the action going down
I strike a match
Strike a match, cook it up (Lowlife)
I'm feeling so sick (Lowlife)
I feel so fucking sick (Lowlife)
On the bathroom floor
Gotta get out and get right
Hustling little girls
Cheating little boys, yeah

Gotta get out, gotta get out and get right
Gotta get out, I gotta get out no more
No more
No more
My eternal fire (Lowlife)

I'm feeling so sick (Lowlife)
On the bathroom floor (Lowlife)
I'm feeling so sick (Lowlife)
No more
Yeah
(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(High life)
I'm feeling so sick (Lowlife)
I feel so sick (Lowlife)
No, no more (Lowlife)Embed
