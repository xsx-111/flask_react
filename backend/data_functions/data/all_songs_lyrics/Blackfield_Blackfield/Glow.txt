Glow LyricsI show the scars of every fear and doubt
I hurt myself to let the darkness out, out
The days go by and nothing brings me joy
The glow was strong when I was a boy but it's gone
And the glow, it goes so slow, it goes
Cracks appear and passion slips away
Colors fade and turn to shades of gray, fade away
And the glow, it goes so slow, it goes
If you knew the man I used to be
Please hold me under the sea
Or scratch my arms till they bleed
Save me, will you help me to feel?
The glow...2Embed
