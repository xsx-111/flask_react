Hello LyricsThrough a different kind of silence
I'm waiting, I'm wasting
Into the road of sadness
I'm walking without you
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Is it gonna last?
Why don't you come and take me with you?
And so I know you had to go
I'm dreaming of the past
An echo of the years we passed through
Asleep in your arms, I'm drifting
I'm falling in sorrow
Dead to the world you left me
In footsteps I follow
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Is it gonna last?
Why don't you come and take me with you?
And so I know you had to go
I'm dreaming of the past
An echo of the years we passed through
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Is it gonna last?
Why don't you come and take me with you?
And so I know you had to go
I'm dreaming of the past
An echo of the years we passed through1Embed
