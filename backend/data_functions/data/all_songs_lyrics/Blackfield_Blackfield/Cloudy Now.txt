Cloudy Now LyricsIn a violent place we can call our country
It's a mixed up man and I guess that's me
The sun's in the sky but the storm never seems to end
It's a place of sorrow but we call it a home
And the darkest thoughts, yeah, I guess they're my own
There's wealth in the bank but there's nothing to show inside
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's gettin' cloudy now
In a special place that I call my life
The father was cruel and he lost his wife
But I don't see, either cos I live across the street
It's a beautiful thing when it starts to rain
A man who drinks just to drown the pain
And I can't stop from dreaming there's something else
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's gettin' cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's cloudy now
It's gettin' cloudy now
We are a fucked up generation
It's cloudy now
A fucked up generation
It's cloudy now
We gotta get out of here
It's cloudy now
A fucked up generation
It's cloudy nowEmbed
