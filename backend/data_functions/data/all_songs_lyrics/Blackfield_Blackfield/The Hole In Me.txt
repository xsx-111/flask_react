The Hole In Me LyricsThe hole in me
I cannot reach
The one who bleeds
Please set him free
The hole in me
The hole in me
That no one sees
The hole too deep
Inside of me
What have I done?
Treat me tonight like a movie star
Who'll never die
Always surrounded by girls like you
Kill all my loneliness
Kill all my loneliness
The hole in me
That never sleeps
Born with me
It's killing me
What have I done?
Treat me tonight like a movie star
Who'll never die
Always surrounded by girls like you
Kill all my loneliness
Kill all my loneliness1Embed
