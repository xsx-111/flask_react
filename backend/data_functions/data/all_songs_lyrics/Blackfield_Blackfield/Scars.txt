Scars LyricsBrightest city buried in the dust
Lonely people stop and stare at us
Together, you and me are getting lost
The sky falls
It's getting hard for me to see the truth
I lost my soul and gave myself to you
You are an angel and the devil too
A tear falls
All I've left are my precious scars
All I've left are my precious scars
I watch a teardrop falling from your eye
You are so perfect when you cry
In the corner all our endings lie
Alone now
All I've left are my precious scars
All I've left are my precious scars
It's me that you need now
It's me that you love now
All I've left are my precious scars
All I've left are my precious scars
All I've left are my precious scars
(I wish I was immune, then it wouldn't hurt)
All I've left are my precious scars
(I wish I was immune, then it wouldn't hurt)
I wish I was immune, then it wouldn't hurtEmbed
