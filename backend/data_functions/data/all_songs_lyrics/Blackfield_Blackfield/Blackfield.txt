Blackfield LyricsCurling lips, fingertips, dead eye dips
I saw it all in the blackfield
Splinter cracks, summer tracks, paperbacks
We found them all in the blackfield
In the shade, whistle blades, singing fades
In the blackfield
She wants to stay
And talk all day
So I remark
When it gets dark
All the pale things under the earth
Will reverse
River glass, cycle past, overcast
I saw it all in the blackfield
Copper sky, shadows rise, bridge of sighs
We had it all in the blackfield
Skin tracks, face facts, fade to black
In the blackfield
She wants to stay
And talk all day
So I remark
When it gets dark
All the pale things under the earth
Will reverse4Embed
