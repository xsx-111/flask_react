Lullaby LyricsShare my cup
Tie me up
Never part
Break my heart
Go to sleep
Wound me deep
Be at peace
Make me bleed
Do no harm
Twist my arm
Lie with grace
Smash my face
Kiss the ground
Drag me down
Stop the noise
Smash my toys
How does it feel without your drugs?
(Sing you a lullaby)
How does it feel without my love?
(Sing you a lullaby)Embed
