Summer LyricsLove me as the summer gone
When eyes were closed and days were long, so long
I burned a torch for you but all the while
Somewhere in the haze you lost your smile
Love me as the winter comes
Don't cast your shadow on my soul, please don't
Don't let me sink, don't let the darkness in
Let your perfect fingers touch my skin
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Love me as the springtime comes
Let your song drift down the stairs to me
Waiting here along the way to blue
Remembering the days I spent with you
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're alone
Heart needs a home
It's a dark and empty road
When you're aloneEmbed
