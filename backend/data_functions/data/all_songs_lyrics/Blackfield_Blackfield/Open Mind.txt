Open Mind LyricsHere's a song from an open mind
I give it to you because I can
And if you're thinking that it's not that kind
It's cos my mood swings make me feel ashamed
It can pass the time
A girl with eyes that see a hundred years
Half remembered, this is my dream
Spinning out from where the hole appears
I've never seen her but I've got photographs
It can blow your mind
An idea falls from a porcelain sky
It won't make you rich and it won't make you high
Out of the
Out of the void it comes
From an open mind
Out of the
Out of the void it comes
It comes from my mind2Embed
