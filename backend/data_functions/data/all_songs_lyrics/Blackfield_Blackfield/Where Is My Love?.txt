Where Is My Love? LyricsEndless fields of emptiness in my dark and wounded heart
Where is my love?
The freezing moment when you turned your head and waved goodbye
Where is my love?
Even all the biggest storms can't take my pain away
Where is my love?
Noisy happy people crossing streets from side to side
Where is my love?
I gave you everything I could but you want the stars
Where is my love?
Endless fields of emptiness in my dark and wounded heart
Where is my love?
Even all the biggest storms can't take my pain away
Where is my love?
Noisy happy people crossing streets from side to side
Where is my love?
So where is my love?
Noisy happy people crossing streets from side to side
Where is my love?
Endless fields of emptiness in my dark and wounded heart
Where is my love?Embed
