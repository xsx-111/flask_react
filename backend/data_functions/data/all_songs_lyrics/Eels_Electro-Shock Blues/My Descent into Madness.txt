My Descent into Madness Lyrics(No I'm not a star. I'm a king of the roads, yeah.)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Springfield's looking pretty dusty today
I see their dreams coming undone
The view from inside ward nine affords this much
A town teeming with the unloved
Close the window and lock it so it's good and tight
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Turning eighteen and trying not to look too lost
Have a not-so-nice day
The jacket makes me straight so I can just sit back and bake
You know I think I'm gonna stay
Talking very loud but no one hears a word I say
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Come visit me tonight at eight o'clock and then you'll see
How I am not the crazy one
Voices tell me I'm the shit
Twenty days go by and every day looks the same
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
I'm the shitEmbed
