Climbing to the Moon Lyrics
So I wrote it all in a letter
I don't know if it came
The nurse, she likes my writing
So she keeps it just like me
So that it won't get away

I won't be denied this time
Before I go out of my mind
Over matters, got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the moon

Got a sky that looks like Heaven
Got an Earth that looks like shit
It's getting hard to tell where
What I am ends and what they're making me begins

And I won't be denied this time
Before I go out of my mind
Over matters, got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the moon

Saturday in the yard
They'll bring you by
We'll lay down on the grass
And watch as the sky closes in
I won't be denied this time
Before I go out of my mind
Over matters, got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the moon
Climbing up to the moonEmbed
