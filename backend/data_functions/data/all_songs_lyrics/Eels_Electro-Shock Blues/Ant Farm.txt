Ant Farm LyricsHate a lot of things, but I love a few things
And you are one of them
Hard to believe after all of these years
That you are one of them
Walk down the street, I'm thinking
"Everybody move along."
I've got a sad-hearted needing
To belong
Nevertheless, it's all the mess you made
But I can't let it go
Walk down the street, I'm thinking
"Look at all the ants in the farm."
I've got a sad-hearted feeling
To harm
Hate a lot of things, but I love a few things
And you are one of themEmbed
