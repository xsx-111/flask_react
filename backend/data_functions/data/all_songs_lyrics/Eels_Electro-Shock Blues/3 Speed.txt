3 Speed LyricsGot a 3 speed and banana seat
Sitting back on the sissy bar
Went to Sev and got a drink
Wish I was driving in your daddy's car
And I looked up at the sky last night
And I thought I saw a bomb
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?
Riding down on Springhill Road
Meeting Alfred out in the woods
Dogs bark and mosquitoes bite
Scratching the itch that makes it feel good
And I looked into the mirror last night
All I saw was a pretty blonde
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?
Life is funny, but not "ha ha" funny
Peculiar I guess
You think I got it all going my way
Then why am I such a fucking mess?
Want a pony and a birthday cake
Want a party with a scary clown
Kneel down and bow to the princess
Kneel down for the queen of the town
And I looked up at the sky last night
And I thought I saw a bomb
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going onEmbed
