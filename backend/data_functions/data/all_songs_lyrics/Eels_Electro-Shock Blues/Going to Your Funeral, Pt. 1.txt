Going to Your Funeral, Pt. 1 LyricsGoing to your funeral and feeling I could scream
"Everything goes away."
Driving down the highway through the perfect sunny dream
A perfect day for perfect pain
Look at all the people with the flowers in their hands
They put the flower on the box that's holding all the sand
That was... that was once... that was once you
Honolulu hurricane, I knew that you were not insane
Living in the insane world
Smiling like it's no big deal, scabby wounds that never heal
The woman was only a girl
Look at all the people with their heads down in their hands
When everything I'm feeling makes it hard to understand
That what, what I need to miss
It's what I need to miss... is you
Going to your funeral and I'm feeling like a fool
No one's gonna take the blame
Thinking about the days of hanging out behind the school
Everything goes awayEmbed
