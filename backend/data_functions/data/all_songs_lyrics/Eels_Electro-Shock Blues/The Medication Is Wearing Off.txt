The Medication Is Wearing Off LyricsSee this watch she gave me?
Well it still ticks away
The days I'm claiming back for me
The medication's wearing off
Gonna hurt not a little, a lot
Keep on tickin' you're not lickin' me
Step on a crack break your mother's heart
Red light, green light, black
Suicide e-mail do not delete
Plug it back in the jack
Start to be what they want you to be
And you see yourself as they see you
Sunrise at the corner of Sunset and Alvarado
I think, "What the hell do I do now?"
Watch the day disintegrate
So I can stay up late and wait
See this watch she gave me?
Well it still ticks away1Embed
