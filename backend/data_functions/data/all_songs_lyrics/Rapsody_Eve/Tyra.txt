Tyra Lyrics
Damn, I'm stunnin' (Fine to the bone)
Sweet  like honey (He fine to the bone)
Walk  through lookin' like somethin' (She fine to the bone)
Walk through lookin' like somethin' (We fine to the bone)

Damn, I'm stunnin' (I'm fine to the bone)
Sweet  like honey (I'm fine to the bone)
Walk  through lookin' like somethin' (We fine to the bone)
Walk through lookin' like somethin'

Fine  to the gristle, boy, I could make a blind man whistle (Woo)
Got too much love for you to ever have a issue (Uh-huh)
Drippin' so hard think I baptized wit Episcopals
Walk the runway and I run away from pistols (Run)
Workin'  on my unity, ain't no need to diss you (Yeah)
Just yet, but send a threat, know I'm the bomb and the missile (Uh-huh)
Black woman on ya arm worth more than arms full of crystals (That's real)
Say the truth hurt, gotta keep a barn full of tissues (Uh)
Miseducation visuals, it ain't a thing to be invisible (It ain't a thing)
World tryna make us all models of a criminal (Yeah)
Multiply, move better, together when it's ten of you (True)
Gang gang, ain't nothin' changed, always keep it trill wit' you (I'm fine to the bone)
Damn, I'm stunnin' (I'm fine to the bone)
Sweet like honey (He fine to the bone)
Walk through lookin' like somethin' (We fine to the bone)
Walk through lookin' like somethin' (Fine to the bone)
Damn, I'm stunnin' (We fine to the bone)
Sweet like honey (He fine to the bone)
Walk through lookin' like somethin' (She fine to the bone)
Walk through lookin' like somethin' (Uh, I'm fine to the bone)

Uh, skin dipped in cocoa (Cocoa), black designer logo (Logo)
My president still four-four, take note, Beyoncé solos (Yeah)
Hold those 'til we moguls, lift every voice for the po' folk (Po' folk)
More black-owned hair stores, revolutionary, Castro
Hero wit' no mask, yo, feel like the Black Panther cast (Uh-huh)
Or Tiger on the last hole, I ain't nowhere near my last goal (Goals)
You looking at a winner, remember, I ain't never had dough (Never)
But I walk like I got it, 'cause my blood mixed with black gold
Misty Copeland ten toes dancin' around the odds (Right)
Said I'd never make it, park the Audi in the garage (Vroom)
Model of success, don't change, be who you are (Yeah)
Don't matter who I'm addressing, it's cut from the same cloth (Real)
I'm here for a different cause, we seldom receive applause (Seldom)
Never receive awards (Yeah, yeah) if we ain't modeling something name (Right)
Fendi, Gucci, Dior (Uh-huh), women like me ignored
But it's aight, though, outsiders never change what's in store (Woo)Embed
