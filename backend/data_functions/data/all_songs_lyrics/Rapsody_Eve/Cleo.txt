Cleo Lyrics
To my real ones that know, this ain't for you
To  my enemies, it's still love all day
Everybody's  still growing and learning themselves, right?
My true story, yo

Pondering, pondering how to approach
Some  of y'all sensitive, but y'all still need to know (Yeah)
Wonder  how a bunch of sheep can have opinions on a G.O.A.T. (How?)
We all on the same continent and off the same boat (Right)
Remember  early on, y'all ain't treat me all the same though (Uh-huh)
Used to question why the brothers even rocked with me for (Uh)
'Member y'all wondered, used to wonder 'bout Wonder
Question why they'd ever wanna push a black woman
Niggas  on my label who ain't want me in the front end
Some sisters in the industry, y'all know y'all was frontin' (I know it)
Dressed too tomboy, rap too lyrical (You said it)
I can say more, the pain would bring a few tears to you (Hurt)
I shed a few, was booed bad in Fort Lauderdale (Uh)
Now I'm boo'd up, they boohoo 'cause I didn't fail
Know who you are, I was told names, never tell
The weight that I carried those summers, I'm never frail
Now they say I ain't elite (Who are they?)
On to the next
I don't take time to address opinions that ain't 9th, Dre, or Jay-Z (Right)
Only rap radars I need are them and the streets (Right)
Be careful, the validations y'all seek (Uh-huh)
I been in them offices, they don't look like you and me (They don't)
I've been in offices that they look like me
I learned lessons 'bout my essence and this industry (Uh)
Y'all banked on the wrong ones, wasted your energy (You did)
Lost more interest, got me laughin' at my enemies
Every door you close, every back you turn (Uh-huh)
Can't keep me away from the life I earned (You can't keep it)
My rock bottom still the high life y'all yearn (It is)
What ain't given, I had to take my turn (Give me that)
Came back, more ammo, like Cleo to burn
Blaow, blaow, blaow, nigga, burn
We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
Money talk, bullshit walk, you dig?
If you aim, you better squeeze
Real ones multiply, chump niggas bleed, you feel me?
We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
You can bank on that nigga
Two five two 'comin live from the booger boo basement
For the big faces, nigga

Yo, let's keep it a whole G, and talk about it upfront (Talk)
The best, point blank, period, every month (Talk)
The goals been lowered and we still scared to dunk (Talk)
Y'all don't want no smoke, half the squad roll blunts, hold up
Enough braggin', let's talk about the baggin' (Yeah)
Talk about the money, who in this business they staffin'? (Uh-huh)
Who milk the cows but they never put a calf in (Tell it)
White men run this, they don't want this kind of passion (Talk)
A black woman story, they don't want this kind of rapping (Talk)
They love a fantasy, they love the gun bang action (Talk)
What good is a black women to them? (Yeah)
Raped us in slavery, they raping us again (Yes)
Only put us on TV if our titties jiggling (Uh)
Jay tried to give us Tidals and we giggling at him (Damn shame)
But we ain't peeped the funny shit they doing (Crazy)
Chitlin circuit, mom and pop stores been ruined (Crazy)
'Cause we ain't wanna share the profit we was all movin'
Now it's pennies on pennies, that don't make sense do it? (Dollars)
We gotta stick together more than we has been (Yes, we do)
Beefin' with each other while they get rich laughing (Come on, bruh)
Mmh, that's a no-no (It is)
Bust my way through like Cleo with the ammo (Baow)
On my own terms, I'ma take what's mine
Singin' day after day, you can sing that line (Like Cleo)
We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
And that's a fact, nigga
You see we came up, got our change up, but we ain't change up
In a world full of fake niggas, still remain us
We ain't forgot about them shots, jack
They gon' be mad when I squeeze back
Real rap forever
Showin' love to all my strong black queens, you dig?
Fuck what you heard, bow down or get shot down, nigga

Money (Money, money, money)
Get your money
Get the money, money
Better get your money
Get the money, money
Money (Money, money, money)
Gotta get your money
Get the money, money
Better get your money
Get the money, money
Money
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
Well, I reme-3Embed
