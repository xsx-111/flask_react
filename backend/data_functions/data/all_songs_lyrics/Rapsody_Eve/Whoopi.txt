Whoopi Lyrics
Yeah
Give it to me now
Give it to me now

They gon' make a sister act up
Turn my attitude back up (Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag)
Count the money up
Call the girls up for backup (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
They gon' make a sister act up
Turn my attitude back up (Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag)
Count the money up
Call the girls up for backup (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

They gon' make a sister act up, Angela Bassett
Blow the whole car up, I ain't even gassin'
I'ma go worldwide, I'ma go NASA
Yeah the arm strong, you can get it if you askin'
They gon' make me go tap into my ratchet
I'ma go Left Eye when I get the matches
I'ma hit the blunt, I ain't even gon' pass it
My girls pullin' up if you ever want static
Rappers are savage, I don't bear malice
But I go crazy, day you try to play me
Go off like Cardi, don't talk 'bout my baby
I ain't no Blood but I might go brazy
Chicks don't faze me, I'm just like 'Yonce
I ain't feelin' you like I ain't feelin' new Kanye
Wish you would like I want new Andre
Back on the block, screamin' ándale, ándale
They gon' make a sister act up
Turn my attitude back up (Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag)
Count the money up
Call the girls up for backup (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
They gon' make a sister act up
Turn my attitude back up (Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag)
Count the money up
Call the girls up for backup (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

They gon' make a sister act up (Act up)
I'm Left Eye with the matches (Matches)
Light it up like a Backwood
Make me call the whole hood
Gold grill like I'm Dracula
Still in all black, I'm a rapper's rapper
I feel like Urlacher, bang on the block
Betta shoot like KD if you ever take a shot
Playin' big Goliath when my team got the rock
Been groomed for the throne, I ain't have to tie a knot
Don't back it up, y'all talk a lot (Y'all talk a lot)
I spot fear like polka dot (Like polka dot)
Power trippin', better tie up your laces, boy
I ain't talkin' 50 Cent or the homie Dot (Or the homie Dot)
I'm crackin up, is this all you got? (Is this all you got?)
Is this all you got? (Is this all you got?)
This all you got? (Is this all you got?)
Is this all you got?
I'm chill, peace, peace, chill, but y'all still talkin' crazy (Crazy)
Don't get my good vibes confused, I go West Coast brazy (Brazy)
Lawyer money, got lawyer money, might need Viola Davis (Davis)
I don't know, know, what y'all thought it was, but I'll show you better than I say it, uh
You make a sister act out (Act out)
You 'bout to hear my big mouth (Big mouth)
Don't make me get the traphouse (The traphouse)
Got me laughin', laughin' out loud (Out loud)
Laugh, laughin' out loud (Out loud)
Laugh, laughin' out loud (Out loud)
You make a sister act out
You 'bout to hear my
They gon' make a sister act up
Turn my attitude back up (Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag)
Count the money up
Call the girls up for backup (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
They gon' make a sister act up
Turn my attitude back up (Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag)
Count the money up
Call the girls up for backup (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a bag, get a bag, get a bag
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
