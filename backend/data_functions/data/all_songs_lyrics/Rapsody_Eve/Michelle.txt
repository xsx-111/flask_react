Welcome to the black and beautiful lounge (Ayy, ayy, ayy, hey, oh)
Ladies  free all night. You're now rockin' with the greatest (Ayy, ayy, ayy, hey, oh)
Fellas,  bring a fifth (Ayy, ayy, ayy, hey, oh)
Rock it to the east (Yeah), rock it to the west (Rock it to the)
Rock it to the east (Yeah), rock it to the west (Drop it like it's)
Rock  it to the east (Yeah), rock it to the west (Drop it like it's)

Lil' funky mama
Politickin'  with my clique and gotta wonder if I'ma get it poppin' (I'ma get it poppin')
I'ma get it poppin' (I'ma get it poppin')
Run up to the disc jockey, tell her play somethin' make me shake my body (Shake it, shake it)
Fly grown thang (Fly thang), runaway sis' with a boss attitude and a black name (Boss)
Where  my girls at? (Girls at)
Where Felicia, and Ayesha, and Keisha, and Michelle, and Shaniqua?

It's ladies first tonight (Tonight)
Let's party girl c'mon (C'mon)
You know it's gonna be tight (Gonna be tight)
Pull up, pull up, pull up, with me, ladies first tonight (Tonight)
Party, girl, c'mon, you know we lookin' dynamite (C'mon, lookin' dynamite)
Pull up, pull up, pull up (Pull up)
Yeah, I love a good night (I love a good night)
Make the body roll like I shake the globe up, like a pair of dice
I'm a bad thang, catch a side eye if you hatin' on my fly
Don't make me make change, if I break it down
Watch the party people start the Soul Train line
How we gettin' down? We ain't come to play (We ain't come to play)
We came to move, catch a groove and you know the girls came to slay

It's ladies first tonight (Tonight)
Let's party girl c'mon (C'mon)
You know it's gonna be tight (Gonna be tight)
Pull up, pull up, pull up, with me, ladies first tonight (Tonight)
Party, girl, c'mon, you know we lookin' dynamite (C'mon, lookin' dynamite)
Pull up, pull up, pull up (Pull up)

Elle V, yeah (Elle V y'all)
Rapsody yeah (That's me y'all, sing)
Head to the nail spot (Yeah)
Then to the mall (Get it girl)
Shop til' my heart drop (Spend it)
'Cause you know I want it all (I know you do)
If this boy don't call (So what?)
I ain't worried bout it at all (We ain't worried)
Switch that boy like I change clothes (Come on)
Kick it to the left, 'cause that's the way love goes
Especially when the liquor flows
Old Mary got me high (Yeah)
Follow my girls to get right (Yeah)
Uh, I dig it when nobody is pressed (Yeah)
Everybody chillin', spent a little of my check (Just a lil' bit)
Just to chill with the homies, ain't nobody gotta flex (Chill wit' me)
Swing it to the East, baby, rock it to the West (Rock wit' me)
Smile at the fellas, I ain't never takin' less (Killed it)
If you ain't showin' love, you gotta get up off the set (Get off)
One time for Aaliyah, always givin' you our best
The party goin' up in uno, dos, tres

It's ladies first tonight (Tonight)
Let's party girl c'mon (C'mon)
You know it's gonna be tight (Gonna be tight)
Pull up, pull up, pull up, with me, ladies first tonight (Tonight)
Party, girl, c'mon, you know we lookin' dynamite (C'mon, lookin' dynamite)
Pull up, pull up, pull up (Pull up)

Rock it to the east (Rock, hey)
Rock it to the west (Drop it like it's hot, ho)
Rock it to the east (Rock it, hey)
Rock it to the west (Drop it like it's hot, ho)
Rock it to the east (Rock it, hey)
Rock it to the west (Drop it like it's hot, ho)
Rock it to the east (Rock it, hey)
