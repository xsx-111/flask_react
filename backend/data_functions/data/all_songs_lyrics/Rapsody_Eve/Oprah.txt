Oprah Lyrics
Eric

I'm a master (Master)
Y'all should give me honorary masters (Masters)
Rapper work the green just like the Masters (The Masters)
The new slave talkin' like he got a master (Woop, woop)
Screamin', "Free Thought" (Free thought)
All the greatest legends behind bars, they really talk (They really talk)
Everything I say is everything I really walk
Got it for the free though if it wasn't what I really bought (I really bought)
Yeah (Yeah), pigeon pose (Pigeon pose)
Only way we ever, ever comin' toe to toe (Toe to toe)
My Ivory Coast copper blood got me drippin' gold (Drippin' gold)
Yeah, I got the juice, woo, see I'm drippin' Dole (Drippin' Dole)

Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circu', uh)

Give the homeless homies money, so they eat well (Yeah)
Went and copped an Audi, gotta go and get it detailed
Drive don't depreciate the value of the resale (Yeah, yeah)
Still talkin' that shit in this mother like we Ezell
Hold up, mothership flow, bring the funk back (Funk back)
This for my young heads, my real ones and old blacks (My old blacks)
This for my nasty niggas askin' where the hoes at? (Where the hoes?)
This gon' be the break, we stop and make 'em do the soul clap
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)

It ain't uncommon to borrow a dollar
Invite me over to eat with your mama (Eat with your mama)
I like the checks with the commas on commas (Commas on commas)
I want the checks with the commas on commas (Commas on commas)
It ain't uncommon to borrow a dollar
Invite me over to eat with your mama (Eat with your mama)
I like the checks with the commas on commas (Commas on commas)
I want the checks with the commas on commas

I need them dollars
Run me my half or I'll put a hole in your wallet
Cold case on my waist, you don't want these problems
Bank called, said they runnin' out of commas, that's on my mama
I'm steady mobbin', posted up 'til I reach my profit
Margin, cash money, nine-nine and two thousand
Hustler, don't you hear my stomach growlin'?
Bitch, I'm 'bout it, I'm hungry
So I need them tender greens spillin' off my plate
Cash on delivery, bitch, I raise the stakes
You would hate what I fuckin' make
Just to pop out and I don't even show my face, oh yeah
To count it all, gon' take about a minute
Don't claim the gang, ho, if you know you not with it
Marijuana scented, windows tinted
Keep it low 'cause you know these niggas can't wait to print it, oh yeah
It ain't uncommon to borrow a dollar
Invite me over to eat with your mama (Eat with your mama)
I like the checks with the commas on commas (Commas on commas)
I want the checks with the commas on commas (Commas on commas)
It ain't uncommon to borrow a dollar
Invite me over to eat with your mama (Eat with your mama)
I like the checks with the commas on commas (Commas on commas)
I want the checks with the commas on commas

Dollars (Hey), dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate, hey)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)
Dollars, dollars, dollars, circulate (Circu'-circulate)

They said we wouldn't have shit
Wouldn't last if it was up to white Jesus
Niggas started to believe it, started birthin' and bleedin' it
Oh, the lies y'all sold us, um
This poor love of ours, this gospel we sing
This little shine of mine
I'm gon' let it eat me up, I'm gon' let it kill me
Gon' let it fuck me up 'til I'm leanin'
'Til I'm fiendin', 'til I'm feelin' better, wow
I kinda feel better now
'Cause I got it now
For me, for him, for her
For my grandmama who had to pick cotton
And my granddaddy who got lashed at, then laughed at
Who you turned your back on, who you took your turn on for massah
I'm sorry, I'm kind of violent now
Fuckin' tired now
Don't mean to disturb your peace
Just needed a little piece of what you got when I helped you out for massah
Y'all got me hot now
Not asking for permission, came back to see what's good now
Niggas buyin' dreams by the pound, only real niggas sellin'
Only real niggas feel your fear
It's nice I'll frighten you
It's nice l've inspired you
To look, to think, to act like me
Little old me?
Little old me came back to say
We made it2Embed
