Myrlie Lyrics
Black widow, young kiddo
Tear stained pillow, 'nother black man died
Wade in the water, I don't mean baptized
Dark ass times, can't bat no eye
I see 'em, our BMs
IBM windows, they don't look through ours
We got a fire and it's big like Cali's
But they ain't for us, we ain't Forrest
They only for it, if we servin' time
Butler boys, that's a bigger crime
We gave ours to the rallies, funerals, black Denalis
Can't let a day go by
Esau, she saw, Eric die
We saw people cry, think about all of our people's wives
Raise the kids in the world they know ain't safe to live
Like Myrlie, emergency
The mirror me said I could be her too, the day I say I do

Black men bleeding, it's your time
Not so funny, Valentine
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love away
Made a widow from a wife
Took the love of my whole life
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love away
Yeah
Invisible veil, Coretta wore that, you could see Israel
Martin Luther wasn't a big enough deal?
Trayvon Martin ain't a big enough deal?
I kid you not
How many Martin's we had shot?
Pouring Remy Martin on the block
In memory, documented by the Roc
Yeah, I hope you watched, let's talk about
What Betty did, she saw X die
We saw X die, how Betty did
Now when I exit, for the baby kid
Cry for the baby Mama and the baby crib
That's a broken home, I could be on that
That's reality, that's a big ol' fact
'Cause I'ma marry black, a hard truth
Think about the widows, that could be us too

Myrlie, I miss you Miss Myrlie. Still holding yourself to sleep all night, still drunk off the shit that keeps you up at night. Still feel haunted, still exhausted. I can love you if you needing love Myrlie. Can you love me back?

Black men bleeding, it's your time
Not so funny, Valentine
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love away
Made a widow from a wife
Took the love of my whole life
Take, don't take, my love away (Oh don't you)
Take, don't take, my love awayEmbed
