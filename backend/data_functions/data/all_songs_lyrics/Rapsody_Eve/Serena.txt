Serena Lyrics
PSA, PSA, PSA
(Eric, Eric, Eric)
You the captain of your own ship, young blood
A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor
That's a quote I saw on Google, though
Can't stop, won't stop
That's that Puffy in me, yeah
Get it while the gettin' good, blood, yeah

Can't stop yeah got a long green
That's a long light, that's a sun beam
That's a bright path in a dark world
That's a good fight for a dark girl
On a surfboard in a rocky river
Y'all poolside, we still deliver
That's a Wonder Woman, superhero
Was black man that saved y'all Neo
We gon' save them all, Nat Turner, Tubman
For the hate you give, still thugging
That's Shakur life, Giovanni wrote it
Nikki, that's a real poet
Black life, we still going
They made we still flowing
Black joy, euphoria
We wanna smile like Gloria
That's Hov mama, word to my mama
That's a motherlode, mothership
Mother land, this some other shit
'90s flick, '96
Set it off, boy I'm Jada P with the box braids
If I aim, squeeze, that's RIP
Please kill the noise, if it's God given it can't be destroyed
Don't stop, get it, get it
I've been working long time, hey
Gotta get a gold mind, hey
Make it, make it go around, hey
Make it, make it go around, hey
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, don't stop, don't don't don't don't

Can't slow my grind up (Yeah)
Want smoke? Come find us (Yeah)
So bright, might blind ya (Yeah)
All the Roc boys behind us (Yeah)
I'm all positive, no minus (Yeah)
Watchers, they eye us (Right)
In my DM like, "Sign us"
I don't know y'all but keep tryin'
Life full of black diamonds
My career like Bryant's
Slow start but I go far
Got mo' heart than a giant (Yeah)
Evolve, that's science (Yeah)
Still move in silence (Right)
That's a better hunt, who I learned it from?
All the tigers and lions (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You ain't a real one if you lying (Nah)
That's the thing about timing (Right)
All my stars still aligning (True)
Rap never did no whining (Neva)
Less the grapes old and Moscato red
Success hella gratifying
For the real ones what's a million
If my folk all still dying?
Don't stop, get it, get it
I've been working long time, hey
Gotta get a gold mind, hey
Make it, make it go around, hey
Make it, make it go around, hey
Don't stop, get it, get it
I've been working long time, hey
Gotta get a gold mind, hey
Make it, make it go around, hey
Make it, make it go around, hey

A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor
That's a quote I saw on Google, thoughEmbed
