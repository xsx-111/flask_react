Maya Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, alright
So my voice could, uh, the beat could come down a tiny bit
And my voice could come up a lot
(I can't)
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

I can't be no bird in a cage (Woo, woo)
My bad, I don't wanna wait, no
We got the juice, we got the proof
Mama always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage (Woo, woo)
My bad, I don't wanna wait, no
Knock on wood, it's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste your soul

Yeah, stay movin' forward and elevate from the floor
And the old you had big drive, the new you drive like Delorean
Until you do more than Lauryn (Yeah)
The future's important, they tell me, do what you can
Man, I'ma do it like Jordan (That's right)
Gotta check myself, Mama
Told me, just like old Morgan, free man (Free man)
A caged bird sings a song for freedom (Freedom)
Goin' borderline crazy thinkin' 'bout the children
Michael Jackson told us all, get off the wall, back then
Ain't no strings, like Tito, no puppet, Danny DeVito
It's your idle time, get you nowhere, unless you Barrino (C'mon)
I ain't a new slave, my new wave, the new negro
Ain't on the web, but it's W. E. B
Key holes, unlocked 'em (Uh)
No thinkin' toxic (That's right)
You miseducated, like Lauryn with the 'locks in
If you confuse my boxin', with me being boxed in (Never)
It's my native language, ain't gotta say it in moccasins
Whatever I be rockin' in, I speak the truth (I speak the truth)
Like 222 times 2 (Yeah), that's 4:44
Better than before (Yeah, c'mon)
Be three times the lady like we sangin' Commodores
Knowin' I can't, I can't
I can't be no bird in a cage (Woo, woo)
My bad, I don't wanna wait, no
We got the juice, we got the proof
Mama always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage (Woo, woo)
My bad, I don't wanna wait, no
Knock on wood, it's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste your soul

I can't be no bird in a cage (I can't be that)
Can't let emotions hold me prison to rage (I can't do that)
Everytime they pop off, I don't even engage (I can't say that)
Knowin' if I act up, I ain't actin' my age (I don't play that)
Some days are Morpheus, other times I'm just like Tre
Which means, some days I need savin', other days I wear the cape (Yeah)
They tell me in due time, when even babies come late (Talk about it)
So I'm go for mine 'cause I ain't got none to waste (That's right)
Born ready, like I came out in some cleats, double laced
To run the world with, they tell me it's gon' be a long way (It's a long way)
Knock on wood that we make it through the day (That's a long day)
I ain't the one to cross, I left that burden to Lecrae
I got a plot for every block, until I'm King like Luke Cage
It's Sue Bird, that's my word, the only time the two relate (A caged bird)
So many, many, many moves to make (Yeah)
And I approach 'em like Michael on the Motown stage (Hee, hee)
I walk the moon before I walk the graves all day (C'mon)
Delay nuttin' sista you ain't got no time to waste, singin'
You can't what?
(Control it)
I can't be no bird in a cage (Woo, woo)
My bad, I don't wanna wait, no
We got the juice, we got the proof
Mama always told me don't waste your time
I can't be no bird in a cage (Woo, woo)
My bad, I don't wanna wait, no
Knock on wood, it's gon' be a long night
Stay movin' forward, don't waste your soul

I can't, I can't
I can't control it1Embed
