Highway Lady LyricsRun down, low down, don't feel tired
Take no orders, don't get fired
I waste away cruisin' along
Fighting blizzards, ragin' storms
Hope the wheels know I'm born to ramble o
Cruisin' along
But I stop, turn my head around
Sleep until tomorrow, in my arms
In my arms
Highway lady, dream the big top high above
Highway lady, highways make you smile again
How she feels
Found my way to Spanish stairs
Small corruption, no one cares about tasty life
Cruisin' along
Fighting blizzards, ragin' storms
Hope the wheels know I'm born to ramble o
Cruisin' along
Fighting blizzards, ragin' storms
Hope the wheels know I'm born to ramble o
Cruisin' along
How she feels
Highway lady, highway lady
Highway lady, highway ladyEmbed
