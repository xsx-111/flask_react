All or Nothing LyricsI thought you'd listen to my reasoning
But now I see, you don't hear a thing
Tried to make you see how it's gotta be
Well it's allright
*chorus: all or nothing, all or nothing, all or nothing, for me
Things could work out just like I want them to, yeah
If I could have the other half of you
Yes you know I would if I only could
I said it's allright
Chorus (instrumental)
I ain't telling no lies, so don't you sit there and cry, mama yeah
All or nothing, all or nothing, all or nothing, for me, for me, for me
All or nothing, need it, all or nothing, all or nothing, I gotta, I gotta, keep on
All or nothing, I need it so bad, all or nothing, I want it right now
All or nothing for me, for me, for me, c'mon
All or nothing, gotta have it now, all or nothing, I need it so bad
All or nothing, for me, for me, for me
All or nothing, gotta gotta, all or nothing, need it so bad
All or nothing, for me, for me, for me come on
All or nothing, all or nothing, all or nothing, I gotta I gotta for me
All or nothing, all or nothing, all or nothing, for meeeeeeeee
(all right, ooh uh, oof, mmm, jesus I wish I hadn't worn these tight trousers!)Embed
