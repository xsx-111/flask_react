Tonight Tonight Lyrics
Could've been a 68’
Where were you and me? (yeah)
If there's a chance I'd take it
Just to wait and see
And from that sad eyed stare girl
You givin’ me, you seem to think the same
Now look and see

So while, waiting til' tomorrow
It never comes (yeah)
Tonight tonight tonight
We're gonna make it girl
Tonight tonight tonight
We're gonna make it girl

You can't always see the future
You always say the same
But we're bound to happen girl
Thought we had it made
And from that sad eyed stare
You givin' me you seem to think the same girl
Now look and see
So while, waiting til' tomorrow
It never comes (yeah)
Tonight tonight tonight
We’re gonna make it girl
Tonight tonight tonight
We’re gonna make it girlEmbed
