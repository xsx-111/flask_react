Reasons Love LyricsNew feel of you runnin' through my vein
Little bit of everything
You know that's what you said
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love
'Cause always you indulge
And parents try to get you out of these jams
You got that envy 'cause they won't understand
The social life you lead leaves nothin' to desire
Don't wanna see you bleed
But you came on like a liar
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love
'Cause always you indulge
And parents try to get you out of these jams
You got that envy 'cause they won't understand
Wrecked myself to love you
All you want is more
One thing you're after
You just try and score
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love
Try hard, try hard to reason, reasons love
'Cause always you indulge
And parents try to get you out of these jams
You got that envy 'cause they won't understandEmbed
