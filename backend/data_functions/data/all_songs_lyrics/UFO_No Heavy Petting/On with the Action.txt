On with the Action LyricsSomething going on at the corner of the block
It's the kids down there
They were startin' to rock
Hot black fever runnin every place
When the Greek kid pulled a knife and pushed it in his face
Some girl makes it with a lover in the door
As the ambulance pulls away, she cries out more
And it's all night long, all night long
On with the action
You need the fastest legs alive
On with the action
If you can't run you can't survive
On with the action
Mama's boy and teacher's pet
On with the action
It's down our street, is it in yours yet
All the kids stand laughin'
They never had such fun
Then someone cuts a brown man who just can't run
And the queen that's been standin' behind the toilet door
His parents don't like boyfriends, call him a whore
But the minister's starin' with his bible in his hand
Was this Gods children, he didn't understand
And it's all night long, all night long
On with the action
You need the fastest legs alive
On with the action
If you can't run you can't survive
On with the action
Mama's boy and teacher's pet
On with the action
It's down our street, is it in yours yet
And it's all night long, all night long
On with the action
You need the fastest legs alive
On with the action
If you can't run you can't survive
On with the action
Mama's boy and teacher's pet
On with the action
It's down our street, is it in yours yetEmbed
