All the Strings LyricsSunset lights still dancing on the runway
And your playing doesn't feel like touching down
At the terminal
Are you someone, are you something
Have I seen your face before?
Long black cars there to shoot you down the runway
One more handshake and you're ready to be shown
At the showdown
Let's go down the crowd now drowns
What's to be told
All the way, all the way
It's taken me so long to find this place
And now you've set the pace
It's all about to fall into space
All the strings are broken
And the band is out of two
But thеy all keep playing
'Cause they know
Therе's more, more to rock'n roll
Sixty days and your time has left without you
Last alone call and you're ready to be shown
Whisper in woods
Every way you are is own
And now you're gone
All the strings are broken
And the band is out of two
But they all keep playing
'Cause they know
There's more, more to rock'n rollEmbed
