Can You Roll Her LyricsFast as light our jets were burnin'
On the road, a distant siren's song
Hands upon my engine's growin'
Vincent's deep throat breathin' out so strong
I can hold her, can you roll her?
Riding like there's no tomorrow
The siren's song sure is growin' stronger
Shadow reached a high note
And in the distance, electric lights no longer
I can hold her, can you roll her?
I can hold her, can you roll her?
I can hold her, can you roll her?
Fast as light our jets were burnin'
On the road, a distant siren's song
Hands upon my engine's growin'
Vincent's deep throat breathin' out so strong
I can hold her, can you roll her?
I can hold her, can you roll her?
I can hold her, can you roll her?
I can hold her, can you roll her?
I can hold her, can you roll her?
I can hold her, can you roll her?Embed
