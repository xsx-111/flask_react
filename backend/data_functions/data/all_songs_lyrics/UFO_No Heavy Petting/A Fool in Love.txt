A Fool in Love LyricsPeople say I'm a lion at heart
But they don't know what I em
People say that I stand apart
But they just don't understand
Every night when the darkness calls
I'll be there at your beck and call
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool right now
People say I'm a man of means
But my plans are full of holes
People say I'm a holy child
But I'm rich down to my soul
All I need is you close beside me
All I need is to satisfy
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool right now
People say I'm a man of means
But my plans are full of holes
People say I'm a holy child
But I'm rich down to my soul
All I need is you close beside me
All I need is to satisfy
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool in love
Every mornin' when the sun comes up
And all your dreams, they slip sway
I see your face and I understand
You're the only one, only one to make my day, yeah
Everybody say you ain't no good
But I won't believe it's true
They all say I ought to find someone
But my heart belongs to you
Every night when the darkness calls
I'll be there at your beck and call
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool right now
People say I'm a man of means
But my plans are full of holes
People say I'm a holy child
But I'm rich down to my soul
All I need is you close beside me
All I need is to satisfy
I'm a fool for you baby
I'm a fool right now
People say I'm a man of means
But my plans are full of holes
People say I'm a holy child
But I'm rich down to my soul
All I need is you close beside me
All I need is to satisfyEmbed
