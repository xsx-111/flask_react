Martian Landscape LyricsI come from the land where the wheat is still wheat
Where the water in the rivers is still water
In this land, every man lends a hand when you need it
But your hands are full of life, so you can help yourself and feel it
It's been a long way from the red of my home
From the valleys and the green plains never ending
Everyone knows that the sun in his land is stronger
And your hands are full of life, if you can only wait just longer
So let it be a small haven, big in your heart
Don't let it turn into a nova, tryin' to climb and climb
Try and forget this place where I can still find time
To sing in rhyme
Martian landscape, I'll learn to lie in your arms
Where all the freedom is mine and it comes
Martian landscape, I'll turn my face to your sun
Where your horizon is mine and it comes
I come from the land where the wheat is still wheat
Where the water in the rivers is still water
In this land, every man lends a hand when you need it
But your hands are full of life, so you can help yourself and feel it
So let it be a small haven, big in my heart
Don't let it turn into a nova, tryin' to climb and climb
Try and forget this place where I can still find time
To sing in rhyme
Martian landscape, I'll want to lie in your arms
Where all the freedom is mine and it comes
Martian landscape, I'll turn my face to your sun
Where your horizon is mine and it comes
Martian landscape, Martian landscape
Martian landscape, Martian landscapeEmbed
