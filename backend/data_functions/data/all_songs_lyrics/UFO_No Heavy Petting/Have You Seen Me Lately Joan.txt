Have You Seen Me Lately Joan Lyrics
Sittin' on a stone wall
Baskin' in the glow
I just flicked a flower off the tumbler
I'm drinking my wine out of

Crossed a road, two ladies in crippled shoes
Can't walk, must be the latest fashion
You know and I know that they know that we know
You can't do nothing about it

Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
My heart feels like stone

I'll take you ladies in my truck
For the past 50 miles
And now approximately
Causing havoc and noise
Jenny "Know it all" find a face from the window
Was back to her desk
Complaining something's wrong
Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
My heart feels like stone
I don't blame you
I don't blame you
How could I blame you for being you?

Sanna's sister twice removed from proud
Says that I don't work out right for her
Was a beat on her ears
Keep away the ghosts
Things I just come off the sidewalk
With the denims and all

Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
My heart feels like stone


Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
Have you seen me lately Joan?
My heart felt like stone
