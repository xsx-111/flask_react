Much Too Much (Mack a Mil) Lyrics
Other MCs in the place know I'm much too much
And I'll bust 'em all up without even cussing
All wannabe's are never ever gonna be nothin'
Gang Starr's in the house and we're crushing
So suckers better be up on their P's and Q's and
Competition come against me and you're losing
I'll use a simple style just to catch you snoozing
Wake up wake up kid read the news and
Take heed 'cause you need to see how battles are won
When a real man displays how it must be done
And I snuff bum MCs and keep the cashflow comin'
And never had no problems getting women
I'm like a catalyst causin' a chain reaction
Dopest vocalist and now the main attraction
Things turn gold at my slightest touch
That's why the people say that I'm much too much

I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much

Check the G-U-R-U, yes, the brother who's progressing
If beats are cake I'm frosting, if salad I'm dressing
Never stressing or guessing or messing around man
Just turn up the system so the beat can be pounding
Blasting out your radio my vocals surrounding
Take a trip uptown and come back down and
Kick it with the fellas I call my crew so
I'm gettin' kinda fat like a big huge sumo
I figure that I'm due and it's true 'cause you know
A rapper this nice oughta clock mad dough
Not the stuff from the baker but the loot yo the paper
I set up shop and drop gems and catch 'em later
'Cause I'm like keeping it moving, improving steadily
Pumping kinda loud in your Blazer or Cherokee
Doesn't matter what you drive, automatic or clutch
Just pop in my tape 'cause I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
Yeah, I'm much too much
I'm much too much
'Cause I'm much too much
I'm much too much

I walk in the room unload a boom that's like sonic
My slick voice to the beat is symphonic
To a biting MC my lines are toxic and chronic
My mystical style is like harmonic
I've rarely had a difficulty slaying MCs
'Cause the ones who were toughest still begged on their knees
And I wreck the set with the greatest of ease
And you know I'm swift like the breeze
I'll never understand why a wack rapper tries and
Convinces himself that his image is so fly and
That's the type of crap you know I'm ain't buying
Chumps lack the beats and their rhymes don't apply and
That's why I've come into your life today
Just to make you sweat in my unique way
I'm controlling all action dissing MC ducks
That's why everybody knows that I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
I'm much too much
'Cause I'm much too much

Mack a mil, mack a mil, mack a mil
Mack a mil, mack a mil, mack a mil
Mack a mil, mack a mil, mack a mil
Mack a mil, mack a mil, mack a milEmbed
