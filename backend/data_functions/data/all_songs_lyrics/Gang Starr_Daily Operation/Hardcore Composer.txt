Hardcore Composer Lyrics
Now I got you looking stiff you numbskull, you'd rather stand still
Faking hard with your rhymes and got no hand skills
So I'll easily drop you and stop you from rhyming
Send you home to moms all bruised up and crying
Then if you want you can go call your people
You're gonna need a mob against me 'cause I'm lethal
Not that I'm a violent brother, no, to the contrary
My vocals carry, then I bury
MC's in holes they dug for themselves
Couldn't be themselves so they sold theirselves
To a company exec who doesn't have respect
For real rap music, so he wants to get
An MC that starts out street to cross over
But not me, 'cause I'm the hardcore composer

You ain't a writer nor a fighter, you're just a biter
I think you need to save all that because in spite of
The reputation that you think you have
The crew already knows that you're really a crab
So I'll grab the mic with haste and send you out of this place
Back to trace my flow but don't waste your time, bro
It only takes a minute or second for me to switch
And rearrange real quick
'Cause I can kick plenty styles, rhymes stretch many miles
I'm the authentic, yes, the lyric unloader
The truth exposer, the hardcore composer
All you delirious, curious suckers
You better act like you've been known
I mack and hold my own with a mic
Just to stagger a bragger, retire a liar
And very easily I'm passin' by ya
'Cause you didn't want to give the credit where it was due
Yeah it was you, uh-huh it was you
And your crummy corny ass crew
So we shall enforce that you lost
And plus you oughta find another type of life
And yes another source of income
Here's some adviceâ€”you can't rap this nice
I broke ya over and over
I told ya I would mold ya, why?
Because I'm bound to give original sound as your ears pound
Bringing pleasure and pain and brains start to gain
From musical measures forming stanzas, combining
Providing answers to mystical questions, never typical inventions
Developed by my Gifted Unlimited mind
Suckers wanna talk but they mimic the rhyme
'Cause they're eager to find the secret behind
The way that I stomp all comp' just like a Timberland
It's the Guru and Premier, it's them again
Droppin' fly tracks and taking things over
And never selling out
'Cause I'm the hardcore composerEmbed
