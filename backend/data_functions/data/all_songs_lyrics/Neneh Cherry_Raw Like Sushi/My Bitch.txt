My Bitch LyricsWhen you turn around baby, I'll be watching you
I can see through you
Maybe then you'll see
That i ain't playing; I'm to be taken seriously
You know what i'm saying?
And so the story goes
One night when i was shaking And i definately wasn't faking
I was lost in a trance Doing my own dance
My girls on my side Were concentrating on the music playing
And the speakers vibrating
I shut my eyes, and the next thing i knew
All i could smell was leather and brute
Imposing on my groove, standing on my side
And licking your lips, and rocking your thighs
I wanted to die laughing, at your serious
I've come to save you expression
But i held my breath and said who are you?
Baby, my name is drew, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Maximum tender, Feminine gender
Come on baby it's time to surrender
I'm drew (so what you gonna go) I just want to get into you
Hey bitch don't be so uptight, We can make a date through tonight
And then before hell breaks loose, I'll just turn up the juice
I say: Hey all you people my name is Mr. Smalls
And some of the girls are saying i am the one with the greatest heart
No matter where i go (gimme a break) no matter who i show
And i'm mr smalls (is that right, wait now)

I stomped this joint from top to toe
I found nothing but half pint two bit guys
Acting out the parts, who might have been charming
Some are in a movie being batman and robin
It's not the way you look, cause you ain't half bad
It's the way you act that makes me sad
You know you think you're finger licking and that's the problemEmbed
