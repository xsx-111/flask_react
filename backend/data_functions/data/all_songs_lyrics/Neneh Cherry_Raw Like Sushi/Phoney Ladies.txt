Phoney Ladies LyricsIf you're gonna play with my soul
Why don't you take a look at your own first
No pain is lean enough, it's always filled with hurt
And those feelings, you know I felt them first
And it hurts

So why don't you stop, phoney ladies, in my face to cramp my freedom
Phoney ladies that mess me up, calling names to cramp my freedom
And you don't even wanna see them, calling names to cramp my freedom
Phoney ladies that mess me up, nobody's gonna grab my freedom
Nobody's gonna mess me up
You becoming a victim of the game
Don't you forget I'm your sister and your friend too
The way you treat me will put this house to shame
Your secret conversations put you in the frame
In the frame

No money money money can buy what we've got
No money money money can buy what we've got
No money money money can buy what we've got
No money money money can buy what we've got
You're playing games
Trying to make me jealous
It'll never save us now
