The Next Generation LyricsAutumn Breeze, a Spring Tease
Summer days and winter nights
The seasons change and that's a fact
Is it not
Domo Arigato, Danke, Merci
Mothers and daughters, fathers and sons
Here's hoping you'll know the right time when it comes
Like I did 'cause I knew though nobody told
Me a damn thing about how The world grows
Right here before you, you can't even blink If you do you'll miss it so take time to think
About your position, your place in this world
About what you're here for so check it out girl
Boys to the right and you're in this too
Come on be real now Can we count on you
To be strong and to love us like Through thick and thin with your heart and your soul not the size of your dick
Yeah, Uh huh yeah uh huh
So check this out
Hey what's this sitting in my lap
Why it's the Next Generation
And do you know what comes from the best love in the world you could possibly ever have
Yes it's the next generation
The children are the chosen ones
Society's got it's piorities Wrong. The schools are closing down
Don't be messing with our future - black babies, white babies
Quarter Puerto Ricans, two sixths Chinese
Any combination you could possibly imagine
But this important as the ground We walk on, people are people you know what I mean
Even the baby with a portaphone
Attached to its' buggy Pushed by a clone
And the black market baby that unwanted baby
For 50,000 it belonged to the rich
Well he didn't like his face
She said it didn't matter
'cause her husband was a surgeon
Ha ha ha ha - urr - sick
Ain't ain't that ain't that sick -
Shucks it breaks my heart
Operate on a baby urr sick
Hey what's that sitting in my lap
Why it's the Next Generation
And do you know what comes from the best love in the world you could possibly ever have
Yes it's the next generation
And is it true that even though they keep you awake at night
Sometimes and mess on your clothes that you worry about
Whether it's really worth the sacrifices that we all have to make
No matter how rich or poor
Why yes they're the next generation honey
(free up)
Push push push, in the bush down on your knees with the birds and bees
Your basic needs is what you're fulfilling
This dude down this way must be making a killing
'Cause then in the morning
She finds herself illing
You planted a seed that won't grow a tree
'Cause the love that's showing is a baby growing
Inside there's a life that's well worth knowing, knowin, knowin
Ha ha ha ha that's nasty ain't it
If you're gonna do it, think before you do it and do it right - right
Hey what's this sitting in my lap
Why it's the Next Generation oh yeah
And do you know what comes from the best love in the world you could possibly ever have
Yes it's the next generation
And is it true that even though they keep you awake at night
Sometimes and mess on your clothes that you worry about
Whether it's really worth the sacrifices that we all have to make
No matter how rich or poor
Why yes they're the next generation honey
You know, you know you see some people look at them right
Old people, guys on the corner holding on, girls right walking
Arm in arm, spittin' on the pavement or whatever
And you wonder right if they've forgotten or if they just
Can't remember that they ever were small one time
'Cause god knows we got to save the babies right
'Cause if we don't save the babies
We ain't Gonna have a world to live in right
And god knows we love this world right
Ain't that, right so right
Right right right... right uh uh...Embed
