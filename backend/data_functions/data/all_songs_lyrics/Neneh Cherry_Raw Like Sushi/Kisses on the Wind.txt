Kisses on the Wind Lyrics
Pero chica, mi amiga, ¿que dice?
Esto es yo, esto es yo y como hablo y hablo así y hablo así contigo
Down this wild street walks, walks a child with no trace
Of ever being as young as her sister is
A local neighborhood crush the boys would hide out and watch
Her hanging washing on the line all the time

More like a woman, she dress like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl to turn the boys on
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young Making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind
Te compraste una bomba pero no me importa
At the corner shop, halfway down the block
All the radios pumping to the way she walks
Past the flyboys art, where her name's engraved
Sweet liberty is what it says
More like a woman, she dress like one
She was the first girl, she was the first girl, to turn the boys on
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind
Te compraste una bomba
Pero no me importa, qué te digo, hombre, mi amigo
Ah it doesn't matter, you know what I'm saying
Ah no, forget it because I'm going there man you know?
You can follow me but you know what I'm saying don't make me say it
Ah, no sé (okay, me voy)
The price of puberty's got a way of showing
It doesn't come in easy stages
Her mother's face in the pot, won't ever leave it
She needs a bell to ring the changes
More like a woman she walks like one
She was the first girl, she was the first girl, to turn the boys on
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the wind
Boys, boys, wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
This girl, she's got another story
When they are gone she blows them kisses on the windEmbed
