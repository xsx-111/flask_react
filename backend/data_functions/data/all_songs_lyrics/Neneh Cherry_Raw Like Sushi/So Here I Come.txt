So Here I Come LyricsI can see this picture of myself
In a green dress I felt lost
The first time I went to school
I was 4 feet 2, 6 feet scared and so distressed
This dress was green, I was the best dressed
I'd ever been, first day at school
I said teacher teacher I know my ABC's
I want to read and write, I want to understand
Why the sky never ends and why the sky is blue
And not white - right
But when I spoke my heart broke
Cause it was plain to see that school
Would never be the picture for my fantasy

I know where I'm going and where I'm coming from
So here I come, so here I come
Slowly I came to discover
Time, heals, time feels so young
When you're having fun
At 13 my kiss was sweet and not deep
Covered in blush kiss 'n tell
My lips were deep red and shiny as hell
In my stairwell kiss "n" love discovered me
Undercover my fantasy my first kiss hit and miss
He wasn't impressed cause I wouldn't get undressed
Wrote my name on the wall - my hair was pressed
He had blue balls
If you want to rock you've got to roll it
If you gonna live you've got to show it
And if you're gonna do it, you got to do it right - don't you know it

On the rooftops I seen panties drop
And thru the windows behind the screens
In the red light after a fight love was made
Love was saved
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in hell just to go straight to heaven
I might have been lost but now I'm found
I got my two feet on the ground
