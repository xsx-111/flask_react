Love Ghetto LyricsI'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the last stretch,on the last stretch
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the left foot, with the right foot
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the last stretch,on the last stretch
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the left foot, with the right foot
You could have reached for me, saved me from lying and I wanted to touch you
But I was stuck on my island
With a puddle of misunderstanding like a sea between us
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the last stretch,on the last stretch
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the left foot, with the right foot
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto
Chasing you is haunting me, but I know that girl is lying
You upset my chemistry
Baby I'm sick of crying
Forever is only like the sky and the sea between us
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago
When we anchored our love in the harbour seems so long ago
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto
I can't see a way every day we are the same
Turning round and round I pick you up and then you let me down
Never will I blame, never will I hate
I'll just have to go saving you from saving me
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the last stretch,on the last stretch
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the left foot, with the right foot
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto
Come rain come shine I'm leaving this love ghetto
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the last stretch,on the last stretch
I'm in a home run, I'm in a home run
On the right foot, with my left foot
On my right foot
What your eyes tell you, your ears can be deceived
And the poor teacher can always be relieved
In the love ghetto
In the love ghetto
What your eyes tell you, your ears can be deceived
And the poor teacher can always be relieved
In the love ghetto
In the love ghetto
What your eyes tell you, your ears can be deceived
And the poor teacher can always be relieved
In the love ghetto
In the love ghettoEmbed
