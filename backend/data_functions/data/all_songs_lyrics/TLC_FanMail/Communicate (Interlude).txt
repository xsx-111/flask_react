Communicate (Interlude) Lyrics
Communication is the key to life
Communication is the key to love
Communication is the key to us
(Change Channel sound)

There's over a thousand ways
To communicate in our world today
And it's a shame
That we don't connect
(Change Channel Sound)

So if you also feel the need
For us to come together
Will you communicate with me?
