Shout Lyrics
(Shout)
What's up y'all (Owwww)
It's Left Eye on the track (Owwww)
My girl T-Boz over to my left (Owwww)
Chilli is on my right (Yeah)
We gonna teach ya'll to shout (Owwww)
Unhh (Owwww)
Check it out (Owwww, yeah)
What's up, what's up, whoo!

Oooh same damn time every hurt or two
Something can happen to put me in the mood
Keep it inside 'til I turn dark blue
Trash everything I ever gave to you
Wrote it on the front of your Lexus Coupe
Didn't want to leave you with a lame excuse
Sex so good, turns love to abuse
When you want it leave, it's got you in a noose

It's not just when I'm in bed
Sometimes it's so frustratin'
I keep it all in my head
'Till I just can't take it no more
It's not just when I get mad
Sometimes it's cuz I'm so glad
That you are near me now
I just have to get it out
Shout!
You gotta let me get it out
You gotta let it go away
Don't wanna spend another day
On this, I feel like you make me
Shout!
You gotta let me get it out
The feelin' won't go away
Don't wanna spend another day
On this, I feel like you make me
Shout!

Found somethin' in your pocket
And I don't know why
I didn't say nothing' just sat and cried
Got me twisted all out inside
Not too long before the next ride
Over and over and over again
Instead of lettin' out I always let it in
This is where the confusion begins
Cuz if you don't make me, you don't win

It's not just when I'm in bed
Sometimes it's so frustratin'
I keep it all in my head
'Till I just can't take it no more
It's not just when I get mad
Sometimes it's cuz I'm so glad
That you are near me now
I just have to get it out
Shout!
You gotta let me get it out
You gotta let it go away
Don't wanna spend another day
On this, I feel like you make me
Shout!
You gotta let me get it out
The feelin' won't go away
Don't wanna spend another day
On this, I feel like you make me
Shout!

Baby just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
Cuz sometimes I need you to turn me out
Cuz that's what lovin' is all about (shout!)
Maybe just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
Cuz sometimes I need you to turn me out
Cuz that's what lovin' is all about (shout!)
Yeah

Check it
I knew that it was only time before my rhymes
Would dig into my mind and get crazy out of line
I do my best to never disrespect
My girls in TLC or my friends
So let me speak my love and peace
All about in this world full of doubt
Is you down for the count?
Do you hoe's still amount to the price that we pay
To remain up in this crucial game
Call it a test, a game of chess, let's play
Me and you, one on one, breakin' the ice 'til the water runs
Down my face like a chase, now do you hear the guns?
Here I come and won't quit until the job is done
Quiet storms will inform you that I've just begun
Tippin' the spot 'till it's hot if you want what I got
See me down to the dot-dot-com
And keep it comin' with your best shot
If you're short or can't rely, then let's not
Shout!
You gotta let me get it out (Gotta let me get it out, yeah)
You gotta let it go away
Don't wanna spend another day
On this, I feel like you make me
Shout!
You gotta let me get it out (Hey! Hey! Ohhh)
The feelin' won't go away
Don't wanna spend another day
On this I feel like you make me
Shout!
You gotta let me get it out (Ohh, oh oh oh)
You gotta let it go away (Oh oh oh oh)
Don't wanna spend another day (Oh oh ohh)
On this I feel like you make me
Shout! (Ohh)
You gotta let me get it out (Oh oh oh)
The feelin' won't go away (Oh oh oh oh)
Don't wanna spend another day (Oh oh oh)
On this I feel like you make me (Ohhhh)
