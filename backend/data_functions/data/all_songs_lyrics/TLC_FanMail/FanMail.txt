FanMail Lyrics
Welcome
We've dedicated our entire album cover to any person (T)
Who has ever sent us fanmail (L)
This is a journey into life (C)
Love, and the future of music (Fanmail)
TLC would like to thank you for your support (Fanmail)
And just like you (Just like you)
They get lonely too (I get lonely too)

Ah-ah-ah (Fanmail)
Ah-ah-ah (Fanmail)
Ah-ah-ah (Fanmail)
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ah-ah-ah (Fanmail)
Ah-ah-ah (Fanmail)
Ah-ah-ah (Fanmail)
Just like you, I get lonely

Waited for you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sittin' Miss alone
We shoulda did this already
Said I got an email today
Kinda thought that you forgot about me
So I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time to show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Into space, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too

Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
FanMail
Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
FanMail
Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
FanMail
Just like you, I get lonely too
Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
FanMail
Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
FanMail
Just like you (Oh)
FanMail
Just like you, I get lonely

Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't want to come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But a girl will do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you (Know you)
Take my time to show you (Show you)
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be (I'll be)
Into space, just you and me (You and me) with no rules (With no rules)
Just like you, I get lonely too

Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
FanMail
Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
FanMail
Just like you (Ah-ah-ah)
Baby, 'cause just like you, I get lonely too (T-L-C)
Just like you (Yeah)
FanMail
Just like you (Oh)
FanMail
Just like you (Oh)
Just like you, I get lonely too

(FanMail) Man we had all kinda sorts of conflicting fanmail, the letters
Some parents was like
"You're the thieves (Fanmail) and the pimps and the thugs of stage"
Just like you ("And you owe every mother in America")
I get lonely too ("A public apology")
Every day I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait 'til the day I see ya
Know that you just might be the one for me (I get lonely too)
Every day I think I'm gonna meet ya
Can't wait 'til the day I see ya
Know that you just might be the one I need
Just like you

Be me, do what I believe in
And be myself and I suggest (T)
Everyone do the same thing, (L)
You do what makes you feel comfortable
Do what makes you feel and happy (C)3Embed
