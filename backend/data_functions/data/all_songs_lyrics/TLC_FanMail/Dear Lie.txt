Dear Lie Lyrics
Dear lie, you suck
You said you could fix anything
Instead I'm fucked
You made things even worse for me
If I had balls
I'd tell you "get away from me"
Guess I'm not smart
I let you unnerve me
I let you control me
Afraid that the truth would hurt me
When it's you that hurts me more

Get outta my mouth
Get outta my hair
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me, out of me, out of me, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

Dear lie, you're dumb
You think you've got the best of me
You think you've won
Misread my vulnerability
I've got, your balls (I've got, your balls)
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned ,your heart (I've learned, your heart)
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no, no more
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my hair
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me, out of me, out of me, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

I've got your balls
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned your heart
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no, no more

Get outta my mouth
Get outta my hair
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me
Out of me, out of me, out of me, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Dear lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Dear lieEmbed
