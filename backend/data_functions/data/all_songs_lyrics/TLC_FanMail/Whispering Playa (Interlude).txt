Whispering Playa (Interlude) Lyrics
Woo, hoo hoo!
Yo yo yo yo yo what's up what's up!
(Look to the left)
(A ha ha ha)
What's up girl, what's up?
(Man, check out another one...)
I know...
(What's up, how you doin' how you doin'?)
I can't believe you sittin' up here, know what I'm sayin?
(Mmm hmm...)
I see you and your girl in here tryna floss or whatever
*Whispering*
Why don't you just get rid of your friend...
(Who are you talkin' about Chilli?)
Yeah, well you know ohhh....
I ain't even recognize...
(Girl...)
What's up Left Eye you know what I'm sayin'...
We just regular ol' peeps and everything
*Whispering*
We can go and get in my stretch viper ya know what I'm sayin...
(Ha ha ha)
We can split this club
(Man, can you please get out of my ear?)
Oh I got it I got it I got it I see
Ya'll rollin' together
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Well we can just bounce to my crib...
Ya know what I'm sayin....
*Whispering*
Do that menage-a-tois...
A ha ha...
(Ha)
You know what I'm sayin'
I'm down
We can burn it down
(Chilli do you hear something?)
(A ha)
A ha
(Girl come on let's go...)Embed
