Lovesick Lyrics
Saw you two the other day
And I must say that she looks great
You all make the cutest two
I guess I should be glad for you
But the thought of you just makes me sick
It's been two weeks and that's too quick
Can't say that I'm doin' fine
Cause I'm bout to lose my mind
And I don't know what I'll do, so

Real sad for me, too bad for you
That I'm so lonely and confused
I've gotta take it out on you
Cause you left me for some chick
Now I'm lovesick, baby

Saw myself on Rikki Lake
Overweight and full of hate
Cause some asshole left me in distress
I used to look down on all that mess
Seems like everything just changed
Once I gave my love to you, you went away
Since you are the one to blame
You better figure out how to get it back baby (Baby)
Real sad for me, too bad for you (Real sad for me too bad for you)
That I'm so lonely and confused (I'm so lonely and confused)
I've gotta take it out on you (Don't know what I might do)
Cause you left me for some chick
Now I'm lovesick, baby (heyyyy)

Before I met you I didn't think
A man can ever do a thing
To take away my independence, baby
Before I met you I was straight
Now I'm 'bout to go insane
So you better think about it, baby

Real sad for me, too bad for you (Real sad for me)
That I'm so lonely and confused (I'm so lonely, Gotta take it)
I've gotta take it out on you (Gotta take it out on you)
Cause you left me for some chick
Now I'm lovesick, baby (Baby)
Real sad for me, too bad for you (Don't know what I might do 2X)
(Real sad for me, yeah)
That I'm so lonely and confused (Don't know what I might do 2X)
(I'm so lonely and confused!)
I've gotta take it out on you (Gotta take it out on you)
Cause you left me for some chick
Now I'm lovesick, baby babyEmbed
