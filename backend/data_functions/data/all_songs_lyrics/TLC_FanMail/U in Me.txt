U in Me Lyrics
U in me feels twice as nice
And everything we do is right
It's nasty love, but that's all right with me
Once a month is not enough
I think about it every week
There's other guys
But that's not U in me

(I can't understand why it feels so good)
I never felt this way before
I want you more and more each day
(Even if there's someone else)
I might as well take care of myself
I'm never satisfied like U in me

You're so damn special, baby, yeah
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
You're so damn special
Don't wanna give mine up, cuz I like U in me

U in me became unreal
I never hesitate to see
I need it now and that's how it should be
U in me was somethin' else
Started messin' with my mind
Cuz there will never be me in U, hey, hey
(I can't understand why it feels so good)
I never felt this way before
I want you more and more each day
(Even if there's someone else)
I might as well take care of myself
I'm never satisfied like U in me

You're so damn special, special, hey, hey, hey, yeah
I could have anybody but that's not U in me (No!)
You're so damn special (Yeah)
Don't wanna give mine up, cuz I like U in me
You're so damn special
You know, you know, you know baby yeah
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
You're so damn special (Can't understand the way I feel)
Don't wanna give mine up, cause I like U in me
You're so damn special baby
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special, hey, hey, hey yeah
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me
So damn special, hey oh oh
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special, hey yeah, hey yeah
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me
So damn special, baby
So damn special
I could have anybody but that's not U in me
So damn special, baby hey
Don't wanna give mine up cause I like U in me1Embed
