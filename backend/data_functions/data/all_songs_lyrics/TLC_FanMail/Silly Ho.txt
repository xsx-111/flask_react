Silly Ho Lyrics
Whoot whoot whoot whoooo
Whoot whoot whoot whoooo
Whoot whoot whoot whoooo
Whoot whoot whoot whoooo

I ain't never been no Silly Ho (Ho)
Waitin' for your call
Like the other girls want you
I ain't never been the one to mess (Mess)
With someone else's mess
That's not a thing for me to do
I ain't never been that chickenhead (Head)
To wake up in your bed
After every club or two
Gonna be the one to make me skurt (Skurt)
Always wanna flirt
With every player on the team

So if you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooh ooh
I ain't never been no silly bitch (Bitch)
Waiting to get rich (Rich)
From a nigga bank account
I have always had my own things (Things)
Bought my own rings (Rings)
Not gon' let you catch me out
You should take a lesson from me (Me)
I ain't the one to be (Be)
Depending on someone else
I can run a scam before he can (Can)
I am better than a man (Man)
I always keep my game on deck

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
So if you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooh ooh
If you really wanna find (Whoot whoot)
Someone to get some behind (Whoot whooo)
I ain't the one for you (Whoot whoot whoot whooo)

Boy, you need a silly ho (Whoot whooo)
To do whatever you wanna do (Whoot whoot whoot whooo)

Someone to get some behind (Whoot whooo)

And if you really wanna know (Whoot whoot)
Boy, you need a silly ho (Whoot whooo)
To do whatever you wanna do, ooh ooh
(Whoot whoot whoot whooo)
You know you can't get with this (Whoot whoot)
One night you just (Whoot whooo)
Go and bust, find a ho to get it up (Whoot whoot whoot whooo)
Why you even try your luck? (Whoot whoot)
Stuck on silly shit (Whoot whooo)
Boy, you know you need to quit (Whoot whoot)
Ain't the one for all this (Whoot whooo)
You missed out

I'm-I'm-I'm-out (Whoot whoot whoot whooo)
I'm-out-I'm-out, out-out (Whoot whoot whoot whooo)
I'm-I'm-I'm-out-out (Whoot whoot whoot whooo)
I'm-I'm-out (Whoot whoot)
I'm-out-out-out (Whoot whooo)

If you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind (I know that you know, that)
I ain't the one for you
If you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do
So if you really wanna find
Someone to get some behind
I ain't the one for you
And if you really wanna know
Boy, you need a silly ho
To do whatever you wanna do, ooh ooh
