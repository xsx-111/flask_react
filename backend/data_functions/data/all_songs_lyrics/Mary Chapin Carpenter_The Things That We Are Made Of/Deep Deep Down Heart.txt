Deep Deep Down Heart Lyrics
How do you know what you know
Because you've seen it with your eyes
How do you know where to go
How to identify your guides
How do you see what was next
In your palm or a show of cards
How do you learn to detect
The outlines of a scar
Now the sky holds the night
As the trees hold the shade
And the road holds the map
Of every journey I've made
And the clouds hold the sigh
Of the wind and the rain
In my deep, deep down heart
My deep, deep down heart
[Verse 2
Now these wheels go so fast
There is nothing here to hold
I keep pushing back the past
So that the future can unfold
I guess the best of my mistakes
Show me all that I don't know
But this strange kind of ache
Never seems to let me go
And the sky holds the night
And the trees hold the shade
And the stars hold the light
That's travelled all this way
But who holds my hand
So I am not afraid
In my deep, deep down heart
My deep, deep down heart
I thought I heard my name
Walking late tonight
From the porch after the rain
In this rowing down the light
There was no one standing there
Beyond the lantern's cast
But just voices in the air
But just questions that ask
How the sky holds the night
How the trees hold the shade
How your sleep holds your dreams
Till they shake you awake
And how love holds you up
And then to chooses to break
Your deep, deep down heart
Your deep, deep down heartEmbed
