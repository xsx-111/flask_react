Note on a Windshield Lyrics
I circled twice then pulled in by the shopping carts
In a cold steady rain coming down in the parking lot
I saw him leave his truck running and duck into the store
I just sat there thinking I'd seen him before
There was something so familiar about him
In the eyes of someone who hasn't forgotten
The shape of a chance as it catches the light
In the millions of raindrops falling that night
So I dug in my bag for a pen and some paper
Found an envelope, tore it in half
I wrote down some words with my name and my number
And then I took a big breath
There's nothing holding us down
I'm not made of stone or of steel
I slipped it beneath the wiper blades
Just a note on a windshield
When you find yourself out of things to believe in
Apart and adrift, no point and no reason
Is there nothing to fear because there's nothing to lose
If it were a choice which one would you choose
There's time you can trust and time that you question
Time you ignore and time you don't mention
Time that you wish you could get back somehow
When see you how fast it's flying by now
There's nothing holding us down
I'm not made of stone or of steel
Will the wind blow you away
Like a note on a windshield
There's nothing holding us down
And no words for the way that you feel
You just watch the rain pour
On a note on a windshield

Some days I still think I could be someone else
Those are the days I feel lost to myself
Mistaking a stranger, misplacing a heart
How to put back together what's been taken apart
I didn't want to leave but I didn't want to linger
Fatalist, optimist, magical thinker
You only hold on until you let go
Turning the key, I pulled away slow

There's nothing holding us down
As my hands were turning the wheel
The rain washed words away
From a note on a windshield
There's nothing holding us down
When there's nothing left to reveal
We are light, we are weightless and brave
Like a note on a windshieldEmbed
