The Things That We Are Made Of Lyrics
I remember driving down the rutted roads late at night
Following the summer moon bright as any pair of headlights
I felt the air on my face
And the night pressed inside my palm
A moment captured in a place
This memory stays strong

Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
The things that we are made of

And I remember feeling I’m alive and in no need of saviors
If the past’s another country I’m at the border with my papers
Where is your heart if not inside you
Where is home or are you lost
Where is love if not beside you
I had no answers but they let me cross

Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
The things that we are made of
Like the silence of my shadow when the twilight world is calling
The loneliness that knows me by the cadence of my walking
And the scar upon my elbow and the sound of my own breathing
My reflection in a window and the way I’m always leaving

And I remember wishing for some other life than this one I’ve claimed
How often have I been convinced how eagerly I’d make that trade
Then all at once I see your face
And the summer night and the open door
Dimmer now but not erased
And I know what these are for

Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
Oh my darling oh my love
The things that we are made ofEmbed
