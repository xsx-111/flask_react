Livingston Lyrics
Change of clothes was all I carried
There were three of us to do the driving
The sky turned black outside of Laramie
And the rain poured down all over Wyoming
It took two long days and four full tanks of gas
To get to Livingston

In between the silences and the feeling grateful
I had so much time for remembering
Late nights around some ones table
Something deeper about those gatherings
More than once I've been far far away
And thinking bout Livingston

On the way back home I would stop awhile
Ease this truck onto the shoulder of the road
It’s a long straight line
That goes for miles and miles
It’s as lonely as a great plains Conoco

I came to say good bye, and to hug you
But I wasn’t brave enough to say that
So I said see you soon and I love you
And I think you understood me from way back
From the very first time we ever sang our songs
Late one night in Livingston
On the way back home I would stop awhile
Ease this truck onto the shoulder of the road
It’s a long straight line
That goes for miles and miles
It’s as empty as a great plains Conoco

I see you standing tall and kinda squinting
In a field outside of White Sulphur Springs
Don’t need a cowboy hat just a 33 Gibson
And a little more time to make it rain
As the sun turns red
And the sky treasure-gold
On the long way back to LivingstonEmbed
