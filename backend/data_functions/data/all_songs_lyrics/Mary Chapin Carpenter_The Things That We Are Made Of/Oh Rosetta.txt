Oh Rosetta Lyrics
I'm telling you these things that I tell no one else
When I'm all alone
When I'm by myself
And I believe you hear me though I have no proof
It's what I feel inside
That's telling me the truth
If I listen and I cannot hear the music
If I try to swim the ocean and cannot reach the shore
If the world is offered love but doesn't use it
Oh Rosetta, what's it for?

May I call you sister when we talk this way?
You make me feel as if there's nothing I can't say
I know I'm not the first one you've brought comfort to
And I'm not the last that will look to you
If I wander and I cannot find the reason
If I keep my heart wide open and cannot feel the sun
And I'm not sure anymore what I believe in
Oh Rosetta, am I the only one?

One day I am walking down a lonely street
New York City's cold, there is no one to meet
And at the corner of 57th and 7th Avenue
I hear someone sing and I know it's you
If I'm still and I cannot hear the choirs
If I try to please the many instead of just the very few
Can you hear me through invisible wires?
Oh Rosetta, what should I do?
If I listen and I cannot hear the music
If I swim against the current and lose sight of the shore
If the world is offered goodness but doesn't use it
Oh Rosetta, what's it for?Embed
