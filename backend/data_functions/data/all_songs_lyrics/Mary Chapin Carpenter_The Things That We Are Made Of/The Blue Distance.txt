The Blue Distance Lyrics
Across the railroad tracks, down the gravel road
Headlights throw a beam on the way back home
Lie down, lie down, listen wide awake
To the trains that roll, to the sound time makes
It passes through the air like a summer storm
Catching on my sleeve like a rose's thorn
Sometimes it whispers, sometimes it roars
Flies like the wind, waits by the door

And I know you know and that's all I need
When the light of day looks like night to me
When you're far away and I'm all alone
I can't explain, I know you know

It fills up my chest, it fills up my eyes
Like an old glass jar filled with fireflies
Sometimes I'm still, sometimes I sigh
Sometimes I'm lost and I don't know why

But I know you know and that's all I need
When the light of day looks like night to me
When you're far away and I'm all alone
I can't explain, I know you know
In the morning light, before the heat sets in
Call the dogs to run where the shade has been
Across the railroad tracks lay your silver down
Find it smooth and flat, stars for your crown
In the blue distance where our lives unfurl
At the edges of the sky, the beauty of the world

I know you know and that's all I need
When the light of day looks like night to me
When we're far away and we're all alone
I can't explain, I know you knowEmbed
