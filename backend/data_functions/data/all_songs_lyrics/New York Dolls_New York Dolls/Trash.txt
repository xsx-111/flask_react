Trash Lyrics
Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take your life away
Trash, won't pick it up, don't try to take my knife away

And please don't you ask me if I love you
If you don't know what I'm doing
What you know is

Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away (Ooh)
Trash, go pick it up, don't throw your love away (Ooh)
Trash, go pick it up, don't try to take my knife away (Ooh, ooh-oh)

And please don't you ask me if I love you (Ooh-oh)
'Cause I don't know what I do
What I know is

Trash, won't pick it up, take them lights away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take my knife away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, forgot to take them all away (Ooh, ooh-oh)

And please don't you ask me if I love you
'Cause I don't know if I do
I want to wipe it out here with you (Ooh)
And take a lover's leap with you
I'm gonna talk alone with you
I'm gonna talk and be with you
But I just don't know if I do
I just don't know if I do
Ah, how do you call your lover-boy?

Trash, pick it up, take them lights away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, won't put that knife away (Ooh)
Trash, pick it up, don't take your life away (Ooh)
Trash, won't get it up, don't throw your love away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take my knife away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, try take them all away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take my knife away (Ooh)

Oh, trash, woah, woah, my sweet baby, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, trash, woah, wpah, baby you're the one (Ooh)

Trash, pick it up, take them lights away (Ooh)
Trash, won't pick it up, don't take my knife away (Ooh)
(Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash)
Trash, won't pick it up, don't them lights away away (Ooh)
(Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash)
Trash, won't get it up, don't take my knife away (Ooh)
(Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash)
Oh, trash, don't kick my knife away
Oh, trash, don't kick my night away
Oh, trash, don't kick my night away
Oh, trash1Embed
