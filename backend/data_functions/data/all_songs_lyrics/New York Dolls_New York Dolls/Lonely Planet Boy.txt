Lonely Planet Boy Lyrics
Huh
Oh, it's hard
It's so hard

And it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from from the other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', baby, for your love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, you pick me up
You're out a-drivin' in your car
When I tell you where I'm goin'
You're always tellin' me it's too far

But how could you be drivin'
Down by my home
When y'know, I ain't got one
And I'm, I'm so all alone
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', I'm cryin', baby, for your love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh, it's so lonely
Oh, oh


Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Oh, can't you hear me callin'
I'm a thousand miles away
And I don't wanna stay
I'm thinkin' words I gotta say

'Cause I wanna be there witcha
And I know what to bring
I remember from the days
You got over everything
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

Oh, it's a lonely planet joy
When the song from your other boys
That's when I'm a lonely planet boy
And I'm tryin', I'm cryin'
Can't y'see I'm dyin'
Baby, for your love
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah
Now you are lonely3Embed
