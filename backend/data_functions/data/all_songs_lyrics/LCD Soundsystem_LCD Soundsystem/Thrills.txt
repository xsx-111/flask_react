Thrills LyricsI'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me
But my desire
Is going to crush me
'Cause you are wired
But I'm all chills
'Cause you adore me
You adore me
But I'm still all kills
I need my thrills
I need my thrills
I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me
But my desire
Is going to level me
'Cause you're alive
But I'm all chills
'Cause you've been loose-knit
You've been loose-knit
But I'm still all kills
I need my thrills
I need my thrills
I'm on fire
Because you want me
Because you want me
But all of my desire
Is going to crush me
When you expire
But I'm still all kills
But you want me
Because you want me
But I'm still all kills
When its all pills
I need my thrills
Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up
Next to you
Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up
Next to you
Thrills, thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up
Next to you
Thrills, thrills
Don't you make me wanna wake up
