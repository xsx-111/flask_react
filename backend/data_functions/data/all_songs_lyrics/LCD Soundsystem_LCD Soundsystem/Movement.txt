Movement Lyrics
It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all of the culture

Oh but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a T-shirt
Doing all the singing
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the T-Shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n
Doing all the blame

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all of the culture
Oh but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a T-shirt
Doing all the saying
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in

We're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
We have the fat guy in a T-Shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n
Doing all the blame
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

It's like the culture
Without the effort or all of the luggage
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a culture
Without the culture of all of the culture

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped

Here's the changeEmbed
