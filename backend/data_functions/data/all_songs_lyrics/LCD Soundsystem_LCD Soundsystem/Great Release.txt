Great Release LyricsAnd it feels like it won't come off
And it tastes like you're full of love
Still the time never to pay off
Still the time never to pay off
And it feels like I'm coming home
And it's smells like I'm learning now
And it feels like it's coming on
And it feels like it's full of cum
Still in time is the great release
Someday dying will be a great release
