On Repeat LyricsA beat's on repeat, beating on me
From every car in the street
It's a constant repeat, on repeat
Of your paranoid heartbreaking beats
On repeat
It's a five song repeat beating on me
Your favorite band helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street
On repeat
On repeat
On repeat
Don't tell nobody what, what you really want because
They can tell everybody else what you really want
Then you're fucked, so act like it's for yourself or it's all yours
And they go and tell everybody else that you're really great
We are just people
You're enfranchised and entranced
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours!
Real life's a compromise
But your beats are half-assed, streak is beating on me
Well, I'm drinking, the weak is helping me sleep
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would run the streets
And come to every show, no one wants that
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools
And come to every show, drugged and unwashed
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets
And come to every show unwashed and drugged and
Beats are on repeat, beating on me
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
Beats are on repeat, beating on me
Beats on repeat, beating on meEmbed
