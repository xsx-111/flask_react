Tired LyricsI don't need no waking up
Well I don't need no waking up
I don't need no waking up
'Cause I'm tired
I don't need no waking up
Yeah I don't need no waking up
I don't need no waking up
'Cause I'm tired
I don't need no waking up
I don't need no waking up
I don't need no waking up
 I'm tired
Don't wake me, I'm tired
 I'm tired

I don't need no waking up
I don't need no waking up
I don't need no waking up
 I'm tired
Don't wake me up, I'm tired
 I'm tired
Too much baby
I'm 
I don't need no waking up
Because I'm tired
I'm tired
Yeah I'm tired
Yeah don't, don't 1Embed
