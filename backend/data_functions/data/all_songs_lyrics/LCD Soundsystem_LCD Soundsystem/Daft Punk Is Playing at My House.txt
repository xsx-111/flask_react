Daft Punk Is Playing at My House Lyrics
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I waited 7 years and 15 days
There's every kid for miles at my house, my house
And the neighbors can't call the police
There's a fist fight brewin' at my house, my house
Because the jocks can't get in the door
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

Well, everybody's lined up in my house, my house
And Sarah's girlfriend is working the door
Got everybody's PA in my house, my house
All the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house
In the basement
'Cause Daft Punk is playing in my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

And never, never let them go
No never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let 'em go
Never, never, never let them go
Oh never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let them go
