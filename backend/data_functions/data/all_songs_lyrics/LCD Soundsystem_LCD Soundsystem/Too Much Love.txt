Too Much Love Lyrics
What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's no fun
What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run
When it's undone
And it's no one

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy
When you can't see
What you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring
Everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up
Keep it up
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's unfun
What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run
When it's undone
And it's no one

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much
What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy
When you can't see
What you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring
Everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up
Keep it up

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
With no memory
With no memory
With no memory
To keep you up at night
With no memory
With no memory
With no memory
To keep you up at nightEmbed
