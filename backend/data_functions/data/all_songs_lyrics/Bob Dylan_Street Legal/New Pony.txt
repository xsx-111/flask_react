New Pony Lyrics
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
She broke her leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her

Sometimes I wonder what’s going on with Miss X
Sometimes I wonder what’s going on with Miss X
She got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girl’s gonna do to me next

I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
She got great big hind legs
Long black shaggy hair hanging in her face


Everybody says you’re using’ voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh well, everybody says you’re using’ voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh, baby, that god you been prayin’ to
Gonna given you back what you’re wishing’ on someone else
Come over here pony, I-hi want to climb up on top on you, well
Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you
You’re oh so nasty and so bad
I swear I love you yes I doEmbed
