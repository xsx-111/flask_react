Pretty, Pretty Baby LyricsI saw a pretty gal by the Nickelodeon
I asked her for a dance and said let's have a little fun
Pretty baby (pretty, pretty baby)
Pretty baby (pretty, pretty baby)
Pretty baby, I never seen a gal like you
We waltzed across the floor, I said how long you been around?
I never knew a girl like you was living here in town
Pretty baby (pretty, pretty baby)
Pretty baby (pretty, pretty baby)
Pretty baby, I think I'm gonna fall for you
Yes, I looked into her eyes and said, a-baby you're for mе
She looked at me surprisеd and said, now we'll wait and see
You better realize I'm right it had to be
Oh, pretty pretty baby you're the only one for me
You were dancing through the night until the sun began to shine
I pulled my pretty baby up, she told me she was mine
Pretty baby (pretty, pretty baby)
Pretty baby (pretty, pretty baby)
Pretty baby... by the way, what's your name?Embed
