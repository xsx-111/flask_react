Unchained Melody Lyrics
Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

Time goes by, so slowly
Time can mean so much
Are you, still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love, to me

Time goes by, so slowly
And time can mean so much
Are you, still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
Godspeed your love, to meEmbed
