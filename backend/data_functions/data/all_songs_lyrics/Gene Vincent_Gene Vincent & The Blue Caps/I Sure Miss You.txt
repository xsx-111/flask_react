I Sure Miss You LyricsYou took away my lovely dreams
But I don't need those things at all
You took away the kisses that I love
You took away most everything
But I don't miss one single thing
But I, I sure miss you
I miss you every morning
I miss you every night
I miss you most of all when
I wanna be loved just right
You took away most everything
But I don't miss one single thing
But I, I sure miss you
Well-ell, I miss you every morning
Well-ell, I miss you every night
Well, I miss you most of all when
I wa, I wanna be loved just right
You took away most everything
But I don't miss one single thing
Well, I sure miss youEmbed
