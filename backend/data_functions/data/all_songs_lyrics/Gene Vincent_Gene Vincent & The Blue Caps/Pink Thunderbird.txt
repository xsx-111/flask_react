Pink Thunderbird LyricsI got a pink Thunderbird with a red fur seat
Well, a-baby it's mine
I got a new brick house with a two car port
Well, a-baby that's mine too
I got a bank account, well baby, filled with green
Well, a-baby it's all mine
There ain't nothing I got baby you don't need
Well, anything I got baby, you can have it
Anything I got baby, you can use
Anything I got baby, you can have it
If you'll only say; I do, I do, I do, I do
(Rock!)
I got a big white yacht at the edge of the lake
Well, a-baby that's mine
I got a million cows, lowing all the time
Well, a-baby they're mine too
I got a factory and an airplane too
Well, a-baby they're all mineEmbed
