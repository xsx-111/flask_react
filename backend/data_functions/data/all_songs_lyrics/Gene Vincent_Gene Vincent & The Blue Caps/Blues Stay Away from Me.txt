Blues Stay Away from Me LyricsBlues stay away from me;
Blues why don't you let me be
Don't know why you keep on haunting me?
Love was never meant for me;
True love was never meant for me
Seems somehow we never can agree
Life is full of misery;
Dreams are like a memory
Bringing back your love that used to be
Tears, so many I can't see;
Years don't mean a thing to me
Time goes by and still I can't be freeEmbed
