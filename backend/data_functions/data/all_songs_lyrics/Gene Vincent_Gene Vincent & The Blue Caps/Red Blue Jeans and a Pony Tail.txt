Red Blue Jeans and a Pony Tail LyricsGot a crazy little cat that works down town
Cuts an awful lot of capers when I come around
She's got the westbound Diesel with the evening mail
And a ooh-wee, red blue jeans and a pony tail
She can do more tricks to this heart of mine
Than ten little monkeys on a long grapevine
I know when she holds me, why I get so weak and pale
Ooh-wee, red blue jeans and a pony tail
(Rock!)
Yeah, she's got more rhythm than a ten piece band
She can rock 'n' roll to the clapping of your hand
I know why they watch hеr like a train does a rail
It's a ooh-wee, red bluе jeans and a pony tail
She can make cold chills run up 'n' down my spine
Make me feel warm in the wintertime
She packs a lot of wallop, can be so small and frail
It's ooh-wee, red blue jeans and a pony tail
(Rock again now!)Embed
