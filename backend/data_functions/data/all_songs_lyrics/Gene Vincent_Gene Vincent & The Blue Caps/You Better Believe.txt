You Better Believe LyricsThere's a right way of thinking
A wrong way too
I got one way of thinking
Honey that's about you
You better believe
What I'm saying to you
I don't want to goof
That's why I'm telling you the truth
Believe, believe
Believe, believe
Rock!
I find it hard to find a way
To win your heart
I know to try it harder
To play it smart
You better believe
What I'm saying to you
I'd give up my style
Just to see you smile
Believe, believe
Believe, believe
Rock!
You better believe
What I'm saying to you
'Cause if you turn me down
I'm afraid we're through
So give me a chance
Making more than a glance
Believe, believe
Believe, believe...Embed
