The Great Pagoda of Funn LyricsThe stars are bright tonight
The air is sweet
Though summer's over now
There's a strange new music in the street
You and I
Know the world can't be like this
It's our love that makes it shine
Girl
Whatever trouble waits outside these doors
We're safe inside this house of light
We make up our own storyline
Around the neighborhood
They stare and grin
As if they live their lives
Just to help maintain the state we're in
But when we fight
Then those hungry wolves close in
We're one thoughtless word away
From poison skies
And severed heads
And pain and lies
So follow me
I'll hold you tight
And we'll build a life together
In the great pagoda of funn
This magic soon will fade
Without a doubt
We'll have to work my love
Just to keep the flame from going out
Cause if we fail
Then these walls will fall away
And we'll find we're in the realm
Of psycho-moms
And dying stars
And dirty bombs
Please follow me
And hold me tight
Yes we'll build a world together
In the great pagoda of funnEmbed
