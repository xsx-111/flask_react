What I Do LyricsI say "Ray, why do girls treat you nice that way?"
He said it's not what I know, what I think or say
It's what I do
It's what I do
It's deep beneath the skin
It's what I major in
It's what I do
Yes, I come to play and I bring big soul
I could rock long before they named it
Rock and roll
It's what I do
It's what I do
I'm specially qualified
To keep 'em satisfied
It's what I do
You turn the lamp down low
You make them feel secure
You've got to show the girl
She's the one you adore
If you want that sugar to pour
Well, you bring some church
But you leave no doubt
As to what kind of love you love
To shout about
It's what I do
It's what I do
If you can't dance by now
The Raelettes will show you how
It's what I do
You turn the lamp down low
You make them feel secure
You've got to show the girl
She's the one you adore
If you want that sugar to pour
He says, "Don, don't despair, take some time
Just find your bad self, you're gonna do just fine"
It's what I do
It's what I do
It's not some game I play
It's in my DNA
It's what I do
It's what I do
(Just, just one thing)
It's what I do
(That's what I do)
It's deep beneath the skin
It's what I major in
It's what I do
(That's what I do)
It's what I do
(Just, just one thing)
It's what I do
(That's what I do)
I'm specially qualified
To keep 'em satisfied
It's what I do
(That's what I do)Embed
