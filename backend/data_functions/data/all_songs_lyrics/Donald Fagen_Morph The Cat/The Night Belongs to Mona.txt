The Night Belongs to Mona LyricsMona's become a child of the night
When she goes out
It's only for bare necessities
She says she's had it up to here with light
While the city sleeps
That's when she comes alive
Yes, the night belongs to Mona
When she's dancing all alone
Forty floors above the city
CD spinnin', AC hummin', feelin' pretty
Sometimes she'll call at some unholy hour
She wants to talk
All of this grim and funny stuff
Then she'll go all quiet in her Chelsea tower
And that's when we wait
To see how the story ends
'Cause the night belongs to Mona
When she's dancing all alone
Forty floors above the city
CD spinnin', AC hummin', feelin' pretty
Was it the fire downtown
That turned her world around
Was it some guy or lots of different things
We all wonder where she's gone
That sunny girl we used to know
Now every night we get the Mona show
Maybe it's good that she's above it all
Things don't seem as dark
When you're already dressed in black
We try not to see the writing on the wall
What happens tomorrow
When the moonrays get so bright
When she rises towards the starlight
Miles above the city's heat
Will she fall hard or float softly to the street
Tonight the night belongs to Mona
When she's dancing all alone
Forty floors above the city
CD spinnin', AC hummin', feelin' prettyEmbed
