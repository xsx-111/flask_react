Brite Nitegown Lyrics
I dreamed I had a fever
I was pushing 103
My mom's all upset, crying by my bedside
Everybody's praying for me
I hear a scratching at the window
I somehow twist myself around
I realize, I'm eyes to eyes
With the fella in the brite nitegown

Brite Nitegown
Brite Nitegown
You can't fight with the fella
In the brite nitegown

The eagle flies on Friday
My baby wants to bash
I hit the ATM and march down the street
With a roll of party cash
Right then a couple lit up brothers
They put me on the ground
They do the steal and leave me to deal
With the fella in the brite nitegown

*Instrumental break*

Ten milligrams of Chronax
Will whip you back through time
Past Hebrew kings and furry things
To the birth of humankind
I shared in all of nature's secrets
But when I finally came around
I'm sitting on the rug getting a victory hug
From the fella in the Brite Nitegown
Chorus (continuously sung until fade out)Embed
