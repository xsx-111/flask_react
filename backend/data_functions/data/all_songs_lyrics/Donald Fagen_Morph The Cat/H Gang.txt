H Gang LyricsI hear Denise is back on the outside
That she's got a wicked plan
She's callin' in the Gong sisters again
To form the ultimate five chord band
For eight months now in that freaking cell
She's been knockin' ideas around
Now she's good and ready to make a big noise
Right here in her own hometown
Here comes the H-Gang
Slammin' into Hinktown
Oh, you better get off the stage, boys
'Cause they'll be looking for a showdown
On a moonless night they started off
On a bus called Happy Day
To bring their vision to cities and towns
Across the U.S.A
And in every club and hall they played
The crowd knew every word
Even today folks are talkin' about
The incredible sounds they heard
Here comes the H-Gang
Turn on the floodlights
Get off the stage son
Unless you're ready for a kickfight
Whatever happened to the H-Gang
Some say they were the best
I heard they broke up, Denise got hitched
And she's living in the Midwest
There's a film that's in production
The working title, Song of Desire
'Bout an orphan girl with this crazy red hair
And a voice and a dream and a soul on fire
Here comes the H-Gang
Slammin' into Hinktown
Oh, you better get off the stage, boys
'Cause they'll be looking for a showdown
Here comes the H-Gang
Turn on the floodlights
Get off the stage son
Unless you're ready for a kickfight
Here comes the H-Gang
Slammin' into Hinktown
Oh, you better get off the stage, boys
Unless you're looking for a showdown1Embed
