Ugly in the Morning LyricsYou did one thing wrong
You woke up
It looked better before
More! More!
And the stomach turns...
Say nothing without wasting a word
I know exactly what you meant
I know how piggy feels
He starves without missing a meal
Look in the mirror...
Don't look at me
I'm ugly in the morning!
When the headache is gone
The sun is not
Forgot to turn the alarm
On! On!
Doesn't matter how much you think
Or the number of hairs in the sink
I did it to myself again
I know how piggy feels
He starves without missing a meal
It's getting clearer...
Don't look at me
I'm ugly in the morning!Embed
