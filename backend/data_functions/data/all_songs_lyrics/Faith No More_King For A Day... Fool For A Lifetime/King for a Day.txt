King for a Day Lyrics
It is not a good day, if you are not looking good
This is the best party that I've ever been to
Today I asked for a god to pour some wine in my eyes
Today I asked for someone to shake some salt on my life

Look, everything's spinning
(We're on the ground)
Never cheer before you know who's winning
(Don't make a sound)

You sniff the glass and let it roll around on your tongue
Let me introduce you to someone before the party is done
Someone to look to in need or in want or in war
If you give him everything, he may give you even more

Look, everything's spinning
(We're on the ground)
Never cheer before you know who's winning
(Don't make a sound)

Look, everything's spinning, we're on the ground
Never cheer before you know who's winning
Don't make a sound, don't make a sound
Everything's spinning, we're on the ground
Everything's spinning, we're on the ground
This is the best party I've been to
This is the best party I've been to
This is the best party I've been to
This is the best party I've been to
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes1Embed
