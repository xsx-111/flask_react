The Last to Know LyricsWhere it grows on trees, but never
Never blooms
Where it hurts the least for whoever
Saw it first
First to go and the last to know
Lasts longer than a lifetime
Takes the least amount of effort
Feels better than a bargain
Just to know it's there
First to go and the last to know
Can't you see
There's only one me
And that me is me
I know where but I cannot share
You'll call me, I'll stand in line till then
I'll be waiting
(Why) Can't you see
All circuits are busy
