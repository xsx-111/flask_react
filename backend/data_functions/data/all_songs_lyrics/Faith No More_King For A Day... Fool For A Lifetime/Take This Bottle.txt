Take This Bottle LyricsI can wait to love in heaven
I can wait for you
Far away, I'll treat you better
Better than down here
Because I done wrong
And I'm a little afraid
I ain't too strong
And this ain't easy to say
Take this bottle
Take this bottle
And just walk away - the both of you
And let me feel the pain - I've done to you
I can hope we'll be together
With a better roof over our heads
I can hope the stormy weather
It passes on - it passes on
But I've hoped too long
Hoped for me to change
And that hope is gone
So listen to what I say
Take this bottle
Take this bottle
And just walk away - the both of you
And let me feel the pain - I've done to you
I can wait to love in heaven
I can wait for you
Take this bottle
And just walk away
Take this bottle
And just walk away
Take this bottle (You got to take it away)
Take this bottle (You got to take it away)
And just walk away - the both of you
And let me feel the pain - I've done to you
I can wait to love in heaven (You got to take it away)
I can wait for you (You got to take it away)
Take this bottle - And just walk awayEmbed
