Star A.D. LyricsStar A.D
See tomorrow dreaming
You don't need your freedom
Star A.D
A little joke that's understood
It's all over the world
A little joke that's understood
It's all over and over and over and over
And dying is dry
Like a fact of history
And when you die, you'll become something worse than dead
You'll become...
A legend
We are forever1Embed
