Caralho Voador Lyrics
They all know me by my car
They all know I'm gone, but not how far
I'm heading straight down 101
I'm going to go and get me some

My lips are moving but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
Gonna get run down

Eu n√£o posso dirigir
E agora aparece
Meu dedo enterrado
No meu nariz

My lips are moving but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
My lips are moving but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
Gonna get run down

My lips are moving but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
My lips are moving but there's no sound
Someday somebody's gonna get run down
Gonna get run downEmbed
