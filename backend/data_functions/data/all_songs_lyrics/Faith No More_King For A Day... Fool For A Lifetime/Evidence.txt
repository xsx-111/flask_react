Evidence Lyrics
If you want to open the hole
Just put your head down and go
And step beside the piece of the circumstance
You got to wash away the taste of evidence

Wash it away
Evidence, evidence, evidence
Got to taste evidence

I didn't feel a thing
It didn't mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify
Didn't feel a thing

Anything you say and we know you're guilty
Hands above your head and you won't even feel me
You won't feel me

Wash it away
Evidence, evidence, evidence
Got to taste evidence
