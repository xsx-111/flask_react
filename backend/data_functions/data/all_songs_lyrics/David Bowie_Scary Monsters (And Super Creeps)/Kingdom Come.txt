Kingdom Come Lyrics
Well, I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"
The voice of doom was shining in my room
I just need one day somewhere far away
Oh Lord, I just need one day

Well, I've been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?

Well, the river's so muddy, but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just a slave of a burning ray
Oh, give me the night, I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

Been breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes, I've been breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay?
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high
Up in the tower they're watching me, hoping I'm going to die

(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
I said I won't be breaking no rocks
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh
Who will pardon me?
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks)

When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes
(When the kingdom comes)
(When the kingdom comes)
When the kingdom comes1Embed
