Jump LyricsWas it you that didn't need me like this sneakin' around with the lights down low
It feels so good I hope it doesn't fade away
But if they catch us here together this way you know we better think quick
'Cause you bet your last buck they'll be first to get the last lick
When I say "jump", you better jump (jump, jump)
When I say "walk", you better get ready to say "goodbye" (goodbye, goodbye)
Now you can't always get what you want when you want it, so you settle for second best
You need it so bad, don't matter what price you pay
When you're living on the line taking chances like this one slip could do the trick
'Cause you bet your last buck they'll be first to get the last lick
When I say "jump", you better jump (jump, jump)
When I say "walk", you better get ready to say "goodbye" (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
And when I look at you now, some how it don't seem right
But it feels so good tonight
When I say "jump", you better jump (jump, jump)
When I say "walk", well you better get ready to say "goodbye"
Jump... when I say "jump"
When I say "walk", you better get ready to say "goodbye" (goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)Embed
