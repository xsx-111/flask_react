Working for the Weekend (demo) LyricsEveryone's watching to see what you will do
Everyone's looking at you, oh
Everyone's wondering will you come out tonight
Everyone's trying to get it right, get it right
Everybody's working for the weekend
Everybody wants a new romance
Everybody's going off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance, oh
You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You want to be in the show?
C'mon baby, let's go
Everyone's looking to see if it was you
Everyone wants you to come through
Everyone's hoping it'll all work out
Everyone's waiting they're holding out
Everybody's working for the weekend
Everybody wants a new romance, hey yeah
Everybody's going off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance, oh
You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You want to be in the show?
C'mon baby, let's go
Hey!
You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You want to be in the show?
C'mon baby, let's go
You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You want to be in the show?
C'mon baby, let's goEmbed
