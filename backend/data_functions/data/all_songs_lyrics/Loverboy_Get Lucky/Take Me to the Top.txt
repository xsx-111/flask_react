Take Me to the Top LyricsHere's lookin' at you
What do you think the chances are we're gonna make it together?
Here's callin' your name
'Cause I have to do the things I have to do
What's a poor boy to do
When he's fallen in love with you
Help me make it through the night
Everything's gonna be all right
Yeah
Come to me deep in the night
Look at you, I feel alright
Crazy little things you do
Make me wanna be with you tonight
Oh
What's a poor boy to do
When he's fallen in love with you
Help me make it through the night
Everything's gonna be all right
You take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Yes, you take me
Take me to the
Take me to the
Take me to the top
Just give me your hand, hold it out
Close your eyes, move up close to me
Just talk to me in the tone of voice
You really don't leave me any choice, you see
What's a poor boy to do
When he's fallen in love with you
Help me make it through the night
Everything's gonna be all right
You take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Yes, you take me
Take me to the
Take me to the
Take me to the top
Oh, oh
Just let me lay my hands on you
That's the thing I wanna do
Wanna spend some time alone
Give me a chance and I'll take you home
Oh
What's a poor boy to do
When he's fallen in love with you
Help me make it through the night
Everything's gonna be all right
You take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the top
Take me to the
Take me to the
You take me to the top
