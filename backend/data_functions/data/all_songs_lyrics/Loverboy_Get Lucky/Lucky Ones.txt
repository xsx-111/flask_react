Lucky Ones LyricsDon't ask me how
But guess who hit the big time?
Don't look now
But guess who's back in town?
It's so easy don't even have to try
You're the winner you can take the prize
It's a dream come true
Which one will it be?
It's a dream come true
We'll just wait and see
Only the lucky ones
Get to steal the show
Only the lucky ones
Really get to know
Only the lucky
Only the lucky ones
Get lucky
Same old story
Somethings never change
With a beautiful girl
Everything's pre-arranged
Your whole life, it comes to you for free
You wear it well, it comes so naturally
It's a dream come true
Which one will it be?
It's a dream come true
We'll just wait and see
Only the lucky ones
Get to steal the show
Only the lucky ones
Really get to know
Only the lucky
Only the lucky ones
(Solo)
Don't ask me how
But guess who hit the big time?
Don't look now
But guess who's back in town?
It comes so easy don't even have to try
You're the winner you can take the prize
Lucky ones
Only the lucky ones
Really get to know
Only the lucky
Only the lucky onesEmbed
