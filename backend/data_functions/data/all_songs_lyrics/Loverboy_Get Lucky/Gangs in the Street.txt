Gangs in the Street LyricsPut your hands in the air
You better take care
Your money or your life
Don't think twice
Gonna get what they need
It ain't nothing but greed
Better watch what you do
Or you'll know that your through
What would you do
If they were looking at you
What would you say
If they were walking your way
Looks like theres gonna be a showdown
You better not slow down
Better watch what you say (yeah)
'Cuz you know they're not playin'
Don't you look over there
You better not stare
Get down on your knees
You beggin' them please
(ohh)
(chorus)
Gangs in the street
Lookin for you
Looking for me
Gangs in the street
Ready for you
And they're ready for me
(chorus x2)
Put your hands in the air
You better take care
Your money or your life
Don't think twice
Better watch what you say
Or you know that you'll pay
Better watch what you do
Or you know that your through
Gangs in the street
Looking for you
Gangs in the street
Looking for me
Gangs in the street
Hey, you looking for me
Gangs in the street
We're gonna seeEmbed
