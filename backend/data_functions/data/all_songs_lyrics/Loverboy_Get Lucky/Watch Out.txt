Watch Out LyricsThere's a new love in your life, I see it in your smile
There's a new love in your life, I've known it for awhile
CHORUS:
You should have told me from the start
But oh no, you had to leave me in the dark
And now you better watch out
So now better watch out
You better watch out for me, yeah
Now there's a new love in my life
Two can play that game
There'e s a new love in my life
Now you got the same
OOOOOHHHHHH
I'm saying ooohwoaooooo, you better watch out
Woaoooooo, woaoooooo, you better watch out now
You should have told me from the start
But oh no, you had to leave me in the dark
And now you better watch out
So now better watch out
You better watch out for me, yeah
You should have told me from the start
But oh no, you had to leave me in the dark
And now you better watch out
So now better watch out
You better watch out for me, yeah
Now look around baby
You better watch out for me
I'm gonna drive you crazy
You better watch out for me
Cause two can play that game
You better watch out for me
And I'll be doing the sameEmbed
