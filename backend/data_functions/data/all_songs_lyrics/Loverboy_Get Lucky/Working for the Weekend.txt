Working for the Weekend Lyrics
Everyone's watchin' to see what you will do
Everyone's lookin' at you, oh
Everyone's wonderin', will you come out tonight?
Everyone's tryin' to get it right
Get it right

Everybody's workin' for the weekend
Everybody wants a new romance
Everybody's goin' off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance
Oh

You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show?
Come on, baby, let's go

Everyone's lookin' to see if it was you
Everyone wants you to come through
Everyone's hopin' it'll all work out
Everyone's waitin', they're holdin' out
Everybody's workin' for the weekend
Everybody wants a new romance (Hey hey, hey hey)
Everybody's goin' off the deep end
Everybody needs a second chance
Oh

You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show?
Come on, baby, let's go
Hey

You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show?
Come on, baby, let's go

You want a piece of my heart?
You better start from the start
You wanna be in the show?
Come on, baby, let's go3Embed
