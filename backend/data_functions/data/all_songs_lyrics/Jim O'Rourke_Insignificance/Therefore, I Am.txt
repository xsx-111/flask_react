Therefore, I Am Lyrics
Me, I'm getting better everyday
That's what I said, don't believe what you've heard
It's not like I want to be king
But I can't help myself, it's just that I am

Sorry, but I found someone new to spend time
Instead on you, I spend it with me
You see, I've travelled round the world, oh yeah
I've seen so many things, why am I talking to you?

Why do you hide behind somebody else
There's one too many in this room and I think it's you

As you can see, I'm a happy guy
Don't need nothin' to get me down, 'cause I'll always have you
We are on a sinking ship
But I'd like to stay on board and shoot the cannons at you

Why do you hide behind somebody else
There's one too many in this room and I think it's youEmbed
