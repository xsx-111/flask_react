Get a Room Lyrics
It's always me in the only seat
That has a canopy
There to screw up the best laid plans
Of those with company
Don't mind me, I've got all night

I'd like nothing more to do
Than to watch the desperation on your face
I may choose to send you straight to Hell
Like it's worse to end up in this place

If I gave you, one night to live
Would you know who to choose to take home
And if she falls asleep before the night is through
Because she has to go to work and you don't

And the night's getting longer
And your skin's getting colder
And you won't get much older

And you try to move towards her
But you can't move your shoulder
And your sight's getting dimmer
Maybe if you kick her
But your leg's getting weaker
And she's such a deep sleeper
And you would get a snorer
To share your last hour
You sure picked a winner
And time's seeming slower
And now you can't see her
All you see is a timer
Moving backwards and forwards
And the night's getting longer
And your skin's getting colder
Maybe if you kick her
But your leg's getting weaker
And she's such a deep sleeper
And you would get a snorer
To share your last hour
You sure picked a winner
And time's seeming slower
And now you can't see her
All you see is a timer
Moving backwards and forwards
And the night's getting longer
And your skin's getting colderEmbed
