Memory Lame Lyrics
It's quite a gamble to speak out of place
Those things could kill you but so could your face
What occupies me pays a low rent
Because fondness makes the heart grow absent
These things I say might seem kinda cruel
So here's something from my heart to you
Looking at you reminds me of looking at the sun
And how the blind are so damn lucky

Those holes on your face could be used better ways
Breathing's a distraction when you chatter away
These things I say might seem to be lies
To seem risqu√©, or sensationalized
And too many people can remember your name
Always walking you down memory lame
These things I say, may seem to offend
But not half as much as I'd like to intend
Cause listening to you reminds me of a motor's endless drone
And how the deaf are so damn lucky

I'd be happy if life came to a stall
Then I wouldn't need my senses at all
These things I say might seem out of line
But day to day, I'm right every time
Looking at you reminds me of looking at the sun
Too long
You'll find
That in no time
You'll be talking to yourself
Along with everybody else
Then you'll despise
The look in their eyes
It may be difficult to tell
If you're looking at yourself
And you look fine
If you don't mind
That empty look that's on your face
A black hole that's out of place
And out of time
In a tight bind
To find something smart to say
When a silence comes your wayEmbed
