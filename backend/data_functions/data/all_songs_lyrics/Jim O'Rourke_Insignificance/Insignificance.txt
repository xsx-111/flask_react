Insignificance Lyrics
I'm still waiting for a sign
That describes how it's all gonna end
And arrives at a time
When it seems to have failed me
Failed, once again
Like a friend, who needs you
Like a house needs a floor
To know when it's been walked on
To know how it feels
To wait, to be lived in

Everything that you felt
Was someone else
Everything that you felt
Was someone else giving you something

It would be easy to stay this way
If it weren't for this problem
That I see underneath
Beneath my complaining
Like a wheel that needs oil
Like a plant that needs reminding
That it's nothing without soil
Even though, then it's stuck there
Like a crumb in bread
Like the seeds in an apple
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)
Everything that you felt (It's never too late to start to regret)
Was someone else giving you something
(Every step you've taken, every word you've said)Embed
