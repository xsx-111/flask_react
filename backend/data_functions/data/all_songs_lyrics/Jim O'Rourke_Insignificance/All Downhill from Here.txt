All Downhill from Here Lyrics
Don't believe a word I say
And I doubt you would anyway
I may be insincere
But it's all downhill from here

If I seem to you just a little bit remote
You'll feel better if you call me a misanthrope
Or whatever floats your boat
But as for me, I'd rather sink my own

Even though I'm here, you should feel all alone
Maybe the point of this you've just outgrown
There are names for me that are better known
Just draw a line and I'll add my own

Woo-woo
Woo-woo
