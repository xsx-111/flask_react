Mother And Child Lyrics
Shadows form knights and pawns upon the squares
Blood is drawn up from the well
Secret signs brought the crime right to your door
An innocent guilty as hell

Oh, the cot is open wide
Damp with milk and honey
Gone the mother and the child
In Jesus name


Oh, the cot is open wide
Damp with milk and honey
Gone the mother and the child
In Jesus name

Should they be waiting there on my return
I may run into their arms
Walking on a razor's edge, unconcerned
Game is lost again, I'll never learnEmbed
