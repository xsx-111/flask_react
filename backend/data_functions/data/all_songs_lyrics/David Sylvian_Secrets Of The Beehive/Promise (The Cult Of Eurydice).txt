Promise (The Cult Of Eurydice) Lyrics
The silence of the park, the moonshine after dark
Came to keep her company
The tiny golden cross lay upon her throat
Hands clutching tight her rosary
The rain upon her lips, eyes opened with a kiss
Just too late for us to see
She sits upon the ground
Face covered by a shroud of midnight canopy

And when the lightning starts
The secrets in her heart
Merge within the rain patterns
And when the shadows fall
The promise of it all
Is lost inside the tears that linger on

All the things we'd hoped would always keep us close
Stand between us now, as fences
The letters that we wrote have all gone up in smoke
And now you're just too far to listen in

When all but hope is lost
You believe at any cost
In things that make the living lighter
And when the shadows fall
The promise of it all
Is lying in the bed besider herEmbed
