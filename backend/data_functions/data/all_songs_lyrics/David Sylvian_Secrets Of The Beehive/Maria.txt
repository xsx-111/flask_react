Maria Lyrics
Climb the stairs
And step into my dream house
These words are yours
Maria

The water's warm (Hold me)
The table bare (Till the worst is past)
Until the summer nights return
Until we close our eyes

Maria
Your every thought's my heartbeat
Maria
Save a thought for me


Maria
Your every thought's my heartbeat
Maria
Save a thought for meEmbed
