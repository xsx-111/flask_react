Last Night Lyrics
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah
Who be your Casanova?
And we don't stop
Drop, drop, drop the flava
Who be your Casanova?
(Facciamo amore)
Yeah and we don't stop
Craig David on the rise
Who be your Casanova?
And we don't stop
Drop, drop, drop the flava
Who be your Casanova?
(Facciamo amore)
Yeah and we don't stop
Craig David on the rise

Stepped in the club now, saw you sitting
With your friends gigglin', lookin' at me
Had to make my move
(Ooh yeah)
So I whispered in her ear, that I'll be your Casanova
Come dance while you think it over
We made our way over to the dance floor
Gotta groove on, dancing, yeah, real hard core
From the front to the back that's where I was at
You know, you know Southampton's mans do it like that
My body all over your
(Facciamo amore)
Damn sure
She was irresistible
The future was foreseeable
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on
(Craig David on the rise)
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on
(Craig David on the rise)

Girl, you had me tripping
(Girl, you've got me tripping)
My heart was feelin', from the beginning
(From the beginning)
Just to hold your body
You drove me crazy, and it weren't like I had to pretend
(Girl, you drive me crazy)
That I'll be a Casanova, if you'd only let me show ya
Felt like a drink so we went to the bar
Next thing we found ourselves in the back of my car
Making you laugh and giggle, ha ha
My body all over your
I didn't want to take it too far
Especially in the car
Got more respect for ya
(Senorita)
Ooh yeah, now you're my partner
Come on
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on
(Craig David on the rise)
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on
(Craig David on the rise)

Yo, yo, yo, yo
I met this girl with the brown eyes, made my moves
Showed enterprise that Craig David's on the rise
It's all about the fly women, good looking women
Those women I can't even begin telling
Senorita, that's the life you live
That makes you wanna leave the one you're with
And this is how I'm droppin' it down
This pretty young girl turned my life around

Pretty young lady
Driving me crazy
Pretty young lady
Driving me crazy
Pretty young lady
Driving me crazy
Pretty young lady
Driving me crazy
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on, tell me
(Craig David on the rise)
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on, tell me
(Craig David on the rise)
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on, tell me
(Craig David on the rise)
(Ieri sera)
Last night, ooh yeah
A pretty young girl I met
Oh yeah, come on, tell me
(Craig David on the rise)

Who be your Casanova?
And we don't stop
Drop, drop, drop the flava
Who be your Casanova?
(Facciamo amore)
Yeah and we don't stop
Craig David on the rise
Who be your Casanova?
And we don't stop
Drop, drop, drop the flava
Who be your Casanova?
(Facciamo amore)
Yeah and we don't stop
Craig David on the rise1Embed
