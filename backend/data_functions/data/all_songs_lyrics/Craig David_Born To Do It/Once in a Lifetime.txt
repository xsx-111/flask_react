Once in a Lifetime Lyrics
Once in my life I have the chance to find
Once in my life I have the chance to find

Once in a lifetime I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me

In the beginning trouble times in my life
I needed a shoulder to cry on
Had no direction until I met you
Everything is gonna be all right
Looking out beyond the stars
Searching always wishing
Often i thought that love would escape me
You got the key babe

Once in a lifetime I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me
I was lost couldn't find my way
You took my hand and chased my blues away
Your inspiration is guiding me through
I'm feeling brand new
Memories of days gone by
Hurting always hurting
You've taken my pain away finally
You set me free babe

Once in a lifetime I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me
Once in a lifetime I have the chance to find the key to my dreams
And I know, that it's so good for me2Embed
