Rendezvous Lyrics
Craig David, this is how we do
Yeah, well come on, check it out
What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun
What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun
What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun
What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun

Six o'clock in the morning
Wipe the sleep from my eyes
Felt just like an ordinary day
Just around the corner, such a surprise
A beautiful angel materialized
Time stood still face to face
I'm sure we'd met in another time and place
Our eyes met as you passed me by (passed me by)
Two souls entwined in the blink of an eye, yeah
And I had to figure out what I'd be missing
So I turned to you and asked you if you wanted to
(You know we'll be getting some)
(Getting jiggy just for fun)
Rendezvous where to, my place say two
And we can do anything you wanna do
Hey, tonight is your night, yeah
When you close your eyes
Take a minute, take a moment, realize
Do you see me when you fantasize?
Tonight'll be your night

I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you
And all the things you do
Girl, feels so right
And all I know is you're the one for me
That special kind of lady
In my life, in my life

Well, here I am writing you a love song
Holding back those years
It's been so long
And I can't deny the way that I'm feeling
It's true, so girl, that's why I'm asking you
(You know we'll be getting some
Getting jiggy just for fun)
Can we
Rendezvous where to, my place say two
And we can do anything you wanna do
Hey, tonight is your night, yeah
When you close your eyes
Take a minute, take a moment, realize
Do you see me when you fantasize?
Tonight'll be your night
(You know we'll be getting some
Getting jiggy just for fun)

Darling, tell me what's on your mind
What'chu thinking (Hey what you thinking)
What'chu thinking (Hey what you thinking)
Darling, tell me what's on you mind (What's on your mind, yeah)
What'chu thinking, yeah
Darling, tell me what's on your mind (Darling)
What'chu thinking (What are you thinking)
What'chu thinking
Darling tell me what's on you mind (Now, darling)
What'chu thinking (What are you thinking)
Yeah

Rendezvous where to, my place say two
And we can do anything you wanna do
Hey, tonight is your night, yeah
(Tonight will be your night)
When you close your eyes
Take a minute, take a moment, realize
Do you see me when you fantasize? (fantasize)
Tonight'll be your night
(It will be
Yes it will be)
I'm just sitting here daydreaming about you
And all the things you do
(All the things you do)
Girl, feels so right
(Makes me feels so right)
And all I know is you're the one for me
That special kind of lady
In my life, in my life

What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun
What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun
What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun
What'chu doing 'cause we'll be rendezvousing and
You know we'll be getting some, getting jiggy just for fun3Embed
