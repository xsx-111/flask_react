You Know What Lyrics
Yeah, I- I know that
I said I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it yeah
I know that you like the way that I put it down on you
You know what, yeah

We were meant to be together for eternity
But now you're gone, it's plain to see I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through, since I've been away from you

When I first met you waiting, standing up by the bus stop
I knew you were something special
Weak in my knees I wanted to drop, yeah yeah
So we checked each other what we had going on was so hot, yeah
I never thought you'd leave me, no, but you know what

We were meant to be together for eternity
But now you're gone, it's plain to see I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through since I've been away from you

Now I can't seem to get over you appearing in everything that I do
It was only last week, Friday when I saw you out with your girlfriends walking 'round my way, yeah yeah
I feel when all's said and done from this love I've had, I've learnt a lot, yeah
I never thought you'd leave me no, but you know what
We were meant to be together for eternity
But now you're gone, it's plain to see I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through since I've been away from you

The flow that we had was so hot
Girl, you took me higher, to the top
We kept it rolling, wouldn't stop
Said you'd never leave me, but you know what

We were meant to be together for eternity
But now you're gone, it's plain to see I was living just a fantasy
So many things I'd like to do if ever I found a love that's true
Finding it hard to push on through since I've been away from you

You don't know what I've been going through
(But I know that)
You don't know what
(I said I'm feeling it, I'm feeling, it, I'm feeling it)
You don't know what I've been going through
(But I know that)
(I said I'm feeling it, I'm feeling, it, I'm feeling it, yeah)Embed
