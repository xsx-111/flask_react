Time to Party Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, here's another one
Aah, aah, aah, yeah, aah, aah, what?
Aah, aah, yeah, what's up?
And we don't stop and we don't wait, come on
Aah, aah, come on
What? Yeah, yeah

On Friday, it's time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?
On Friday, time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?

Friday, pay day, ready to do the things we love
We're gonna get our groove on, all night long
Give it up now for the DJ
And put your hands where my eyes can see

It may be raining but who cares about the weather? (get up)
Cause when the heat is on we'll all be getting wetter (stand up)
It's the start of the weekend
Don't waste no time, for tonight is your night
On Friday, it's time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?
On Friday, time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?

Everybody's feeling right
Cause we know it's party night
Ooh yeah, all the ladies are looking tight
Whether silk or satin, lace or leather, ooh what a sight

Here's where the party starts, things can only get better
Just make your way on to the dance floor, get together
It's the start of the weekend, don't waste no time
For tonight is your night

On Friday, it's time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?
On Friday, time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?
This party be going on till the break of dawn
Let's give it up, what? What? Let's get it on
Break open a bottle of Moët & Chandon
And when it's gone, we'll start on the Dom Pérignon
This vibe's makin' me high like Toni
Surrounded by other people movin' their body
We be kickin' mad flava in your ear
Big shout to the people round the side in the front at the rear
This is gonna be one hell of a year
And there's no way that I'm lettin' anyone interfere
This is how we do gettin' it on in the venue
Can you check my microphone? 1, 2
Can you give it up now please for the DJ
Givin' you a party like a Summer Sortie, okay
Let's see those hands in the air
And wave them around like you just don't care, come on

On Friday, it's time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?
On Friday, time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?
On Friday, it's time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?
On Friday, time to party
Let me see you swing and sway
Tell me, are you with me? Are you with me?Embed
