Key to My Heart Lyrics
Lonely hours, Lonely days
Never meant to drive you away from me
I should've listened to ya lady and what you had to say, if only
I never knew how much you feel for somebody after you've let them go (let them go)
And you find out that it's too late to let your feelings show (feelings show)
And even though I've done you so wrong
Don't you know, like I know, baby

You see you've got the key to my heart, girl
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart
'Cause when u said you had to leave
Had to go away, you closed the door on me
You threw away the key

I'm starting over; I'm feeling down
Still can't believe that you're not around
I should've been there for you, baby
But now I'm crying on this melody tonight
I didn't realize there's no other remedy to numb this pain (numb this pain)
But if you come back in my life then maybe I can start to live again (live again)
And even though you're being so strong
Don't you know, like I know, baby
You see you've got the key to my heart, girl
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart
'Cause when u said you had to leave
Had to go away, you closed the door on me
You threw away the key

And everyday and night I'm thinking about you constantly
Now I know for sure how much you really mean to me, yeah
Sometimes I get a rush and I see, how we were meant to be, lady

You see you've got the key to my heart, girl
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart
'Cause when u said you had to leave
Had to go away, you closed the door on me
You threw away the key
You see you've got the key to my heart, girl
Unlock me and take all my feelings apart
'Cause when u said you had to leave
Had to go away, you closed the door on me
You threw away the key1Embed
