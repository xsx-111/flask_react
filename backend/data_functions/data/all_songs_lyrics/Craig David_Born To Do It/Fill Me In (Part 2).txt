Fill Me In (Part 2) Lyrics
I say we do it again, do it again come on
Craig David
Ooh yeah
Come on baby

Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats up
Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats up

Late last night you were chilling with your friends baby
Driving all the God damn guys crazy yeah
You said now would you like
To take me for a ride honey
I said that would be just fine for me, for me yeah
You come around and you were willing to drive
But it wasn't enough I guess you wanted me to come your way
You wanna ride & then tell me you wanna stay
No way, ain't messing with the games you play
Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats up
Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats up

So tonight, we're gonna hit the club baby
Get up get your groove on party tonight, ooh yeah
So don't you worry, I'll be all over your body
Like chocolate over a Turkish delight, lady
Said you wanted to dance but then you wouldn't dance
But you wanted to play so slow it down Mr. DJ
I guess the reason why you always seem to get your way
Is down to the games you play

Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats up
Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats up
Girl when I'm rubbing you down
And you're making those sounds
Ooh girl you know I like it, like it
You make me feel so aroused
Hold it down in a crowd
Though I like the way you put it on me

Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats up
Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up
Let me know whats upEmbed
