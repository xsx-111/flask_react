Booty Man Lyrics
One, two, buckle my shoe
Three, four, step inside the venue and
See, in the corner of my eye
This beautiful girl that's standing by the bar looking fly
She was like a beauty queen out of a magazine, looked about 19
Five minutes talking, next thing it's her number being written

If you're looking for the man that can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say damn, the booty man can
Click off click on www.cd.com, international bomb
The booty man's really got it going on

One, two unbuckle my shoe
Kissing and cuddling at my crib after the venue and I
Didn't wanna take it too fast so I said:
"Slow slow, I gotta make some calls so keep it down low"
She was like: "I can't believe you wanna talk instead of making love to me"
Five minutes chilling, next thing it's my name she's calling

If you're looking for the man that can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say damn, the booty man can
Click off click on www.cd.com, international bomb
The booty man's really got it going on
Bomb, bomb the booty man booty man's really got it going on, on
The booty man booty man's really got it going
Bomb, bomb the booty man booty man's really got it going on, on
The booty man booty man's really got it

If you're looking for the man that can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say damn, the booty man can
Click off click on www.cd.com, international bomb
