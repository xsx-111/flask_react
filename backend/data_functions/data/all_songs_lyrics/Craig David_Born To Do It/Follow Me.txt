Follow Me Lyrics
Can you tell me
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
Talk, talk to me

In your letter, it said you, wanted to talk to me
Talk, talk to me, to me
That you're missing my loving
Asking am I gonna give it to ya?
She said, "I like the way you put it down on me, me baby"
That there's nothing more she'd rather do, do than

Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
Both of our bodies
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
This'll be a night you won't forget
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
Both of our bodies
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
This'll be a night you won't forget

Relax, unwind, and just take your time
Take, take your, take your time
I would like to show you
Get to know you, hold you, kiss you
Running my fingers through your hair
How do you like it?
Let's just take it nice and slow, and enjoy the flow
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
(You know what you gotta do
You know what you gotta do)
Take my hand
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
(This'll be a night you won't forget)
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
(Follow me, follow me darling)
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
(Can you follow me?)

When I get on top and I make it real hot
And you tell me, "Don't stop"
Are you fallin'?
When I get on top and I make it real hot
And you tell me,"Don't stop"
Whose name you calling?
When I get on top and I make it real hot
And you tell me, "Don't stop"
Are you fallin'?
When I get on top and I make it real hot
And you tell me, "Don't stop"
Ooh, yeah talk, talk to me
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
Both of our bodies
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
This'll be a night you won't forget
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
Both of our bodies
Follow me, follow me to my bedroom
This'll be a night you won't forget

Can you tell me
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
How do you feel?
Talk, talk to me1Embed
