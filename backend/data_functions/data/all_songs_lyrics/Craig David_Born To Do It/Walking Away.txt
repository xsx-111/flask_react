Walking Away Lyrics
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

But now I truly realize
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well, I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies
And, well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away
Well, I'm so tired, baby
Things you say, you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room, baby
Don't listen to the games they play

Girl, I thought you'd realize
I'm not like them other guys
'Cause I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise, babe
And well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh I'm walking away, from the troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, troubles in my life)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (I'm walking away)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (I'm walking away, I try to show you baby)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh I'm gon', I'm gonna find a better day)
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life (Oh yeah, from the troubles in my life, baby)
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day8Embed
