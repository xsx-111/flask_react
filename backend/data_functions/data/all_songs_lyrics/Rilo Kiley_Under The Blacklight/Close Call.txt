Close Call Lyrics
She was born on a Brighton pier
To a gypsy mother and a bucket of tears
Her good looks coulda sailed a ship
But her will alone coulda sunk it
Funny thing about money for sex
You might get rich, but you die by it

It's gonna be a close call
Gonna be a close call

Tell me now, what would you do
Hangin' back with the brutes
Hustle and pickpocket
That's no way to get rich

It's gonna be a close call
Gonna be a close call
Gonna be a close call
Gonna be a close call

Businesswoman with good sense
If you live it all, you're gonna die by it
Funny thing about money for sex
You might get rich, but then...
It's gonna be a close call
Gonna be a close call
Gonna be a close call
Gonna be a close callEmbed
