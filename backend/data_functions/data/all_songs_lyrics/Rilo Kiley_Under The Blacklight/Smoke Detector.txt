Smoke Detector Lyrics
My eyes burn, everybody smokes
My eyes burn, everybody smokes
I smoke too, but not as much as you
I do the smoke detector
There is a girl in a tank top
She is not wearin' a bra
She looks so hot on the dance floor
She does the smoke detector

She says, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
She says, "Danger!
I'm the smoke detector"

I took a man back to my room
I was smokin' him in bed
Yeah, I was smokin' in bed
This is what he said
I took a man back to my room
I was smokin' in bed
Yeah I was smokin' in bed
This is what he said
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"
I said, "Danger!
Do the smoke detector"Embed
