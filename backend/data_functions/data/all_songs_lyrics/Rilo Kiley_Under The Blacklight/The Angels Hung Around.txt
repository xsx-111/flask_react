The Angels Hung Around Lyrics
I been had and I been held
With the ghosts at bay
And I been oaked and I been doped
And carried away
I been charred and I been scarred
On my own face
But I never thought I'd see you as I did
Today

Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
As they carried me away

I been clubbed and I been snubbed
By the dogs of L.A
And I been burned and I been learned
In the same city
I been whored and I been gored
I been less and I been more
But I never thought I'd see you as I did
Today
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
As they carried me away

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

You were stuck in the badlands
Actin' like a bad bad man
I been photographed and painted up
And I been in love, only once
And I feared the best and loved the worst
And insisted that I go first
And watch your eyes as they poured
And I never really loved you more
And I never thought I'd see you as I did
Today

Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
Till the angels hung around
As they carried you away
And they put you in the ground
When the angels hung around
And the angels hung around
As they carried me awayEmbed
