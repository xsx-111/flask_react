Under the Blacklight Lyrics
When you get sober, will you get kinder?
'Cause when you get uptight, it's such a drag
When I get older, I won't remember
Until that day comes, I've got somethin' on you
Under the blacklight, out in the garden
Into the pale moon, I'll be waitin'

Under the blacklight
Under the blacklight

Even dead men lie in their coffins
It's been a long time since you felt better
Under the blacklight, out in the garden
Into the pale moon, I'll be waitin'

Under the blacklight
Out in the garden
Into the pale moon
Under the blacklight

Somewhere in Laredo borders a soft man
Like a black widow, I'll be crawlin'
Under the blacklight
Out in the garden
Into the pale moon
Under the blacklight
Down in the valley
Up in the dark blue
Under the blacklight
Under the blacklightEmbed
