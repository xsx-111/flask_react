Give a Little Love Lyrics
You'll get your money, I'll get my friends
Hard living's forgiven in the end
You got your troubles, I got mine
On a clear day, I can read your mind

Ooh
It's like a battlefield inside

You got to
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
To get a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love

I know you better
Than you want me to
Inside your pockets
And walking in your shoes

Ooh
It can get better if you try
You got to
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
To get a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
You got to
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
To get a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love

I keep you close
In my wildest dreams
My rear view mirror
And you're waving to me
Our last goodbye
I don't mind

You got to
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
To get a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
I hope you
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
To get a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
You got to
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
To get a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
You got to
Give a little love
Give a little love
Give a little love
To get a little love
Give a little love
Give a little loveEmbed
