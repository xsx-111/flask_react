The Moneymaker Lyrics
You got the money maker
You got the money maker
You got the money maker
This is your chance to make it

Out, out, out, oh yeah
You'll get out, out, out, oh yeah

You got the money maker
They showed the money to you
You showed them what you can do
Showed them your money make

You get out, out, out, oh yeah
You'll get out, out, out, oh yeah

You are the money maker
She is yours for the takin'
You know you wanna make her
Show her your money maker
She says "out, out, out", hell yeah
She says "out, out, out", yeah
You get out, out, out, oh yeah
You get out, out, out, oh yeah

And it's in my hands (What to do)
I will, if you want me to

She says "out, out, out", hell yeah
She says "out, out, out", yeah
You get out, out, out, oh yeah
You get out, out, out, oh yeahEmbed
