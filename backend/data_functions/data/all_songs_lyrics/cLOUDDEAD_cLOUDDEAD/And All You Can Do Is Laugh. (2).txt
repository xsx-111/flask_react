And All You Can Do Is Laugh. (2) Lyrics
Hello?
How you doin'?
Who's the spokesman?
What are you doing sir?
My God!
Listen
What was I doing?
What was I doing?
Rhythm (x15)
Rhythm's wonderful
That kind of rhythm's everything, you can't even go to the bathroom if your rhythm ain't ?
What was I doing?
Play me some beautiful dreamy music, dear prince
Have you ever swung around a beautiful country road
With a gleam of sweet life in the air
Groovy with gold in your pocket
Riding a wild set of wheels at an easy pace
Can you feel it?
You start thinking about a beautiful girl
You met there five years ago
What a gasser she was!
Take me now!
What am I doing here?
Who do you think's been driving while you were gone?
