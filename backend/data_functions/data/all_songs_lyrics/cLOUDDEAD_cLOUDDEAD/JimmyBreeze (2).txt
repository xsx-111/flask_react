JimmyBreeze (2) Lyrics
It seems I'm only me in sleep
Where we meet in dream
At the concrete bottom of the brody garage bridge you just jumped from
Who would've ever thought art school could be so sickening
Wearing a werewolf mask, you tuck your shirt in
You said its nice to look like you just stepped out of a movie
And sure, you look cinematic
Silhouette in the edge of a roof of a car parked
Under the orange sun set sky
With an empty sketch pad and a werewolf mask
We always meet too late after you done did it
Put cracks in concrete fifty feet from where I first saw you stand
A pack of little birds peck at your flesh and your monster mask
As I reach to touch your shoes to track the trail of where you've been

The ram's crumpled horn, an empty turtle shell
Sunset is an all day process, sunset is an all day process
The ram's crumpled horn, an empty turtle shell
Sunset is an all day process, sunset is an all day process
The ram's crumpled horn, an empty turtle shell
Sunset is an all day process, sunset is an all day process

We seem to be sinking deeper into a vat of honey glaze
Shall we live
Or shall we laminate ourselves into a standard appetizing position
At school, next quarter, all the supply lists
Call for Reynold's Wrap and contact paper
Report covers and lacquer am I here to something something
Or start a dead butterfly collection
William Howard Taft is appalled that as an artist
I wouldn't want to overindulge in a set of
Highly toxic and rare natural pigments
Or beautiful paper to waste the rainforests with
But friends, we no longer rave for glitzy masters
Who paint gold leaf holy babies at the backs of cathedrals
And that's a fact
