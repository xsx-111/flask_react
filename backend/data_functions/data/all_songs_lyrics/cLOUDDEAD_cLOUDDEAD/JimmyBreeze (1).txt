JimmyBreeze (1) Lyrics
What's his name, Jim?
'Jimmy Breeze'. 'Jimmy Breeze'
You've reached four, seven...
Hello
Hello?
Hey, what's up?
Is this Jimmy Breeze?
Yeah
Yeah well, we're looking for a rhythm guitar player for our band
OK, OK, sounds good
What do you look like? Do you look good holding a guitar?
Oh yeah, yeah
We have specific suits. We wear leather pants and, uh, a red and black Michael Jackson suede jacket
Um, no, I don't got a problem with that, man
Wow, what a loser
He's kinda groovy
Groovy? He's freaky!
Where is love?
I've taught myself to survive a four story fall
Wearing a space suit and a dead Englishman's socks
It's a textbook procedure, kid
Right out of the pages of the hollowed out book
Where once I hid my paint speckled glasses
Don't lose your shoes over such a simple step as hitting ground
Just remember to roll
Just remember to roll
Silence in a five-story stairwell
I say, and that's all I can think of
In my brandon-eyed dead of day drawl
I can barely squeeze that lie
Through the plaque-clogged pinhole between my two front teeth
Mom
I've kept a razor under my tongue since I was a small toddler with a tight belt
I haven't been able to kiss a woman with an open mouth, my friend
Cause I'm afraid that I'd split her lip
Is that sick?

Well, my friend lives down on the eastern side of Cincinnati

Silence in a five-story stairwell
I say, and that's all I can think of
In my brandon-eyed dead of day drawl
I can barely squeeze that lie
Through the plaque-clogged pinhole between my two front teeth
Mom
I've kept a razor under my tongue since I was a small toddler with a tight belt
I haven't been able to kiss a woman with an open mouth, my friend
Cause I'm afraid that I'd split her lip
Is that sick?Embed
