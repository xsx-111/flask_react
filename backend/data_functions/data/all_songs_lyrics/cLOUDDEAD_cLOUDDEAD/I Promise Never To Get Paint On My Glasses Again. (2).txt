Poem
Victories
1. The key turns and the engine starts
2. With a shovel and towel the children run around and around the patch of soil in the middle of which bursts a small, brilliant patch of green
3. After hours of fighting the upstairs neighbors emerge into the sun. Looking up, their baby smiles
4. The trap snaps and that's that
5. After 30 years and childbirth twice pushing the enormous stroller past the cheap condos she hears a whistle and picks up her step
6. Not even the house creaks at 3:47 AM as sitting in grandpa's chair in the living room, he counts through 60 entire seconds of silence
By, Rain
A tough catch
I promise never to get paint on my glasses again
"Take rt. 2 NW to Seattle, take rt. 1 S to Mexico."
Sleepy leaders, never drag their feet
Blinking off my lightbulb fix
Sort of wordless
Whole picturey
What began on the bench, rolls stale air
Inside outside glare
Patterns in behavior
"What is a rainbow lord?"
"A hoop for the lowly."
I must admit I've been greedy with the gravity I suit
Family members?
I've a car full
But, I know your birthday death wish
Weight lifting dream
By the window
Citybus mean faces & fare
Just in case I'm coming with
Beautiful pictures of big cities
A bonfire walking
To those I love
Its look inside
And heavy
Puts gills on god
And flag in dirt
Toward tears
I claim this land in the name of nothing
Has been done before
It's how fit between the stars and planets
Are all lined up for me
In baby face solemnity
Despite the business card
These things change
And trust their pack of animals
Don't hate me because I dream awake
This ant writes on the back of love letters
My depression sings of Buddha with a soc. XXX-XX-XXXX
I miss my friends and family
Let's get our cry on
Paper thin and falling leaves
This change
This last big change
Shhhhhh....
Reading from my pillow as if I never had one
Higherself
And wet clothes chosen
Naked holding hands
I got things together
They came from all around to see me lain to rest
In violet fits and petting my cat
Harmony and discord
A 900 pager
Only time will quell
There is no difference in the plan of cloudsEmbed
