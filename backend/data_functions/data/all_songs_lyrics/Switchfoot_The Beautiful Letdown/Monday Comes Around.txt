Monday Comes Around Lyrics
Friday, Monday comes around

She's a girl with the weight of the world on her big brown eyes
She's a girl who's been talking to herself to apologize
She'll never do it again she promised
But then she hasn't been all that honest
Can she trust herself to be herself
Or is she talking to herself again?

Hey, Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around?
Hey, Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around?

When Monday comes around, comes around
When Monday comes around

Monday comes wondering
Where do you run to find a second start?
Where do you go when you're broke and alone
And Friday falls apart?
All these questions are leaving her shaking
Can you be two girls in one?
Can your heart bend this much without breaking?
You know that you know
And you can never have it both ways
Hey, Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around?
Hey, Friday what you gonna do now
When Monday comes around?

When Monday comes around, comes around
When Monday comes around, comes around
When Monday comes around, come around
When Monday comes around

Don't take it easy
Don't take it easy
Who says everybody's giving and taking, giving and taking?
Everybody's taking away

(Monday comes around, comes around
Friday, Monday comes around)
Friday, Monday comes around
Friday, Monday comes around
Friday, Monday comes around
Friday, Monday comes around
Friday, Monday come...
Friday, Monday comes around
Friday, Monday comes around...1Embed
