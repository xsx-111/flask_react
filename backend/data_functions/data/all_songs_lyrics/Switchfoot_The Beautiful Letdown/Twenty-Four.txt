Twenty-Four Lyrics
Twenty-four oceans
Twenty-four skies
Twenty-four failures
And twenty-four tries
Twenty-four finds me
In twenty-fourth place
With twenty-four dropouts
At the end of the day
Life is not what I thought it was
Twenty-four hours ago
Still I'm singing

Spirit take me up in arms with You
And I'm not who I thought I was
Twenty-four hours ago
Still I'm singing
Spirit take me up in arms with You

There's Twenty-four reasons
To admit that I'm wrong
With all my excuses
Still twenty-four strong
But see I'm not copping out
I'm not copping out
I'm not copping out
When You're raising the dead in me

Oh, oh, I am the second man
Oh, oh, I am the second man now
Oh, I am the second man now

And You're raising these twenty-four voices
With twenty-four hearts
With all of my symphonies in twenty-four parts
But I want to be one today
Centered and true

I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
You're raising the dead in me

Oh, oh, I am the second man
Oh, oh, I am the second man now
Oh, I am the second man now
And You're raising the dead in me, yeah, yeah
I want to see miracles
To see the world change
I wrestled the angel
For more than a name
For more than a feeling
For more than a cause

I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
And You're raising the dead in me

And you're raising these twenty-four voices
With twenty-four hearts
And all of my symphonies in twenty-four parts

Life is not what I thought it was twenty-four hours ago
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms
I'm not copping out
I'm not copping out
I'm not copping outEmbed
