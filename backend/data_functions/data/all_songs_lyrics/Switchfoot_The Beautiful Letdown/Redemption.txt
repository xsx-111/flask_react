Redemption Lyrics
Four A.M., two hours to go
I'm wearing out a lonely glow
I miss you more than I can know
Here I am, here I am, won't you get me?

I've got my hands at redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come alive, come alive

With my fist down at your feet
I was runnin' out of mysteries
Insecure and incomplete
Here I am, here I am
Won't you get me?

I've got my hands at redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come alive
Come alive, alive, come alive
My fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me out
And my fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me, worn me out

I've got my hands at redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come alive
(I've got my hands)
At redemption's side
(Whose scars are bigger than)
Bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
And I'll come alive, come aliveEmbed
