Adding To The Noise Lyrics
What's it gonna take to slow us down
To let the silence spin us around?
What's it gonna take to drop this town?
We've been spinning at the speed of sound
Stepping out of those convenience stores
What could we we want but more, more, more?
From the third world to the corporate core
We are the symphony of modern humanity, yeah

If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off your stereo, radio, video

I don't know what they're gonna think of next
Genetic engineers of the most high tech
A couple new ways to fall into debt
I'm a nervous wreck but I'll bet that that T.V. set
Tells us what we wanted to hear
But none of these sound bites are comin' in clear
From the third world to the corporate ear
We are the symphony of modern humanity, yeah
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off your stereo, radio
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off your stereo, radio
Stereo, radio
Stereo, radio
Stereo, radio
Stereo, radio
Stereo, radio

If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off your stereo, radio
If we're adding to the noise
If we're adding to the noise
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this songEmbed
