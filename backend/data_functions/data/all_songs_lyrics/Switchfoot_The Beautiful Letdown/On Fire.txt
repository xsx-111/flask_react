On Fire Lyrics
They tell you where you need to go
They tell you when you need to leave
They tell you what you need to know
They tell you who you need to be

But everything inside you knows
There's more than what you've heard
There's so much more than empty conversations
Filled with empty words

And you're on fire when He's near you
You're on fire when He speaks
You're on fire burning at these mysteries

Give me one more time around
Give me one more chance to see, yeah
Give me everything You are
Give me one more chance to be near You

When everything inside me
Looks like everything I hate
You are the hope I have for change
You are the only chance I'll take
When I'm on fire when You're near me
And I'm on fire when You speak
And I'm on fire burning at these mysteries
Mysteries
Mysteries

You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire
I'm standing on the edge of me
I'm standing on the edge of me
I'm standing on the edge of me
I'm standing on the edge of me
I'm standing on the edge of everything I've never been before
And I've been standing on the edge of me, standing on the edge

And I'm on fire when You're near me
And I'm on fire when You speak
Yeah, I'm on fire burning at these mysteries
These mysteries
These mysteries, yeah
You're a mystery, yeah
You're a mystery1Embed
