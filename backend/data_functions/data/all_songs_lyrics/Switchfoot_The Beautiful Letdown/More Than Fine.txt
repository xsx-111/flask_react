More Than Fine Lyrics
When I wake in the morning, I want to blow into pieces
I want more than just okay, more than just okay
When I'm up with the sunrise, I want more than just the blue skies
I want more than just okay, more than just okay

I'm not giving up, giving up, not giving up now
I'm not giving up, giving up, not backing down

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay

When I'm lit with the sunshine
I want more than just a good time
I want more than just okay, more than just okay
Okay

I'm not giving up, giving up, not giving up now
I'm not giving up, giving up, not selling out

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay
More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay, okay
More than oceans away from the dawn
More than oceans away from the dawn
More than oceans away from who we are
More than oceans, more than oceans, yeah

More than fine, more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay
Okay, okay, okay fine more than bent on getting by
More than fine, more than just okay
