Angel LyricsOh, be active as I, I realise this
Walking home and just here feeling it
Oh, come clean before you talk dirty to me, darling
Scream into your pillow; no, you’re never not an angel
You lick my skin, underneath me, angel
Mess up my dress, I couldn’t care less
Every time that you’re with me I'll pretend to what you do
Oh, and if you miss it, ooh, I'm saying this
Oh, and peel my dress off, oh, as you suggest
Oh, don’t come before your high, where were you going?
Oh, you’re flattering; no, you’re never not an angel
Underneath me I see nothing
Angel, your hair not slick, your wings are clipped
Underneath your perfect sin there’s something evil happening
Angel, you lick my skin, I’ve done nothing
Angel, mess up my dress, I couldn't care less
Every time that you’re with me I'll pretend to what you doEmbed
