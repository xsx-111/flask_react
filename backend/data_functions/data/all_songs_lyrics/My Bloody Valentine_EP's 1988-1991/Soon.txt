Soon Lyrics
Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah, doll of pain
I let you get to me
Yeah, yeah

Come back, don't be
Afraid of me soon
That I'll harm you
Your eyes are blue
Blue jewels
Yeah, yeah

Come back, have faith
Someone like you
Can find the reason
Of what I did to you
Yeah, yeah

Wake up, don't fear
I want to love you
Yeah, doll of pain
I let you get to me
Yeah, yeah6Embed
