Swallow Lyrics
Sweetheart
I want to know
Your heart, oh, oh

Swallow, swallow love
I close my mouth
Slowly, slowly, love
Into my mouth

Close the door
I want you more
Your head, crawl down

Swallow, swallow love
I close my mouth
Slowly, slowly, love
Into my mouth

Coming down

Swallow, swallow love
I close my mouth
Slowly, slowly, love
Into my mouthEmbed
