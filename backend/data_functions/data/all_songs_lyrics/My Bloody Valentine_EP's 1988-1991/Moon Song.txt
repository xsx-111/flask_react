Moon Song Lyrics
Hold me close
I hate you the most
When you are the only one
Never could forgotten one
I can
Hear you, dear
I wish that I was never born
When you are the only one

You come to me
Thoughts that I can't see
You're never real
Pretend to me
When I'm with you
I don't know what to do
Don't come back soon
I don't want you to
When you are the only one

Hold my hand
But understand
You are the hated one
And you are the only one
You can look
And you can touch
That's why it's never fun
When you are the only one
If they could see
What you have done to me
You will not be the
Only one
You come back soon
Breaking up the room
And soon you'll be the
Forgotten one
And to her the only one
Only one
Now you'll be forgotten one1Embed
