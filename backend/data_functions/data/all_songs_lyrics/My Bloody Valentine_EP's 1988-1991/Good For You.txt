Good For You LyricsCelebrate the ways to me cause I want you to
Complicate the happiness and it's never at you
Took out your fuse in two simple little lies
And it's oh so near you and her
Hold on to your precious little smile for me
I could never imagine your lips I see
Try and try to guess
Good for you my evil one
Twist me and incite me I won't mind
Tastes so sweet, so wonderful and incite me
Soft licker in her eyes, anger quietly
What do I say, I just have to let this be
