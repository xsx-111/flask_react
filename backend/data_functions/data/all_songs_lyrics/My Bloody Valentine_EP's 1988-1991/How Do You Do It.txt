How Do You Do It LyricsStepping some way out
It won't be long before they find out
How you do it
Sometimes evil
I doubt someone's telling a lie
How can you do it?
Oh, you've got nothing to do
So don't doubt me
Hey, you're some kind of fool
So I think I'll leave
When you're away
This fool's out to play
Yeah, that's how I do it
How soon comes today?
I can't be sure I will find a way
That's how I do it
Oh, so you're playing a game
______________ leaves
Hey, now you do it again
You're what I need
Step this time way out
It won't be long before they find out
How you do it
Sometimes evil
I doubt someone's telling a lie
How can you do it?
Oh, you've got nothing to do
So don't doubt me
Hey, you're some kind of fool
So I think you should leaveEmbed
