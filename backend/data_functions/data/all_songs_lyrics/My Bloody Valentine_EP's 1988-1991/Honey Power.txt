Honey Power Lyrics
Change my mouth
Here with your tongue
Your body soft
Over there where you're laying down
Hold my flower
Here and you will now
Fall
Sure you did from appearing smile

Ooh, bloom
I drink to you
Feel you come
High enough till you're sleeping and
Take my flower
Touch before I die
Over you
Then we'll sleep for another hourEmbed
