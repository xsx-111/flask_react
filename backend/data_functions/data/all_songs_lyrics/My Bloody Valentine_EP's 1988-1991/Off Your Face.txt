Off Your Face Lyrics
Hate
Pretend that I
Adore you
Hate
What do you take me
For you

Crybaby, shame
You're in love with the game
Swallow the pain
Nothing else will remain

Hate
What I will do is
Scar you
Hate
Don't say I didn't
Warn you

Crybaby, shame
You're in love with the game
Cry in the rain
I won't love you again
