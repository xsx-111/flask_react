Stand By Me Lyrics
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So, darling, darling stand by me
Oh now now, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
And the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Yeah


Whenever you're in trouble won't you
Stand by me
Oh, now now, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
Darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me10Embed
