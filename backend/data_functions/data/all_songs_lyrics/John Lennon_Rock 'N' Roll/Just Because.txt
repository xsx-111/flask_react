Just Because Lyrics
Ah, remember this
Why, I must have been thirteen when this came out
Or was it fourteen, or was it twenty-two
I could have been twelve actually

Just because you left and said goodbye
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so
Darling, I would rather let you go

Just because I want someone who's kind
With a heart as good and pure as mine
But maybe I am asking far too much
Darling, please don't ever break my heart

I know you think you're smart
Just running around and breaking lovers' hearts

Just because you left and said goodbye
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so
Darling, I would rather let you go
It’s too late darling, you just gotta say goodbye
Why, the last time I saw you, you were wearing man’s clothes
Not that I’m prejudiced, but you know
I had problems with the zippers
But who am I to hassle you like this?
I’m just gonna have to let you go
There’s two basses in this, I hope you appreciate it
This is Dr. Winston O' Boogie saying goodnight
From Record Plant East, New York
We hope you had a swell time
Everybody here says "Hi" ... goodbye
Just because you left and said goodbye
Do you think that I will sit and cry?
Even if my heart should tell me so
Darling, I would rather let you go
Goodbye, so long
Been a long year
AlrightEmbed
