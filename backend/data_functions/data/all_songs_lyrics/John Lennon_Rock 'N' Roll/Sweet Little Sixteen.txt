Sweet Little Sixteen Lyrics
They're really rocking in Boston
In Pittsburgh, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
On down to Frisco Bay
All over Saint Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen

Sweet, sweet, sweet little sixteen
She's got the grown up blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's sporting high heeled boots
Oh but tomorrow morning
She's gonna have to change her trend
Become sweet sixteen
And back in class again

Oh mommy, mommy
Please, please may I go
You know it's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy
You know I beg of you
Scream it to momma
It's alright with you
Because they're rocking in New York
In Philadelphia, PA
Deep in the heart of Texas
Down at the Rainbow L.A
All over Saint Louis
And down in New Orleans
All the mothers want to do
Sweet little sixteen

Sweet, sweet, sweet sixteen
She's so delicate
She's just gotta have it
About half, half the numberEmbed
