Rip It Up / Ready Teddy Lyrics

Well it's Saturday night, and I just got paid
Fool about my money, don't try to save
My heart says, "Go! Go! Have a time"
Because it's Saturday night, baby, I'm feeling fine

Gonna rip it up
Gonna rock it up
Gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
Gonna rock it up
And ball tonight

Got me a date and now don't be late
Picked her up in my eighty-eight
Shag on down to the union hall
When the joint starts jumping, I'll have a ball

Gonna rip it up
Gonna rock it up
Gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
Gonna rock it up
And ball tonight


Well, ready, set, go man, go
I got a girl that I love so

And I'm ready
Ready ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, Teddy to rock and roll

Going to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock and roll, baby, she's the apple of my eye

And I'm ready
Ready ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready ready Teddy, I'm ready
Ready ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, Teddy to rock and rollEmbed
