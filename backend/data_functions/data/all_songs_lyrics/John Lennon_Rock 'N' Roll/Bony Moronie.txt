Bony Moronie Lyrics
I got a girl named Bony Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Ought to see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bone

Well now I love her, she loves me
Oh how happy, now we gonna be
Making love underneath the apple tree

I told her mama and her papa too
Just exactly what I'm gonna do
We're gonna get married on a night in June
Rock 'n' roll by the light of the silvery moon

Well now I love her, she loves me
Oh how happy, now we gonna be
Making love underneath the apple tree

She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
She's a real up setter, she's a real live wire
Everybody's watching when my baby walks by
She's so good looking, really catches the eye
Well now I love her, she loves me
Oh how happy, now we gonna be
Making love underneath the apple tree
Well now I love her, she loves me
Oh how happy, now we gonna be
Making love underneath the apple treeEmbed
