Peggy Sue Lyrics
If you knew, Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue
Without Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, yes I love you Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty Peggy Sue
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well, I love you girl and I need you Peggy Sue

I love you, Peggy Sue, with a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh I still love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
Look out


Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue, oh how my heart yearns for you
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Oh well I love you girl, and I want you Peggy Sue
Oh yes I love you girl and I want you Peggy Sue1Embed
