Do You Want to Dance? Lyrics
Hello

Well, do you want to dance, hold my hand?
Tell me I'm your loving man
Baby, do you want to dance?
Well, do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Hug and kiss all through the night, now
Baby, do you want to dance, dance, dance?

Well, do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Baby, do you want to dance?
All right, all right

Look out
(Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?)
Do you want to dance?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?)

Well, do you want to dance, make romance?
Kiss and squeeze, yeah, yeah
Do you want to dance?
All right, now dance
Well
Beep, Beep
Wow

(Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?)
Do you want to dance?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?)
(Do you, do you, do you, do you want to dance?)Embed
