I Can See You LyricsDid you see your people?
They all turned out for you
We were all together not so long ago
In the shadows we can see you
In the wind we hear your laugh
When the light reclaimed you
We were left clawing at the sky
In the oceans we can find you
For the sun we praise your name
In the dirt we pray for god to bring you back again
I can see you, I can see you
In the void the stones are turning and turning and turning
I can see you, I can see youEmbed
