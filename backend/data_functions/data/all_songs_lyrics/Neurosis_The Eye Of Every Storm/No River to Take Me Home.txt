No River to Take Me Home LyricsThe water's deep here
The less of me I show to you
The more I get to get me through
The stain of my eyes
Burnt deep within
Who will fall?
I asked not to know
I'm sealed away, you can't touch me now
Wheel and fire return to me
Let them come
Be my eyes, lead me on
Lift me out, tear me up, spark to fire
Whatever comes through me I will be
I had three signs thrown down on me
Fate frees my heart
Whatever comes through me I will be
Digging a hole so I can rest
No tears from no river to take me home
The seeds in my way, roots to the core
Of a rising sun falling through the wind to the soil
As my body leaves me
I cling to a tree in a dream
I'm screaming to you
Whatever comes through me I will beEmbed
