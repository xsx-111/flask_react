A Season in the Sky LyricsI had a vision last night, my god was glowing
There was another bridge on fire
And the last wrecks were counted
The sky opened and the blood flowed
A distant cancerous season was upon me
I had a hook in my back and a light to guide me
My words were useless again
The leftovers were playing with my memories of love
I screamed at my god and he let me go
I drifted silently to the desert and began to pray
I came to a pile of ashes and sifted through it looking for teeth
A snake spoke through me again
But I could not heal their wounds
I'm searching for the old spirit of war
With my rough hands and a sharp knife
I need something to cut into so that my god can see me again
To be right again
To see my shadow alone
To get back to the hook a let the light burn in my soul
All I've seen walking through the fire
The figures in my dreams
Run back on me in a psychic scar
As I ride to the dawnEmbed
