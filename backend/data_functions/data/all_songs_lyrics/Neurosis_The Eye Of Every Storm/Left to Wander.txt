Left to Wander LyricsA light went out of the world today
The spirit rose like smoke
The corpse gave in to the ether
We're left to wander at the void
We're left to wander
The race to render your vision
A fracture in the world can devour
Return to the light of the bearer
The radiant breaks down into life
We're left to wanderEmbed
