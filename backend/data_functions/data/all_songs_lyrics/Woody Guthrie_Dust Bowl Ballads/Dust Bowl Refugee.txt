Dust Bowl Refugee LyricsI'm a dust bowl refugee
Just a dust bowl refugee
From that dust bowl to the peach bowl
Now that peach fuzz is a-killin' me
'Cross the mountains to the sea
Come the wife and kids and me
It's a hot old dusty highway
For a dust bowl refugee
Hard, it's always been that way
Here today and on our way
Down that mountain, 'cross the desert
Just a dust bowl refugee
We are ramblers, so they say
We are only here today
Then we travel with the seasons
We're the dust bowl refugees
From the south land and the drought land
Come the wife and kids and me
And this old world is a hard world
For a dust bowl refugee
Yes, we ramble and we roam
And the highway that's our home
It's a never-ending highway
For a dust bowl refugee
Yes, we wander and we work
In your crops and in your fruit
Like the whirlwinds on the desert
That's the dust bowl refugees
I'm a dust bowl refugee
I'm a dust bowl refugee
And I wonder will I always
Be a dust bowl refugee?Embed
