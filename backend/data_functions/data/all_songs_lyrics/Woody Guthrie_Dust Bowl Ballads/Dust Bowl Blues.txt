Dust Bowl Blues LyricsI just blowed in and I got them dust bowl blues
I just blowed in and I got them dust bowl blues
I just blowed in and I'll blow back out again
I guess you've heard about every kind of blues
I guess you've heard about every kind of blues
But when the dust gets high, you can't even see the sky
I've seen the dust so black that I couldn't see a thing
I've seen the dust so black that I couldn't see a thing
And the wind so cold, boy, it nearly cut your water off
I seen the wind so high that it blowed my fences down
I've seen the wind so high that it blowed my fences down
Buried my tractor six feet underground
Well, it turned my farm into a pile of sand
Yes, it turned my farm into a pile of sand
I had to hit that road with a bottle in my hand
I spent ten years down in that old dust bowl
I spent ten years down in that old dust bowl
When you get that dust pneumony, boy, it's time to go
I had a gal, and she was young and sweet
I had a gal, and she was young and sweet
But a dust storm buried her sixteen hundred feet
She was a good gal, long, tall and stout
Yes, she was a good gal, long, tall and stout
I had to get a steam shovel just to dig my darlin' out
These dusty blues are the dustiest ones I know
These dusty blues are the dustiest ones I know
Buried head over heels in the black old dust
I had to pack up and go
An' I just blowed in and I'll soon blow out againEmbed
