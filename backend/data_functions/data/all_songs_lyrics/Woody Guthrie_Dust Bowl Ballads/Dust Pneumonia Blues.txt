Dust Pneumonia Blues LyricsI got that dust pneumony, pneumony in my lung
I got the dust pneumony, pneumony in my lung
An' I'm a-gonna sing this dust pneumony song
I went to the doctor, and the doctor, said, "My son"
I went to the doctor, and the doctor, said, "My son
You got that dust pneumony an' you ain't got long, not long"
Now there ought to be some yodelin' in this song
Yeah, there ought to be some yodelin' in this song
But I can't yodel for the rattlin' in my lung
My good gal sings the dust pneumony blues
My good gal sings the dust pneumony blues
She loves me cause she's got the dust pneumony, too
It it wasn't for choppin' my ho would turn to rust
If it wasn't for choppin' my ho would turn to rust
I can't find a woman in this black ol' Texas dust
Down in Oklahoma, the wind blows mighty strong
Down in Oklahoma, the wind blows mighty strong
If you want to get a mama, just sing a California song
Down in Texas, my gal fainted in the rain
Down in Texas, my gal fainted in the rain
I throwed a bucket o' dirt in her face just to bring her back againEmbed
