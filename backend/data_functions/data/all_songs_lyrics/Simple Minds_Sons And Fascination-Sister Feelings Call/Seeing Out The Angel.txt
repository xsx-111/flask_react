Seeing Out The Angel LyricsVoice leading to voices
Last song that the land sings
In colourful breathless emotional sea
Leaving us in this way
Seeing out the angel
From the shadow of a day
That stands alone and crying young
Singing fascination
For the twist in anxious days
That stand alone and crying young
See out the angels
For the rescue pools of life
That stand alone and crying young
Rescue by the first light
Receiving us with these tears
Feeling your gaze in the back of my eyes
Leaving worlds this way
In voice leading to voices
Last song that the land sings
In colourful breathless emotional sea
Leaving us this way
Seeing out the angels
Singing fascination...Embed
