20th Century Promised Land LyricsStories came like the wind
Joining every bridge in the wind
Ringing out footsteps
Calling out stell-heels
I give voice
I give breath
Count out evenings and stars
How fast can these things move on
Taking roots back to yourself
And the reason for fear was moving on
And on
Some time
Great times
Troubled time
Fire for the times
Ringing out footsteps
Calling out steel-heels
Promised land
Great times in commotion
Here come every day
It only lasts an hour
Unhappy the land that has no heroes
No! Unhappy the land that needs heroes
And the reason for fear was moving on
The speed of light was moving on
Don't cry
Tears are only wasted waters
Some say God her only loves the proud
Be damned on luck
But not dishearted
Nothing to prove
And nothing to present
I give voice
I give breath
Catching winds in my hand
My hand
Some times
Great times
Catching wind in my hand
My hand
Some times
Great times
Troubled times
Fire for the times
Ringing out footsteps
Calling out steel-heels
Promised land
Great times in commotion
Here comes every dat
It only lasts an hour
Unhappy the land that has no heroes
No! Unhappy the land that needs heroes
I'll call you out
I'll scream you out
And I don't care if you're afraid
When city sounds invade the air
Catch the wind in their hands
Promised land
Catch the wind in their hands
Promised lands
Promised lands
Promised lands
Great times in commotionEmbed
