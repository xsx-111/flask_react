Love Song Lyrics
In coats of many colour
Reptile man drop
Stay below it, stay below it
Stay below it, stay below it
Temperature drop
America's a boyfriend
Untouched by flesh of hand
Heartbeat under, heartbeat under
Heartbeat under, heartbeat under
Some promised land

Love song
Love song
Love song
Love song
On and on and
On and on and

Flesh of heart, heart of steel
So well, so well
I cut my hair, paint my face
Break a finger, tell a lie
So well, so well
America's a boyfriend
Untouched by flesh of hand
Stay below it, stay below
In glory days that come and go
Some promised land

Stay below
Shout below
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel
Flesh of heart
Heart of steel

Love song
Love song
Love song
A love song

Stay below
Shout below
In glory days
That come and go
Stay below
Shout below
In glory days
That come and go
