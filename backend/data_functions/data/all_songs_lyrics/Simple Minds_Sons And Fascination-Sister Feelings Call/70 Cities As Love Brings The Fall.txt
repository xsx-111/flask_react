70 Cities As Love Brings The Fall LyricsHe wants the world
Screams everything
Follows in love
Love brings the fall
She is a country
Feel for life
Follows in love
Love brings the fall
First tear forms in the right eye
This is the eye that's crying first
First tear forms in the right eye
This is the eye that's crying first
Going somewhere
Getting someplace
Going somewhere
Follows in love
Love brings the fall
Going somewhere
Getting someplace
Going somewhere
Follows in love
Love brings the fall
Going somewhere
Getting someplace
Going somewhere
Follows in love
Cities heavy
Moving breathing
Follows in love
Love brings the fall
The need to draw blood somehow
Follows in love
Love brings the fall
Breath is in
Breath is out
I'm not seeing anything
I see too much
When the otherside of midnight calls
Remind me I'm glad to be here
First tear forms in the right eye
This is the eye that's crying first
In seventy cities
In seventy cities
Oh no oh no oh no no no
Here it comes Here it comes
Here it comesEmbed
