Careful In Career LyricsCareful In Career
Take care
I take care
It's a shame
To go away
It's a shame to go away
It's a shame
To die already
Looking at you
Looking in through at me
Pouring X years of life
Pouring in ecstasy
Performance or ecstasy
I'm looking at you
Looking in through at me
I've come so far already
I've come so far already
So far
I've come so far
Careful In Career
Take care
I take care
I see the lodgers
They are walking
Hands over my eyes
I see you yawning
Shambling
Drugged up by the heat and so
Looking at you
Looking in through at me
Pouring X years of life
Pouring in ecstasy
In performance or in ecstasy
I'm looking at you
Looking in through at me
I've come so far already
I've come so far already
It's a shame
Looking at you
Looking in through at me
All in ecstasy
I've come so far already
All in ecstasy
I've come so far already
All in ecstasy
I've come so far already
I've come so far
I've come so far
It's a shame
It's a shame
Looking at you
Looking in through at meEmbed
