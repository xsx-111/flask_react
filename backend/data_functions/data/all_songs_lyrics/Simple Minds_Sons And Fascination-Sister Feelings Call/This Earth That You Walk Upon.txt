This Earth That You Walk Upon LyricsWhat's your name?
What's your nation?
Sense of order
Sense of speed
Earth that you walk upon
Shakes his hand
Turns away
Turns his back and walks away
Earth that you walk upon
Earth that you walk upon
What's your name?
What's your nation?
Sense of order
Sense of speed
Earth that you walk upon
Passing on and on
Earth that you walk upon
Screaming edge of light
Shines so shines so hard
Earth that you walk upon
Turning onEmbed
