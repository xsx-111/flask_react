Wonderful In Young Life Lyrics
Wonderful In Young Life
Two weeks in another town
Sending shivers along in the spine
Of your friends when they call
Here she comes
The wild wind blows
In rhythms of season
In young life and reasons
Deceiving and pleasing to some
Wild girls wild
In epic beauty wild
Surviving these changes
In paces and faces
In free wonder
Free wonder
Free wonder style

Wonderful
Little Egypt eyes
Wonderful
And the world can't wait
Wonderful
And the beat's white hot
Wonderful
Dream dream dream
It's the eighties youthful theme
Loving the city
A theme for great cities
And loved ones
And love
Memorize
A crowded swallow skies
Whatever the weather
The climate is perfect for
So young
And so young in life
An angel day
Angels coming your way
Screaming food fortune
And follow
And look at the memories
That are stuck in our eyes


Wonderful In Young Life
Two weeks in another town
Sending shivers along in the spine
Of your friends when they call
Here she comes
The wild wind blows
In rhythms of season
In young life and reasons
Deceiving and pleasing to some
Wild girls wild
In epic beauty wild
Surviving these changes
In paces and faces
In free wonder
Free wonder
Free wonder style

God I'm singing memories
Hey I'm singing memories
Look I'm singing memories
Here she comes - wonderfulEmbed
