Poop Ship Destroyer Lyrics
Let me lock you in the system
At warp 2
Push it on into systematic overdrive
You know what to do
Let's cruise past all the golden poo
That makes me blue
These things gonna help you do better
Poop, poop

Poop ship, poop ship, ship destroyer
On the poop ship, poop ship, ship destroyer

Let me jam all the frequencies
On channel 2
I was chewin' on this brownie
And I think I'm almost through
Let's cruise!
The chocolate stew was u know who
I told you to jam the frequency
This sector's chartered by you

Everybody, poop ship on the poop ship destroyer
The poop ship poop ship destroyer
Poo poo poo poo pooEmbed
