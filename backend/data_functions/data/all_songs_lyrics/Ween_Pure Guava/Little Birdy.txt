Little Birdy Lyrics
Oh, little birdy
Oh, little birdy

I saw the little birdy sing
He sang with glee and everything
He sang for spring, and sang for me
And everything was so happy
I don't know why, I want to fly
I try to sigh, I try to fly
Made a tie, then they try
To get me down, I want to buy
And make me fly, get me high
So I can try, then you try
The little birdy start to cry, so happy

Little birdy
Why so happy?
Little birdy
Why so happy?

Can I touch your birdy wing?
Try and hop and everything
Can the sun reach down on us?
And through the heavens, oh we would sing
I want the birdy, make me laugh
See the birdy, make me laugh
Take a little birdy bath
I don't know why it got me high
I don't know why I don't know why
It cannot die it sang too high
And all the birds on the wing sang
So together
I saw the little birdy sing
He sang with glee and everything
He sang for spring, and he sang for me
And everything was so happy
I don't know why I want to fly
I try to sigh I try to fly
And made a tie and then they try
To get me down, I want to buy
Make me fly, get me high
Get me try, then you try
The little birdy start to cry, so happy

Birdy
Little birdy
Little birdy

Can I touch your birdy wing?
Fly and hop and everything
Can the sun reach down on us?
And through the heavens oh, we would sing
The birdy make me laugh
See the birdy, make me laugh
Take a little birdy bath
I don't know why he got me high
I don't know why I don't know why
It cannot die, it sang so high
And all the birdies on the wing sang together
So together
So together1Embed
