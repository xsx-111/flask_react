Reggaejunkiejew LyricsI don't know where you're comin' from
But I wish you'd go away
And I don't know where you get your money from
But I wish I didn't have to be the one to pay
And I'm not sure how to say this
And I'll seal it with a kiss
Do up a bag and drop dead, motherfucker
So I can hang out with Chris, ohhh
What can you do
When your world's been invaded by a reggaejunkiejew
And what can you do
When the things that made you happy now only make you blue?
Take a permanent vacation
Get the fuck out of town
Go see Jamaica, motherfucker
Let your dreadlocks down
All that you speak is bullshit
And all the people you know
Maybe some people like to eat it
But I think you're a dick
What can you do
When your world is invaded by a reggaejunkiejew
And what can you do
When the things that made you happy now only make you blue?
Come on
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew
Matzofarian, reggaejunkiejew, fuck you
Reggaejunkiejew, fuck you
Reggaejunkiejew, fuck you
Reggaejunkiejew, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
