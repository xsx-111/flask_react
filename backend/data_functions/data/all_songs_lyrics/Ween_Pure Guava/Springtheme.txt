Springtheme LyricsGood morning, my love
The skies are clearing up today
Can I kiss you on the boob
Like I did yesterday
You let me in
You let me sin
You made me cry
You got me high
Can I touch you in the nude?
You're lookin really good in bed
How come you ain't talkin
Like we was yesterday
You let me in
You let me sin
You made me cry
You got me high
Wake up little wake up
Got somethin new to say
Don't move a muscle
I'm gettin' dressed and I can't stay
You let me in
You let me sin
You made me cry
You got me high
Got me high got me high got me high high highEmbed
