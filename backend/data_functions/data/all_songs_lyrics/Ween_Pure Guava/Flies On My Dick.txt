Flies On My Dick LyricsOh sweet mindfuck lady
Please love me like you do
Plagued by an image of days long gone
Flies on my dick
Never sit alone on a hot sticky noon
With flies on your dick
I'm just a boy with a gypsy nun
I love it when you stick me with your staff
Oh sweet mindfuck lady
Smashed with a nightmare
All alone with flies on my dick
Have a beautiful pain
It always rains in your bed
When I'm wet with truth
I'll say it with sooth
I know what I must do
Sweetheart - nun - gypsy
I know what i must do
So afraid I know what I must do
So afraid I know what I must doEmbed
