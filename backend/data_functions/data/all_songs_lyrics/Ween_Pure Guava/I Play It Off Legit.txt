I Play It Off Legit LyricsWhere've you been?
I was out with Pat
Was she shootin' shit?
Yeah, but I played it off legit
Talkin' to some Joe, hangin' out, shootin' shit
Tried to tell me somethin', I play it off legit
How did you handle it?
I played it off legit
So pleasant when the sails of the seas of Orion gently slip
No more need for God's sorrow, I just play it off legit
Dude's hounding this bitch, okay, I'm checkin' out the shit laughin' (Yeah)
Later on I'll fuck her (oh man), she knows I'm legit
(She gotta know that)
(That's right)
(From the start)
(Bitch was houndin' and shit)
(Tell me about that sexy scorpion)
A sexy scorpion that stings her with wit
I play it off legit because I know I'm legit, yeah
(That's right dude, I know you're legit)
(Uh huh)
(Played it off cool)
My mom bought me a cool shirt, when I wear it I'm the shit
I'm really not that legit, my mom bought it
(She wasn't playing it off legit either)
(Nah, she knows I'm legit)
(Did you clap when you saw her?)
I clapped when I saw her, when I found her, you split
When I'm on the go, you know I'm legit
(I mean, I was really legit, up on the go that time)
(Ah you were, you were out with Pat)
(laughter)
(...know I'm legit)
(You know I'm legit)
(Go)
(Do it- keep going... tell 'em about Joe)
Talkin' to some Joe, (some Joe) hangin' out, shootin' shit (right)
Tries to tell me somethin', (right) I play it off legit (that's right)
(You wanna hear about the scorpion?)
(Laughter)Embed
