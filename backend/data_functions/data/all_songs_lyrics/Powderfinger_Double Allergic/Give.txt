Give LyricsI keep looking back for clues
They're all mine
And I keep pulling back from truths
You're all mine to give
All mine to give x2
All mine
Lies to relieve and soothe
They're all mine
And I would break the holy rules for you
You're all mine to give
All mine to give x6
All mine
Got your brakes on
And I should run a mile from you
You're all mine to give
All mine to give
All mine to give x10
All mineEmbed
