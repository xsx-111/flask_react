Oipic LyricsFar may you run from what you know
Sermons homespun before the show
One superjudge that brings a change in taste
The new seasons king with a brand new face
The old seasons bloom seemed to run its race
And we standby for your word
Truth and intent will lose the day
Music's revenge to pave the way
Play favourites with a view to changing taste
The new seasons king with a brand new face
The old seasons bloom seemed to run its race
And we standby for your wordEmbed
