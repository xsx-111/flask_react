JC LyricsJesus christ, what name do you go by now
Time is passing with the wind blows new decrees
Canned for life your used by date is faded
And followers of you now watch tv
What could i do
And tonight your dress is looking shaded
The colours don't seem to captivate
Count the loss i see your moving on now
Pressures off no more people to drag you down
What could i do
On my own I stand naked
Jesus christ, don't look at me that wayEmbed
