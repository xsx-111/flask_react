Glimpse LyricsTell me when does your justice start
What you say and what I see they are miles apart
Now I'm as guilty as any man or woman I declare
Of apathy and selfish greed and self interested affairs
Now why must we accept these things when after all
They're only handed down
Tell me when does your mercy begin
What you say and what I see
Looks like its come to an endEmbed
