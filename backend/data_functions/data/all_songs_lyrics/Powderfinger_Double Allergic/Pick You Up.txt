Pick You Up Lyrics
When you are set to throw in your hand
When you are far from home
When what you believe is buried in your hands
When you feel outgrown

I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

When your speech is slow
When your eyes are closed
When you feel betrayed
When your heart is frayed
When your feet are cold
When your sights are low

I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

When you are set to throw in your hand
When you are far from home
When what you believe is buried in your hands
When you feel outgrown

I'll be the one to pick you up again
When you decide you've had enough of it
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the one

When you decide you've had enough
When you decide you've had enough
When you are set to throw in your hand
When you've had enough
When you're set to throw in your hand
When you're set to throw in your hand
When you're set to throw in your handEmbed
