Take Me In LyricsSea uprising takes me in
The crimes I'm fighting break my skin
Sea uprising takes me in
I don't know
I don't know
You might have to take me in
You might have to break me in
These rules and systems are losing ground
What I believe in is breaking down
This blind direction is lost and found
I don't know
How far to go
You might have to take me in
You might have to break me inEmbed
