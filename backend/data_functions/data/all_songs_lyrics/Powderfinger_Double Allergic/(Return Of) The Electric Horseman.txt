(Return Of) The Electric Horseman LyricsIn my head, inside my dreams
Under my hand as no-one's seen
Bent to the will of the others
Stange kind of day to discover
That all seasons fail and recover
So don't tie the hands of your brother
All seasons fail and recover
Home ground relief from a name
Never to breathe and remain
And in your climb to be unique
Why don't you see you have all turned out the same
Now all seasons fail and recover
So don't tie the hands of your brother
All seasons fail and recover
So don't tie the hands
Don't tie the hands
Don't tie the hands
How do I decide where to go, if I don't know who to bring
Share secrets with the grapes and the wind
How do I decide where to go, if I don't know where I've been
Share secrets with the wine and the wind
Now all seasons fail and recover
Don't tie the hands of your brothers
All seasons fail and recover
Don't tie the hands of your brothers
Don't tie the hands
Don't tie the hands
And in your climb to be unique
Why don't you see you have all turned out the same...Embed
