Skinny Jean LyricsYou got knee high boots to hide focaccia fruit
You better think twice about the soy milk drink babe
You got a patent handbag and solid state rags
You won't think twice about the bill will you baby
Should I be the one to say that you don't need it
Skinny jean crushed a kenyan roast bean
Raoul devours another organic buffet
They're so presservative free to keep their smokescreen
Should I be the one to say you don't need that
Style guide never would proclaim that you don't need it
They say you like it sundried tell me is that right
They say you like it sundried tell me is that right
Skinny jean loves brazilian roast beans
Raoul wood fires a tandoori pizza today
Special filter gonna keep them out of harms way
Should i be the one to say that you don't need that
Too tired to survive the day a brew might fix it
Skinny jean we all die somtime
They say you like it sun dried tell me am I right againEmbed
