Living Type LyricsYou'll be there to break my fall
To reassure my doubts and faults
And all your fables will ring true
They are the lies you lean on too
There's love on your breath
I'd better not say
About the blood on your hands
There's love on your breath
I'd better not say
About the blood on your hands
You hold the future in your hands
And sullen eyes soothe and command
A graceful mouth your deadly tool
Too bad the truth has fallen through
There's love on your breath
I'd better not say
About the blood on your hands
There's love on your breath
I'd better not say
About the blood on your hands
The incarnation of a Christ
Manipulation
There's love on your breath
I'd better not say
About the blood on your hands
The cross on your head
Tell me what does that say
About the blood on your dress?
The cross on your head
What does that say
About the blood on your dress?Embed
