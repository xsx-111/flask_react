Fripp LyricsThere's a shark shaped fin
In the water of my dreams
An alligator screams from the depths there
I'd swim with you there
I'd swim with you there, yeah yeah
In the house that I use
There's a psycho on the loose
He's playing with the fuse of a bomb there
I could live with you there
I could live with you there
Bye bye long day
I need to sleep so much
You shine on me
Too much is not enough
On the sheets and pillow case
In my bed for heaven's sake
The devil's dancing until late in my head there
But I could sleep with you there
I could sleep with you there
Always
Always
Bye bye long day I need to sleep so much
Nineteen hours straight
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Undivide your love
Undivide your loveEmbed
