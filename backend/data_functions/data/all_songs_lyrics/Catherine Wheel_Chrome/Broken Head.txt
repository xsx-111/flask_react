Broken Head LyricsStep inside my head
See how much I see
Feel how much I feel
Just this once I will...
Show you something good
A planet with no roof
The leading edge of truth
It's waiting up there
Broken head spilling air what an atmosphere
I really feel such a thrill
Broken mind come alive, imagination shines
I really feel such a thrill ooh ooh
A post euphoric grin
An astronaut I've been
Astronomic feelings
A face like luna - ah
Broken head spilling air what an atmosphere
I really feel such a thrill
Broken mind come alive my invention shines
I really feel such a thrill ooh ooh
Come into the big sleep
Donnez moi la grande surprise
Keep keep the vision clear
Come close and bring it near, it's the mother, the mother...
Broken head spilling air what an atmosphere
I really feel such a thrill
Broken mind come alive my invention shines
I really feel such a thrill ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Aah aahEmbed
