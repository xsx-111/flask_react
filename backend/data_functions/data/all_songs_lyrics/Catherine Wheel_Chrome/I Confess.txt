I Confess LyricsOh my blue-eyed boy
Built something to destroy
Is it getting high?
High
Oh you cheeky face
Shirt open to the waist
Now it's really getting cold
One more paranoia, I don't want another
Oh yes I confess, I don't want another
Yes you handsome man
Wicked boy, you sycophant
Are you ready to feel?
Deep stress, nothing new
Anxiety to use
Coming through the door
One more paranoia, I don't want another
Oh yes I confess, I don't want another
Ah... Ah...
Taken many drugs, popped so many pills
Gasp at my adventures, marvel at my thrills
One more paranoia, I don't want another
Oh yes I confess, I don't want another
One more poison thought, don't want another
Yes, yes I confess, I don't want anotherEmbed
