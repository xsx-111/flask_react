Chrome Lyrics
Can't you accept this flower hasn't grown?
Kick away the petals and come home
This is all she said
But there's something in me cold within me
A beast inside me, bold inside me

I find myself in chains
I find myself in chains

But if I had some time
I'd use it this time
Fix myself I will, I hope it's this time
And if I could only see the subtle things you see
I'd think myself so brave in victory

Step inside everything, everything's all clear
Maybe I could find some inspiration here
Because it's time to fix this thing
It's time to fix this thing

But if I had some time
I hope it's this time
Escape to somewhere beautiful
Then maybe I could really see the subtle things you see
I'd consider it such rare and privileged company

No, no, no, no
But never again, never again, never again
I'm just too close to winning
And I find myself in chains
And it's time to fix this thing

'Cos if I had some time
I'd use it this time
Escape to something beautiful
'Cos underneath the steel and rust and oil and shit
There's chrome just shining chrome

A mirror finish of my own
Alive inside this chrome
Home, home, homeEmbed
