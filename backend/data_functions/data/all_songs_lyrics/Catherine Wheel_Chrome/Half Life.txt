Half Life LyricsSo high it's hurting
So wide the line is drawn
I've gotta learn to stop myself from falling
Down so low
So don't die it's over
I've got a life, I've got a place to grow
I've gotta learn to stop myself from falling
Down so low
There's still time to grow
You know you know
It's so hard to think clearly
Clear
So clear
I've gotta learn to stop myself from falling
Down so low
There's no time to build
It's no horror film
It's so hard to think clearly
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah - ooh
There's still time to grow
You know, you know
It's so hard to think clearly
Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah...Embed
