Crank Lyrics
Love my superstitious games
Running circles round my brain
When I'm left smiling
I love to steal this living steam
My head in someone's dream
I'm tired of sleeping

Call me crank, my idea
Crank, so severe
Crank, my conscience clear

I build my canopy of steel
It fulfills my sense of real
A chrome protection

Call me crank, my idea
Crank, so severe
Crank, my conscience clear
It's clear

In this small partition, like a prison
Explode time bomb
If you know where I come from
Just call me
You call me crank, my idea
Crank, so severe
Crank, my conscience clear
Please call me crank, it's what I need
Crank, my mind in sync
Crank, my dream complete

Lay down, lay down, lay downEmbed
