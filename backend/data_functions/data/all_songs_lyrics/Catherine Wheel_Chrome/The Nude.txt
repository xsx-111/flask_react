The Nude LyricsYou're making me doubt myself
This feeling I know so well
Visions of naked greed
Are visions I just don't need
Far deep, phantom seeking, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Far from living, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
The texture of moistened skin
All over this skin I've been
Skin that's been angel stretched
No muscle or excess flesh
Far deep, phantom seeking, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Far from living, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
You're making me doubt myself
This feeling I know so well
Feeling of naked lust
This feeling I love so much
Far deep, phantom seeking oh you are
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Phantom breathing oh you are
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Upon the wall, the life is drawn
The love is lost, the truth will fall
The sinking ship, the sinking soul
The final fear
The picture on the wallEmbed
