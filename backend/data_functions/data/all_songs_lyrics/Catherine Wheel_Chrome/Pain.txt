Pain LyricsBefore the summer fell I already knew
She said I was more than dead
I already knew
Pain, here it comes again
Pain, I just can't take this anymore
Pain, here it comes again
Pain, a knife behind the eyes, a vicious size
Again
I miss my best friend, a growing fear
A lot to sacrifice
Or draw to an end
Pain, here it comes again
Pain, I just can't take this anymore
Pain, here it comes again
Pain, a knife behind the eyes, a vicious size
Again, again, again, again, again, again
Pain, here it comes again
Pain, I just can't take this anymore
Pain, here it comes again
Pain, a knife behind the eyes
A vicious, vicious, vicious pain
Pain, here it comes
Pain, here it comes
Pain, here it comesEmbed
