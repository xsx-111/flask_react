Ursa Major Space Station LyricsThere's no doubt
Of the future in my head
It's all worked out
I'd hate it to go left unsaid
I'd follow you through time
'Til it's not worth living
And if somewhere there's a sign
That I just don't know
Then I just won't show you
I'll make it easy
All the time
Shake it out
There's no doubt
Of the purpose in my mind
It's all worked out
I'll make it easier to find
I'd follow you through time
'Til it's not worth living
And if somewhere there's a sign
That I just don't know
Then I just won't show you
I'll make it easy
All the time
Shake it out
It's no crime
From the middle
From the sides
Shake it out
Shake it out
Ahs
Ahs
Let's take a rocket ship to Mars
And anchor off the satellite for lonely hearts
Such a special place
In outer spaceEmbed
