What a Bastard the World Is LyricsEarly in the morning I feel my pillow
I listen to the soundless phone
My thighs are sweaty, freezing inside
Our beds empty as ever
What a bastard you are
Leaving me all night missing you
Slowly the door opens, you stand for a while
See if I'm asleep or just closing my eyes
I quickly get up and throw my pillows
Throw an ashtray filled with butts
Where were you all night, if I may ask you so?
Though I don't care at all, I'd just like to know
Right! You weren't near the phone to call me from
Or is it you were afraid to wake me up?
I'm sick and tired of listening to the same old crap
You know half the world is occupied with you pigs
I can always get another pig like you
You've heard of female liberation, well that's for me
You'll see me walk out one day and then where will you be?
But don't you be too happy
I ain't walking out yet to give you satisfaction
I'm first gonna find something other than the walls
To have some human conversation
Then I'll glow, Ill be happy inside, my limbs will relax
And I can walk out into the world, singing with my people
But now I couldn't even move my muscles to go near the door
I've been sitting here too long and my legs are numb
Are you listening, you jerk, you pig, you bastard
You scum of the earth, you good for nothing
Are you listening?
Oh, don't go, don't go
Please, don't go
I didn't mean it, I'm just in pain
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
The door is closed, She's left alone
Making herself a breakfast
Her hands are shaking, her eyes looking out
Watching the trees grow day by day
What a bastard the world is
Taking my man away from me
Taking the world away from me
Female lib is nice for Joan of Arc
But its a long, long way for Terry and Jill
Most of us were taught not to shout our will
Few of us are encouraged to get a job for skill
And all of us live under the mercy of male society
Thinking that their want is our needEmbed
