Winter Song LyricsI know you now for a thousand years
Your body still feels nice and warm to me
The sun is old, the winter's cold
The lake is shining
Like a drop of Buddha's tears
The mountains lie in a distance
Like the future we'd never reach
And I keep my warmth
With your body close
The world must be dead
We must be the only heads
Ticking on a hillside
Like a leftover timebomb
I know you now for what you are
And my mind still goes through
Ups and downs with yours
The moon is clear, the room is bare
The bed is shining like an old scripture
That's never been opened before
And I keep my warmth with your mind close
The world must be dead
We must be the only heads
Ticking in a farmhouse
Like a forgotten timebomb
One day we discovered that the clock
Was not ticking anymore
And our bodies kept spreading rapidly
Like a very very fine tissue
Until it stretched over the whole wide worldEmbed
