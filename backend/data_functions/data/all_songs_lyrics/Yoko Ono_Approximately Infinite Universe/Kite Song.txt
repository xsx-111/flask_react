Kite Song LyricsI flew a kite, i held on tight to its string
Each time i go anywhere, i held on tight
In the middle of the night i woke up in fright
Thinking maybe in my dream i let go of my kite
When i was in a restaurant, talking to my friends
Watching their mouths move faster and faster
I thought of the kite that was flying in the sky
And made sure that my hand was holding the string
That was a long time ago
Many skies went by since then
Now my hands stopped holding anything
And i've learnt to take a walk instead
Then one day in the evening light
I saw something strange shining bright
The sky was dark, with swarms of larks
And in the midst of it all, yes, it was my kite
How did the kite get there, i'll never know
Floating away among the clouds to where nobody knows
I held my gun with both my hands
Slowly aiming at the shining dot
The shot went off, the dot blew off
Since then i've never seen the kite againEmbed
