Air Talk LyricsOne, two, three, four, five, six
It's sad that air is the only thing we share
No matter how close we are there's always air between us
It's also nice that air's something we all share
No matter how far apart we are an air links us
It's sad that past is something we can never share
No matter how close we are the past is between us
But it's also nice that without the past
We'd have never known each other
No matter how far apart we are it brought us together
Yes, it's very nice to have someone to share
There's something very nice to have someone to care
We may not share our past but we have our future to share
It's sad that life is such a heavy thing to bear
No matter how close we are it's easy to despair
It's also nice that you and I know it's what we all share
No matter how far apart we are we can learn to care
There's something very nice to have something to share
There's something very nice to have someone to care
We may not share our bodies but we have our minds to share
Yes, there's something very nice to have something to care
There's something very nice to have someone to share
We may not share our language but we have the world to shareEmbed
