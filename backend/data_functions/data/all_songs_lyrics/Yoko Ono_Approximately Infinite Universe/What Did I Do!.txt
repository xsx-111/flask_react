What Did I Do! LyricsI was looking for something in the closet
I was sure it would be there
But to my surprise it wasn't there
And I had to look all over the world
I was telling anybody I need to find it now
It's very important to find it now
I wasn't surprised that they didn't care
And I had to look for it myself
Where is it? where is it?
Oh, where could it be?
Why don't you help me look for it?
Why don't you help me look for it?
I kept on looking for the thing they say was
There
But I couldn't find it anywhere
And to my dismay, I didn't even remember
What I was supposed to look for anyway
What is it? what is it?
Oh, what could it be?
Why don't you tell me what it is?
Why don't you tell me what it is?
I was looking for something I knew was in my
Head
I wasn't sure if it were dead
But to my dismay, it was still there
I had to close the door real fast
What did I do? what did I do?
Oh, what did I do?
Why didn't I look in the closet instead?
Why didn't I look in the closet instead?
I was looking for my head in the closet
I was sure it would be there
But to my surprise it wasn't there
And I had to look all over the world
Where is it? where is it?
Oh, where could it be?
Why don't you help me look for it?
Why don't you help me look for it?Embed
