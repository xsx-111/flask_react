Waiting for the Sunrise LyricsWaiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
So I can take your hand
And stroll about
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
So we can go on the streets
And see the people smile
Give me your hand
So I could tell you that
Things will be alright
The rooms still dark
But it won't be so long
And I can take you outside
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
So we can go to the park
And roll about
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
So we can go to the docks
And watch the boats go by
Come on, love
Give me your hand
And things will be alright
The room's still cold
But it won't be so long
That we can go outside
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
So I could see your hair
Shining in the air
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
So I can see the sky
Reflected in your eyes
Come on, love
Don't be depressed
Things will be alright
The room's too low
But it won't be so long
That we can be outside
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunrise
Waiting for the sunriseEmbed
