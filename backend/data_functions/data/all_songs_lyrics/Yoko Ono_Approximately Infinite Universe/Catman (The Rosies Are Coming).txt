Catman (The Rosies Are Coming) LyricsCatman, you're looking cool today
We say, catman, umm, catman, umm
My name is rosy and my hangs on you
Catman, umm, catman
So keep your high-heel boots and your knee-high mind
Come up to my pad and see my work
Go for a meal and hear my joke
Or get in a bag and take a poke
But don't be too clever or we'll kick your fillies in
Look out, look out
The rosies are coming to town
Look out, catman, look out, catman
The rosies are flashing along
Catman, we feel a fool today
I say, catman, umm, catman, umm
My name is rosy and my wangs on you
Catman, umm, catman
So leave your well polished tail and your uptight suit
Show us some funnies that are better than daddies
Or bake us some cakes that are better than mommies
Or give us your witties that are trapped in your willies
But don't be too clever or we'll scratch your goodies out
Watch out, watch out
The rosies are riding the town
Watch out, catman, watch out, catman
The rosies are slashing about
Catman, shining your tools today
They say, catman, umm, catman, umm
My name is rosy and my fangs on you
Catman, umm, catman
So save your thigh high thoughts and your banana skin
We'll burn your pansies and give you a bug
We'll squeeze your lemon and give you a mug
We'll cut your daisies and give you a slug
And don't be too clever or we'll blow your sillies off
Keep out, keep out
The rosies are passing the town
Keep out, catman, keep out, catman
The rosies are bashing around
Coochy coochy coo, bunny bunny boo, patti patti poo
Catman! catman! where are you?
Don't be a prune, catman, give us all you've got
Your blueberry eyes and your evergreen lies
'cause after all, by this fall you might grow too old
And you can't ask your mommy to use an old fruity in her pie
Patter cake, patter cake, baker's man
Bake me a cake as slow as you can
Pat it, and prick it, and mark it with 'o'
And put it in the oven for me and my mo
Batter cake, batter cake, baker's girl
Fake me a cake as fast as you curl
Bat it, and whip it, and mark it with blood
And throw it in the oven with trickles and mud
Wetter cake, wetter cake, baker's boy
Make me a cake that's sweet as your toy
Wet it, and slick it, and mark it with 'p'
And leave it in the oven for lizzie and me
Catman! catman!
Hey, dumballs, get me a pair of rubber dolls, will you!
Catman!
Catman!
Catman!
Man -
Catman!
Catman!
Catman!
Catman!
Catman!
Catman!
Catman!
