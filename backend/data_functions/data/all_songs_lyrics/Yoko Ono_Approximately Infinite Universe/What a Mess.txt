What a Mess LyricsIf you keep hammering anti-abortion
We'll tell you no more masturbation for men
Ev'ry day you're killing living sperms in billions
So how do you feel about that, brother?
What a waste, what a waste
What a waste, what a waste
To have to talk to a phony like you
If you keep telling us we're more than equal
We'll tell you equal is not equal enough
For centuries we've been taking your double ass deal
So what do you say to that, brother?
What a drag, what a drag
What a drag, what a drag
To have to cope with a crazy like you
Brrrr
Ah
Ah
Ah
If you keep laying on money or power
We'll tell you meanwhile your sprinkler is out of soda
So keep off our grass till you're in some kinda order
What do you say to that, brother?
What a mess, what a mess
What a mess, what a mess
To have to put up with a fuzzy like youEmbed
