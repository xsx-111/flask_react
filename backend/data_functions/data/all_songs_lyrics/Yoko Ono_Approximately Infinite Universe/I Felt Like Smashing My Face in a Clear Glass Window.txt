I Felt Like Smashing My Face in a Clear Glass Window LyricsAll day long, I felt like
Smashing my face in a clear glass window
But instead, I went out
And smashed up a phone box 'round the corner
I never had a chance to choose my own parents
I'd never know why I should be stuck with mine
Mommy's always trying not to eat
And daddy's always smelling like he's pickled in booze
I never had a chance to choose my own name
I'd never know why I should be stuck with mine
Mommy's always talkin' 'bout family pride
And daddy's always hiding 'bout his weekend rides
All day long, I felt like
Smashing my neck in a clear glass window
But instead, I went out
And smashed up a station wagon 'round the block
I looked at the mirror and told myself
I'm glad I still don't look like them, at least
Mommy's like a film star in a distorted mirror
Daddy's like a guy who lost his stomach in the war
I went to shake hands with the president in Miami
I went to a rock show to see Mick Jagger
And you'd never believe it, surprise of my life
They had paint on their faces, just like my mommy's
Am I going crazy, or is it just you, daddy?
Am I going nuts, or is it just you, mommy?
Am I plain gone, or is it the world?
Daddy, i'd rather have you dead than crazy
Trying to talk to them is like eating tv dinner when you're angry
Trying to get their love is like watching ice cream ad when you're hungry
They gave me a watch that's guaranteed not to break
But my mommy and daddy broke up last fall
Am I going crazy, or is it just you, daddy?
Am I going nuts, or is it just you, mommy?
Am I plain gone, or is it the world?
Mommy, I'd rather have you dead than crazy
All day long, I felt like
Smashing my head in a clear glass window
But instead, I went out
And smashed up a churchyard 'round the cornerEmbed
