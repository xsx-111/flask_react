Wilder Mind Lyrics
It's in my blood, it's in my water
You tried to tame me, tame me from the start
With that deadness in your eye, flash your flesh
Desperate for a need to rise
With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
And the place looks safe from harm
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind
You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love if you want
Beholden now, I find myself awake
Waiting on the edge again
You sleep so sound with your mind made up
Drinking from your cup of broken ends
With a silver crystal on
How well you used to know how to shine
And the place looks safe from harm
But I had been blessed with a wilder mind
You can be every little thing you want nobody to know
And you can try to drown out the street below
And you can call it love if you want
But I thought we believed in an endless love
But I thought we believed in an endless love
