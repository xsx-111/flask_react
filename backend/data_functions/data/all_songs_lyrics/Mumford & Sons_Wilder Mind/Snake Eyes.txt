Snake Eyes Lyrics

You hold it, in your hands
And let it flow, this cruelty
Of youth as you fall again
Alone, In the compromise of truth
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you leave it open?
And the stakes remain too high
For this silent mind
And the shake, the lonely itch
That courses down my spine
To leave a love divine
Donâ€™t leave a love divine
Its a water tight excuse
It's in the eyes
I can tell, you will always be danger
We had it tonight, why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes
I can tell you will always be danger
How does the earth around your feet
Just slip away?
And the bandit that greets you in the night
With snake eyes, the most precious kind
It's in the eyes!
I can tell, you will always be danger!
We had it tonight! Why do you always seek absolution?
It's in the eyes!
I can tell you will always be danger!
