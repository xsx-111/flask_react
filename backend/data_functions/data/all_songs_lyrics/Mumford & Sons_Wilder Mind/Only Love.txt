Only Love Lyrics
Loneliness and all
I was stuck to the spot without a friend
Alone again
And I hunger and I thirst
For some shiver
For some whispered words
And a promise to come

And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end

I didn't fool you but I failed you
In short, made a fool out of you
And a younger heart
And I rage and I rage
But perhaps I will come of age
And be ready for you

And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end
And you saw me low
Alone again
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end
Didn't they say that only love will win in the end13Embed
