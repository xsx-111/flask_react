Angeles Lyrics
Angeles

Angels, answer me
Are you near if rain should fall?
Am I to believe
You will rise to calm the storm?
For so great a treasure words will never do
Surely, if this is
Promises are mine to give you
Mine to give

Here, all too soon the day!
Wish the moon to fall and alter out tomorrow
I should know
Heaven has her way
Each one given memories to own

Angeles, all could be
Should you move both earth and sea
Angeles, I could feel
All those dark clouds disappearing

Even as I breathe
Comes an angel to their keep
Surely, if this is
Promises are mine to give you
Mine to give

Angeles
