Book of Days Lyrics

One day, one night, one moment
My dreams could be tomorrow
One step, one fall, one falter
East or west, over earth or by ocean
One way to be my journey
This way could be my book of days

Ó lá go lá, mo thuras
An bealach fada romham
Ó oíche go hoíche, mo thuras
Na scéalta nach mbeidh a choích

No day, no night, no moment
Can hold me back from trying
I'll flag, I'll fall, I'll falter
I'll find my day maybe
Far and away
Far and away

One day, one light, one moment
With a dream to believe in
One step, one fall, one falter
And a new world across a wide ocean
This way became my journey
This day ends together
Far and away

This day ends together
Far and away
Far and awayEmbed
