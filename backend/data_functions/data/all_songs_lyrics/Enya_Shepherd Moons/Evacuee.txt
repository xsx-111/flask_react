Evacuee Lyrics
Each time on my leaving home
I run back to my mother’s arms
One last hold and then it’s over

Watching me, you know I cry
You wave a kiss to say goodbye
Feel the sky fall down upon me

All I am
A child with promises
All I have
Are miles full of promises of home

If only I could stay with you
My train moves on, you’re gone from view
Now I must wait until it’s over


All I am
A child with promises
All I have
Are miles full of promises of home
Days will pass, your words to me
It seems so long, eternity
But I must wait until it’s over1Embed
