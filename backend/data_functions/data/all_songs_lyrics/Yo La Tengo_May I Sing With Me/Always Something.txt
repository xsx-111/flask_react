Always Something LyricsWell, it's raining outside
At least it's gotta be somewhere
There's a long dark cloud just moving around
Moving around
Over nothing town
And it's always something
And it's always a touch of the same
Well, the light is on
And I have to see you
But it wasn't glowing
And it wasn't on
I'd love to know
How much it glows
And it's always something
And it's always something
And it's always something, touch of the same
And it's always something
And it's always something, touch of the same
Touch of the same, touch of the sameEmbed
