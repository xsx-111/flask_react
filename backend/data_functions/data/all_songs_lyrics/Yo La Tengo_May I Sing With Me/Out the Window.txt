Out the Window LyricsI'm sitting round like I got nothing to do
Got something to say, but not to you, not now
I'm just waiting for the back and forth that won't begin
Back to back, that won't seem to end
I'm here waiting for a sign
Everything goes out the window
Watching you walk out the door tonight
When my hope falls, bounces off you, hits the floor
Splits into 2 or 3 pieces
Well, I'm still waiting on it
Down and down to the empty space where it lays
Where it falls apart
I'm stuck waiting for some sign
Everything goes out the window
Watching you walk out the door
I wrote a letter to my oldest friend
Forgot it for awhile
Then on second thought, I read it through and threw it out
I'm through waiting on a signEmbed
