Some Kinda Fatigue LyricsSitting in a parked car
Trying hard to smile
But I've been looking for one good reason
But I haven't found it yet
Took awhile, well, what's it gonna be?
The way it's got to be
I know it's out there
One good reason
But I haven't found it yet
I'm stepping away, stepping away from you
Some weird kinda fatigue
Someday I'll find it
One good reason
But I haven't found it yet1Embed
