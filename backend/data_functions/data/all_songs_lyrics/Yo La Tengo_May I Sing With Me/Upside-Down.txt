Upside-Down LyricsMary calls from far away
Sure there is another
Walks the floor cause she can't settle down
Waiting for the phone to ring
Stuck inside the bedroom
Drinks too much to make the room spin round
When she sits down
No one knows the world is upside-down
Watches how it spins around
No one knows the world is upside-down
Knowing if she'll just admit
One revealing detail
She can't hide her state of mind behind
She sits down
No one knows the world is upside-down
Watches how it spins around
No one knows the world is upside-down
Everybody wants to be the lucky guy
They're just uncertain how to please her
Everybody stops to see the setting sun
They're not just looking for the time
Caring not what people say
At other people's parties
Mary finds someone and settles down
She sits down
No one knows the world is upside-down
Watches how it spins around
No one knows the world is upside-downEmbed
