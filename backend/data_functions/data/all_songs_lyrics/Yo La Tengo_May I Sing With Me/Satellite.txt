Satellite LyricsA lonely walk until the heaven's break
Come back home and see what's changed
Flipped the TV on and every channel's got some satellite
A broken shoe to practice walking straight
Take a little step and stop to think
About the planets and the atmosphere
And the satellites
Wait for the day to come, the day to go
Take all the needles from your hair
See how the things that happen
Never really ever happen with a thought unaware
Around the corner, a while to zero in
And feel for where it ought to be
If not the nuts and bolts and that'll come
Like a satellite
Wait for the day to go, the day to come...Embed
