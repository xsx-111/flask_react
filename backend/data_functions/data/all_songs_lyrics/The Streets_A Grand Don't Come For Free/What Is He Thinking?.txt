What Is He Thinking? Lyrics
He's fucking lying, I know he is
It's written all over his face

I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)
I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)

Can't seem to do anything but stare
My C.P. coat is lying just there
Draped over the edge of that dusty chair
All fits into place suddenly, yeah
The coat was hanging up under my stairs
But one day it went leaving the cupboard bare
The facts all click in and become square
He stole it while I was unaware
But why is he denying it when it's so bate?
Looking at the telly, won't look over straight
Why is he not flapping and explaining away?
To one very fucking frustrated mate
Dan's been trusting every word Scott says
He believes in mates, fair play
But Scott's story is too far outweighed
And I'm gonna act before its too late
I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)
I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)

This must all look a bit weird
It's Mike's C.P. coat sitting here
Draped over the chair so that it appears
To all fit me up suddenly and clear
I'm gonna have to just try and volunteer
An answer 'bout the man who left the bomber here
He must've picked it up from Mike's dear girl's house
When the weather wasn't clear
The man must've thought it was Simone's coat
But didn't think it was Mike's coat, though
I can't just deny it 'cause my face shows
Looking at the telly's not aiding, no
I can't tell Mike this man didn't know
And innocently borrowed the coat at Simone's
Because then Mike would demand to know
Why this man was even at Simone's
That frown could mean anything
What the fuck am I gonna do now? He knows I'm lying
I wish I could read his mind
It's written all over my face

I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)
I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)

What the fuck's he saying she had, the garm?
Either he has gone John Barnes
Or he's trying to spin me a con's yarn
He thinks he's the fucking Don, gar
How long have I undergone his smarm?
Shrugging it all off as fun, charm
If he don't stop looking at the TV though
I'm gonna wrap the cable round his wee throat
Hang on, Scott says Simone had the coat
Where did he see her on the d-low?
What is it I don't need to know?
Is he scheming to be near Simone?
In the club, I wondered what was on the go
Dan was trying to keep Scott from being close
And Scott teefed my money and he teefed my coat
And he's trying to steal my girl from under my nose
I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)
I wish I could read what his eyes are saying
Staring straight and not blinking
He's not giving anything away
What is he thinking? (What is he thinking?)

Right, I can't be bothered with this no more
I'm gonna have to tell him, I owe him the score
I wish I could tell him about the dough on the drawers
That is something I don't know, I swore
The coat thing will look dodgy loads more
If I don't throw it down as the crow soars
I'd better put the video on pause
Face up toe-to-toe, over the floor
He really needs to know how his jacket
Miraculously appeared 'round my gaff here
And the man that left it's been shagging
Mike's girl behind Mike's back and ting
This shit's all got a bit out of hand
There's no options, I'm all down on plans
I'm just gonna have to spill it now, man
Tell Mike the person that brought the coat 'round was...
