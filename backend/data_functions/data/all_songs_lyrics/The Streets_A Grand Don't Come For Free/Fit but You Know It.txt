Fit but You Know It Lyrics
Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing but I just noticed some tan lines
On your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on, it is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked on my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Whoa! (Leave it out)
Are you smoking crack or something? (Leave it out)
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment (Leave it out)
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me (Leave it out)
Don't t—look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, "Yeah, but, what if?"
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I’ll continue
I didn’t want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like 'good', but just rude like 'uncouth'
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well, let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in 'good', I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not wanna give this satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oi, and just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't, even though you look grand
But you look sharp there, smiling hard, suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but you just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white-shirted man
I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oh, oi, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
(Whoa, we've all had a drink, mate...)
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Haha, huh, huh, huh
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it
You're fit but you know it
I think I'm going to fall over
I think I'm going to fall o–
