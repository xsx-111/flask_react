Blinded by the Lights Lyrics
That's the one, oi
How did he not find the baggy
With his hand in my shoe?
Way too close for me
Oh well, at least they allowed me through
Should be a good night in here
Rammo in the main room
People keep pushing me though
No reception on the phone

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
They said they'd be here, they said
They said in the corner
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

These look well speckled
A bit green and blue
Threes is well cheap though
So I'll take three if I need to
Right, I'm on a plan
I wish the bouncers'd go away
Borrow water off this man
Here goes nothing, okay
And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
Oh, that's proper rank
That tastes like hairspray
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

I hate coming to the entrance
Just to get bars on my phone
You have no new messages
So why haven't they phoned?
Menu: write message
"So where are you and Simone?"
Send message: Dan's number
"Where have they gone?"

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
Why's the message pending?
Where the fuck are ya?
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night
Hmm, brandy or beer?
Water's a good idea
I wish that bar lady'd appear
And come serve over here
Where the fuck could they be?
Still not over in the corner
This night's a tragedy
I keep thinking I saw her

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
No, that's not them
That's not them either
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

I'm still not feeling anything
This has got to be a dud
It's been ages since I necked it
I smoked six tabs to the nub
Belly's not even tingling
I just feel a bit pissed
No-one looks like mingling
I can't see her or him
And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
I'm gonna do another I think
Yeah, one more, these are shit
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

These toilets are a piss-take
Queue's bigger than the door
Gotta get rid of this pill taste
What are they chatting so much for?
Glad I'm not a girl in this place
They'll be here 'til dawn
Sure my belly's tingling a bit
Something's happening, I'm sure

And I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
Maybe I shouldn't have done the second one
I feel all fidgety and warm
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

Whoa, everything in the room's spinning
I think I'm gonna fall down
My heart's beating too quick
I'm fucking tripping out
I wonder whether they got in?
Turned away, no doubt
Who cares? This is a tune coming in
That one noise is like

I'm thinking
Lights are blinding my eyes
My eyes are rolling back
I'm rubbing my thighs with my hand
And I'm thinking
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night

Yeah, yeah, they cheer
Can they see my hand in the air?
I need to wave 'em over here
I swear Simone's kissing Dan
My head's twisted severe
Body is rushing everywhere
They could have texted me when they were near
But I'm fucked and I don't care

Lights are blinding my eyes
What was I thinking about?
Ah, who cares
I'm mashed
People pushing by
Then walking off into the night
Totally fucking
Can't hardly fucking stand
This is fucking amazing
