Swordfish LyricsSome people believe in astrology
Others believe in technology
Some people believe in all those "ologies"
But I believe in swordfish
He believes in swordfish
I believe in Happy Days
I believe in Joanie Loves Crotchie
I believe in all that TV crap
And I believe in swordfish
He believes in swordfish
Came up from the ghetto with the help of my stiletto
Every day I hear the people groan:
Why should we buy postage stamps?
We can make our own
We may be doing something wrong
We could be running a little too long
I guess we better end this song
I say I believe in swordfish
He believes in swordfishEmbed
