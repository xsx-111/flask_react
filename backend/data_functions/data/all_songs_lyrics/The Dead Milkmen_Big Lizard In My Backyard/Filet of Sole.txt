Filet of Sole LyricsFillet of sole baby
Is my favourite dish
Fillet of sole baby
When the dish is fish
Cause oh, I lose control
When you serve fillet of sole
Now you're cookin' baby
Got an appetite
Said you're cookin' baby
Smells out of site
Oh, I lose control
When you serve fillet of sole
Little bit of sole and I'm feelin' fine
Little bit of sole and I'm losin' my mind
I'm feeling fine
I'm losing my mind
Fillet of sole baby
Now I'm feeling fine
Fillet of sole baby
We're gonna dine
Oh, I lose control
When you serve filet of sole
Baby I love the stuff you cook
Baby I love the way you look
Ah, the way you look
Uh, that stuff you cook
Fillet of sole baby
Is my favourite dish
Fillet of sole baby
When the dish is fish
Oh, I lose control
When you serve fillet of soleEmbed
