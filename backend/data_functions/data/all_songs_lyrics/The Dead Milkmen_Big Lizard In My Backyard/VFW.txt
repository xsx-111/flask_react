VFW LyricsMom and Dad don't like me
They say I'm mean and crude
They tried to make me a good little boy
By sticking downers in my food
Fucked up world
We're all veterans of a fucked up world
Fucked up world
We're all members of a fucked up world
My neighbours try to run me down
Because I'm such a mess
Maybe it's cause of the way I look
Or maybe the way I dress
Philosophers try to put me down
Hey what's the meaning of life?
Go kill a cop and drink till you drop
Baby that's my advice
In a...
Fucked up world
We're all veterans of a fucked up world
Fucked up world
We're all members of a fucked up world
Girls don't really like me
That's why I hate myself
Maybe it's cause of the way I look
Or maybe it's something else
My room is such a pig sty
My floor has never been swept
But I've got a fuck off attitude
And that's something that should be kept
In a...
Fucked up world
We're all veterans of a fucked up world
Fucked up world
We're all members of a fucked up worldEmbed
