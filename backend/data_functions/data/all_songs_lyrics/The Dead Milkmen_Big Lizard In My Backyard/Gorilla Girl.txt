Gorilla Girl Lyrics(This is a gorilla girl)
(1.2.3)
Gave to the gorilla girl, gobs and gobs of love
No one else would touch that girl unless they wore a glove
Gifted was this girl of mine, great knowledge could she grasp
But once she ate a golf pro and vomited in the grass
But I love my groovy gorilla girl
And her groovy, gorgeous gape, oh!
And her fabulous zoo-keeper father-
My love looks like an ape!
My folks say she's wrong for me; this girl is a mistake
Whenever I date gorilla girl they whack me with a rake
Took her out to a picnic at a girl scout jamboree
Golly did those girl scouts gape at gorilla girl and me
But I love my groovy gorilla girl
And her groovy, gorgeous gape, oh!
And her fabulous zoo-keeper father-
My love looks like an ape!Embed
