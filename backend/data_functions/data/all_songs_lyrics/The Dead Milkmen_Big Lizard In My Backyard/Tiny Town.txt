Tiny Town LyricsHello, my name is Billy Bob and I don't give a damn
I got myself some white sheets straight from the Ku Klux Klan
I got myself a daughter and she's a Mongoloid
Because I married my sister and our gene pool's been destroyed
Let's do it!
This is a tiny town
And we don't want you comin' round
(x2)
We got ourself a sheriff and his name's Bobby Joe
One day he said to me "Them punk rockers gotta go"
So we hopped into his pickup truck with a gun rack on the back
And we beat up on them punks and we beat up on them blacks
Because
This is a tiny town
And we don't want you comin' round
(x2)
So if you should happen to come to our little town
It might be wise if you didn't hang around
'Cause we hate blacks and we hate Jews
And we hate punks but we love the F.U.s
Let's do it!
This is a tiny town
And we don't want you comin' round
