Laundromat Song Lyrics(1--2--1-2-1.2.3.4)
Soap and quarters and bleach and laundry
Are words I use at the laundromat
Reading the news, and watching the people
That's what I do at the laundromat
At the laundromat my heart grows fat
Ah Ah
As my clothes get dry I stop and sigh
Ah Ah
Dreaming -- Screaming
There's a girl washing her clothes
I'm in love but nobody knows
She looks sixteen or seventeen
My mind grows dirty when my clothes get clean
She's so young and tall
Ah Ah
I'm gonna give her my all (or Borax)
Ah Ah
Dreaming -- Screaming
I'm not a subtle guy
I'll go to her and sigh
"If I don't see you again my love
I must surely die."
Dreaming -- Screaming
Clothes go round and round
And my heart goes up and down
She's drying her jeans
In separate machines
She's loading up her granny cart
Ah Ah
Goin out the door; it's breaking my heart
Ah Ah
Dreaming -- ScreamingEmbed
