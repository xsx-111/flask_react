Lucky Lyrics(1.2.3.huh)
Little Billy drunk on beer
Plops down behind the steering wheel
His prom date pukes on her brand new dress
He wonders who'll clean up the mess
His car skids goes off the road
Hits a tree and then explodes
His death was quick painless they say
Hope when I die I go that way
But
You may not be so lucky (x4)
Little Debbie drunk on wine
Says she's havin' a very good time
She thinks she's havin' the time of her life
Prom date sharpens a big butcher knife
Like a cheap horror movie on the silver screen
The night is filled with deadly screams
Would've been salesman's famous capers
It even made the big city papers
You may not be so lucky (x4)
President laughs shaves his head
Pushes the button and bombs the Reds
Reds hits back with all they've got
Now we're all in the melting pot
Let's have a big cheer for the government
Who's finally ended our descent
Vaporized masses in the shopping mall
Never got to see the H-bomb fall
Little Billy drunk on beer
Plops down behind the steering wheel
His prom date pukes on her brand new dress
He wonders who'll clean up the mess
His car skids goes off the road
Hits a tree and then explodes
His death was quick painless they say
Hope when I die I go that way
But
You may not be so lucky (x3)
Never gonna be so lucky
Little Debbie drunk on wine
Says she's havin' a very good time
She thinks she's havin' the time of her life
Prom date sharpens a big butcher knife
Like a cheap horror movie on the silver screen
The night is filled with deadly screams
Would've been salesman's famous capers
It even made the big city papersEmbed
