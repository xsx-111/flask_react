Spit Sink LyricsOh come on baby take a drink
Never mind that it's a spit sink
A spit sink (x2)
It's nothing but a spit sink
Jam
Took a drink
Thought I was gonna die
Somebody told me
The water was formaldehyde
Ah take off your clothes
Don't be lonely
The sign above
Says "for Negroes only"
A spit sink (x2)
It's nothing but a spit sink
Jam
Went to the doctor
Thought I was gonna flip
He said "Boy
This is a heavy acid trip"
The world is nothing but an open sewer
The trash and slime just runs right through her
Take off your clothes
Let's jump in
We can go
For a little swim
A spit sink (x2)
It's nothing but a spit sink
Jam
Took a drink
Thought I was gonna die
Somebody told me
This water is formaldehyde
Come on baby take a drink
It's acid baby
It'll make you really thinkEmbed
