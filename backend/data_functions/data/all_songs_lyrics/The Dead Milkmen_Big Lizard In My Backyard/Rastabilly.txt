Rastabilly LyricsMy baby's got two hands
My baby's got two feet
My baby's got a forehead
And all the chicken you can eat
My baby's got two elbows
My baby sure has a nose
My baby she's got ten toes
And my baby's got a couple a' those
(You guys comin' to the Klan rally tonight?)
My baby drives a truck
My baby sure is good luck
My baby has a pet duck
And my baby is a heck of a Fffff-riend
Yeah, that's right
Somebody kicked my dog Mavis and I'm gonna find out just who the hell it was
I'm all messed up on cough syrup now, so just like never mindEmbed
