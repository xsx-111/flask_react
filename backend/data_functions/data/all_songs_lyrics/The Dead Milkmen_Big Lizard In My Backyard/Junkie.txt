Junkie LyricsMy best friend is a junkie
He shoots up all day
Sometimes he even shits himself
What else can I say?
Shoot up or shut up (x4)
If his girl don't score
He beats her black and blue
He wears his track marks like tattoos
I love to hear his junkie talk
Whenever he talks on the sidewalk
My best friend is a junkie
It's sad but true
My best friend is a junkie
What does your best friend do?
My best friend is a junkie
He shoots up all day
Sometimes he even shits himself
What else can I say?
Shoot up or shut up (x4)Embed
