Right Wing Pigeons LyricsThe town in Georgia's got a law on the books
Says if we all got guns then we won't have crooks
Now what could make them think that way?
What could make them act that way?

They're just right wing pigeons from outer space
Sent here to destroy the human race
They don't give a damn about you or me
They just buy guns and watch TV
Let's go!
The lady in Detroit owns a can of mace
Got pissed at my brother so she sprayed it in his face
Now what could make her think that way?
What could make her act that way?

She's just a right wing pigeon from outer space
Sent here to destroy the human race
She don't give a damn about you or me
She just buys guns and watches TV
The man in the White House who just don't care
He starves little kids and he dyes his hair
Now what could make him think that way?
What could make him act that way?
