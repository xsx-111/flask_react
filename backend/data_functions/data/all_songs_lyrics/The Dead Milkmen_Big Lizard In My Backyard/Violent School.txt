Violent School LyricsViolence rules! (x5)
Violence rules, guns are cool and we've got guns, in our school (x2)
20 people livin' on a desert isle
They're all friendly they all smile
Then the food supply gets too low
20 people 10 gotta go
Violence rules, guns are cool and we've got guns, in our school (x2)
1,000 people gather in the streets of Manhattan
The lights go out guess what happens?
It's time to steal, it's time to shoot!
It's time to rob... taste my boot!
Violence rules! (x5)
Violence rules, guns are cool and we've got guns, in our school (x2)
Violence rules, guns are cool (x2)
Violence rules, guns are cool and we've got guns, in our schoolEmbed
