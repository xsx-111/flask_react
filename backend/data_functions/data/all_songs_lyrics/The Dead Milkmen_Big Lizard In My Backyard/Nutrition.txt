Nutrition LyricsNow my life is easy
My life ain't hard
I'm gonna spend all day
In my fuckin' backyard
I ain't got no money
Hell, I don't care
My parents let me use their credit card
I've got nowhere to go
Just hang out on the street
My folks say I've got no ambition
At least I give a shit
About the stuff I eat
Yeah! I care about nutrition
Tried to get a job
At the retail store
But I could not stand the competition
Now I spend all my time
Hangin' out at the shore
Givin' myself a skin condition
I've got nowhere to go
Just movin' on my feet
People say I've got no ambition
At least I give a shit
About the stuff I eat
Yeah! I care about nutrition
Sometimes I get upset
When I see on the TV
All them people in this world
That is starvin'
But there's nothin' in this world
That could possibly bother me
When I smell the turkey Dad is carvin'
Boy I'm starving
Christ I'm starving!
My folks said
I gotta get myself a job
Cause they ain't gonna support me
Well, if all I am to them
Is just some lazy slob
Why didn't they abort me?
I guess I'll just hang out
On Broad and South
Livin' by my intuition
At least I give a shit
What I put into my mouth
Yeah! I care about nutrition
Nutrition
It's good for me
Nutrition
I've got vitamin C
I care (x3)
I give a healthy shit
And Mom and Dad say if I eat all of my food
I can go to the hard core show and see F.O.DEmbed
