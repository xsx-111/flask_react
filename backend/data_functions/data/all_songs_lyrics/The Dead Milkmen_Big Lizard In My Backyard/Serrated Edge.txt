Serrated Edge LyricsUp on the hilltop where the vultures perch
That's where I'm gonna build my church
Ain't gonna be no priest, ain't gonna be no boss;
Just Charles Nelson Reilly nailed to a cross
I don't piss, I don't shit, I'm gettin' no relief
People shake their heads in disbelief
GO!
Just me on a hilltop with 15 girls
In a Nelson Reilly orgy that'll make your hair curl
I don't piss, I don't shit, I'm gettin' no relief
People shake their heads in disbelief
Yeah, Charles Nelson Reilly, he's our man
He can't heal the sick with the touch of his hand
He can't walk on water, can't make wine flow;
Just another greedy actor on The Late Late Show!
I don't piss, I don't shit, I'm gettin' no relief
People shake their heads in disbelief
GO!
Just me on a hilltop with 15 girls
In a Nelson Reilly orgy that'll make your hair curl
I don't piss, I don't shit, I'm gettin' no relief
People shake their heads in disbeliefEmbed
