Beach Song LyricsSand is hurting my tender feet
The air smells like rotting fish and solarcaine
I hate the people on the beach
With their towels and umbrellas, they're so insane
I don't wanna be on the beach! No! (x2)
I don't wanna be on the beach!
I don't wanna be on the beach! No!
I hate my girlfriend, she-she-she
Lies on the beach like a barrier reef
Soaking up the stupid sun
While the radio is blasting fun, fun, fun
I don't wanna be on the beach! No fun! (x2)
I don't wanna be on the beach!
I don't wanna be on the beach! No fun! No!
(x2)
This is no way to spend a summer
I've got sand caked on my feet
I gave my ice cream to a shark
And now I've got nothing to eat
No fun!
I don't wanna be on the beach! No fun!
I don't wanna be on the beach! No fun! No!
I don't wanna be on the beach!
I don't wanna be on the beach! No funEmbed
