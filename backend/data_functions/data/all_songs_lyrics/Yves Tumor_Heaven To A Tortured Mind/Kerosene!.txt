Kerosene! Lyrics
I can be anything
Tell me what you need
I can be your baby in real life, sugar
I can live in your dreams
I can be where you need me to, baby
I can do anything
I can be what you tell me to be
I can be what you need
I can be your real life sugar
I can live in your dreams
Will you be my fantasy, little baby?
You're just what I need
Can you be my fantasy, little baby?
You're just what I need
I can be what you need, little baby
Just tell me what you need

I ain't like them other girls
Look me in the eye, tell me I'm the one
And I'll be your only boy
Oh, I can be your only girl, little baby
I can be anything you need
I need kerosene!

And I'll be your only boy
Oh, I can be your only girl, little baby
I can be everything you need
