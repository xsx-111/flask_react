Medicine Burn Lyrics
Carry me away into your spirit
I can't lift my own troubles
I've got nothing left to fear but the wilderness
I saw a man sit in front of ah, ah, ah
Scarlet colored teeth, she had seven heads
And six hundred teeth, and six hundred
And six hundred, and six hundred
Severed heads on the mental guillotine
Life of blasphemy, a room full of kings
Seven heads and six hundred teeth

Carry me away into your spirit
I can't lift my own troubles
I've got nothing left to fear but the wilderness
I saw a man sit in front of ah, ah, ah
Scarlet colored teeth, she had seven heads
And six hundred teeth, and six hundred
And six hundred, and six hundred
And six hundred, and six hundred
And six hundred, and six hundred
And six hundred, and six hundred
And six hundred, and six hundred teeth3Embed
