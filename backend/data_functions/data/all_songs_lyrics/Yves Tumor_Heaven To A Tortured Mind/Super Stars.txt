Super Stars Lyrics
You, you, you, oh, you
You, you, you, oh, you
Oh, you, you, you, oh, you
Oh, you, you, you, oh, you

Hang me like no other lover, baby
Tell me, lately, do I drive you crazy?
Baby, lady, tell me I'm your lover
Baby, love me like no other woman
I just told you I will never love her
Break me, mend me, help my heart recover

Oh, what you want me to do? (You, you)
Oh, what you want me to say? (You, oh, you)
Oh, what you want me to do? (You, you)
Baby (You, oh, you)

Girl, when I'm with you, it's like super stars
Girl, when I'm with you, it's like super stars

Hang me like no other lover, baby
Tell me, lately, do I drive you crazy?
I just told you I will never love her
Break me, mend me, help my heart recover
Girl, when I'm with you, it's like super stars
Girl, when I'm with you, it's like super stars
Girl, I can't quit you, you're my super, my super star
I can't quit you, you're my super, my super star

Rain down, rain down on me
Rain down, rain down on me
Rain down, rain down on me
Rain down, rain down on me
I love you
I hate you
But I need you
But I adore you, but girl, I-uh

Girl, I can't quit you, you're my super, my super star
I can't quit you, you're my super, my super star2Embed
