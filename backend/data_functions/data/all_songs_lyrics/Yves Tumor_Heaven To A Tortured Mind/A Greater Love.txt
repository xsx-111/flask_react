A Greater Love Lyrics
Summer, Winter, the Fall has changed, yeah
Don't you ever feel like the weather brings change, yeah, change?
Don't you ever, ever bring change, yeah, bring change?
I said, don't you ever, ever feel like the weather has change, yeah, change?

You were sent from above like the thunder when it rains
She is my lover, that would never change
She's sweet like the Summer
Why don't you feel my rain?
The way I feel, the ways I feel about you
You made me feel, your kiss so real
Baby, you bring change

And I feel so heavy in the Summer
You deserve some different kind of lover
Autumn pulls me back into slumber
Summer, SummerEmbed
