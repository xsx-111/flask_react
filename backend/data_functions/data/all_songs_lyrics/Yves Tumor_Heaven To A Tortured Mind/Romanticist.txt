Romanticist Lyrics
Two hearts, I couldn't resist the charm
Wasn't right, wandering the streets at night
We tried, got me looking everywhere
Hard road
Tell me who you are
I can be the gentle boy
Caught up in the city lights
It's alright, ten minutes till the sunrise, rise, rise

I wanna keep you close, right by my side
Swear you got me hypnotized
I wanna give you every piece of me
You know you are my everything
I wanna dance into your hurricane
Blinded by your glare again
Hard road

It was the golden age
Battered and bruised in your multicolored maze
Your mind is scattered, I've been thinking of the days
That I made progress with that sinister boy
Hard road
I wanna keep you close, right by my side
Swear you got me hypnotized
I wanna give you every piece of me
You know you are my everything
I wanna dance into your hurricane
Blinded by your glare again
Hard road9Embed
