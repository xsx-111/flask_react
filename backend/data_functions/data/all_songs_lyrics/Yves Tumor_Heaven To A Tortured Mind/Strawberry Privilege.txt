Strawberry Privilege Lyrics
I didn't know what to do
I knew I would find my way
Like they said I was supposed to, supposed to
Supposed to, supposed to
We hung out sometime
Only when I was a star (Only when I was a star)
Saw that coming a mile away
We hung out sometimes
You came out the blue
Only when I was a star
Saw that coming a mile away
We hung out sometimes

Came down, you came down inside
You made sure that I was alright
Then you left, you ran outta sight
Like you were, like you were supposed to do
Came down, you came down inside
You made sure, you asked, am I alright?
Then you left, you ran outta sight
Like you were, like you were supposed to do

I didn't know what to do
I knew I would find my way
Like they said I was supposed to, supposed to
Supposed to, supposed to, supposed to
We hung out sometimes
Only when I was a star (Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes)
Saw that coming a mile away
Sometime, maybe another day
We hold on sometimes
Came down, you came down inside
And made sure that I was alright
Then you left, you ran outta sight
Like you were, like you were supposed to do
Came down, you came down inside
You made sure, you asked, am I alright?
Then you left, you ran outta sight
Like you were, like you were supposed to do

I didn't know what to do
I knew I would find my way
Like they said I was supposed to, supposed to
Sometime, maybe another day1Embed
