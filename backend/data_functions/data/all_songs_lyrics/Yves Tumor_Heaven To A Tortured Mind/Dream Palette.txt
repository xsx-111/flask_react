Dream Palette Lyrics
Floating through what feels like
A declaration of love
Our hearts are in danger
Tell me, is this fundamental love?
A feeling you deserve
A stare you, you've seen before
Our hearts are in danger
Tell me, is this confidential love?

Floating through what feels like
A declaration of love
Our hearts are in danger
Tell me, is this fundamental love?
A feeling you deserve
A stare you, you've seen before
Our hearts are in danger
Tell me, is this confidential love?5Embed
