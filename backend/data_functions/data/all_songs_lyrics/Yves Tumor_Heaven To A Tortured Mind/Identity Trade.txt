Identity Trade Lyrics
Pure water from the fire, reflect my spirit
Pure water from the fire, reflect my spirit

We watched along for seven days in a row
I saw my first lover clutching a dagger sunk beneath the water
A tranquil heart, the last of human desire
Millions of people living on the isle sunk beneath the water

Pure water from the fire, reflect my spirit
Pure water from the fire, reflect my spirit1Embed
