Hasdallen Lights LyricsWhat are you running from?
What do you miss?
Tell me, what do you crave?
How do you feel?
What are you running from?
Tell me, what do you crave?
How do you feel?
Hustle, hustle, hustle
What are you running from?
Running from my own shadow
What do you miss?
I miss the sound of you
Tell me, what do you crave?
Hustle, hustle, hustle
How do you feel?
Trouble, trouble, trouble
What are you running from?
Tell me, what do you crave?
How do you feel?
Hustle, hustle, hustle
What are you running from?
What do you miss?
Tell me, what do you crave?
How do you feel?
What are you running from?Embed
