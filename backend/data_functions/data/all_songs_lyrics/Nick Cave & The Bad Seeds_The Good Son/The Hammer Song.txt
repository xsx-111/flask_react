The Hammer Song Lyrics
I set out on Monday
The night was cold and vast
And my brother slept
And though I left quite quietly
My father raged and raged
And my mother wept
Now, my life was like a river
All sucked into the ground

And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down

Many miles did I roam
Through the ice and through the snow
My horse died on the seventh day
I stumbled into a city
Where the people tried to kill me
And I ran in shame
Then I came upon a river
And I laid my saddle down

And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down
It knocked me to the ground
And I said now, "Please, please
Take me back to my home ground"
Lord, the hammer came down
Now, I've been made weak by visions
For many visions did I see
All through the night
In the seventh hour an angel came
With many snakes in all his hands
And I fled in fright
I pushed off into the river
And the waters came around

And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down
And it did not make a sound
And I said, "Please, please
Take me back to my home ground"
Lord, the hammer came down
And I pushed off into the river
And the waters swelled around
And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down
It did not make a sound
And I said now, "Please, please
Take me back to my home ground"
Lord, the hammer came down
And it threw me round and around
And I said, "Please, please
Take me back to my home town"
Lord, the hammer came down
And knocked me through the ground
And I got down on my knees
And I said, "Please, please"
I said "Take me to my home ground"
Lord, the hammer came down
And I said, "Please, please
Take me back to my home ground"
Lord, the hammer came down
And it threw me round and around2Embed
