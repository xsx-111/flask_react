Headstrong Lyrics
To your common sense firm arguments
I won't listen to your voice of reason
Trying to change my mind
I mind my feelings and not your words
Didn't you notice I'm so headstrong
Even when I know I'm wrong?
Take this to your heart and into your head now
Before you waste your time
Call a truce and call a draw
What's the use in mapping your views out in orderly form
When it does nothing but confuse and anger me more?
I mind my feelings and not your words
Didn't you notice I'm so headstrong
You're talking to a deaf stone wall

Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true, I'll repeat it
All is fair in love and war
That's how the famous saying goes

Open up your eyes, see me for what I am
Cast in iron, I won't break and I won't bend
Take this to your heart and into your head now
The old wives' tale is true, i'll repeat it
All is fair in love and war
That's how the famous saying goes
If I told you we were out to sea in a bottomless boat
You'd try anything to save us
You'd try anything to keep us afloat
And if we were living in a house afire
I don't believe that you could rush out and escape it
And not rescue me

Listen, I think they were talking to youEmbed
