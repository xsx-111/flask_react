Trouble Me Lyrics
Trouble me
Disturb me with all your cares and your worries

Trouble me
On the days when you feel spent
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden
When my back is sturdy and strong?
Trouble me
Speak to me
Don't mislead me, the calm I feel means a storm is swelling
There's no telling where it starts or how it ends
Speak to me
Why are you building this thick brick wall to defend me
When your silence is my greatest fear?
Why let your shoulders bend underneath this burden
When my back is sturdy and strong?
Speak to me
Let me
Have a look inside these eyes while I'm learning
Please don't hide them just because of tears
Let me
Send you off to sleep with a
"There, there, now stop your turning and tossing"
Let me
Know where the hurt is and how to heal
Spare me?
Don't spare me anything troubling

Speak to me
And let our words build a shelter from the storm
Lastly
Let me know what I can mend
There's more, honestly, than my sweet friend, you can see
Trust is what I'm offering if you
