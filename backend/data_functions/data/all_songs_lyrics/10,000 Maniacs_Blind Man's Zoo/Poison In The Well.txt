Poison In The Well Lyrics
Tell me, what's gone wrong?
I tilt my head there, under the faucet
But when i turn it on
Dry as paper
Call the neighbors
Who's to blame for what's going on?
In the dark without a clue
I'm just the same as you

O, they tell us there's poison in the well
That someone's been a bit untidy
And there's been a small spill
Not a lot, just a drop

But there you are mistaken
You know you are!
I wonder just how long
They knew our well was poisoned
But they let us just drink on

O, they tell us there's poison in the well
That someone's been a bit untidy
And there's been a small spill
All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea
Someone's been a bit untidy
They'll have it cleaned up in a week
But the week is over
And now it's grown into years
Since i was told that i should be calm
There's nothing to fear
But i drank that water for years
My wife and my children!
Tell me, where to now
If your fight for a bearable life
Can be fought and lost in you backyard?

O, don't tell us there's poison in the well
That someone's been a bit untidy
That there's been a small spill
All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea

Someone's been a bit untidy
They'll have it cleaned up in a weekEmbed
