Hateful Hate Lyrics
In the dark night a giant slumbered
Untouched for centuries
'til awakened by a white man's cry
"This is the eden i was to find"
There were lands to be charted
And to be claimed for a crown
When a hero was made
By the length he could stay
In this dangerous land of hateful hate
Curiosity filled the heads of these
There was an upper room they had to see
Curiosity killed the best of these
For a hero's hometown welcoming
Still they moved on and on
Who came building missions?
Unswerving men of the cloth
Who gave their lives in numbers untold
So that black sheep entered the fold
Captured like human livestock destined for slavery
Naked, walked to the shore where great ships moored
For the hell bound journeys
Bought and sold with a hateful hate
Curiosity filled the breasts of these
With some strange ecstasy
Curiosity killed the best of these
By robbing their lives of dignity
Still they moved on and on
Calling men of adventure
For a jungle bush safari
Come conquer the beast
His claws and teeth
See death in his eyes to know you're alive
European homesteads grew up in the colonies
With civilized plans for wild hinterlands
Their guns and god willing
Such a hateful hate
Curiosity spilled the blood of these
For their spotted skins and ivory
Curiosity filled the heads of these
Madmen with the lies of destiny
Curiosity spilled the blood of these
Then blotted their lives from history
Curiosity filled the heads of these
One man claimed all that he could see
Curiosity still entices these
Madmen with a lusting and a greed
Their legacy, legacy, legacyEmbed
