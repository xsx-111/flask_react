Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts Lyrics
Is there anyone out there?
Somewhere I can belong?
Man, the city just ain't so kind tonight
I need a place to take refuge
See, I've been loving you blind
I guess that made it hard for me to find

That we were caught up in the middle
Of a worn-out dream
I knew we were in trouble
But, baby, I almost screamed

When I saw you dancin' on the moon now
I watched him spin you 'round and 'round
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're flying away while I'm stuck here on the ground

Is there anyone out there?
Somewhere I can belong?
Man, the city just ain't so kind tonight
And if I had my suspicions
I kept 'em out of my heart
Just wish I would've known right from the start
That you'd be speaking in riddles
And you'd never confide
You know I knew we were in trouble
But, honey, I almost cried

When I saw you dancin' on the moon now
I watched him spin you 'round and 'round
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're out on the wind and I'm still waiting to be found

You did a fine job of hiding
That crooked ace up your sleeve
You doubled down my direction
You kiss me on the cheek and leave
I followed you through the darkness
I followed you through the cold
And, woman, I can tell you one thing
You're gonna wish you could go back and fold

Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're flying away while I'm stuck here on the ground
Why did you roll your dice, show your cards?
Jilted lovers and broken hearts
You're out on the wind, I'm still waiting to be found
Yeah! Will I ever win? Only time will tell
You got to suffer to remember how well
That are our ideals never really marched in time
That's the bottom line
Jilted lovers and broken hearts1Embed
