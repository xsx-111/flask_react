Crossfire Lyrics
There's a still in the street outside your window
You're keeping secrets on your pillow
Let me inside, no cause for alarm
I promise tonight not to do no harm
I promise you, baby, I won't do you no harm

And we're caught up in the crossfire
Of heaven and hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down

Watching your dress as you turn down the light
I forget all about the storm outside
Dark clouds roll their way over town
Heartache and pain came a-pouring down
Like hail, sleet and rain, yeah
They're handing it out

And we're caught up in the crossfire
Of Heaven and Hell
And we're searching for shelter
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Tell the devil that he can go back from where he came
His fiery arrows drew their bead in vain
And when the hardest part is over we'll be here
And our dreams will break the boundaries of our fears
Boundaries of our fears

Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
Lay your body down
