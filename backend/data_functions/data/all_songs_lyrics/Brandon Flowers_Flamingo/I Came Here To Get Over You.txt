I Came Here To Get Over You Lyrics
I came here thinking I could ease the pain
I came in spite of others' good advice
I came here thinking sweet, sweet revenge
Bring me some sugar, let the games begin

I made a lot of bad decisions, but tonight, I'm breaking through
I came here to get over you

I had this dream about a wild bird
Black feathered picking at your beating heart
You reach for me and shout, "I need your love"
Yet soon collapses when I call your bluff
Picking at your heart strings, "I need your love"

I started shaking when you told me that you found somebody new
I came here to get over you

And the lights are burning like kerosene
I can't stop thinking about you and me
Did you cross your fingers when you told me you'd be true?
I came here to get
I came here to get
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I came here to get over you
I made a lot of bad decisions, but tonight, I'm breaking through1Embed
