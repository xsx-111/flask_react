Was It Something I Said? Lyrics
Me and Valentina went down to the chapel
But the gates were shut
I had my vows in my pocket and a gold plated ring
For my honey love

We headed down Tropicana
To the corner with the late night restaurant
We sat across from each other
When I looked in her eyes there was something gone

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hid?
If you leave me hanging
I don't know what I'll do
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
In the clear of the blue moonlight
You got me on my knees
Valentina, this is not like you

I got a job at the Nugget and I saved a thousand dollars
For a brand new start
She said, "I didn't want to do it, but I did it
'Cause I didn't want to break your heart"
The waiter whispered when he said
We had to take the conversation to the parking lot
Please, baby, please, Valentina, baby
You're the only thing I got

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hid?
If you leave me hanging
I don't know what I'll do
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
In the clear of the blue moonlight
You got me on my knees
Valentina, this is not like you

I hear church bells ringing in my head
And I take 'em everywhere I go
Valentina met a dealer
And I heard they had a baby five months ago

Was it something that I said or did?
Was it something that I should have kept hid?
If you leave me hanging
I don't know what I'll do
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
In the clear of the blue moonlight
You got me on my knees, Valentina
Don't say it's true
This is not like you1Embed
