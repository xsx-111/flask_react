Hard Enough Lyrics
You let me into your life on a whim
And there was magic and fire in the night
In loving, I was just a little boy
I made mistakes that caused you so much pain
All I know is that I'm older now

Some people think that it's best to refrain
From the conventions of old-fashioned love
Their hearts are filled with holes and emptiness
They tell themselves that they're too young to settle down
Well, I promise that I'm older now

And this has been hard enough on you
I know it's been hard enough on me
Been tellin' myself that I can roll with the changes
And when the water gets high above your head
Darlin', don't you see?
While this has been hard enough on you
It's been hard enough on me

I wasn't lookin' when we built these walls
Let me spread my dreams at your feet
Let's not let time's bitter flood rise
Before my thoughts begin to run
I think I'm getting older now
And this has been hard enough on you
I know it's been hard enough on me
Been tellin' myself that I can roll with the changes
And when the water gets high above your head
Darlin', don't you see?
While this has been hard enough on you
It's been hard enough on me

I can't stand the thought of another
Talking to you sweet, my dear
Where would I be tonight if you hadn't held me here
In your arms?

And this has been hard enough on you
I know it's been hard enough on me
Been tellin' myself that I can roll with the changes
And when the water gets high above your head
Darlin', don't you see?
While this has been hard enough on you
It's been hard enough on meEmbed
