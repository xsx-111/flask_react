Swallow It Lyrics
Seek out the light between
Time and confusion glowing up ahead
Instead of slipping through
You bit off more, much more than you could chew

You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down

We had a lot to learn
Table manners and grace, how to wait your turn when
Time came to clear your slate
You had too much, had too much on your plate

You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
Take your medicine and crawl before you walk
Think it through before you open your mouth to talk
Be an advocate of joy
Find your little heart's desire and
Follow it

Whoa, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
Baby, you're not ready
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, slow down
And take the time to evolve
You could not swallow it
No, baby, you're not ready, now, slow down
No, no, no, no

Don't be afraid, this is your year
It's gonna be alright, you're a performer
Just take your time, but not too much time
No, no, no, noEmbed
