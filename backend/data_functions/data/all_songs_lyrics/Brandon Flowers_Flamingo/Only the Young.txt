Only the Young Lyrics
Look back in silence
The cradle of your whole life
There in the distance
Losing its greatest prize

Nothing is easy
Nothing is sacred, why?
Where did the bough break?
It happened before your time

And there were people there
Lovely as you'd ever care
Tonight, baby you can start again
Laughing in the open air
Have yourself another dream
Tonight, maybe we can start again

Only the young can
Break away, break away
Lost when the wind blow
On your own, oh
Only the young can
Break away, break away
Lost when the wind blows
On your own, oh
Mother, it's cold here
Father, thy will be done
Thunder and lightning are crashing down
They got me on the run, direct me to the sun

Redemption, keep my covers clean
Tonight baby, we can start again

Only the young can
Break away, break away
Lost when the wind blows
On your own, oh
Only the young can
Break away, break away
Lost when the wind blows
On your own, oh

And the sun will shine again
And the sun will shine again
Are you looking for the sign?
Or are you caught up in the lie?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Only the young can
Break away, break away
Lost when the wind blows
On your own, oh
Only the young can
Break away, break away
Lost when the wind blows
On your own

Only the young can
Lost when the wind blows
Only the young can
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Lost when the wind blows3Embed
