On the Floor Lyrics
When the lights go down in the city
Getting real low
Settling in my room
I'm unnoticed
When the still comes in through my window
Letting me go
And I feel a calm, come over me
On the floor

On the floor
Where the rats all come away clean
There on the floor
Where the children all stomped and screamed
Straight out the door
Where I find myself on my knees
Begging please

When the lights go down in the city
And everyone goes
To their room, walking the trail
To dreamland
When the lights go down in the city
Something is roaring
And I find myself
Waiting to believe
On the floor
Where the mice call shots in the corner
That's where I'll be
When the crickets come home and sing their symphony
Where I find myself on my knees
Begging please

On the floor
Facing  the things I've done
Here on the floor
Where the years have gathered and run
That's where I'll be
And I find myself on my knees
Begging pleaseEmbed
