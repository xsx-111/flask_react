Lonesome Love Lyrics
I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something

Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say "Hello"
And I lose

'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me

In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for

Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?4Embed
