Blue Light Lyrics
Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked
Silver in the night

Singing, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Out there, I'm a sharp knife
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?
Are you?

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo8Embed
