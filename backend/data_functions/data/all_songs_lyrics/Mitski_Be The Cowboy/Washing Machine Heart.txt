Washing Machine Heart Lyrics
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside

Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

But do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?54Embed
