Remember My Name Lyrics
I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love?
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show

'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally call it heaven?

I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like heaven15Embed
