Come Into the Water Lyrics
Come into the water
Do you wanna be my baby?
Are you waiting to touch me?
You look so good, but I keep my hands
'Til you come into the water

Maybe I'm the same as all those men
Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me

I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me3Embed
