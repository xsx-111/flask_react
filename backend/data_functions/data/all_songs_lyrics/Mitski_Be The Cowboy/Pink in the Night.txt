Pink in the Night Lyrics
I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing

"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you"

I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right

Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again?12Embed
