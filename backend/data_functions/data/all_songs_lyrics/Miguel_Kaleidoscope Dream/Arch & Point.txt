Arch & Point Lyrics
Black leather skirt in a leopard print shirt, woah!
Skip dinner heading straight for dessert, woah oh
But when it feels so good then it just come natural
Baby, arch your back and point your toes

Ballerina smart but your sex like art, oh
I'm saying rhythm is a talent that cannot be taught, woah hoho, babe
When it feels so good then it just come natural
Baby, arch your back, point your toes

See, I don't suppose
That every good girl knows
All that every bad girl knows
So baby, arch your back
And point your toes, yeah

Fishnet bodysuit, birthday cake, woah
Fetish is a pleasure that cannot be faked, woah hoho
But when it feels this good then it just comes natural
Baby, arch your back and point your toes

Oh, polaroid flash, baby, anything goes
Feeling high, don't keep your eyes closed
Cause when it feels this good, baby, just come natural
Baby arch your
You know what to do
Yeah baby
You know I don't suppose
Oh, that every good girl knows, yeah
All that every bad girl knows
Say, arch your back and point your toes, yeah
Baby, arch your back and point your toes8Embed
