Use Me Lyrics
Sedate me, salacious salty and sweet
I’m overwhelmed by tasty thoughts of you
Daydream, my body's waving a white flag
Take me, yeah, ah baby

Now I know I'm sober
It's just so profound
That every wall I've built up
Has come crashing down
Don’t the waves pull the sand?
Don’t the moon pull the tide, babe?
Then I'm yours, yeah

Use me, wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me, it's the very first time
That I'm nervous, can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on, 'cause it turns me on
If you're nervous, just let me show you
How to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
Sensation, as I place my tongue on your lips
You’re overwhelmed by everything I do, oh
Curse me, yeah, with such a beautiful nightmare
Don’t wake me, now baby

Now I know I’m sober
It’s just so profound, yeah
That every wall I built up
Has come crashing down, yeah
Don’t the waves pull the sand
Don’t the moon pull the tide baby
I'm yours, yeah

Use me, wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me, it's the very first time
That I'm nervous, can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on, 'cause it turns me on
If you're nervous, just let me show you
How to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
Blissful collision as our bodies tangle intertwined
Biting your lip, baby put me inside
Crucified thoughts, tender moments on a ricochet
Purging my mind of the power I own
Falling to forever, just forgive me, I was faithless
Danger in your eyes, baby you can devour me
Defile me, yeah

Use me, wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me, it's the very first time
That I'm nervous, can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on, 'cause it turns me on
If you're nervous, just let me show you
How to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
Use me, wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me, it's the very first time
That I'm nervous, can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on, 'cause it turns me on
If you're nervous, just let me show you
How to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
Use me
Use me, wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go
Forgive me, it's the very first time
That I'm nervous, can I trust you, huh?
Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on, 'cause it turns me on
If you're nervous, just let me show you
How to touch me, I could teach you, yeah
