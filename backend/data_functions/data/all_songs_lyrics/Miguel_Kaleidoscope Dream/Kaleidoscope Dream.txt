Kaleidoscope Dream Lyrics
I taste you in infinite colors
Collide in a fountain
Amidst all the lovers

Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (a shiny scope dream)
Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream

Can you imagine, a field of LED lights
It flickers and flashes
'Cause our joy is electric

Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (a shiny scope dream)
Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream

Oh oh, breathe
Oh oh, close your eyes, you're with me
Oh oh, reach high
Taste the sky
Just hold my hand
Across the moon we'll hope to fly
You're safe with me, you're safe with me
Yeah, body language like piano keys
Allow me to provoke babe
Make you sing a melody
Every single stroke babe
As I kiss your third eye
Bet you're gonna scream
Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream

Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)

All these helium hues in a ray of amusement
Linking the stars from the sky

Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (a shiny scope dream)
Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream

Yeah, body language like piano keys
Allow me to provoke babe
Make you sing a melody
Every single stroke babe
As I kiss your third eye
Let your love come sweet
Only you can be my Kaleidoscope dream
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Oh oh, reach high
Taste the sky
Just hold my hand (kaleidoscope dream)
Across the moon we'll hope to fly
You're safe with me, you're safe with me

Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)
Kaleidoscope dream (dream dream dream)7Embed
