The Thrill Lyrics
Can you roll down a window
I just wanna feel the wind blow, in my face

'Cause these moments come one blink at a time
That's why I never wanna close my eyes, yeah
I can feel the riot in the air tonight
Kinda trouble, you can taste

And I, can't wait
And I, can't wait
It's the thrill I feel my heartbeat race
And I, can't wait, can't wait

Jamie, Johnny and Jack know
Shoot them up, shoot them down, Sh..shh..shooter
Dancing up, we never black out
Never chase, never waste, never hesitate, no

'Cause these moments come one blink at a time
And we're just laughing as we lose our mind, yeah
We could be a riot in the air tonight
Start the kind of trouble you can tell
And I, can't wait
And I, can't wait
It's the thrill I feel my heartbeat race
And I, can't wait, can't wait

'Til they play our song
'Til the lights go on
'Til we can't drive home
Shout give me more, give me more
'Til we're all alone
'Til we greet the sun
Give me more, give me more, yeah
Give me more, give me more

And I, can't wait
And I, can't wait
It's the thrill I feel my heartbeat race
And I, can't wait, can't wait2Embed
