Pussy Is Mine Lyrics
RJ: Hit the button
Miguel...
My man, c'mon man
C'mon man, we got to get this done....
Keep it one hundred babe
We both know, I'm not the only one
But when I'm there
You treat a nigga real good
And that's probably why I always come, yeah
So lie to me, lie to me, lie to me so sweet
Cause I don't ever want to imagine
All the other niggas like me
Ever had a chance, to get in your pants
So

Tell me that the pussy is mine, yeah
Tell me, tell me baby, that it's all mine, yeah
Tell me that that pussy is mine, ooh
'Cause I don't wanna believe
That anyone is just like me
Like me, oh whoa
Could you just lie to me, lie to me, lie to me so sweet
Baby ignorance is bliss
Yeah I know exactly what this is
Just

Tell me that the pussy is mine, yeah
Tell me, tell me baby, it's all mine
Tell me that that pussy is mine, ooh
'Cause I don't want to believe
That anyone is just like me
Oh oh, like me

RJ: Ey yo, can we get serious, please?
Miguel: Are we really recording right now?
RJ: Yes! Hello?
Miguel: Aww shit. Yo RJ, you ready?31Embed
