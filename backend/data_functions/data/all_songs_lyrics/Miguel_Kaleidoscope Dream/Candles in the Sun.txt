Candles in the Sun Lyrics
Is there a god?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching out?
If not, what are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing now?
Look at all these people
Searching for a reason
Searching for a peace of mind
Hey, I say we’re all created equal
That’s what they teach us
But that ain’t how we treat each other
Naw, that ain’t how we treat each other
Shit, the truth is that we need each other, yea

Diamond in the back, babies on crack
Kick in the door, wavin’ the 4-4
White collar, war, crime, money gets spent
Candles in the sun, blowin’ in the wind
Sun goes down, heroes often get shot
Peace has long been forgot
Ooh will it be too late when we find out?
Yeah, all that we got
Take a look around now
Just take a look around
Business and governments just watch out an innocent fade
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aide
Aren't you appalled?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

Diamond in the back, babies on crack
Kick in the door, wavin’ the 4-4
White collar, war, crime, money gets spent
Candles in the sun, blowin’ in the wind
Sun goes down, heroes often get shot
Peace has long been forgot
Ooh will it be too late when we find out?
Yeah, all that we got
Take a look around now
Just take a look around
Oh, may we all live long
May we all be brave
And the bridges we burn
Only light our way
May we all be strong
And we all be brave
And the bridges we burn
Only light our way
Oh, may we all live long
May we all be brave
And the bridges we burn
Only light our way
May we all live long
May we all be brave
And the bridges we burn
Just be the bridges we burn
All that we got
Oh, we're all that we got
Look around now (all that we got)
Hey, yeah, yeah
Is there a god?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching out?
Is there a god?
I'm sure he's watching
Are we doing?
Are we going?
Oh, take a look around now10Embed
