Do You... Lyrics
Do you like drugs?

Have you ever felt alone?
Do you still believe in love?

But do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, well me too, me too, me too, babe
Me too, me too
Do you like love, do you like love?
Yeah, well me too (me too, babe), me too
It’s what we're gonna do

What about matinee movies and pointless secrets
Midnight summers, swim private beaches
Rock, paper, scissors, wait, best out of three
My mama said the greatest things in life are free
What about lust, what about trust, what about fun?
She said, you know that I do
Oh you do, baby, hope you do now
You do, do, do, do

But do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, well me too (me too babe), me too
Me too, me too
Do you like love? Do you like love?
Yeah, well me too, me too
It’s what we're gonna do
Tonight, so let’s dance a little harder
'Til I feel like I know ('Til I feel like I know)
All the things

Do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, well me too, me too, me too, me too
Do you like hugs? Do you like love?
Oh it feels like we got so much in common now
Right about now baby
Me too, me too
It’s what we gonna do
It’s you and me, yeah tonight
Tonight, you and me tonight
Tonight, you and me tonight
You and me tonight
You and me tonight
You and me yeah, tonight
You and me tonight, oh
Feel like I've known you for so long
Right about now baby, yeah, yeah
I wanna do you like drugs tonight
Wanna do you like drugs33Embed
