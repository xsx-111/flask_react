Hold Tight London Lyrics
So why do I warn you?
I see things when I hold you
But I've whispered: "It's all right"
It was you and me and a long night

You're a ghost in the doorway
I can see through, but I hold tight
Understand holding 'til it hurts
I just want you here and you're lovely

You're a ghost in the doorway
I can see through, but I hold tight
Understand holding 'til it hurts
I just want you here and you're lovely

Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
Don't worry, nothing can go wrong
