Hats Off to  Harper Lyrics
Mmm, a, mmm, a, mmm, a mmm, a mmm, a come on down

When I done quit hollering baby
I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Get my babe, won't be late
You know by that I mean ah, seconds late
Ah, must I holler?
Must I shake 'em on down?

Well, I've done quit hollerin', baby
I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Well, I ain't no monkey
I can't climb no tree
No brown skin woman gonna make no monkey out of me
Yeah, I ain't no monkey
Sure can't climb no tree

I been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Well, I've been mistreated babe I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Listen mama, put on your mornin' gown
Put in your nightshirt Mama
We going to shake them down
Must I holler?
Must I, must I, must I shake them on down?

Oh, I've been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Gave my baby a twenty dollar bill
If that don't get her, I'm sure my shot, shot, shot-gun will
Yeah, I gave my baby a twenty dollar bill
Well, if that don't get that woman, I'm sure my shot-gun will
I'm gonna go shoot her now2Embed
