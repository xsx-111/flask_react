Easy Money LyricsYou don't have to talk all night
I'm a man who can't say no
You don't have to twist my arm
Just point me where you wanna go
Take me to the action, take me to the track
Take me to a party if they're bettin' in the back
I been working all my life, can't afford to wait
Let me call my wife so I can tell her I'll be late
I want the easy, easy money
I could get lucky, oh, things could go right
I want the easy, easy money
Maybe this one time, maybe tonight
You don't have to try too hard
I don't need a song and dance
I don't need an invitation
If you've got a game of chance
Take me to the tables, take me to the fights
Run me like the numbers, roll me like the dice
When you're counting on a killing, always count me in
Talk me into losin' just as long as I can win
I want the easy, easy money
I want the good times I never had
I want the easy, easy money
I want the good life, I want it bad
Easy money
You say I fool myself
But better me than being a fool for someone else
I got a hot slot machine of a system ready to go
Easy money, I got a one-track mind
And a good reputation laying on the line
I'll either come back a bum or a king
Baby, I don't know
You don't have to start a fire
I'm a man who can't say no
If you've got a little risky business
Just point me where you want to go
Take me to the power, take me to the heat
Take me to the cleaners if it's open to the street
Something's got to pay off, something's got to break
Someone's got a fortune that they're begging me to take
I want the easy, easy money
I could get lucky, things could go right
I want the easy, easy money
Maybe just this time, mmaybe tonight
Easy money
I don't want no hard cash
I just want the easy money
Oh, I could get lucky
(Easy money)
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, ahEmbed
