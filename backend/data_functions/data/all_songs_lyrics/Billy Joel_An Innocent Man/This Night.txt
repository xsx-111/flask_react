This Night Lyrics
Didn't I say I wasn't ready for romance?
Didn't we promise we would only be friends?
And so we danced, though it was only a slow dance
I started breaking my promises right there and then
Didn't I swear there would be no complications?
Didn't you want someone who's seen it all before?
Now that you're here, it's not the same situation
Suddenly, I don't remember the rules anymore

This night is mine
It's only you and I
Tomorrow is a long time away
This night can last forever

I've been around, someone like me should know better
Falling in love would be the worst thing I could do
Didn't I say I needed time to forget her?
Aren't you running from someone who's not over you?
How many nights have I been lonely without you?
I tell myself how much I really don't care
How many nights have I been thinking about you?
Wanting to hold you but knowing you would not be there
This night, you're mine
It's only you and I
I'll tell you to forget yesterday
This night we are together
This night is mine
It's only you and I
Tomorrow is such a long time away
This night can last forever

Tomorrow is such a long time away
This night can last foreverEmbed
