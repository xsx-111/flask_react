Silicone Grown Lyrics
Wait a minute, honey, I don't think the joke's too funny, no
I stayed up all night checking out the doctor's guide, woo
Wait a minute, honey, stop pretending you're a bunny
Well I might've guessed you been to see a specialist

Well, you got more front than the Hague Museum, oh no
Oh, homegrown silicone you really got the best of me

Alright
You made a man outta me, yeah
