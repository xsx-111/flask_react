My Fault Lyrics
Take me like you find me
Don't try to change me
You know better than that
Take me as you see me
Don't try to hide me
I ain't used to that
I'll shout it out loud
Put a bomb in a crowd
If I got something to say
There's nothing that can stop me
I can't let it lay

If I have to fall on my head
Every night of the week
It's gonna be my fault (No one else)
If everything goes wrong
When I'm singing my song
It's gonna be my fault and no one else
There ain't nothing you can do about it
I've sat and thought it over
Don't try to help me
I was just born this way
Never, ever gon' change
So if everything goes wrong
And I drink all night
It's gonna be my fault (And no one else)
People don't change just overnight
So don't break it kindly
Don't hypnotize me
I just won't understand
Take me like you find me
Don't try to change me
Don't you know better than that, oh
Don't you know better than that, oh
Say I'm just a fool, that's alright

Never try to change me or rearrange me
Aw yeahEmbed
