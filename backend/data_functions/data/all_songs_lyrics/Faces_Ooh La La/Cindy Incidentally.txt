Cindy Incidentally Lyrics
Oh Cindy, ain't you noticed?
That several of your friends have moved on
And the street outside is just a little too quiet
And your local papers run out of news
I'm not persuading you or disengaging you
But Cindy, you and me we gotta move

Can you refuse? No time to lose
We'll hit the high road early this morning
So don't be late, don't hesitate
This dream can pass just as fast as lighting

Oh, Cindy, incidentally
Baby, I ain't putting you on


Can you refuse, with nothing to lose?
We'll hit the high road early this morning
So don't be late, don't hesitate
This dream can pass just as fast as lighting
Oh Cindy, don't you worry
'Cause between us we can make it through
There ain't nothing, no, no nothing
In the world I can do without you
So Cindy, get your coat on
Leave the rent with the gent up in the penthouse
Turn your music so loud let's attract a big crowd
We'll drink a round to this town and bid goodbye
FarewellEmbed
