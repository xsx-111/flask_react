Glad and Sorry Lyrics
Thank you kindly for thinking of me
If I'm not smiling I'm just thinking

Glad and sorry, happy or sad
When all is done and spoken
You're up or I'm down

Can you show me a dream?
Can you show me one that's better than mine?
Can you stand it in the cold light of day?
Neither can I


Can you show me a dream?
Can you show me one that's better than mine?
Can you stand it in the cold light of day?
Neither can I1Embed
