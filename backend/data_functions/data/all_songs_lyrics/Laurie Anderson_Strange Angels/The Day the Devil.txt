The Day the Devil LyricsThe day the devil comes to getcha
You know him by the way he smiles
The day the devil comes to getcha
He's a rusty truck with only twenty miles
He's got bad brakes he's got loose teeth
He's a long way from home
The day the devil comes to getcha
He's got a smile like a scar
He knows the way to your house
He's got the keys to your car
And when he sells you his sportcoat
You say: Funny! That's my size
Attention shoppers!
Everybody please rise
Give me back my innocence
Get me a brand new suit
Give me back my innocence, Oh Lord!
Cut me down to size
Well you can hide under the porch
And you can hide behind the couch
But the day the devil comes to getcha
He's right on time
Here he comes
Well I'm sick of hearin bout your problems
Yeah girlie you're breakin my heart
I'm the original party animal
Hey! Hey! Babaloo
So don't come bangin your Bibles
'Cause you've been laughin all the way to the bank
And don't give me those crocodile tears
Cause you've been doing it for years
I'm everywhere!
Sign right here Mr. Jones
The day the devil comes to getcha
He's a long way from home
And you know he's gonna getcha
'Cause you're stuck in the middle
Everybody please rise
Give me back my innocence
Get me a brand new suit
Give me back my innocence, Oh Lord!
Cut me down to size
Give me back my innocence
Get me a new Cadillac
'Cause when I get on up to heaven Lord
You can have it all back
'Cause in heaven, you get it all back
In heaven it all comes back
'Cause in heaven, you get it all back
In heaven
'Cause in heaven...... In heaven......Embed
