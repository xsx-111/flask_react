The Dream Before LyricsHansel and Gretel are alive and well
And they're living in Berlin
She is a cocktail waitress
He had a part in a Fassbinder film
And they sit around at night now
Drinking schnapps and gin
And she says, 'Hansel, you're really bringing me down.'
And he says, 'Gretel, you can really be a bitch.'
He says, I've wasted my life on our stupid legend
When my one and only love was the wicked witch
She said, What is history?
And he said, History is an angel
Being blown
Backwards
Into the future
He said: History is a pile of debris
And the angel wants to go back and fix things
To repair the things that have been broken
But there is a storm blowing from Paradise
And the storm keeps blowing the angel
Backwards
Into the future
And this storm, this storm
Is called
