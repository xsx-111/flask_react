Ramon LyricsLast night I saw a host of angels
And they were all singing different songs
And it sounded like a lot of lawnmowers
Mowing down my lawn
And up above kerjillions of stars spangled all over the sky
And they were spirals turning
Turning in the deep blue night
And suddenly for no reason
The way that angels leave the ground
They left in a kind of vortex
Traveling at the speed of sound
And just as I started to leave
Just as I turned to go
I saw a man who'd fallen
He was lying on his back in the snow
Some people walk on water
Some people walk on broken glass
Some just walk round and round in their dreams
Some just keep falling down
So when you see a man who's broken
Pick him up and carry him
And when you see a woman who's broken
Put her all into your arms
'Cause we don't know where we come from
We don't know what we are
So when you see a man who's broken
Pick him up and carry him
And when you see a woman who's broken
Put her all into your arms
'Cause we don't know where we come from
We don't know what we are
And you?
You're no one
And you?
You're falling
And you?
You're traveling
Traveling at the speed of light
And you?
You're no one
And you?
You're falling
And you? You're traveling
Traveling at the speed of lightEmbed
