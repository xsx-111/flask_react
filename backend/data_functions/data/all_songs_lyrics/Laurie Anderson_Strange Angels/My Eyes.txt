My Eyes LyricsSometimes I wish I hadn't gotten that tattoo
Sometimes I wish I'd married you
One hundred fires, one hundred days
Sometimes I feel like a stranger
Sometimes I tell lies (Whoa ho)
Sometimes I act like a monkey
Here comes the night
And then kerjillions of stars start to shine
And icy comets go whizzing by
And everything's shaking with a strange delight
And here it is: the enormous night
And oo my eyes; they're lookin all around
And oo my feet; I'm upside down
If I were the president
If I were Queen for a day
I'd give the ugly people all the money
I'd re-write the Book of Love
I'd make it funny
Wheel of fortune, wheel of fate
Two hundred forty million voices
Two hundred forty million names
And down in the ocean where nobody goes
Some fish are fast
Some are slow
Some swim round the world
Some hide below
This is the ocean
So deep, so old
And then kerjillions of stars start to shine
And icy comets go whizzing by
And everything's shaking with a strange delight
And this is it: the enormous night
And oo my eyes; they're lookin all around
And oo my feet; they've left the ground
So cry me a river that leads to a road
That turns into a highway that goes and goes
And tangles in your memories
So long, so oldEmbed
