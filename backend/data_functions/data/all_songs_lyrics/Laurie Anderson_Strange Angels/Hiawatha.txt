Hiawatha LyricsBy the shores of Gitche Gumee
By the shining Big-Sea-Water
Downward through the evening twilight
In the days that are forgotten
From the land of sky blue waters
And I said: Hello Operator, get me Memphis Tennessee
And she said: I know who you're tryin' to call darlin'
And he's not home he's been away
But you can hear him on the airwaves
He's howlin' at the moon
Yeah this is your country station
And honey this next one's for you
And all along the highways
And under the big western sky
They're singin' Ooo oooooo
They're singin' Wild Blue
And way out on the prairie
And up in the high chaparral
They hear a voice it says: Good evening
This is Captain Midnight speaking
And I've got a song for you
Goes somethin' like this:
Starlight Starbright
We're gonna hang some new stars in the heavens tonight
They're gonna circle by day
They're gonna fly by night
We're goin' sky high. Yoo Hooooo hooo
Yeah yoo hooo Ooo Hooooooooo
So good night ladies
And good night gentlemen
Keep those cards and letters coming
And please don't call again
Geronimo and little Nancy
Marilyn and John F. dancing
Uncle took the message
And it's written on the wall
These are pictures of the houses
Shining in the midnight moonlight
While the King sings Love Me Tender
And all along the watchtowers
And under the big western sky
They're singing Yoo Hooooo
They're singing Wild Blue
And way, way up there, bursting in air
Red rockets, bright red glare
From the land of sky blue waters
Sent by freedom's sons and daughters
We're singing Ooo Hoooooooo
We're singing Wild Blue
We're singing Ooo Hoooooooo Ooo Hooooooooo
And dark behind it rose the forest
Rose the black and gloomy pine trees
Rose the firs with cones upon them
And bright before it beat the water
Beat the clear and sunny water
Beat the shining Big-Sea-WaterEmbed
