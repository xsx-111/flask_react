Strange Angels LyricsThey say that heaven is like TV
A perfect little world that doesn't really need you
And everything there is made of light
And the days keep going by
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Well it was one of those days larger than life
When your friends came to dinner and they stayed the night
And then they cleaned out the refrigerator
They ate everything in sight
And then they stayed up in the living room
And they cried all night
Strange angels singing just for me
Old stories, they're haunting me
This is nothing like I thought it would be
Well I was out in my four door with the top down
And I looked up and there they were
Millions of tiny teardrops just sort of hanging there
And I didn't know whether to laugh or cry
And I said to myself: What next big sky?
Strange angels singing just for me
Their spare change falls on top of me
Rain falling, falling all over me
All over me
Strange angels singing just for me
Old Stories, they're haunting me
Big changes are coming
Here they come
Here they comeEmbed
