Who Needs Information Lyrics
 Alright, that's a song called "Radio Waves"! You are listening to KAOS in Los Angeles, and we've got Billy on the line!
 I'm from the Valleys
 You're from the valley?
 No, Jim you schmuck, the Valleys. Wales. Male voice choir
 Oh, you're from Wales! Now is this, uh, sperm or blue-tip?
 Ha, ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Jim
 Sorry
 Me and Benny went out
 Who's Benny?

Me and Benny went out last night
Looking for fun
Supping ale in the moonlight
Waiting for the dawn to come
Benny pointed at a Hi-Fi shop
He said, "Hey man, look at all the stuff they've got!"
How'd you make a have out of a have not?

Who needs information
When you're working underground?
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds
Benny climbed up on a footbridge
And he teetered on the parapet
He said, "Can you see the whites of their headlights?
Are they coming yet?"

Who needs information
This high off the ground?
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds
Who needs information
When you're living in constant fear?
J-j-just give me confirmation, yeah
There's some way out of here
(Some way) out of here
(Some way) out of here
(Some way out of here, out of here)
Some way (out of here)
Some way (out of here)
(Some way out of here)

Benny hefted a breeze block
And tried to let go
Got hung up on a tear drop
So me and Benny went home
Who needs information
When you're living in constant fear?
Just give me confirmation, yeah
There's some way out of here
(Some way) out of here
(Some way) out of here
(Some way out of here, out of here)
Some way (out of here)
Some way (out of here)
(Some way out of here)
Who needs information
When you're living on borrowed time?
Just give me confirmation
There will be a winner this time
Who needs information
When you're working underground?
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds
Who needs, who needs, who needs information?
(This high off the ground)
This high off the ground?
Just give me confirmation
We could win a million pounds

*Jim lights a cigarette*
 So your brother's in jail?
*Closing the prison's door*Embed
