The Powers That Be Lyrics
 This is some live rock and roll at KAOS, where rock and roll comes out of chaos and a song called... 'The Powers That Be'!

(The powers that be, the powers that be, the powers that be...)

They like a tough game, no rules
Some you win, some you lose
Competition, good for you
To die to be free
They're the powers that be
They like a bomb proof Cadillac
Air conditioned, gold taps
Back seat gun rack
Platinum hub caps
They pick horses for courses
They're the market forces
(Nice car, Jack!)
They like order, make-up
Lime light, power
Game shows, rodeos
Star Wars, TV
They're the powers that be
If you see them come
You better run, run
You better run on home
You better run, run
You better run on home

Sisters of mercy better join with your brothers (brothers)
Put a stop to the soap opera right now (yeah)
They say the toothless get ruthless
You better run on home

You better run, run
You better run on home

(The powers that be, the powers that be, the powers that be...)

They like treats, tricks
Carrots and sticks
(The powers that be...)
They like fear and loathing
(The powers that be...)
They like sheep's clothing
(The powers that be...)
And blacked-out vans
Blacked-out vans
Contingency plans
They like death or glory (death or glory)
They love a good story
They love a good story
Sisters of mercy better join with your brothers (sisters of mercy)
Put a stop to the soap opera state
They say the toothless get ruthless
Run home before its too late

You better run, run
You better run on home
You better run, run
You better run on home
You better run, run
You better run on home
You better run, run
You better run on home
You better run, run
You better run on home
You better run, run
You better run on home
You better run

 Goodnight, Jim
 Goodnight, BillyEmbed
