Me or Him Lyrics
You wake up in the morning, get something for the pot
Wonder why the sun makes the rocks feel hot
Draw on the walls, eat, get laid
Back in the good old days
Then, some damn fool invents the wheel
Listen to the whitewalls squeal
You spend all day looking for a parking spot
Nothing for the heart, nothing for the pot

Benny turned the dial on his shortwave radio
Oh, how he wanted to talk to the people
He wanted his own show
Tune in Moscow, Tune in New York
Listen to the Welsh kid talk
Communicating like in the good old days

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
It was either me or him
And a voice said
"Benny, you fucked the whole thing up
Benny, your time is up" (your time is up)

Benny turned the dial on his shortwave radio
He wanted to talk to the people
He wanted his own show 
Tune in Moscow, Tune in New York
Listen to the Welsh kid talk
Communicating like in the good old days
The good old days
"Forgive me Father ("Mobile One Two to Central)
For I have sinned (We have a multiple on the A465 between Cwmbran and Cylgoch)
Father, it was either me or him
Father, can we turn back the clock? (Ambulance, over)
I never meant to drop the concrete block!" (Roger central, over and out")

Benny turned the dial on his shortwave radio
Oh, how he wanted to talk to the people
He wanted his own show
Tune in Moscow, Tune in New York
Listen to the Welsh kid talk
Just like in the good old days
The good old days

"Do you really think Iranian terrorists would have taken Americans hostage if Ronald Reagan were president?
Do you really think the Russians would have invaded Afghanistan if Ronald Reagan were president?
Do you really think third-rate military dictators would laugh at America, and burn our flag in contempt, if Ronald Reagan were president?"
"Well, it might work! ("We as a group do most importantly want to beseech...) Sure! (...President Reagan and our fellow Americans to refrain from any form of...) Only, it's going to be mighty dangerous for you, Cassidy!"
(...military or violent means as an attempt, no matter how noble or heroic...)
"Guess you don't know Hopalong Cassidy, mister! Adventure's his bread, excitement's his butter (...to secure our freedom")
And danger, why to him that's like strawberry jam to top it off!"Embed
