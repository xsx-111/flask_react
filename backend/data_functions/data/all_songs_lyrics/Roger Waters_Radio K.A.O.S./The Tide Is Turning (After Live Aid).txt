The Tide Is Turning (After Live Aid) Lyrics(Morse Code repeats in the background)

I used to think the world was flat
Rarely threw my hat into the crowd
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning
Used to look in on the children at night
In the glow of their Donald Duck light
And frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning

But ooh, the tide is turning
The tide is turning

Satellite buzzing through the endless night
Exclusive to moonshots and the world title fights
Jesus Christ, imagine what it must be earning
Who is the strongest? Who is the best?
Who holds the aces, the East or the West?
This is the crap that our children are learning

But ooh, the tide is turning
(Ooh) The tide is turning
The tide is turning
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
Now the satellite's confused
Cause on Saturday night
The airwaves were full of compassion and light
And his silicon heart warmed to the sight
Of a billion candles burning

(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
The tide is turning, Billy

I'm not saying the battle is won
But on Saturday night all those kids in the sun
Wrested technology's sword from the hands of the warlords

Ooh, the tide is turning
Ooh, the tide is turning
The tide is turning, Sylvester

(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)
(Ooh, the tide is turning)1Embed
