Four Minutes Lyrics Four minutes and counting
 Okay...
 They pressed the button, Jim
 They pressed the button, Billy? What button?
 The big red one
 You mean the button?
 Goodbye, Jim
 Goodbye? Oh yes! This ain't au revoir, it's goodbye! Ha! Ha!
 This is KAOS. It's a beautiful, balmy, Southern California summer day. It's 80 degrees- I said balmy; I could've said bomb-y! (laughing) Okay
 I'm Jim, and this is Radio KAOS. and with only four minutes left to us, let's use this as wisely as possible. Out at Dodger Stadium, it's the bottom of the seventh. The Dodgers are leading three to nothing over the Giants. And, uh, for those of you who are looking to go surfing tomorrow, too bad
(Phone rings)
(Jim answers the phone)
 I'm kinda lost in here to tell you the truth
 Okay, good, I'll handle it
(Jim hangs up the phone)
 Ladies and gentlemen, if the reports that we are getting are correct, ah, this could be *it*
Billy, if you're listening to me, please call now

After a near miss on a plane
You swear you'll never fly again
After the first kiss when you make up
You swear you'll never break up again
And when you've just run a red light
Sit shaking under the street light
You swear to yourself you'll never drink and drive again
(Sometimes I feel like going home)
You swear you'll never let things go by again
(Sometimes I miss the rain and snow)
And you'll never toe the party line again
(And when the east wind blows, sometimes I feel like going home)
 Billy, if you are listening, please call
 Sole has no eyes
 Goodbye little spy in the sky
They say the cameras don't lie
Am I happy? Am I sad? Am I good? Am I bad?
 Sole has no eyes
 Sole has no eyes
 Counts down from 10 to 1
 Our own independent nuclear deterrent has helped to keep the peace, for nearly forty years
 Goodbye, Billy2Embed
