Shoplifters Of The World Unite Lyrics
Learn to love me, assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
My only weakness isâ€”well, never mind, never mind, oh

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

Learn to love me and assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
But last night the plans for a future war
Was all I saw on Channel Four

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

A heartless hand on my shoulder
A push and it's over
Alabaster crashes down (six months is a long time)
Tried living in the real world instead of a shell
But before I began...
I was bored before I even began
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
