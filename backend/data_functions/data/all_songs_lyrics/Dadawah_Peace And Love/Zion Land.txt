Zion Land LyricsZion land we want to go
Zion land we want to go
Zion our Father's home, we have to go
Zion land we want to go
Zion land we want to go
Zion land we want to go
Zion our Father's home, we have to go
Zion land we want to go
Land of the Lion of Judah
The root of David
Which hath prevailed to open Jah book
And to loose the seven seals thereon
Zion land we want to go
Yeah we gotta be there
Zion land we want to go
Zion our Father's home, we have to go
Zion land we want to go
Ohhhhh holla Zion land
Ohhhhh-ohhh holla Zion
Ohhhhh holla Zion land
We got to be there
Mmmmmm in this time
Zion land we want to go
Zion land we want to go
Zion our Father's home, we have to go
Zion land we want to go
