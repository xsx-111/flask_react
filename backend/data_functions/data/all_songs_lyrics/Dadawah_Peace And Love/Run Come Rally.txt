Run Come Rally LyricsHail Jah Rastafari
Emperor Hailie I Selassie I
Oh clap your hands all ye people
Shout unto God with the voice of triumph
For the Lord Most High is terrible
And He's a great king over all the earth
Jah shall subdue the people under us
And the nations under our feet
O thou Most High God, Jah Rastafari
Almighty God - Man
Come together brother, sisters
For the time is now come (come now)
When we must unite and be strong
That we can put away all the wrong, in the land
Righteousness exalt a nation
Sin is a reproach to any nation
Knowing that the wicked must fall
The righteous must live
Hail to the Kings of Kings and the Lord of Lords
Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judea (Hail)
Elect of Himself
Mister Five By Five, Revelation five
Emperor Hailie I Selassie I
Run come rally, rally
Run come rally, rally 'round King Alpha's throne
So run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
Oh run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
The hotter the battle is
The sweeter Jah victory, Jah victory
The hotter the battle is
The sweeter Jah victory, Jah victory
So run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
Yeah run away
(Run come rally, rally
Run come rally, rally round)
Ohhhh you got to run away, hey
(Run come rally, rally
Run come rally, rally round)
Babylon couldn't be my home
Run come rally, rally
Run come rally, rally round King Alpha's throne
The sun shall be darkened and the moon shall turn
Into blood, one of these days (mmmmmm)
So run away, come away from the land of the sinking sand
(The hotter the battle is, the sweeter Jah victory)
Ohhhhhh you got to run away now
Mmmmmm we gotta be free
Ohhh no more slavery (Run come rally, rally
Run come rally, rally round)
Mmmmm from the land, from the land of the sinking sand
(Run come rally, rally
Run come rally, rally round King Alpha's throne)
Yes, no more slavery
No more pain and no more sorrow
We have to flee from the land of the sinking sand
(The hotter the battle is, the sweeter Jah victory)
As our Father told us what life has taught Him
Until the colour of man's skin
Makes no more significance than the colour of man eyes
Until all is looked upon equal
As we are in the eyes of the Almighty God
The dream of peace will only be a fleeting illusion
(Run come rally, rally
Run come rally, rally round)
One that we pursue but never attain
Until each and every one is looked upon equal (King Alpha's throne)
As we are in the eyes of the Almighty
Until there is no more first
Second and third class nations of the world
(Run away, run away, run away from the sinking sand) I Selassie I
We gotta be free my bredrens
We got to have love
Without love, we are nothing at all (remember that)
Without love, we are nothing at all
Without love, we are nothing at all
At all
Zion
Jah (Rastafari)
For if among my chosen sons
There linger still some doubtful ones
Oh enter in their hearts oh JahEmbed
