Angel Lyrics
You are my angel
Come from way above
To bring me love, to bring me love

Her eyes
She's on the dark side
Neutralize every man in sight, every man in sight

Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

You are my angel
Come from way above


Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
