Black Milk Lyrics
You're not my eater
I'm not your food

Love you for God
Love you for the Mother

Eat me in the space
Within my heart

Love you for God
I love you for the Mother

Mother fountain
Or live or not at all

The most level
Sunken chapel

Love you for God
Oh, love you for the Mother
All's there to love
Only love8Embed
