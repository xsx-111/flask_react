Man Next Door Lyrics
There's a man that lived next door
In my neighborhood
In my neighborhood
And he gets me down

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
And find a quiet place

Hear the pots and pans, they fall
Bang against the wall
Bang against the wall
No rest at all

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night
I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
And find a quiet place
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip…
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip…

There's a man that lived next door
In my neighborhood
In my neighborhood
And he gets me down

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

Gotta get away
Ohh, ahhh
Oh, ah, ah
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip…1Embed
