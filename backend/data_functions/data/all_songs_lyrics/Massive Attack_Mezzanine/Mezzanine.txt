Mezzanine Lyrics
I'm a little curious of you in crowded scenes
And how serene your friends and fiends
We flew and strolled as two, illuminated gently
Why don't you close your eyes and reinvent me?

You know you've got that heart made of stone
You shoulda let me know
You coulda let me know
We'll go â€˜til morning comes
And traffic grows
And windows hum
Spending all week with your friends
Give me evenings and weekends
Evenings and weekends

I could be yours
We can unwind
All these half-floors
All these half-floors

You'd agree it's a typical high
You fly as you watch your name go by
And once the name goes by
Not thicker than water, nor thicker than mud
And the 8K thuds, it does
Sun set so thickly
Let's make it quiet and quickly
Don't frown
It tastes better on the way back down

I could be yours
We can unwind
All these half-floors
All these half-floors
All these half-floors
Will lead to mine

We are the curious
While I roam
Stick me down
Stick me, stick me down

We can unwind
All these half-floors
All these half-floors
Will lead to mine
We'll see to
All these half-floors
All these half-floors
We'll see to
All these half-floors
Will lead to mine
All these half-floors
We can unwind all our floors
We can unwind all our floors5Embed
