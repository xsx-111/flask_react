A Hundred and Sixty Acres LyricsI got a hundred and sixty acres in the valley
Got a hundred and sixty acres of the best
Got an old stove there that'll cook three square
And a bunk where I can lay me down to rest
Up at dawn to greet the sun
I've forgotten what a care or worry means
Head for home when day is done
With my pocket money jinglin' in my jeans
I´ve got a hundred and sixty acres full of sunshine
Got a hundred and sixty million stars above
Got an old paint hoss, I'm the guy who's boss
On the hundred and sixty acres that I love!
Up at dawn to greet the sun
I´ve forgotten what a care or worry means
Head for home when day is done
With my pocket money jinglin' in my jeans
I´ve got a hundred and sixty acres full of sunshine
Got a hundred and sixty million stars above
Got an old paint hoss, I'm the guy who's boss
On the hundred and sixty acres that I love!
Got an old paint hoss, I'm the guy who's boss
On the hundred and sixty acres that I love!1Embed
