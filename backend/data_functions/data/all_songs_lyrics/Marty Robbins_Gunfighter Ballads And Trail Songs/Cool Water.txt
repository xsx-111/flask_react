Cool Water Lyrics
All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for you and me?
Water
Cool, clear water
The shadows sway and seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there He'll hear our prayer
And show us where there's water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waitin' there for you and me?
Water
Cool, clear water
Cool, clear water1Embed
