Kokoku LyricsI come very briefly to this place
I watch it move. I watch it shake
雲湧く山の、 私の叫び、 私の声を
勇者の故国、 私はそこに、 私は遊ぶ
They say the dead will rise again
And here they come now, strange animals out of the Ice Age
And they stare at you, dumbfounded,  like big mistakes. And we say:
Keep cool. Maybe if we pretend this never happened, they'll all just go away
私はそこに、私は遊ぶ、目を閉じ、目を閉じ
(And yet, we could all be wrong)
聞くのは小鳥、私の叫び、私の声を
(Wouldn't be the first time)
雲湧く山の、私はそこに、私は遊ぶ
雲湧く山の、聞くのは小鳥、私の叫び
They say the world is smaller now. Small world
They say that man is taller now. Tall man
They say the stars are closer now. Thank you, lucky stars
You come very briefly to this place
And on a very distant star, slimy creatures scan the skies. They've got plates for hands. And telescopes for eyes
And they say:
Look! Down there! A haunted planet spinning 'round
They say:
Watch it move. Watch it shake. Watch it turn
(...私の叫び、私の声を、目を閉じ、目を閉じ)
And shake
And we say:
Watch us move. Watch us shake. We're so pretty
We're so pretty
We say:
Watch us move now. Watch us shake. We're so pretty
Shake our hands. Shake our heads. We shake our feet. We're so fine
The way we move. The way we shake. We're so niceEmbed
