Blue Lagoon LyricsI got your letter. Thanks a lot
I've been getting lots of sun. And lots of rest. It's really hot
Days, I dive by the wreck. Nights, I swim in the blue lagoon
Always used to wonder who I'd bring to a desert island
Days, I remember cities. Nights, I dream about a perfect place
Days, I dive by the wreck. Nights, I swim in the blue lagoon
Full fathom five thy father lies. Of his bones are coral made
Those are pearls that were his eyes. Nothing of him that doth fade
But that suffers a sea change. Into something rich and strange
And I alone am left to tell the tale
Call me Ishmael
I got your letter. Thanks a lot
I've been getting lots of sun. And lots of rest. It's really hot
Always used to wonder who I'd bring to a desert island
Days, I remember rooms. Nights, I swim in the blue lagoon
I saw a plane today. Flying low over the island
But my mind was somewhere else
And if you ever get this letter. Thinking of you
Love and kisses. Blue Pacific. Signing offEmbed
