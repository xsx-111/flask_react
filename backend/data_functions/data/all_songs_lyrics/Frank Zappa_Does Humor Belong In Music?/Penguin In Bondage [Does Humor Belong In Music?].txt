Penguin In Bondage  LyricsHe's just like a Penguin In Bondage, boy
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...
Rennenhenninnahenninnenninahennn
Way over on the wet side
Of the bed
Just like the mighty Penguin
Flappin' her eight ounce wings
Lord, you know it's all over
If she come atcha on the strut & wrap 'em all around yer head
Flappin' her eight ounce wings, flappinumm
She's just like a Penguin In Bondage, boy
Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho!
Ooh, you missed! Oh sorry!
How 'bout the next contestant?
Shake up the pale-dry
Ginger ale
Tremblin' like a Penguin
When the underpants fail
Lord, you must be havin' her jumpin' through a hoopa real fire
With some Kleenex wrapped around a coat-hang wire
Little Penguin
A dirty little bird!
(What?)
She's just like a Penguin In Bondage, boy
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...
Rennenhenninnahenninneninahenn
Howlin' over to some
Antarcticulated moon
In the frostbite nite
With her flaps gone white
Shriekin' as she spot the hoop across the room
The you-hoo-hoo
One-Adam-Twelve, see the room^LYou know it must be a Penguin bound down
When you hear that terrible screamin' and there ain't no other
Birds around
She's just like a Penguin In Bondage, boy
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...
She's just like a Penguin In Bondage, boy
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...
Rennenhenninnahenninneninahennnn
Aw, you must be careful
Not to leave her ho ho ho
TOO LOOSE
(To count in France)
'Cause she just might box yer dog
'Cause she just might box yer doggie
An' leave you a dried-up kind of a dog biscuit...Embed
