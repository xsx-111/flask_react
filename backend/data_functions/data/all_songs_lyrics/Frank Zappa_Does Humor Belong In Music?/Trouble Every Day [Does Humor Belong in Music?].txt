Trouble Every Day  Lyrics(It's a boy in a muumuu)

Well I'm about to get sick
From watchin' MTV
I been checkin' out the HO HO HO!
Until my eyeballs fail to see
I mean to say that every day
Is just another rotten group
(Right you are, girl)
And when it's gonna change, my friend
Will probably make you stoop, I don't know
So I'm
Watchin' and I'm waitin'
Hopin' for the best
Even think I'll go to prayin'
Every time I hear 'em sayin'
(Oh no!)
There's no way to delay
That trouble comin' every day
There's no way to delay
That trouble comin' every day

Wednesday I watched the riot
I seen those cops out on the street
I watched 'em throwin' rocks & stuff & chokin'
In the heat
I listen to reports
(Oh, we gotta . . . )
'Bout the whisky passin' around
(Sho' nuff . . . don'tcha!)
I seen the smoke & fire
And the market burnin' down
Watched while everybody
On his street would HA HA HA!
To stomp & smash & bash & crash & slash & bust & burn
And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
Hopin' for the best
Even think I'll go to prayin'
Every time I hear 'em sayin'
(Oh no!)
There's no way to delay
That trouble comin' every day
There's no way to delay
That trouble comin' every day
I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'
Hopin' for the best
Even think I'll go to prayin'
Every time I hear 'em sayin'
(Oh no!)Embed
