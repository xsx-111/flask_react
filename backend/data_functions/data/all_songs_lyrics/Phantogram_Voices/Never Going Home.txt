Never Going Home Lyrics
Baby, don't die on me
I believe in trust
Late night
I go to sleep
Wondering what is real

If this is love
I'm never going home
If this is love
I'm never going home
If this is love

Mama
You screamed to me
After all these years
Daddy
You've walked the dirt
All these holidays fun
If this is love
I'm never going home
If this is love
I'm never going home
If this is love
If this is love
I'm never going home
If this is love
I'm never going home
If this is love5Embed
