Bad Dreams Lyrics
Bad dreams never affect me
I'm not afraid of the concrete
Bad dreams never affect me
I'm not afraid of the concrete

I’m not doing this all in fun
I just gotta go
I’m not doing this all in fun
Just say goodbye
Baby you’ve got soul

To changing me
(And I believe this happened once before)
To changing me
(And I predict the world will be all gone)
To changing me
(And I can see the same things that you see)
To changing me
(‘Cause I predict the world)

Bad things never neglect me
I’m just a scene in a movie
Bad thoughts never arrest me
I’m just a flash in a memory
I’m not doing this all in fun
I just gotta go
I’m not doing this all in fun
Just say goodbye
Baby you’ve got soul

To changing me
(And I believe this happened once before)
To changing me
(And I predict the world will be all gone)
It’s a shame you never knew it
(And I can see the same things that you see)
It’s a shame you never knew it
(‘Cause I predict the world)3Embed
