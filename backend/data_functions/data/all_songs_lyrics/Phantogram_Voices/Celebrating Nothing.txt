Celebrating Nothing Lyrics
Tell myself I'm fine in celebrating nothing
And all the time I waste on celebrating nothing

How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down

Give me a reason to stay alive
I've got the feeling we're gonna die

I hide behind my eyes and lies and broken mirrors
And every day I say this time around my vision's getting clearer

How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down
(x2)
Give me a reason to stay alive
I've got the feeling we're gonna die
(x2)
How many times can I blow it all
How many times will I burn it down
(x2)
Give me a reason to stay alive
I've got the feeling we're gonna die3Embed
