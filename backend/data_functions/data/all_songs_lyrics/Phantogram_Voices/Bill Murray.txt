Bill Murray LyricsAm I lonely?
Oh it feels like when the day breaks
Am I wanted inside?
Say goodbye, do you feel liked?
Wave goodbye, and your heart's not in line

Burning star
Burning star
Am I lonely?
Cause it feels right
If I look up, can you keep me alive?
Wave goodbye to your family and friends
Those lost ants
And your eyes bleed when you see
Cause nothing works inside
