My Only Friend Lyrics
I have all the stars with you
I have enough

I will wait outside
As long, as you, are alright
I will know to die
You are beloved
You are beloved
You are...

I will wait outside
As long, as you, are alright
I will wait outside
You were cold, last night
So cold, my God
So cold
Hide your broken bones
In my hands
You've lost your battle
And I, I had it all, we had it all
And we don't have to ask
Why believe the lies
That people tell you, you've lost your battle
And vines and tiny thoughts
Inside your wound
You're all I have
My only friend
You're all I have
My only friend
You're all I have
My only friend
You're all I have
My only friend
You're all I have
My only friend
You're all I have
My only friend
You're all I have
My only friend
You're all I have
My only friend
I had all the stars with you4Embed
