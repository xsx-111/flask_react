Fall in Love Lyrics

Love, it was enough to recognize
To see, I was the reason you feel sick inside

Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, I may be
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, I

Love, it cut a hole into your eyes
You couldn't see you were the car I crashed
Now you're burning alive

Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, baby
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, I

Babe, the night it swallowed my soul
Could it be that I fell apart? It shows
The lines on the face ate away my smile
Could it be that I fell apart?
Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, baby
Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, baby
