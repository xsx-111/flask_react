Howling At The Moon Lyrics
I got everything, and I know what to do
I could run the show, cut the inventory too
Howling at the moon, howling at the moon
I could fire .45's all day into the sun
And say goodbye
Not the shooting stars
Not the crashing cars
Not the future past
Was made to last
I didn't know
I didn't know
I didn't-

At night I cry and howl at the moon
At night I cry and howl at the moon

Say goodbye for now
And I’ll say it again
All the stars at night
Won’t save my friend
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon
Howl at the-
At night I cry and howl at the moon
At night I cry and howl at the moon

And if I ever fall asleep
I’ll turn it around and face the sea
Yeah, I will crucify my dreams to be on your side
To see you alive
To see you alive
To see you alive

At night I cry and howl at the moon
At night I cry and howl at the moon

And if I ever fall asleep
I'll turn it around and face the sea
Yeah, I will crucify my dreams to be on your side
To see you alive
To see you alive
To see you alive2Embed
