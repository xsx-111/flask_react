Black Out Days Lyrics
Stay-ay ay ay ya away-ay ya away-ay ya

Hide the sun
I will leave your face out of my mind
You should save your eyes
A thousand voices howling in my head

Speak in tongues
I don't even recognize your face
Mirror on the wall
Tell me all the ways to stay away

Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
And stay away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya

Dig a hole
Fireworks exploding in my hands
If I could paint the sky
Would all the stars then shine a bloody red?
Stay-ay ay ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya
And stay-ay ay ay ya
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya

And stay-
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine)
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)
And stay-
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices all the time and they're not mine)
Away-ay ya
Away-ay ya (I'm hearing voices and they're haunting my mind)

Black out days
I don't recognize you anymore35Embed
