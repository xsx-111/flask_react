Nothing but Trouble Lyrics
Do you ever have the feeling that you constantly
Been dreaming this is life?
Everyone I know is not around
And Lucy's still been crawling underground

They're eating all my shotgun smiles
Yeah eating all my shotgun smiles
I'm nothing, I see nothing but double

Don't listen to me
I'm nothing but trouble
I'm losing my mind

I don't want wanna see another night
No, I don't want to taste another lie
The walls are breathing in and out and I
Continue to deny another

They're eating all my shotgun smiles
Yeah eating all my shotgun smiles
I'm nothing, I see nothing but double
Don't listen to me
I'm nothing but trouble
I'm losing my mind
Don't listen to me
I'm nothing but trouble
I'm evil inside9Embed
