The Day You Died Lyrics
What would I do if it didn't affect you
Merry-go-round and round and round
Tell me the truth, I know that you're leaving
Tell me the truth, I know it's you

Strange it didn't affect me
Strange it didn't affect me

Oh, stay
Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all
What should I do
It completely destroyed you
Swimming around, around and drown, oh
Tell me the truth love
I know that you need me
Tell me the truth, I know it's you


I came to say goodbye, cause you're feeling nothing
Assuming to your heart, we got nothing at all
Cause even if you wanna try to see if there's something
I drove into your heart, we got nothing at all
And I don't care to say goodbye, cause i'm feeling nothing
I dug into your heart, we got nothing at all7Embed
