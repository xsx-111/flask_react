Graveyard Lyrics
In a graveyard, I've been
A body I have seen

A female condom's what you should be throwin in
You need protection, I'm sick and I'm going in
I'm sick when I flow with pens
The shit like some old Depends
The pick of the chosen men
I flip...hold up
I'm the Talcum Malcolm, the Emo Primo
Got no need for beef, got a Vegan ego
I'll squeeze three freaks in a El Camino
Arizona Charlie's East Casino
A stack on Blackjack, 3 on Keno
So much cream that they screen my C-Notes
Stains on my jeans, breath reeks of Cheetos
These girls on my team, breast meat and deep throat
She don't swallow? That claim's preposterous
Lets just say she has a populous esophogus
She prolly wanna crash, but no Bandicootin
And yes we're going Dutch, but no Vanderslootin
Cus I don't hit women, but I'll annoy a bitch
Wiretap your phone, Rod Blagojevich
I Vincent Van Gogh hard in the paint (ay!)
What gave you the impression that I can't? (ay!)
Many have tried, most of them failed
Trap or Die, Oregon Trail
You won't prevail if you push me
I'm that dude, Todd Palin
I get dumb...pussy
There's a gem found in every heap beneath when you're six feet deep
A ledger that points to treasure
Pots of immeasurable gold
That are six feet deep
The Grim Reaper reaps the souls of those
Who walk in their sleep, we're all six feet deep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep though I'm walking in heat
It's like I'm six feet deep

All at once I stepped out of a dream
That music in my ear
All at once I stepped out of a dream
But a body that was me2Embed
