Rhythm of the Rain Lyrics
Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind
Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

Let’s blaze, what a way to escape
What’s a way for you to waste away your days of mistakes?
Eyes glossy, glazed-over like, donuts and cakes
You’re happy with somebody so you wish and hope that it’s fate
But what if it’s fake? Hell of a scam, the whole time
All for the pie, you know, key lime
If it all ended today, at least you tried
It was a nice ride, time to go inside
Yourself and take a look at the person and how it’s hurtin’
Like how could somebody love you for years and then desert ya
What’s the whole purpose? Experience of learning?
Exterior is strong but inside you’re certainly burning
Take two of these that’s the remedy for anything
You could be happy or else, at least pretend to be
Own biggest enemy, killing self slow
They tell you hold on loose but never let go
Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

Yo
I still remember the first time I realized that life wasn’t picture perfect
My father packing up his things to leave his kids deserted
The rain reflecting off the windows as it hit the surface
I wonder if he thinks the shit was worth it
As I sit here and write another one
Puffin on another blunt
Zonin til’ my buzz is done
Proud to be my mother’s son
See, she taught me to always be calm and pensive
And live my life without ever regrettin mistakes and consequences
My strongest lessons as a young fella
You see I’ve done hella runnin through the rain with no umbrella
But no complainin it just forced us to become better
Wintertime – one sweater
Dinnertime – crumbs fed us
I sit and think about the wisdom that I’ve gained
Reminiscin as I listen to the rhythm of the rain
I’m driven and persistent with my vision and my aim
If I did it all again I would live this all the same
Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

Yo, uh
I’m storm chasing
And she’s an F-5 with a sex drive that’ll leave me tied to her bedside
Hurricane hips, stoppin all progression
Serotonin levels drop, tropical depression
She is my professor and I’ve been taught a lesson
That in the eye of the storm the pressures barometric
She knows I’m wary of her game plan
But when she gambles she can count on me
I’m her Rain Man
Damn shame man, the fly stewardess
Mental turbulence, head off in the cumulus
Blaming the weather or whatever for her moodiness
My main star but I’m barely on her radar
And so my heart sinks – or the pain floats
I’m in a shit storm, shoulda wore a raincoat
The clouds break and I can tell its over
Cause she’s my sunshine but I’m catching melanoma
Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
(So let the rain fall down)
How could I﻿ go wrong?
(Let it fall, let it fall)
I was ruling my mind
(So let the rain fall down)
I must have been blind1Embed
