Sweet Little Sixteen (Live) LyricsThey're really rockin' in Boston
In Pittsburgh, P.A
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
'Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen
Sweet little sixteen
She' just got to have
About a half a million
Famed autographs
Her wallets filled with pictures
She get 'em one by one
Becomes so excited
Watch her, look at her run
'Cause they'll be rockin' on Bandstand
In Philadelphia, P.A
Deep in the heart of Texas
And 'round Frisco Bay
All over St. Louis
'Way down in New Orleans
All the cats wanna dance with
Sweet Little Sixteen
Sweet Little Sixteen
She's got the grownup blues
Tight dresses and lipstick
She's sportin' high heel shoes
Oh, but tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her trend
And be sweet sixteen
And back in class again
Oh, mommy, mommy
Please may I go?
It's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show
Oh daddy, daddy
I beg of you
Whisper to mommy
It's all right with youEmbed
