Nice Boys Lyrics
She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smelling sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried

In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big, you know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home

I said, "Nice boys don't play rock and roll"
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price laying flat on her back

Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made
You know, nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was


Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get her ass around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with a flick and a spoon

And in the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big, you know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Na, na, na na, na, na, baby
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'll bet your mamma said
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
