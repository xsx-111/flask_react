Move to the City Lyrics
You pack your bags and you move to the city
There is something missing here at home
You fix your hair and you are looking real pretty
It's time to get it out on your own
You are always fighting with your mama and your papa
Your family life is one big pain
When you, you gonna move to the city
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, time you gotta move


You stole your mama's car and your daddy's Plastic credit card
You are sixteen and you can't get a job you're not going very far
You are always riding with the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane
When you, you are going to move to the city
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, time you gotta move
Right to the city where the real men get it
Child isn't it a pity
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me


You are on the streets and it isn't so pretty
You need to get a new what you please
You do what you got to do for the money
At times you end up on your knees
I am always buying with the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain
But you, you had to move to the city
Into the city where it all began

You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, time you gotta move

Oh right to the city with the real nitty gritty
Aw, child isn't it a pity
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me1Embed
