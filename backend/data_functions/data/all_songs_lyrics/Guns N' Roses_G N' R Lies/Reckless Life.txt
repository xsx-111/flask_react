Reckless Life Lyrics
Hey fuckers! Suck on Guns N' fuckin' Roses!

I am reckless and feeling no pain
You know I have got no need to control
Living with the danger, I am always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Living like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain and you know I know my part

On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I am never alone because I have got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Living like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain because it is coming from my heart

I lead a reckless life and I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only vice


Reckless life, I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only
Reckless life, I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only4Embed
