Dindi LyricsSky, so vast is the sky
With far away clouds just wandering by
Where do they go?
Oh I don't know, don't know
Wind that speaks to the leaves
Telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and to me
Oh, Dindi, if I only had words
I would say all the beautiful things that I see
When you're with me
Oh my Dindi
Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees
That's how my heart is singing, Dindi
Happy Dindi
When you're with me
I love you more each day
Yes I do, yes I do
I'd let you go away
If you take me with you
Don't you know, Dindi
I'd be running and searching for you
Like a river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you, my Dindi
Can't find the sea
That would be me
Without you, Dindi
Like a river that can't find the sea
That would be me without you, my DindiEmbed
