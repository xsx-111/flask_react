Just As Good As Gone Lyrics
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone

I stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping, mmmhmm
It breaks my heart to see you lying there, alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong

Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone

There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls, mmmhmm
Living separately together in a house that's not a home

Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone

Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as goneEmbed
