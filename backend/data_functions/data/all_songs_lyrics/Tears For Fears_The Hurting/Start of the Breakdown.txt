Start of the Breakdown Lyrics
Scratch the ice, let the telephone ring
Sense of time is a powerful thing
And we love to laugh, love to cry
Half alive we love to
Go slow when we're dancing for rain
Dry skin flakes where there's ice in the vein
And we love to cry, half alive

Is this the start of the breakdown?

Scratch the earth, dig the burial ground
Sense of time won't be easily found
And ten out of ten for the ones
Who defend, pretend too
Breakdown is a final demand
We stand firm with our heads in our hands
As we love to cry, half alive

Is this the start of the breakdown?
I can't understand you
Is this the start of the breakdown?
I can't understand you
Is this the start of the breakdown?
Break, breakdown
Break, break


I can't understand you
Is this the start of the breakdown?
I can't understand you
Is this the start of the breakdown?
I can't understand you
Is this the start of the breakdown?
I can't understand youEmbed
