Ideas As Opiates Lyrics
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you will
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you will

Cause I find you think what makes it easier
And I find you think what makes it easier

Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you will
Say what you want
Say what you want
Say what you will

Cause I find you think what makes it easier
And I find you think what makes it easier

And lies spread on lies
We don't care
Belief is our relief
We don't care
Cause I find you think what makes it easier
And I find you think what makes it easier

And lies spread on lies
We don't care
Belief is our relief
We don't care3Embed
