Memories Fade Lyrics
There's only need, I love your need
So much I'm losing me
I cannot see the reason for the pain
With hungry joy, I'll be your toy
Just hoping you will play
Without the hope my body starts to fail

Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye, my friend
Will I ever love again?
Memories fade but the scars still linger
Woah, woah

I cannot grow, I cannot move
I cannot feel my age
The vice-like grip of tension holds me fast
Engulfed by you, what can I do
When history's my cage?
Look forward to a future in the past

Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye, my friend
Will I ever love again?
Memories fade but the scars still linger
Woah, woah

The more I talk, the more I say
The less you seem to hear
I'm speechless in a most peculiar way
Your mind is weak, your need is great
And nothing is too dear
For you to use to take the pain away

Memories fade but the scars still linger
Goodbye my friend
Will I ever love again?
Memories fade
When I die, pretend you can justify the end
Memories fade but the scars still linger
Woah, woah, still linger
Still linger, woah3Embed
