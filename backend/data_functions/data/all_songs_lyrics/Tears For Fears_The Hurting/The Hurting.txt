The Hurting Lyrics
Is it an horrific dream?
Am I sinking fast?
Could a person be so mean
As to laugh and laugh

On my own
Could you ease my load?
Could you see my pain?
Could you please explain
The hurting


Could you understand a child
When he cries in pain?
Could you give him all he needs
Or do you feel the same?

All along
You've been told you're wrong
When you felt it right
And you're left to fight
The hurting
The hurt, hurt, hurt
The hurt, hurt, hurt


Get in line with the things you know
Feel the pain, feel the sorrow
Touch the hurt and don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
Get in line with the things you know
Learn to cry, like a baby
Then the hurting won't come back
Won't come back, won't come back

The hurt, hurt, hurt
The hurt, hurt, hurt

Is it an horrific dream?
The hurt, hurt, hurt
Is it an horrific dream?
The hurt, hurt, hurt
Is it an horrific dream?
The hurt, hurt, hurt
Is it an horrific dream?
The hurt, hurt, hurt
Is it an horrific dream?
The hurt, hurt, hurt
Is it an horrific dream?
The hurt, hurt, hurt
Is it an horrific dream?
The hurt, hurt, hurt1Embed
