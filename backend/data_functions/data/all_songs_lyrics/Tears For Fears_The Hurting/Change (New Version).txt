Change (New Version) Lyrics
You walked in to the room
I just had to laugh
The face you wore was cool
You were a photograph

When it's all too late
It's all too late

I did not have the time
I did not have the nerve
To ask you how you feel
Is this what you deserve?

When it's all too late
It's all too late

Change
You can change
Change
You can change
And something on your mind
Became an attitude
You wore to secrecy
And said goodbye to youth

When it's all too late
It's all too late

We walk and talk in time
We walk and talk in two
And we say "C'est la vie"
How thoughtless, how untrue

When it's all too late
It's all too late

Change
You can change
Change
You can change
What has happened to
The friend that I once knew?
Has he gone away?


When it's all too late
It's all too late


Change
You can change
Change
You can change

Change
You can change
Change
You can change

Change
You can change
Change
You can changeEmbed
