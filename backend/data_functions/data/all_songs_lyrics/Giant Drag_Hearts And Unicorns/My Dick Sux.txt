My Dick Sux LyricsOh I felt
Rushing to the kill
But only
I forgot one thing
I'll only lie
If I should die
Don't make me try
It burns meaningless
Oh I'm hot
Bruised and sane with dirt
But you
Drown me til I'm blue
My only lie
If I should die
Don't make me cry
Feeling meaningless
Oh I feel for you
What I feel for you
I will run from you
And I will come for you
My only lie
If I should die
Don't make me try
It burns meaningless
My love is meaningless
My life is meaningless
This all is meaninglessEmbed
