YFLMD LyricsOK, I made a mistake
And if we kiss here
My word dear
You and your gun
Oh, hell
You fit me so well
And if we leave here
I will be back, dear
You and your gun
You and your gun
Father
You're just like my father
Father
You're just like my father
You and your gun
You and your gun
Father
You're just like my father
Father
You're just like my father
Father
You're just like my fatherEmbed
