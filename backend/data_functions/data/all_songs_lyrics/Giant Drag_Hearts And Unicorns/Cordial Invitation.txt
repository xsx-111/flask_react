Cordial Invitation LyricsOh watch this for a minute
It could change any second
Don't you let him forget it
Oh oh
Oh watch this for a minute
It will change any second
Don't you let him forget it
Can't give out
Your dream
Is my nightmare
Your dream
Is my new kiss
Oh don't stop me believing
Once I get my head in it
I will run from the corner
I will leave here this minute
Your dream
Is my nightmare
Your dream
Is my new kiss
Your dream
Don't have me there
You'll see its different when you care
You're not what I thought
Your dream
Is my nightmare
Your dream
Is my new kiss
You're not what I thoughtEmbed
