Blunt Picket Fence LyricsTook so long to grow
Just a moment to destroy
Its not hard to know
Just a moment from a baby boy
Its hard to miss
I'll kiss your fist for now
Who have you stolen from
Will you take from me
When you're old enough
I'll tell you everything
Its hard to miss
I'll kiss your fist for now
Who you know and where you go
Its not my dish
If you stay gone long enough
You're gonna miss oh oh oh
Its hard to miss
I'll kiss your fist for nowEmbed
