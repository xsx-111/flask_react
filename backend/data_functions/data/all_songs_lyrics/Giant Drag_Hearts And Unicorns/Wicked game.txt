Wicked game LyricsThe world was on fire and no one could save me but you
Strange what desire, make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you...
I never dreamed that I'd loose... Somebody
*Chorus*:
And I don't wanna fall in love
No I don't wanna fall in Love...
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, You never felt this way
What a wicked thind to do, Make me dream of you
*Chorus*
The world was on fire now no one could save me...
Ain't it strange what desire....
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you...
I never dreamed that I'd loose... Somebody
*Chorus*(with extra)
And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
No I don't wanna fall in Love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
And I.... I don't wanna fall in Love (this world is only gonna break your heart)
Nobody loves no oneEmbed
