High Friends in Places LyricsMove to the room
Down on the bed
These are the things she said
And make it good
And make me clean
These are the things I need
But I can't have just one
Because it isn't enough for me
We'll understand
Talk in your sleep
Tell secrets that we keep
I'm calling you
Out of the crowd
Yeah mommy is so proud
But I can't have just one
Because it isn't enough for me
And I can't have just one
You know it isn't enough for me
One isn't clean
And one isn't man enough for me
To make me believe
That one could ever fill my need
To be
And I can't have just one
You know it's never enough for me
And I can't have just one
You know it isn't enough for me
One isn't clean oh yeah yeah
One isn't man enough for me
To make me believe oh oh yeah
That one could ever fill my need
One isn't clean
And one isn't man enough for me
Just make me believe
Make me believe
Make me believeEmbed
