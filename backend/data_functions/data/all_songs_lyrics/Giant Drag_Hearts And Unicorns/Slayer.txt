Slayer LyricsHaven't felt me feel real in a long time
Why won't you touch me?
Everything is yours, nothing's mine
You don't owe me
Anything
Make mistakes like we know how
We're learning slowly
Still the same? i beg to differ
You hardly know me
All the things you say get back at you
Today i woke up hurting
Did i ever sleep?
Wake me up before california
Darling boy, i always adore ya
If this is what you want, then i'll leave
Baby
Maybe
Haven't felt so well for some while now
You can't slow me
Make mistakes like only i know how
I don't even know me
Anymore
All the things i say
Give 'em back to me
Today i woke up hurting
Did i ever sleep?
Wake me up before california
Darling boy i've never known ya
If this is what you need, then i'll leave
Baby
Baby
I'm sorry
Baby
All the things i say
I'll give 'em back to you
Always wake up hurting
Did i ever sleep?
Wake me up in time for california
And i'm the one to forget all about you
And then i'll leaveEmbed
