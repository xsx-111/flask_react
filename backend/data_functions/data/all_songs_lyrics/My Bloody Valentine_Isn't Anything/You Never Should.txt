You Never Should Lyrics
Twisting round inside
My heart is burning up, my head divide
But you control these feelings I can't hide
Tried to change my mind
Until the end there's nothing in control of you
It isn't easy but that's all I can do

Oh, you took a long time
Yeah, 'cause you probably could
Ooh, you said the fault was mine
Yeah, but you never should

Breaking down again
You're running little circles through your hair
I could walk away now and you wouldn't care
Don't look so surprised
You crawl around and then you seem to wonder why
I turn around and see madness in your eyes

Oh, you took a long time
Yeah, 'cause you probably could
Ooh, you said the fault was mine
Yeah, but you never should1Embed
