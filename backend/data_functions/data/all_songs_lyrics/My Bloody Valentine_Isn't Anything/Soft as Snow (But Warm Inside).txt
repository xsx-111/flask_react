Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside) Lyrics
Soft as snow but warm inside
Penetrate, you cannot hide
Feeling lost forever, really need you
Feeling dark and feeling true
This is all I ever knew
Soft as skin in leather and I whisper, "You"

Harder you come down on me (Ooh, ooh)
Sink away, you look happy (Ooh, ooh)
Secrets keep forever, they're undressing me (Ooh, ooh)
Come inside, it's warm in here (Ooh, ooh)
Better now to have no fear (Ooh, ooh)
Carried on a wave, where it can lead you? (Ooh, ooh)

Touch your head, then your hair
Softer, softer everywhere
Fingertips are burning, can I touch you there?
Soft as velvet, eyes can't see
Bring me close to ecstasy
High away to heaven, and I'm coming too

Float now, coming down on me (Ooh, ooh)
Handed you what I cannot see (Ooh, ooh)
Feel the big happy, you're exploding me (Ooh, ooh)
Soft as snow and warm inside (Ooh ooh)
Penetrate then re-divide (Ooh, ooh)
Slip away forever, really need you (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh1Embed
