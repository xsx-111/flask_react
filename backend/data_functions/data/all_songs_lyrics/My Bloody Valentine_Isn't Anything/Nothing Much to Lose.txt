Nothing Much to Lose Lyrics
Your soft hand
But I don't understand
Your big brown eyes
With a small small heart

I'll come down, down, down
Oh, you don't know what you found
Don't, don't walk, walk, walk away

Take me
I will remember you
Long dark hair
Nothing much to lose

Help you crawl crawl crawl
Oh, I want to see it all
Eyes asked, "Why? Why? Why?"
Too late

Please you
Oh, I know what to do
A soft salt taste
Do you see me as a fool
Can I look, look, look
Oh, the things you took
Eyes asked, "Why? Why? Why?"
Too late
I'll come down, down, down
Oh, you don't know what you found
Don't, don't walk, walk, walk away3Embed
