All I Need Lyrics
You don't ask what I needed to do
When I come back you'll need to choose
Oh, whatever I ask you take take take take
Oh, this is all I need to say

It's in your eye, I wondered why
No need to say how close can we lie
Oh, we don't talk, you know all I need
Oh, this is what I need to take

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

You don't ask what I needed to do
When I come back you'll need to choose
Oh, all I ask you do do do do
Oh, this is all I need from you

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm3Embed
