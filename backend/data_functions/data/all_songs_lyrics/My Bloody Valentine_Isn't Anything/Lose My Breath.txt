Lose My Breath Lyrics
Keep coming now
Possessed of nothing more than hell
Before I can speak
My world is wishing me asleep

Weigh me down
And when the darkness comes around
Repeating heads
Remember nothing I have said

Where are you
Come back again, I want you too
"Not now, girl," you say
But I was born to lose my breath2Embed
