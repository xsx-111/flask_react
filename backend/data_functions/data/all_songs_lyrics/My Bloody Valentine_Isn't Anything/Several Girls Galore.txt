Several Girls Galore Lyrics
Heard that I met me once before
Was it me or just don't you care

Once more ignore
As I wrap me around we
I'm never quite there at all

So which me should I prefer
To go out driving in my car
Feeling so sore
I took me out dancing
Three of me or more

Insane, I'm sure
We're living inside me
Are several girls galore

Once more ignore
I'll wrap me around we
I'm never quite there at all
Insane, I'm sure
We're living inside me
Several girls galoreEmbed
