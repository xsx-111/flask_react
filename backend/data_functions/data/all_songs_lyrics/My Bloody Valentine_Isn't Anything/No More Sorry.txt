No More Sorry Lyrics
What happened now
And again
And then again
And again
Left me black and blue

No more sorry

Flesh and bone
Not alone
You're not alone
Waiting by the telephone
Whatever you do

Don't call daddy

In my hair
Everywhere
Everywhere
And everywhere
Fingerprints of you
Filthy, dirty

Wash and mend
And wash and mend
Some kind of friend
Your septic heart, your deadly hand
Left me black and blue

No more sorryEmbed
