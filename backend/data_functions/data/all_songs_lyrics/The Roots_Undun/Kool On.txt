Kool On Lyrics
Whoa, ohh
Whoa, ohh, mm

Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine (Aah)
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine (Aah)
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine (Aah)
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine

I’m in the double-G, three-piece tux
Screaming, "Dressed to kill," hope somebody call my bluff
It’s a full house, sipping on a Royal Flush
Two queens is on my cuffs, good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time, I’m paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is "en garde"—I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel?
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think:
"How do you find this upper echelon?"
It's time, let’s toast to better days
A beautiful mind and a flow that never age
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine

Yo, I’m never sleeping like I’m on methamphetamines
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precede me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangster steez beyond the seventies
Holding fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers, rich, but never famous
Hustle anonymous, still remain nameless
In hindsight, gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I’m calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
It’s suicide, right? Pursuers tried, like
To no avail, and a hero's what they died like
I got 'em waiting on the news like I’m Cronkite
Not in the limelight or needed for crime, right?
No boasts, just bodied, and chalked close to the line-sight
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside, they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair, but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi, yeah, the bastards of the party home
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Been a quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined, the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
'Cause them long days in the sun have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in the narrow lane
Say "Cheese," freefalling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap
For all the years that we spent in luxury's lap without looking back
'Cause memories could sting like a hornet
Damn, it felt good to see people up on it
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine
Come get your kool on
Stars are made to shine, stars are made to shine5Embed
