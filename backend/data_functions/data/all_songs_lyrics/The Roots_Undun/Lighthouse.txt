Lighthouse Lyrics
If you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with this
Now, if you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with... this

And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face-down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
Face-down in the ocean

Smoking cheap weed, sipping on cheap vodka
Yo, pick your poison, down Davy Jones’ locker
It’s rum we be wanting, by the tons, my consumption
Take a look at my lungs and my liver, it’s disgusting
Take a look at the man in the mirror, we start fussing
Only one person gets hurt when throwing punches: me
And the man behind the glass just laughs
The waves come over my head and just crash
My hand start bleeding, water starts receding
A feeling comes into my heart, I start believing that—
I actually might survive through the evening
Survive on my own thoughts of suicide that’s competing
With thoughts of tryna stay alive, which been weakened
By the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
The fear of drowning, still diving in the deep end
The waters carried me so far, you can’t reach him
And it feels like there’s no one...
And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face-down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

After the love is lost
Friendship dissolves, and even blood is lost
Where did it begin? The way we did each other wrong
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across
I stopped holding my breath, now am I better off?
There, without a trace, and you in my head and all?
The halted motion of a rebel without a pause
What it do is done 'til you are dead and gone
The Grim Reaper telling me to swim deeper
Where the people go to—lo and behold, the Soul Keeper
I’m not even breaking out in a sweat or cold fever
But I’m never paying up on my debt—or tolls, either
I’ll leave the memories here, I won’t need 'em
If I stop thinking and lie—now, that’s freedom
Your body’s part of the maritime museum
And face-down in the past is where I’m being
And no one’s in the lighthouse
You’re face-down in the ocean
And no one’s in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It’s no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there’s no one there
That cares if you drown
You're face-down in the ocean

If you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with this
Now, if you can‘t swiz-zim, then you're bound to driz-zown
Passing out life jackets, 'bout to go di-down
Get down with the captain, or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss, I’ma hit you with... this6Embed
