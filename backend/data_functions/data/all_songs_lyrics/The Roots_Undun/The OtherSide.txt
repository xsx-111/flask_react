The OtherSide Lyrics
Two—

Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running 'round town, spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena, let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down, low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low, so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen, if it not for these hood inventions
I'd be just another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay, serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to Hell, I’m gonna make an entrance, yeah
Let 'em know I’m getting cheese like omelets is
But I’m the toast of the town like Thomas is

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry 'bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score
Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying coldblooded hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs, but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return and learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now, all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah, that hindsight 20/20
Now, niggas dead on the money
Try to take something from me, it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun, I am becoming
And when he’s tired of running through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear 'cause there’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind, scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time, and it passed by

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score
I’m sitting on top of the world, ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to break a gun law
Thinking that enough is enough, but still, I want more
Thinking how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
Any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night, I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose, get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way, the market moves
Cash rules, kings, queens, prince, and princess
Every night, I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now, I’m on the edge of my bed, making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head when I’m getting mine

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I make it to the other side (Make it to the other side)
That’s when we’ll settle up the score
Score, score, score, score, score
Score, score, score, score
Score, score, score, score
Score, score, score...7Embed
