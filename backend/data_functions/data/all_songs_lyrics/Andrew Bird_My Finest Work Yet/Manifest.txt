Manifest Lyrics
I'm coming to the edge of the widest canyon
My companions' dear
I'm starting to question my manifest destiny
My claim to this frontier

I'm coming to the brink of a great disaster
The end just has to be near
The Earth spins faster, whistles right past you
Whispers death in your ear
Don't pretend you can't hear
Don't pretend you can't

I can hear your tendrils still digging
For everything that's walked this Earth once living
Then to be exhumed and burned to vapor
Can you save her?
Now she's in the air
Radical and free
Neither here nor there
She's obliged to no one
She's obliged to no one
Yeah, yeah
I'm coming to the edge of a rising ocean
Such commotion and fear
Keeping all our eyes on what's on the horizon
And all that we hold dear

I'm coming to the brink of a great disaster
End just has to be near
The Earth spins faster, whistles right past you
Whispers death in your ear
Don't pretend you can't hear
Don't pretend you can't

I can hear your tendrils still digging
For everything that's walked this Earth once living
Then to be exhumed and burned to vapor
Can you save her?
She's in the air
Radical and free
Not a goddamn care
She's obliged to no one
She's obliged to no one
Oh, no
Don't pretend you can't hear
Don't pretend you can't hear5Embed
