Sisyphus Lyrics
Sisyphus peered into the mist
A stone's throw from the precipice, paused
Did he jump or did he fall as he gazed into the maw of the morning mist?
Did he raise both fists and say, "To hell with this" and just let the rock roll?

Let it roll, let it crash down low
There's a house down there but I lost it long ago
Let it roll, let it crash down low
See my house down there but I lost it long ago


Well, I let the rock roll on down to the town below
We had a house down there but I lost it long ago
Lost it long ago
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm letting it roll away
It's got nothing to do with fate
And everything to do with you

I'd rather fail like a mortal than flail like a god, I'm a lightning rod
History forgets the moderates
For those who sit recalcitrant and taciturn
You know I'd rather turn and burn than scale this edifice, yeah
Where's my accomplice?
So take my hand, we'll do more than stand
Take my hand, we'll claim this land
Take my hand, and we'll let the rock roll
Let it roll, let it crash down low
There's a house down there but I lost it long ago
Let it roll, let it crash down low
See my house down there but I lost it long ago
Lost it long ago

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm letting it roll away
It's got nothing to do with fate
And everything to do withâ€“


Sisyphus peered into the mist
A stone's throw from the precipice, paused9Embed
