Olympians Lyrics
You were inhabited
Speaking in tongues in the night
I wasn't having it
I could tell that something wasn't right
Why don't you come to bed
Instead of stumbling into the light
Of medicine cabinets?
Shaking out pills left and right
Right

Who's giving up the most?
No one's gonna give you a medal
Who's giving up the ghost?
Oh, wouldn't you like to know

The competition rages
This nocturnal dance
The misery's contagious
We are Olympians

Oh, we're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around, yeah
We're gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn
You start spitting out anathemas
You start spitting out anathemas
It was anathema
Spent half of my life on the exchange
Oh, it was anathema
'Bout half a mile between addled and deranged
Oh, it was anathema
La-da-da-da-da-da
It was anathema
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Who's giving up the most?
Who's giving up the most?
Who's giving up the most?
You were speaking in tongues in the night
Who's giving up the most?
I could tell that something wasn't right
Who's giving up the most?
Shaking out pills left and right
Who's giving up the most?
Stumbling into the light
Light

The competition rages
This nocturnal dance
Misery's contagious
We are Olympians
Oh, we're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around, yeah
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
