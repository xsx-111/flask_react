Bloodless Lyrics
They're profiting from your worry
They're selling blanks down at the DMZ
They're banking on the sound and fury
Makes you wonder what it all's got to do with me

Bloodless for now

I'm keeping mine with the altruists
I'm putting my weight behind the dancer
I know it's hard to be an optimist
When you trust least the ones who claim to have the answers

And it's an uncivil war
It's an uncivil war
It's an uncivil war

Bloodless for now

And the poets, they explode like bombs
(Bloodless for now)
While the gentry is drinking Moet Chandon
(Bloodless for now)
Turn around and quote a well known psalm
Don't you worry 'bout the wicked
Don't you envy those who do wrong
And your innocence will be like the dawn
While the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun

Well, the best lack all conviction
And the worst keep sharpening their claws
They're peddling in their dark fictions
While what's left of us, well, we just hem and we haw

And it feels like 1936
In Catalonia
In Catalonia

Bloodless for now
Bloodless for now

And the poets, they explode like bombs
(Bloodless for now)
Drinking Moet Chandon
(Bloodless for now)
Turn around and quote a well known psalm
Don't you worry 'bout the wicked
Don't you envy those who do wrong
And your innocence will be like the dawn
While the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun1Embed
