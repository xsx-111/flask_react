Cracking Codes Lyrics
You just have to look into my eyes
You don't need a secret code
No need to play at being spies
And though I may speak to you in tongues
We don't need Rosetta Stone
To know how this song is sung

But you can read between the lines
And you can savor every word
There'll be times when you are stammering through tears
So long they're not from crocodiles
It will be music to my ears
To your ears, to my ears
Because what you say is true
Yeah, it's true

'Cause what I say is1Embed
