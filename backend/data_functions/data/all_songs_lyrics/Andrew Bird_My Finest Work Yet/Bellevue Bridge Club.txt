Bellevue Bridge Club Lyrics
And I will hold you hostage
Make you part of my conspiracy
You will be witness to carnage
You know there's no you without me

I'm gonna shake you
'Til it wakes you, yeah
From your waking dream
Show you affecting scenes
Of life beyond your front door
I will exploit you
Then conscript you
For my narrative schemes
Show you distressing scenes

I'm gonna drag you from your bed onto your floor
By any means necessary
By any means necessary
By any means necessary
I'm gonna dig up what you buried, yeah
By any means necessary

There you go again
Finding brilliant ways to make things harder
Are we smarter alone or in this endless Stockholm syndrome?
Here's what is known
We're gonna break this two-way mirror
I'm gonna shake you, break you
By any means necessary
By any means necessary
By any means necessary ('Til some)
By any means necessary (Some day)
By any means necessary (Whoa, some sweet day)

We will be playing bridge on the psych ward
With Arthur, Jane and Lou
We will be playing bridge on the psych ward
With Barbara, Gene and Sue
Whoa, and if you ever start to get bored
You know there's no one to blame but you

And I will hold you hostage
Make you part of my conspiracy
You will be witness to carnage
You know there's no you without meEmbed
