Don the Struggle Lyrics
Come on everybody, let's settle down
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town

I saw you stumble through the theater
Spilling drinks on everyone
And it's the young ones that I fear for
Forgive us, we know not what we've done

Come on everybody, let's settle down
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling

Clinging to the thread of the notion that your fight is a righteous one
The more you have to try to convince yourself
The more you're gonna hear a dissonant sound
But dissonance is energy while the consonance reminds you of your poverty
Do you follow me?
Oh, come on everybody, let's settle down
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town

I saw you limping through the exit row
Boasting of the wars you've won
You know they say that what you reap you sow
You're welcome, enjoy the mess, but now I'm done
Yeah, you can thank me later, but now my race is runEmbed
