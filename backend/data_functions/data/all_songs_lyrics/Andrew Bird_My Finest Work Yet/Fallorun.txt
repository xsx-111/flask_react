Fallorun Lyrics
We could have been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here
You know I was your rain and thunder
Upon your hills and valleys
We could have been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here
You know that light is passing through it
It's 'cause there's nothing really here
You know he's just a mere conduit
For all of your fears

You think you're making choices
But there's no one really here
Just tone-deaf angry voices
That are breathing in your ear

Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
It's taking us back to a one-horse town
Building us up just to tear us down
So you can fallorun

You know we could have been together
But you traded hell for leather
A closer walk with thee
And we locked our horns forever
We could've been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here
He's nothing without you
He's nothing without you
You think it's just an aberration
That it could not happen here
Such an abomination
Could be the man of the year
You think you're making choices
But there's nothing really here
Just tone-deaf angry voices
That are breathing in your ear

Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
They say Rome wasn't built in a day
But it all came down in the month of May
Oh, fallorun

You know we could have been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here
You know I was your rain and thunder
Upon your hills and valleys, dear

You think you're making choices
But there's nothing really here
Just tone-deaf angry voices
That are breathing in your ear

Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun
He's taking us back to a one-horse town
Building us up just to tear us down
Well, we sure hope you can stick around
And you don't fallorun, oh1Embed
