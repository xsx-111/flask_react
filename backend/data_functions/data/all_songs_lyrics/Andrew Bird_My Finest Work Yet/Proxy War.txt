Proxy War Lyrics
He don't have to get over her
She don't to have get over him
With all their words preserved forevermore
You don't have to get over her
She don't have to get over you
It's true these two have never met before

At least not in real life
Where your words cut like a knife
Conjuring blood, biblical floods
Looks that stop time

You don't have to remember
We forget what memories are for
Now we store them in the atmosphere
If you don't want to get too close
You don't have to get too close
It's just what we're calling peer-to-peer
You don't want to get over
You don't have to get over
We store them in the atmosphere
If you don't want to get over her
She don't have to get over you
It's true these two have never met before
At least not in real life
Where your words cut like a knife
Conjuring blood, biblical floods
Looks that stop time

If you don't want to get over her
You don't have to get over her
If you don't want to get too close
You don't have to get too close
If you want to remember
If you don't want to get over
If you don't want to get over
If you don't want to get overEmbed
