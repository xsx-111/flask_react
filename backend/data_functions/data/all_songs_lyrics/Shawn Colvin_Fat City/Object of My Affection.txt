Object of My Affection Lyrics
Jump into the night
Gas up and downshift
Cruise up the coast
On the FM drift
It's a crazy world
On the head of a pin (Come to me)

Oh some other time
Or some other star
I might've cried but now
You only need to look so far
As the smile on my face (Come to me)
To see the shape I'm in (Come to me)

You try love in a bottle
Try love in a box
Play it all night long
Dance 'til you drop
And it sure got soul baby
But it's not flesh and blood (Come to me)

Well I tried looking for love
But I guess it's true
You don't look for love
It's gonna look for you
Well you found me, honey (Come to me)
And you sound so good (Come to me)
You're the object
Of my affection
Not a dream
Or make believe
You're the object
Of my affection
Come to me

Now we see the women
In the photograph
Sweet Anne of mercy
And Sylvia Plath
For a thousand words
They got a life sentence (Come to me)
Oh yeah

If we lined up all the girls
Who died in vain
We could walk on their heads
To hell and back again
But I got the big book (Come to me)
And antidepressants (Come to me)
You're the object
Of my affection
Not a phantom fantasy, yeah
You're the object
Of my affection
Come to me
Hey!


You're the object
Of my affection
Not a toy with batteries
You're the object
Of my affection
Not a rescue remedy, oh no
You're the object
Of my affection
Come to meEmbed
