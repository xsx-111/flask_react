Round of Blues Lyrics
Here we go again
Another round of blues
Several miles ago
I set down my angel shoes
On a lost highway
For a better view
Now in my mind's eye
All roads lead to you

So wherever you go
You better take care of me
This time
If you're gonna go
Remember me and all
This time

We had our bitter cheer
And sweet sorrow
We lost a lot today
We get it back tomorrow
I hear the sound of wheels
I know the rainbow's end
I see lights in a fat city
I feel love again
So wherever you go
You better take care of me
This time
If you're gonna go
Remember me and all
This time

All this time
I been makin' deals
Shades of black and white
On a Hollywood reel
All this time
I been missing
Something so real
All this time
I been a face in the crowd
Now I'm living in color
And laughing out loud
All these names
For just foolin' around
It's a new breakthrough
It's an old break down

We smoked a lot of hope
We did our cryin' , too
We're finally waking up
To what real love can do
Down a lost highway
Under the twilight moon
A chorus in your eyes
Another round of blues
So wherever you go
You better take care of me
This time
If you're gonna go
Remember me and all
This time

We had all
This time
We had all
This timeEmbed
