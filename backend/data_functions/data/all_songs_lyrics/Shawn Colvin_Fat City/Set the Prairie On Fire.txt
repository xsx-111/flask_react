Set the Prairie On Fire Lyrics
Full full moon and
That same sad nature
I wanna cover every inch of you
Like ink on paper
Like the blind parade of souls
Consumed by religion
I can't wait 'til I get you
In that defenseless position

When we set the prairie on fire
Oh we go down to the water
Naked and slow
You and me
And the heart of desire
We set the prairie on fire
How hard will the wind blow?
How far will it go?

When this feeling burns down
To one solitary color
The velocity of longing
Melting into each other
It's a song our fingers play
All at once and together
You can bet we never learned it
But we've known it forever
Oh I dreamed that we were flying
Carried up from the ashes
Black silhouettes of velvet
Against the crimson of passion
We can almost hear the echoes
From the smoldering meadow
It's the rapture of the angels
And the rage of the devil

When we set the prairie on fire
Oh we go down to the water
Naked and slow
You and me
And the heart of desire
We set the prairie on fire
How hard will the wind blow?
How far will it go?

In the cool dusk of horses
Through the rusted wires of sleep
With our arms around midnight
We're headed for release
We go riding in the wind
We go riding in the dark
Riding, riding, oh, oh
When we set the prairie on fire
Oh we go down to the water
Naked and slow
You and me, you and me
And the heart of desire
We set the prairie on fire
How hard will the wind blow?
How far will it go?
How far will it go?
How far will it go?
How far will it go?
How far will it go?Embed
