Tenderness on the Block Lyrics
Mamma where's your pretty little girl tonight
She's tryin' to run before she can walk
That's right
She's growing up
She's got a young man waiting
She's growing up
She's got a young man waiting

She's wide-eyed
She'll be streetwise
To the lies
And the jive talk
But she'll find true love
And tenderness on the block

Now daddy don't you ask her when
She's comin' home
When she's back don't ask her where
She's been
She's going out
She's got a young man waiting
She's going out
She's got a young man waiting
She'll be okay
Let her have her way
It's a long way
It's a long walk
But she'll find true love
And tenderness on the block
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
And tenderness on the block

Now I know how much it hurts to see her go
But she's got a mind of her own you know
She's all grown-up
She's got a young man waiting
She's all grown-up
She's got a young man waiting

She was wide-eyed
Now she's streetwise
To the lies
And the jive talk
But she'll find true love
And tenderness on the block
She was wide-eyed
Now she's streetwise
To the lies
And the jive talk
But she'll find true love
And tenderness on the block
Yeah, she's gonna find true love
Hey, she's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
Oh, she's gonna find true love, yeah
She's gonna find true love
Find true love
She's gonna find true love
Find true love
Mmm, She's gonna find true love
Find true love
She's gonna find true love
Find true love
Hey, she's gonna find true love
Find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
Oh, she's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true loveEmbed
