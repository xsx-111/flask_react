Our Basement (Ed) LyricsIn the fleeting blush
Between dusk and afterlight
Your eyes were aglow like two moons
Then your smile shot through me
Tranquilizing all the ache
And now I'm higher than the streetlights
Fading on beneath the nightskies blue
I imagine you
Doing simple things
Like humming
One part of a song
That you like
Singing out the words that move you
Down the avenue
While I watched you walk past me
On a day like this
Summer fever's all you think
No drop can escape this relentless heat
A familiar sound
Passing by cools everything
And I hide my face behind the shame of all the sins
That kept that sound from me
And imagine you
Doing simple things
Like humming
One part of a song
That you like
Singing out the words that move you
Down the avenue
While I watched you walk past me
Down the avenue
While I watched you walk past me
Down the avenue
While I watched you walk past me
In the fleeting...
No drop can escape...
I hide my face behind the shame for all the sins that
Keep this sound from me...
The sound...Embed
