Ceaseless Inexhaustible Child (Cyntoia Brown) LyricsAt first light
Collect your thoughts
Run on by
I will drag your heart
Cross the floor
Slip right under
The burden of thee
Fragments of the past
Well they always come rushing on back
I slither along with them
Ceaseless inexhaustible child
Done and dusted from the get go
I'm done and dusted
At first light
Every crime lives on
They glint and gleam for me
They glint and gleam for me
Glint and gleam for me
There I go again
Slipped under the burden of it
Done and dusted
I'm
Ceaseless inexhaustible child
They slither along with me, slither along
They always come crawling back
Fragments of the past
They always come rushing on back
At first light, every crime lives on
There I go again
Slipped under the burden of you
There I go again
There I go again
There I go again
Done and dusted
Ceaseless inexhaustible child
You're done and dustedEmbed
