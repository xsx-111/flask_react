Tightrope Lyrics
My words are weapons, in which I murder you with
Please don't be scared, please do not turn your head
We are the future; the 21st century dyslexic, glue sniffing cyber sluts
With homicidal minds and handguns
We are insane, nothing will change

There is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
And, I will tiptoe down that line, but I will feel unstable
My life is a circus and I am tripping down that tightrope
Well, there is nothing to save me now, so I will not look down
And again, and again, and again, and it happens again
And again, and again

There's no beginning, there is no end
There is only change
Progression backwards, is this where we are heading
Take back your soul, forget your emptiness

There is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
And, I will tiptoe down that line, but I will feel unstable
My life is a circus and I am tripping down that tightrope
Well, there is nothing to save me now, so I will not look down
And again, and again, and again, and it happens again
And again, and again
I speak of madness, my heart and soul
I cry for people who have got no control
Lets take our sanity, lets take compassion
And be responsible for every action
Hell no, no how, no way, no way, no way, no how, no way, no how

There is a thin line between what is good and what is evil
And, I will tiptoe down that line, but I will feel unstable
My life is a circus and I am tripping down that tightrope
Well, there is nothing to save me now, so I will not look down
And again, and again, and again, and it happens again
And again, and again

Down to the ground, all the way down, hidden in the dirt3Embed
