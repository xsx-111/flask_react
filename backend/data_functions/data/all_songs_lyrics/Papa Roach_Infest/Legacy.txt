Legacy Lyrics
Dead president, fuck the president
Masons strive for power while I work to save my residence
He owns you, even though he never told you
Mark of the beast on your hand, now he owns you

Thrown down to the bottom level
Ruled by the fist and the fist is the devil
I metamorphosize and make myself level
We are the future, we are right now

Right now
I'm taking a stab at the sick, sick, sick
I know what evil is and evil can suck my dick
Like Samhain and the God is no joke
Better watch your neck cause you might get choked


You sink, we swim. We rise, you fall. We meet our fate together
I was here from the start, and I'll be here in the end
In the end
I'm dodging arrows from the dark side everyday
And I'm a main target cause of what I say
Infinitely always go against the grain
And question everything, before he takes your brain


Yeah, come on!
Yeah, come on!


Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
I was here from the start, and I'll be here in the end
In the end
Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacyEmbed
