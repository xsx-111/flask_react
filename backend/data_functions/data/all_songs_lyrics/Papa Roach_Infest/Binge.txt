Binge Lyrics
Can you take that down?
So, can you take that down?

All I need is a bottle
And I don't need no friends, no
Wallow in my pain
I swallow as I pretend
To act like I'm happy
When I drink to no end, no
I'm losing all my friends
I'm losing in the end

She says, "Behave, little boy
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground"

When I'm sober life bores me
So I get drunk again, yea yea
I'm losing all my friends
I'm losing in the end
She says, "Behave, little boy
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground"

You better sit back down
You better put that down
Put the bottle down
I am on a binge

She says, "Behave, little boy
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground
It's your turn to learn to fight
You better sit back down
Till you hold your ground"

I am on a binge
I wish things would change
Wish they rearrange
I'm on a binge
I wish things would change
Wish they rearrange
I'm on a binge
I'm on a binge
Yea yea1Embed
