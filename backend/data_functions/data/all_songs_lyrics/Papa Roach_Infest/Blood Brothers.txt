Blood Brothers Lyrics
Watch your back because the next man is coming
And you don't know if the next man is dumbin'
Survival of the fittest what it is
I got your back, you got my back and that's the biz
Blood is rushing through my veins, I got the power
Channel the energy and with my strength I will devour
Sickening thoughts is running through my head
That's when I realize I'm glad I'm not dead

Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill

It was a dream and then it hit me, reality struck
And now my life is all shifty and it all moves fast
Close to a buck fifty; we all stand strong
In respect to the family in times of insanity
And through words of profanity
I describe our dysfunctional family
Blood brothers keep it real to the end
Deeper than the thoughts you think, not a trend
Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public's craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill
It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill
Again and again

Corruption and abuse
The salesman of our blood
For the public is craving
Existence in the dark

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, kill

It's in our nature to destroy ourselves
It's in our nature to kill ourselves
It's in our nature to kill each other
It's in our nature to kill2Embed
