Infest Lyrics
Welcome to the original Papa Roach soundfire
Viva la Cucaracha!

My name's Coby Dick
Mr. Dick if you're nasty
Rock a mic with a voice that's raspy
And I'm poetic in my operations
My God given talent is to rock all the nations

We're going to infest

Infest, the theory of my first manifesto
Push your wig back with my lyrical pistol
Blow, now Papa Roach is on your mental
Banging like your headpiece, it's just that simple
Cock back and unleash with my physical
Wrap you in my thoughts and become indivisible
Centrifugal forces, individuals
Stick to my mind as we rock into ritual

You better do just what I say
And if you don't then you will pay
Infest!
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family

You bettter do just what I say

Now that I got your attention
Did I forget to mention
All the heads we be infesting
Hope you people learn your lessons
'Cause the game of life is crazy
Got all y'all people guessing
What is wrong with the world today?
Government, media, or your family
Would you cry if I died today?
I think it'd be better if you did not say
You better do just what I say
And if you don't then you will pay
Infest!

We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family

We will infest, die like the rest
First they shackle your feet
Then they stand you in a line
Then they beat you like meat
Then they grab you by your mind
First they shackle your feet
Then they stand you in a line
Then they beat you like meat
Infest your mind
We will infest, die like the rest
People are the problem today
We will infest, die like the rest
People are the problem today

We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family
We're going to infest
We're getting in your head
What is wrong with the world today?
The government, the media or your family!1Embed
