Never Enough Lyrics
Life's been sucked out of me
And this routine's killing me
I did it to myself
I cannot say it would not be
Somebody put me out of my misery
Expression, stimulation, hollow sense of myself
I did it to myself again
Somebody put me in my place

Never enough
Never enough
Do I deserve
What I got?

Now everything's okay
There's nothing wrong with me
This seems unnatural
To me I'd say in every way
Somebody kick me in my face
Now something's wrong with me
I'm bleeding profusely
And this seems natural
To me I fuck up everyday
Somebody put me in my place
Never enough
Never enough
Do I deserve
What I got?
Never enough
Never enough
Do I deserve
What I got?
What I got?
What I got?
What I got?

I feel as if I'm running
Back to where I started
You ask what's wrong with me
And I say nothing
Is everything okay?
Is something wrong with me?
Pushing and pulling feelings eternal
My heart is yours

I feel as if I'm running
I feel as if I'm running
I feel as if I'm running
Run
Life will knock me down
Never enough
Never enough
Do I deserve
What I got?

Never enough, never enough
Life will knock me down2Embed
