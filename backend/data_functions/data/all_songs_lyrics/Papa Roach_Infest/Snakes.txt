Snakes Lyrics
I got a problem with the snakes that are crawling
Through my area
When the darkness has fallen
And Mama told me that they love to bite
They stab you in the back
No shame that's right
What? What?
I keep my distance because they are making me crazy
And stealing from me
You know those fuckers are lazy
My blood boils
Fat turns to oil
Step the fuck back or you will get buried in soil
Over drama
Or you could sleep with the fishes
My clutches are tight
And I'll take your last wishes
One for your money
Two for your girl
Three for your life
Now, I fucked up your world

Do you like how it feels?
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
I don't like how it feels, check it
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
Break it down
Yo, it's kind of funny how you are running your mouth man
You are caught in a lie
And now there's no way out, come on
Betray your friends and your peeps and your family
Living like a snake
Living like a bloody thief
Check my speech cause it's deep like the sea
From me to you all
And then from you all back to me, ha
Danger, danger
Slay snakes like a ranger
Military style fears God
Not a stranger
Now tell me, tell me whose crew sicker
Mine's sicker
Get on your knees to be a dick licker
One for your money
Two for your girl
Three for your life
Now, I fucked up your world

Check it
Do you like how it feels?
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
I don't like how it feels, check it
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
Do you like how it feels?
I don't like how it feels
I don't like it
I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't like it
I don't want it
I don't need it
What the fuck is up?

Do you like how it feels?
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills
Do you know how it feels?
To be stabbed in the back then watch your blood spill
Do you like how it feels?
I don't like how it feels
To be bit in the neck by the snake that kills

By the snake that kills
By the snake that killsEmbed
