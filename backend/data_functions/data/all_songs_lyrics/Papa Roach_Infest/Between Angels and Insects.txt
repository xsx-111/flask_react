Between Angels and Insects Lyrics
There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my obsession

I just want to be heard
Loud and clear are my words
Coming from within man
Tell them what you heard
It's about a revolution
In your heart and in your mind
You can find the conclusion
Lifestyle and obsession
Diamond rings get you nothin'
But a lifelong lesson
And your pocketbook stressin'
You're a slave to the system
Working jobs that you hate
For that shit you don't need
It's too bad the world is based on greed
Step back and see
Stop thinking about yourself
Start thinking about

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Because everything is nothing, and emptiness is in everything
This reality is really just a fucked up dream
With the flesh and the blood that you call your soul
Flip it inside out It's a big black hole
Take your money burn it up like an asteroid
Possessions, they are never going to fill the void
Take it away and learn the best lesson
The heart, the soul, the life, the passion

There's no money, there's no possessions, only obsession
I don't need that shit
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Money, possessions, obsession

Present yourself, press your clothes
Comb your hair, clock in
You just can't win, just can't win
The things you own, own you. No!
Take my money, take my possessions, take my obsession
I don't need that shit
Fuck your money, fuck your possessions, fuck your obsession
I don't need that shit
Money, possession, obsession
I don't need that shit6Embed
