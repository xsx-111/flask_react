Dead Cell (live) LyricsBorn with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn 'em on
Process the data, make yourself the bomb
What is your target? What is your reason?
Do you have emotions? Is your heart freezing?
Seizin', this opportunity to speak
You didn't say nuthin' but turn your fuckin' cheek
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Sick in the head, living but dead
Hear what I said
Learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Jah, nutty warrior, nothin's scarier
Kids are gettin' sick like malaria
Situation gets hairier
I'm throwing up all types of barriers
I'm tellin' you
The kids are getting singled out
Let me hear the Dead Cell shout
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn them on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
No soul, no control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug 'em in and then turn them on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
Stop pointing fingers cause we all are guilty
Of clean cut lies and the truth that's filthy
Believe what is the root of the word
Out comes lie when it's cut into thirds
I don't believe what my eyes behold, No!
I don't believe what my ears are told, No!
Seizin, this opportunity to speak
I'm saying something don't turn your fuckin' cheek!
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!
Born with no soul, lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug them in and then turn 'em on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
No soul, no control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug them in and then turn 'em on
Process the data make yourself the bomb
Dead... Cell...
Dead... CELL!!!
Dead Cell! Dead Cell!Embed
