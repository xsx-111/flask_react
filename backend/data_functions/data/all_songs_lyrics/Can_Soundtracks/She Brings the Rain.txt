She Brings the Rain Lyrics
Yes I care if she brings me spring
But don't care about nothing
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

In the dawn of the silvery day
Clouds seem to melt away
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

She brings the rain, it feels like spring
Magic mushrooms out of dreams
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

So mellow yellow gray disappears
Flying on the raven's wing
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

Yes I care, she brings me spring
But don't care about nothing
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
Magic mushrooms out of things
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
She brings the rain

In the dawn of the silvery day
Clouds seem to melt away
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain2Embed
