Mother Sky Lyrics
I say madness is too pure like mother sky
I say madness is too pure like mother sky
I say madness is too pure like mother sky
I say madness is too pure like mother sky

I say madness is too pure like mother sky
I say madness is too pure like mother sky
Tell me what's the price of your life
Tell me what's the price of your life

I say madness is too pure like mother sky
Tell me what's the price of your life
Tell me what's the price of your life
Tell me what's the price of your life

Life and mother sky
And mother sky
And mother sky
And mother sky

I say madness is too pure like mother sky
Tell me what's the price of your life
I say madness is too pure like mother sky
I say madness is too pure like mother sky
Turning to desert
Turning to desert
Turning to desert
Shine like you2Embed
