Deadlock Lyrics
When we fool didn't know how build the new room
You could choose too along the sunshine
But then the smile and then the reefs just for chess and me
Now you fools stand happy in the pan
When the smile and tender leaves just for chess and me
Now you fools must stand in the pan
When we fool didn't know how build the new room
You could choose too along in the sunshineEmbed
