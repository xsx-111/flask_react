Tango Whiskeyman Lyrics
To leave the boy with the long hair
Are you singing, rhyme coming?
Here come a naturally chosen
Call him number one to sleep for
He sings another grip and still
Momma, papa, no one knows him
The one way they look at me
I don't lease in the morning crowd stay

He'll get a drink to his head
Everyone gets to know he's the next to fight
As victory don't get him
When he wins a cup, camouflage
When I talk to you
You just sing we're right, the way back
Can you hear me, my friend?
Don't break room, wish me luck

Why, why don't you dedicate
To follow chicks, so stupid, Saturday afternoon?
I, I know you and where you go
Like a stupid guy, tango whiskeyman
He'll get a drink to his head
No one get to know he's the next to fight
He read the story in bed
Where Daddy made me sleep in a frown
When I talk to you
You just sing you're right, the way back
Can you hear me, my friend?
Don't break room, wish me luck

Why, why don't you dedicate
To follow chicks, so stupid, Saturday afternoon?
I, I know you and where you go
Like a stupid guy, tango whiskeyman

To leave the boy with the long hair
Are you singing, rhyme coming?
Here come a naturally chosen
Call him number one to sleep for
He sings another grip and still
Momma, papa, no one knows himEmbed
