Stray Dog and the Chocolate Shake LyricsSupervisor guy turns off the factory lights
So the robots have to work in the dark
And there's a car load of kids with beer and cigarettes
Burning out and doin' lawn jobs in the park
And there's a shitty limousine parked in front of the bar
It never got to drive any movie stars
But the guy in the driver's seat don't care
With his weird cologne and his magic hair
It's magic
The sofa and the fridge are on the car
But they're not strapped down
And we're drivin' all over town
And the used-up krylon cans that the farmer found
Were used to paint the foothills brown
So there's a high school football coach sittin' on the couch
With a tooth pick in his mouth
And the stray dog won't forget the day
He tricked him with a chocolate shake
A little trickEmbed
