O.K. with My Decay LyricsI woke up Tuesday morning
To comin' down
Without a sound
Comin' back down
The pressure put upon me
It goes and goes 'til it thinks it got me
It tries and tries as it might to trick me
Into breaking back down
I'm OK
In truth I say
I'm OK
In truth I say
I'm OK
With my decay
I have no choice
I have no voice
I have no say
On my decay
I have no choice
So I'll rejoice
I'm OK
With my decay
I have no choice
I have no voice
I have no say
On my decay
I have no choice
So I rejoice
I'm OK
I'm OK
I'm OK
I'm OK
I'm OK
I'm OKEmbed
