Yeah Is What We Had Lyrics"Yeah" is what we had
"No" we never knew
"Good", "good" is what we understood
"Yeah" is what we had
And "no" we never knew
And "good", "good" is what we understood
Now I walk alone through howling winds
Fast food bags wrapped 'round my shins
Remembering (remembering)
Wondering...
In this life will I ever see you again?
In this life will I ever see you again?
'Cause "yeah" is what we had
And "no" we never knew
And "good", "good" is what we understood
"Yeah"'s what we had
And "no" we never knew
And "good", "good" is what we understood
Data files and dinner dates some day
Until then I had best be on my way
Remembering (remembering)
Wondering...
In this life will I ever see you again?
In this life will I ever see you again?
In this life will I ever see you again?
In this life will I ever see me again?
In this life
In this life
In this lifeEmbed
