Lost on Yer Merry Way LyricsTrouble with a capital T
"Tie him down," they said
But tired ain't for me
Let this one fly
I wonder what they'll make of me
When I'm good and gone in song
In God's country
Let this one fly
Off on a merry way
Often in a lotta days
Lost on yer merry way
Cause unrevealed and never known
And never known...
Trouble with people like me
Tie 'em down and then they vanish instantly
Let this one fly
Its really no problem, you see
When the sky ignites and your days crash quietly
Let this one fly
Off on a merry way
Often a lotta days
Lost on yer merry way
Cause unrevealed and tucked away
On yer merry way
Often a lotta days
Lost on yer merry way
Cause unrevealed and never known
All that I'm asking tonight
Is that I make it back home alive
No explosions, no crashes, no fights
I wanna get back home... (back home... back home...)
I wanna get back home... (back home... back home...)
I wanna get back home... (back home... back home...)
I wanna get back home... (back home... back home...)
Back home tonightEmbed
