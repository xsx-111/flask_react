Saddest Vacant Lot in All the World LyricsShe's in the kitchen
Crying by the oven
It seems she really loved him
He's so drunk he's
Passed out in a Datsun
That's parked out in the hot sun
In the saddest vacant lot in all the world
World
World
World
Boldly going
Where he rarely knows
But he'll miss her when he goes
What a shame
As she drifts out of reach
While he's still drunk asleep
In the saddest vacant lot in all the world
World
World
World
World
World
World
World
World
World
World
World
World (saddest vacant lot in all the world)
World (saddest vacant lot in all the world)
World
World (saddest vacant lot in all the world)
