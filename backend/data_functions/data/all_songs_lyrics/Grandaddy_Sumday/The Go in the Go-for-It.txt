The Go in the Go-for-It LyricsThe talk, it got so loud
The songs cut out
Well that's when I'd had enough
Of all their talk and stuff
I had to bring it down
To more level ground
Where my only company
Is wind blowing through the leaves
My head they tried to wreck
And I just laughed and said
Guess who lost the go in the go-for-it
When they expected that
They instead got this
The broken but pretty mess
What they care I could care less
My farewell e-mail reads
"Farewell to thee"
I'll pass through your world with ease
Like wind blowing through the leaves
My head they tried to wreck
And I just laughed and said
Guess who lost the go in the go-for-it
Despite the faxes sent
I shook my head and went
Guess who lost the go in the go-for-it
The go in the go-for-it
Guess who lost the go in the go-for-it
The go in the go-for-it
Guess who lost the go in the go-for-it
The go in the go-for-itEmbed
