The Warming Sun LyricsIn a dream
You were sitting there waiting by the door for me
And I got the opportunity
To experience
The experience once again
How it could have maybe been
But in real life
You're in another world and with another guy
Who doesn't have to cheat, he never has to lie
And all that stuff I didn't get comes so easy to him
He doesn't even have to try
Do you ever ask yourself
How it could have maybe been?
I haven't been that bad
But I haven't been that good
Overmisunderstood
Oh I wish I really could
Enjoy the warming sun
Enjoy a warm someone
And end the need to hide
Away alone inside
In a dream
You were sitting there waiting by the door for me
I said hey you, get out of my fog
I said hey you, get out of my fogEmbed
