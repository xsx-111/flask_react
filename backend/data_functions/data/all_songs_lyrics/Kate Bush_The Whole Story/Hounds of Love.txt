Hounds of Love Lyrics
It's in the trees
It's coming

When I was a child, running in the night
Afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark, hiding in the street
And of what was following me
Now hounds of love are hunting
I've always been a coward
And I don't know what's good for me

Oh, here I go
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I'll be
Two steps on the water

I found a fox, caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
And I'm ashamed of running away
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this
I'm still afraid to be there
Among your hounds of love
I feel your arms surrounding me
I've always been a coward
And never know what's good for me
Oh, here I go
Don't let me go
Hold me down
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, darling, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I'll be two steps on the water

I don't know what's good for me
I don't know what's good for me
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
Yeah, yo-, yeah, yo-your love
Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake
Do you know what I really need?
Do you know what I really need?
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah6Embed
