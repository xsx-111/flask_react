Breathing Lyrics
Outside gets inside
Through her skin
I've been out before
But this time it's much safer in

Last night in the sky
Such a bright light
My radar send me danger
But my instincts tell me to keep

Breathing
Out, in, out, in, out, in
Breathing, breathing my mother in
Breathing my beloved in
Breathing, breathing her nicotine
Breathing, breathing the fallout in
Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in

We've lost our chance
We're the first and the last, ooh
After the blast
Chips of Plutonium are twinkling in every lung
I love my beloved, ooh
All and everywhere
Only the fools blew it
You and me knew life itself is

Breathing
Out, in, out, in, out, in
Breathing, breathing my mother in
Breathing my beloved in
Breathing, breathing her nicotine
Breathing, breathing the fallout in
Out in, out in, out in, out in
Out in, out in, out in, out...
Out... out... out... out... out...

"In point of fact it is possible to tell the difference between a small nuclear explosion and a large one by a very simple method
The calling card of a nuclear bomb is the blinding flash that
Is far more dazzling than any light on earth - brighter even than the sun itself - and it is by the duration of this flash that we are able to determine the size of the weapon..."
What are we going to do without..?
"After the flash a fireball can be seen to rise, sucking up under it the debris, dust and living things around the area of the explosion and as this ascends, it soon becomes recognisable as the familiar 'mushroom cloud'. As a demonstration of the flash duration test, let's try and count the number of seconds for the flash emitted by a very small bomb; then a more substantial, medium-sized bomb; and finally, one of our very powerful 'high-yield' bombs."

What are we going to do without...
Ooh, please!
What are we going to do without..?
Let me breathe!
What are we going to do without..?
Ooh, quick!
We are all going to die without...
Breathe in deep!
What are we going to do without..?
Oh, leave me something to breathe!
We are all going to die without...
Oh, leave me something to breathe!
What are we going to do without..?
Oh, God, please leave us something to breathe!
We are all going to die without...
Oh, life is...4Embed
