Army Dreamers Lyrics
B.F.P.O
Army dreamers
Mammy's hero
B.F.P.O
Mammy's hero

Our little army boy
Is coming home from B.F.P.O
Wave a bunch of purple flowers
To decorate a mammy's hero
Mourning in the aerodrome
The weather warmer, he is colder
Four men in uniform
To carry home my little soldier

What could he do?
Should have been a rock star
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
What could he do?
Should have been a politician
But he never had a proper education
What could he do?
Should have been a father
But he never even made it to his twenties
What a waste, army dreamers
Oh, what a waste of army dreamers
Tears o'er a tin box
Oh, Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know
Like a chicken with a fox
He couldn't win the war with ego
Give the kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have buttons and bows

What could he do?
Should have been a rock star
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
What could he do?
Should have been a politician
But he never had a proper education
What could he do?
Should have been a father
But he never even made it to his twenties
What a waste, army dreamers
Oh, what a waste of army dreamers
Oh, what a waste of all them army dreamers
Army dreamers, army dreamers
