Business as Usual Lyrics
Look at the weather, look at the news
Look at all the people in denial
We're running time, leaving grace
Still we worship at the marketplace
While common sense is going out of style
I thought that I would be above it all by now
In some country garden in the shade

But it's business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Just grinding away
You try to be righteous
You try to do good
But business as usual
Turns your heart into wood

Monuments to arrogance reach for the sky
Our better nature's buried in the rubble
We got the prettiest White House that money can buy
Sitting up there in that beltway bubble
The main jefe talks about our freedom
But this is what he really means
Business as usual
How dirty we play
Business as usual
Don't you get in the way
Yeah, make you feel helpless
Make you feel like a clown
Business as usual
Is breaking me down

Boy, you can't go surfing in Century City
Yeah, them sharks out there are lurking beneath the curb
Yeah, they rob you blind, chew you up, and it ain't pretty
And it's a soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking, soul sucking
Soul sucking, soul sucking world

Business as usual
Day after day
Business as usual
Feel like walking away
A barrel of monkeys
Or band of renown
Business as usual
Is breaking me downEmbed
