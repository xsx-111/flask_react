Center of the Universe Lyrics
I come before you with my heart in my hand
Hoping you can see me through this veil of tears
Somehow I've got to make you understand
Ah, don't you know me after all these years?
Oh, love, I hate to disappoint you
But there's something you should know

This is not the center of the universe
That's alright with me
This is not the center of the universe
But it's where I want to be

I will be with you everywhere you go
In gentle breezes that caress your skin
And you will see me in the silent snow
In everything that comes around again
Oh, love, I'll always be beside you
Wherever you may roam
Someday, with all the stars to guide you
You will find your way back home
