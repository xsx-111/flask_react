Somebody Lyrics
You feel bad, but not bad enough
You know you had it coming because you played so rough
Back over your shoulder got an icy chill
Man, you thought you'd get away with it
Now you know you never will

Somebody, somebody
You got a feelin' somebody's following you

No one knows about the times you had
You've been so evil, you know, you've been so bad
There's a devil to pay for what you put them through
And you got a feeling somebody's following you


There's a jack-o-lantern moon in the midnight sky
Somebody going to live, somebody going to die
But down in the graveyard on that old tombstone
There's a big black crow and it's calling you home

Somebody
You know there's somebodyEmbed
