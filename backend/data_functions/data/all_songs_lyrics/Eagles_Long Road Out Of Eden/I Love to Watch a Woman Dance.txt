I Love to Watch a Woman Dance Lyrics
I love to watch a woman dance
She bows her head and lifts her hands
Her hips begin to circle slowly
Her eyes have closed, her face is holy
She holds the whole world in trance

I love to watch a woman dance
Yeah, I love to watch a woman dance

She likes the slow songs of love lost
They take her a million miles away
Because to dream, sometimes, is the only way
To go places you can't get to any other way
Our eyes connect, she takes my hand


I feel my heart beating, and I wonder
Will it ever satisfy my longing?
I'm going to hold on to you for as long as I can
For who knows, this dance may be our only dance
So we danced together, close and slow
So slow we're almost standing still
Her warm breath against my neck
Slowly breaking down my will
The room spins so I can barely stand
The song ends, then, she lets go of my hand
There's so much I don't understand
