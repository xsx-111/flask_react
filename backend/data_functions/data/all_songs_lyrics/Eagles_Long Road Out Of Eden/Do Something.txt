Do Something Lyrics
I've been walking through the fields
And on the streets of town
Trying to make sense of what you left me
Everything that I believed in
Has been turned upside down
And now it seems the whole wide world's gone crazy
But when I feel like giving up
And I'm ready to walk away
In the stillness, I can hear
A voice inside me say

Do something
It's too late for saving face
Don't just stand there taking up space
Why don't you do something?
Do something
It's not over
No, it's never too late

You were always on my side
Love was all we had
Now I sit and watch our love unraveling
I pick up the morning paper
All the news is bad
How did we get on this road we're traveling?
But when I feel like giving up
And there's nowhere left to go
That's the time I dig down deep
The only thing I know

Run away
You can't run away
For your honor
For your pride
You'll sleep better
Knowing you tried

To do something
Do something
It's too easy not to care
You're not ready for the rocking chair
Get up and do something
Do something
Don't wait too long
Even if it's wrong
You've got to do something
Do something
It's not over
No, it's never too late1Embed
