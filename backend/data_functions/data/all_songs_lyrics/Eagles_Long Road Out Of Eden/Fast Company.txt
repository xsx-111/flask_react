Fast Company Lyrics
Now, where you going?
Now, what's the rush?
You listen here
No, you just hush
I know what you think
That man don't know anything
But I've been around a while
I know what's happening
Everybody want to check you out
Everybody want to be your friend
And all this pressure
Where do I fit in?
They don't know nothing you don't know
Ain't got nothing you ain't got
But you keep on running, you keep on running with the

Fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast
Fast company
You're going nowhere, you're going nowhere fast

Now it's alright
To have some fun
This is your turn
Your life has just begun
You're racing out the door
Don't have very much to say
Your motor's running hot
You can't wait to get away
Looking up the road ahead
You can't see very far
Remember where you come from
Remember who you are
Be careful what you say
Be careful who you trust
This world is beautiful
This world is dangerous

Talk to me and help me try to remember
How it feels to be so in doubt
Turn to me and help me try to remember
That raging fire that the years put out
