Guilty of the Crime Lyrics
You're the only one who's ever heard my song
I might be lonely now, but I won't be lonely long
Take a look at me, baby
Tell me, what do you see?
Take a look at me, baby
You're looking at the brand new me
I'm like a total stranger knocking at your door
No need to worry about the way I was before
It's a new love story
So read every line
You be the judge and the jury
I'm guilty of the crime

I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime
Of loving you, baby
Guilty of, guilty of the crime

I'm saving all my loving just for you
Because there's nothing more that I would rather do
It's a new love story
Got to read every line
You be the judge and the jury
I'm guilty of the crime
