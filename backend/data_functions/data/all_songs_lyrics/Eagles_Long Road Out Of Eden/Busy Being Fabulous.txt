Busy Being Fabulous Lyrics
I came home to an empty house
And I found your little note
"Don't wait up for me tonight"
And that was all she wrote
Do you think I don't know that you're out on the town
With all of your high-rolling friends?
What do you do when you come up empty?
Where do you go when the party ends?

And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
I don't know what you were dreaming of
Somehow you forgot about love
And you were just too busy being fabulous, uh-huh

A little time in the country
A day or two to slow down
A bottle of wine and a walk in the moonlight
Maybe some fooling around
But you think time is just a magazine
And money's just a thrill
I've waited so long for you to change your way of living
Now I realize that you never will

You tell a joke and everybody's laughing
That's something you know how to do
You've always been the life of the party
But now my baby, the joke is on you
Because you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
Running after something that never comes
What in the world are you running from?
And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy to think about us
To drink the wine from your winner's cup
To notice the children were growing up

And you were just too busy being fabulous
Too busy, too busy
Too busy
Aw, babyEmbed
