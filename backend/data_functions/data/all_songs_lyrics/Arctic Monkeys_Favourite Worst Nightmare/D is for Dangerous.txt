D is for Dangerous Lyrics
He knew what he wanted to say
But he didn't know how to word it
The dirty little Herbert was seeking an escape
But the place was well-guarded
The guiltiness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare

'D' is for desperately trying to simulate
What it was that was alright
Three quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
On the brink of a mission
On the brink of an episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
A parallelâ€”I think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
'D' is for delightful and try and keep your trousers on
You should know you're his favourite worst nightmare20Embed
