Radio Ass Kiss LyricsCHORUS
Radio Ass Kiss on the air
Say what you like now no one cares
Radio Ass Kiss on the air
Say what you like now no one's scared
I caught the DJ pulling up his trousers
I'm staying tight lipped he's doing me a favour
I caught the DJ pulling up his trousers
Switch the station try another flavour
It's not seen, it's not heard
It's not mentioned by the spoken word
So bugger the plugger cos there'll be another
It's easy for the blind to see
And gives the company a policy
CHORUS
God bless the DJ jeepers yowsers
Who's got the problem?
Just look at my behaviour
God bless the DJ jeepers yowsers
Peel me off the cross
We don't need another saviour
It's not seen, it's not heard
It's not mentioned by the spoken word
So bugger the plugger cos there'll be another
I'm not making an apology
Or calling it my apology
Or calling it my policy
CHORUS
Thrills kids we've got another caller, a lady pickpocket from over the
Water. Jeez I'm swell for doing her a favour, another dance beat for her
Sickly little daughter
