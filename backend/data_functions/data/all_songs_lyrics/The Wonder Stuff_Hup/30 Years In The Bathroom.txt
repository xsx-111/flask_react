30 Years In The Bathroom LyricsMy lavatory has been my sanctuary
And it's easy for you to laugh at me
'Cos I been 30 good years in the bathroom, baby
Rubadubdub one man in a tub and it's me
Always me
CHORUS
And now the time has come to share the joke
That the latch on the bathroom door is broke
And now it's time to let you know
That it's only the beat of my heart that is slow
Who's fault is this? I deny that it's mine
I been stuck in here since 1959
That's 30 good years in the bathroom baby
But it's okay, yeah it's okay
Cos when they come to take me away
I will be clean, I will be clean
CHORUS
Well I been 30 years in a bad mood, baby
But it's okay, yeah it's okay 'cos that's better
Than 30 years on the back seat of a car
Oh beat me with the pumice stone
Eight to the bar
