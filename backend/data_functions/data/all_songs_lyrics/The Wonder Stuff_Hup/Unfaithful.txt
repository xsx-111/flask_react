Unfaithful LyricsShe left me once, she left me twice
She left me three times or more
But no, she didn't leave me at all
It's harder to smile when you've lied to a friend
But no, it's not hard at all
CHORUS
So it's back to the house and the wife and the kids
It's high time that she realised
But no, no it doesn't show
It was lucky I brought my disguise
Well if things never change I'll be back there again
I dare say there's some good in the bad
Deceit is a friend I've embraced him with ease
I missed out some of the chances I've had
CHORUS
