Piece Of Sky LyricsHow did you get so very high
You got so high you almost touched the sky
Lady luck couldn't wish you more luck than I
So take a jump and steal your piece of sky
If luck was a bird then you shot it down
It's blood and it's feathers they lay spread on the ground
I won't look at you and ask why
Cos you'd take a piece and stick it in your eye
CHORUS
No it'll never be the same
But we're not to blame
So what's the point in making starts
When making starts just tears your heart
And where's the sense in recompense
When recompense don't make no sense at all
So take a jump and steal your piece of sky
Yeah, take a piece and stick it in your eye
CHORUS
