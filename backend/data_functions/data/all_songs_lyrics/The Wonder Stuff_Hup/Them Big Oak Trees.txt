Them Big Oak Trees LyricsForgive us for the crimes that we are about to commit again
Forgive us for the stance we took
We are but little men

Oh I remember better times than these
Me, Acorn Man
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
I don't care to rhyme anymore
'Cause I've been seen as the money mad
Money mad topical bore

Oh I remember better times than these
Me, Acorn Man
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
And as Dave said with a cough
"Too much too soon"
Think again
Back to the boardroom
Think again
Back to the bedroom
Back to bed
Back to bed
Back to bed
Back to bed
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Same way it's always been
Oh I remember better times than these
Me, Acorn Man
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Oh I remember better times than these
Me, Acorn Man
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Oh I remember better times than these
Same way it's always been
Me, Acorn Man
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Same way it's always been
Oh I remember better times than these
Same way it's always been
Me, Acorn Man
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Them, big oak trees
Same way it's always beenEmbed
