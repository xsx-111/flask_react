Golden Green Lyrics"She's Golden but she's green
And all the things that i have seen
And all the items that i'm hoarding up the back stairs
Give 'em to me, give 'em now!
Shut it up you silly cow
How could you say i'd even think that, how?
These words are not my own
They only come when i'm alone
She is loved and she is welcome in my home
These words are not my own
They only come when i'm alone
She is loved and she is welcome in my home
She's taken all my vitamins
Used up my lighter fuel
I'm sure she stole all of my pencil lead in school
Don't flap i'll give it back
But woman its not the lack of my possesions
That is making me feel cruel
These words are not my own
They only come when i'm alone
She is loved and she is welcome in my home
These words are not my own
They only come when i'm alone
She is loved and she is welcome in my home
And if she loves me
She'll say that she loves me
Lies will shine in her eyes
And if she loves me
She'll say that she loves me
Even lies will shine in her eyes
These words are not my own
They only come when i'm alone
She is loved and she is welcome in my home
These words are not my own
They only come when i'm alone
She is loved and she is welcome in my home
These words are not my own
They only come when i'm alone
She is loved and she is welcome in my home"Embed
