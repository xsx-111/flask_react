Beetles in the Bog LyricsWhen the sun goes down
With the one you love
Out in the sky
Beetles in the bog
Laaa laa laa laaaa
Laaa laa laa laaaa
Laaa laa laa laaaa
Laaa laa laa laaaa
If the cloud is high
Let the spirit fly
Out of the sky
Beetles in the bog

Laaa laa laa laaaa
Laaa laa laa laaaa
Laaa laa laa laaaa
Laaa laa laa laaaaEmbed
