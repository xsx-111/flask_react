Breathe Lyrics
Breathe with me

Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane
Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane

(Come play my game)
Inhale, inhale, you're the victim
(Come play my game)
Exhale, exhale, exhale

Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane
Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane

(Come play my game)
Inhale, inhale, you're the victim
(Come play my game)
Exhale, exhale, exhale
Breathe with me
Breathe with me

Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane
Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane

(Come play my game)
Inhale, inhale, you're the victim
(Come play my game)
Exhale, exhale, exhale

Breathe with me

Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane
Breathe the pressure
Come play my game, I'll test ya
Psychosomatic, addict, insane
(Come play my game)
Inhale, inhale, you're the victim
(Come play my game)
Exhale, exhale, exhale4Embed
