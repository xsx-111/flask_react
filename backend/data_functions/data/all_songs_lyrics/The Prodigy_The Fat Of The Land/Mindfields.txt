Mindfields LyricsThis is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell-shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell-shock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell-shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell-shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
So watch your head rock
This shock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell-shock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell-shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This is dangerous
Open up your head, feel the shell-shock
This is dangerous
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This shock
This shock
Hahaha... I walk through mindfields, eh
This shock
This shock
This shock
This shock
This shock
This shock
This shock
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This shock
This shock
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
I walk through mindfields, so watch your head rock
This shock1Embed
