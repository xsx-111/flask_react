Cry For You Lyrics
When I—
When I—
When I—
When I—

When I cry for you (No explanation needed)
When I cry for you (It's not debated)
When I cry for you (It's so degrading)
When I cry for you (No hesitation)
When I cry for you (No explanation needed)
When I cry for you (It's not debated)
When I cry for you (It's so degrading)
When I cry for you (No hesitation)

And I can't dream it on my own
Another dream left all alone
Another reason, looking for love
Without a meaning, looking for hope
And I can't dream it on my own (When I cry for you)
Another dream left all alone (When I cry for you)
Another reason, looking for love (When I cry for you)
Without a meaning, looking for hope (When I cry for you)
When I cry for you (No explanation needed)
When I cry for you (It's not debated)
When I cry for you (It's so degrading)
When I cry for you (No hesitation)
When I cry for you (No explanation needed)
When I cry for you (It's not debated)
When I cry for you (It's so degrading)
When I cry for you (No hesitation)

And I can't dream it on my own
Another dream left all alone
Another reason, looking for love
Without a meaning, looking for hope
And I can't dream it on my own (When I cry for you)
Another dream left all alone (When I cry for you)
Another reason, looking for love (When I cry for you)
Without a meaning, looking for hope (When I cry for you)

I'm just sitting here thinking
Thinking 'bout when I started feeling
When I started myself from crying
Replacing what's lost, or at least trying
Never been so out of mind
Never been so into mind
Never been so wondering why
If this is for the best
If this is for the best
Let's put this to the test
Let's put this to the test
Whatever happens next (When I cry for you)
Let's put this to the test (When I cry for you)
Let's put this to the test (When I cry for you)Embed
