Need You Now Lyrics
I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now
I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now

Tired of being myself, caught up in this world
I never dreamed I could belong
To a state that don't see right from wrong
I never dreamed I would belong to your place

I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now
I need you now (In a place afar), need you now (In a place afar)
Say it loud, I need you now

Tied up in disgrace, how can we keep a man so long?
Waiting for a fate stripped to all our hearts
Never dreamed we would belong
In a world, a world that's just gone wrong

And if we try to stand alone
We'll be playing with a force beyond control
Our faces pressed against the glass
In the knowledge you belong to us
I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now
I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now
I need you now

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh3Embed
