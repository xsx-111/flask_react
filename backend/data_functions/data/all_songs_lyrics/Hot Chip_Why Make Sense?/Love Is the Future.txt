Love Is the Future Lyrics
Ah, uh-mm, ah
Ah, uh-mm, ah
Mm-mm-mm, ah

Baby, roll off the high end (Uh-mm, ah)
And let's get the guitar track right (Ah)
We don't know where this day ends (Uh-mm, ah)
But we know we've got tonight (Mm-mm-mm-mm)
You know I find a sadness (Uh-mm, ah)
In dark, in dark of night (Ah)
Alone and I'm wondering (Uh-mm, ah)
Wondering for something so right

When I am with you, we're only losing time
Drinking the hours, as I pour you and you sip from mine
When I am with you, what's real is out of mind
Dreaming is binding, stay close to me as we redefine

Connection, correction
Connection, correction
Correction, correction
Correction, correction
We've been staying up all night (Uh-mm, ah)
Been just deleting the days (Ah)
Something happens at midnight (Uh-mm, ah)
When the world is torn and frayed (Mm-mm-mm-mm)
I'm in love with the daylight (Uh-mm, ah)
But find it hard when rearranged (Ah)
Nothing's better than stage fright (Uh-mm, ah)
We turn heads as we turn on a phrase

I threw up my fist but she spiked my punch
So I couldn't fight all her moves, she turned the light off
She spoke the words and unravelled my pen
And parts of my body that had devil and sin
She took the stand for one night
So one might not believe the thoughts received
But remembering her thighs keep my eyes shut
I told her now, "You in my hut" (Yeah)
And I housed her by design
But she now owns real estate on my mind
Now, this all started from: "Yo, excuse me, Miss?"
And we broke all ethics, now Socrates is pissed
The wish of a well connects to my gut
And the preacher said, "The devil lives in a struggle"
I'm like, "She ain't got wings but bless her, mama"
My nerve's saying it feels like nirvana
When I'm with you, we're only losing time
Drinking the hours, as I pour you and you sip from mine
When I'm with you, my heart is on the line
Dreaming is binding, stay close to me as we redesign

My love
My love

(Connection) Our love is the future
I thought we would never see
Let's move to the future
Where you can connect with me
(Connection) Our love is the future
I thought we would never see
Let's move to the future
Your love has designs on me
(Correction) Our love is the future
I thought we would never see
Let's move to the future
You're moving inside of me1Embed
