White Wine and Fried Chicken Lyrics
Started in a timeless tradition, still marking time
The wildest ambitions were just false alarms
In this mindless condition, I started to smile
But in time I was wishing for nothing so wild

You gave me white wine and fried chicken, a new place to stay
Where my heart has permission to sing all the day
And your smile is resistant but starting to sway
Where the wild water's swimming and leading us astray

We dream ourselves into a new position and waste all the day
With our blues in remission, we'll keep them at bay
And in time's row permission, the clock fades away
I can hear its heart ticking with nothing to say

You gave me white wine and fried chicken, a new place to stay
Where my heart has permission to sing through the day
And your smile is resistant but starting to sway
Where the wild water's swimming and leading us astray

Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la la
Ah, la la, la la
Ah, la la, la la laEmbed
