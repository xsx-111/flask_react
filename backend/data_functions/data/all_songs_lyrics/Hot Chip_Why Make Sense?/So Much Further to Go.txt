So Much Further to Go Lyrics
There's so much further to go, and my mind was
Fixed on running everything
Too close to decipher a voice, so I ask her
"What would you have me say?"
The silence and answer, I hope not to hear her
Open my mouth, for love is thin

Like a miracle
A miracle that's hard to bear
Like a miracle
Whose song once filled the air

Without much further to go, my time was
Ripped from my body, unwarned
And the opening started, and that's when my heart just
Lifted this thing unborn
Restless and weary, but seeing so clearly
I wandered off to war

Like a miracle
A miracle that's hard to bear
Like a miracle
The silence just fills the airEmbed
