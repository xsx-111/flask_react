Huarache Lights Lyrics
When I see the beams of those Huarache Lights
I know every single thing will be just right
I know every single we play tonight
Will make the people just bathe in the light
Just bathe in the light, bathe in the light

So I can see
I got something here that you don't ever want to turn down
I got something for your mind, your body and your soul
Every day of my life, every day of my life

Machines are great, but best when they come to life
You can burn your finger on the pulse of the light
There's nothing to touch and there's nothing to hold
Am I so truthful? Or in truth, is the youth just getting old?

Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
So I can see
I got something for your mind, your body and your soul
Every day of my life, every day of my life
Every day of my life, every day of my life

Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better
Replace us with the things that do the job better3Embed
