Dark Night Lyrics
I'm calling for an angel to bring me (A dark night)
A dark night to bind me (A dark night)
In my daydreams (A dark night)
Darkness finds me (A dark night)
It takes me somewhere (A dark night)
I need to be (A dark night)
If you can't see me (A dark night)
At least you can feel me (A dark night)

Shutting down
Went to see you, now you're gone
Closer now
Have you been waiting here long?
Don't say a word
I don't think they'd understand

I'm calling for an angel to bring me
A dark night to bind me (A dark night)
In my daydreams
Darkness finds me (A dark night)
It takes me somewhere
I need to be (A dark night)
If you can't see me
At least you can feel me (A dark night)
A dark night, a dark night
A dark night, a dark night
A dark night, a dark night
A dark night, a dark night

Here in my daydream
Twilight finds me every time
Under the sun
I can't help feeling this is wrong
Don't say a word
I don't think they'd understand

I'm calling for an angel to bring me (A dark night)
A dark night to bind me (A dark night)
In my daydreams (A dark night)
Darkness finds me (A dark night)
It takes me somewhere (A dark night)
I need to be (A dark night)
If you can't see me (A dark night)
At least you can feel me (A dark night)

If I don't get to see you, at least I can feel you
If I don't get to see you, at least I can feel you
If I don't get to see you, at least I can feel you
If I don't get to see you, at least I can feel you
If I don't get to see you, at least I can feel you
If I don't get to see you, at least I can feel youEmbed
