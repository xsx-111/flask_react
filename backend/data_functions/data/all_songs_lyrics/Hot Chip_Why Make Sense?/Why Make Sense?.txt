Why Make Sense? Lyrics
Out of happiness can come a bitterness
Move the readiness into a headiness
With your last caress, started motionless
Like the sinner says, move your body-ness
And mine, mine, go high and high
It moves too slow before you know
Into happiness with a sweet caress
From the loving-ness with the somewhere blessed
What becomes us next, nothing we can't test
Nothing we can't trust if we can't caress

Why make sense when the world around refuses?
A winner lost is one who always chooses
Nothing left can leave you all out of time
And without it, you're nearing your decline
Why be tough when strength is just for losers?
Be what you are at the mercy of yours

It's the clouding of our minds, it's the morning of our lives
It's the mystery we find in the cursing of our time
It's the clouding of our minds, it's the morning of our lives
It's the mystery we find in the cursing of our time
It's the clouding of our minds, it's the morning of our lives
It's the mystery we find in the cursing of our time
Why make sense when the world around refuses?
A winner lost is one who always chooses
Nothing left can leave you all out of time
And without it, you're nearing your decline
Why be tough when strength is just for losers?
Be what you are at the mercy of yours3Embed
