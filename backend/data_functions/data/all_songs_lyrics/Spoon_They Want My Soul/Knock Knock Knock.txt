Knock Knock Knock Lyrics
All lines are read, the film is done
After Hours is on and now they'll make another one
If you miss the meaning this time
Well here comes another one

And if you clap your hands, the man will fall
Hold your breath, he'll shake himself to death
And the scenes get rearranged
And words unsaid

Every day, I hear "knock knock knock"
Oh and it's you
Oh every day, I hear "knock knock knock"
Then I see you and you're shaking
And you're breaking and you tell me I'm your only friend
And it starts all over again

You said you were living in a buttoned-up world
Living in 1892
There was nothing they could say to convince me
To blame nobody but you
We'll tell you some truth and you know it's gonna blow
But you don't give a damn, don't care who's gonna know
You just want everyone talk slow
And give you consent

Every time I hear "knock knock knock"
I know that it's you
Oh every day, I hear "knock knock knock"
And I see you and you're shaking
Oh you're breaking so I put down my poison pen
And it starts all over again

And it starts all over again
And it starts all over again
Sta-starts up to give
It's all over again3Embed
