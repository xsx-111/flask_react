Inside Out Lyrics
Time's gone inside out
Time gets distorted when
There's intense gravity
I don't got time for holy rollers
Though they may wash my feet
And I won't be their soldier

There's intense gravity in you
Yeah, there's intense gravity in you
I'm just your satellite
I'm just your satellite
Ooh, and I know that time's gone inside out
And now it's only like we told you
Mmm, though they may wash my feet
They do not make me complete


Break out of character for me
Time keeps on going when
We got nothing else to give
We got nothing else to give
Ooh, cause time's gone inside out
I don't make time for holy rollers
Mmm, there's only you I need
They do not make me complete
