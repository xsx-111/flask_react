Outlier Lyrics
You were smart, you played no part
You just thought, what you thought
And I remember when you walked out of Garden State
Cause you had taste, you had taste
You had no time to waste

Ohhh, what happened to you kid?
Yes Lord, what's happening now?
Mm na na-na-na (x12)

All alone, alone and lost
You never played us wrong or stayed too long

Ohhh, what happened to you kid?
Yes Lord, what's happening now?
Mm na na-na-na (x12)
Na-na, na-na, na-na (x5)2Embed
