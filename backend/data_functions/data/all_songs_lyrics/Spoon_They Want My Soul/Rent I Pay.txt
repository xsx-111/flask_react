Rent I Pay Lyrics
I've been losing sleep, just noddin'
Sleep that I wish that I'd known
And I lost all my tapes of back masking
Peace just for asking, peace that I ought to be owed

And that's the rent I pay
Just like my brother would say it

Out amongst the stars and the stones
Every kinda fortune gets old
Every kinda line is gonna come back to me just as I go

And that's the rent I pay (Yeah)
Like my brother say it
That's the rent I pay
Rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That's the rent I pay
Ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la

I've been losing sleep, and I'm nodding
Sleep that I wish that I'd known
And I lost all my tapes of back masking
Peace just for asking, peace that I ought to be owed
And that's the rent I pay
Like my brother say it
That's the rent I pay
Rent I pay
Like my brother say
That's the rent I pay

Everybody knows just where you been going
Everybody knows the faces you been showin'
And if that's your answer, no, I ain't your dancer
And if that's your answer, no, I ain't your dance1Embed
