Do You Lyrics
I was on 45th
I was half out of a bag (Oh yeah)
Yeah, I knew that you saw me
You laughed when I looked back
I thought I'd given up
Now I didn't feel so bad
And then a shock went through me
And then I walked right back (Uh)

Do you want to get understood? (Oh yeah)
Oh, do you want one thing or are you looking for sainthood?
Do you run when it's just getting good?
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you?

Someone get Popsicles
Someone do something 'bout this heat
'Cause it's late in October
And tar's still melting in the streets
You tiptoe for ages and lose yourself
Flipping back pages, unbuckling belts

Oh, love, that's the way love comes
Do you, don't you know that that's the way love comes?
Do you feel it black and blue?
Oh, do you, do you, do you, do you?11Embed
