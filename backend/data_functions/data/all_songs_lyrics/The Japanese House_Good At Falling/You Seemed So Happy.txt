You Seemed So Happy Lyrics
Sometimes I start believing in things that aren't real
And my friend likes to deceive me in the way that I feel but

All these things don’t happen to anybody like you
These things don’t matter to anybody but

Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you

Sometimes I start concealing
The way that I work in my head
Can't take it anymore
I won't stop feeling the weight of my world and

All these things don’t matter to anybody like you
These things don’t matter to anybody but

Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like-
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you
All these things don’t matter
All these things don’t matter
To anybody like

Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like-
Oh, you seemed so happy to everybody you knew
These things don’t happen to anybody like you4Embed
