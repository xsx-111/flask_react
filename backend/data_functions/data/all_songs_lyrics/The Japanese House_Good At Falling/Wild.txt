Wild Lyrics
I knew it was this that had to give
And I was having such a good time
You know me so well and you tell me all the time
And I was having such a good time

And all my friends like me and I shine brightly
And I take it lightly, and I shrug it off me
And I speak quietly, and they can't find me
Then I'm out behind me

Watching myself go wild
Watching myself go wild
(Watching myself go)
(Watching myself go)

You know I'm up to scratch and they give me that
Didn't mean to mean it, I'm an acrobat
A peace machine, such a diplomat
They all believe me, I'm such an act
And I've caught you lonely, you're a fool for that
Now it's all over and I'm so glad
I'm a silver child, a first class prize
I know you're blind, but I'm in disguise
I'm cut up glass, you look inside
Cut up the past and you're still mine
Don't want it back, leave me tired
I'm out behind me
Watching myself go wild
(Watching myself go)
(Watching myself go)5Embed
