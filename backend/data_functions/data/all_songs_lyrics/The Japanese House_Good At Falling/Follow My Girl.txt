Follow My Girl Lyrics
Different people have their different ways of living
I chose mine and it was unforgiving
Someone gave me guidance, there was something in it
I put it into practice and I tried to live it
I'm self-dividing and I have no limit
I can't fix it, it's not right
Nothing feels good, it's not right

Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)

I found a subsidence but I overlooked it
Someone gave me guidance and for once I took it
I put it in perspective and I see so clearly
I'm part of a collective, oh I nearly reached it
In the distance, caught the light
I can fix it, make it right

Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
Nothing feels good, I can't fix it, it’s not right
Right
Nothing feels good, I can't fix it, it’s not right
Right

Watching my world
Make funny faces at its own reflection
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)
So I'll follow my girl
'Til I find myself a sense of direction
(Nothing feels good, it's not right)4Embed
