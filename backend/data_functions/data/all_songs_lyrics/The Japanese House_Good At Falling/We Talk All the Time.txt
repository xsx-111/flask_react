We Talk All the Time Lyrics
Lying in bed
And you're circling 'round my head
Try to picture something different instead of this
Pretend I don't exist
A paradigm shift
I was never here at all

And they said that we'd get on
I didn't think it would take so long
Before you took me away from
Everything else, took me out of myself
I'm gone (Gone)

We don't touch anymore
But we talk all the time so it's fine
Can somebody tell me what I want?
'Cause I keep changing my mind
I can see a progression
And I guess it's happening
A different direction
And I guess it's happening

Shall we start again?
What do you want to do then?
Going over and over
Growing older and older
Let's think this through
What do you want to do?
And your chin's on my shoulder
And you're turning me over
We don't fuck anymore
But we talk all the time so it's fine
Can somebody tell me what I want?
'Cause I keep changing my mind
I can see a progression
And I guess it's happening
A different direction
And I guess it's happening

Somebody tell me what I want (Want)

We don't fuck anymore
But we talk all the time so it's fine
Can somebody tell me what I want?
'Cause I keep changing my mind
I can see a progression
And I guess it's happening
A different direction
And I guess it's happening5Embed
