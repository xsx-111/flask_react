Everybody Hates Me Lyrics
Up in my head
I'm the only one around

’Cause somehow
Everybody hates me now

The sky seems clear
But I can only see the clouds

'Cause somehow
Everybody hates me now

I've over-extended
Replaced all of my friends with
A linen sheet, a takeaway box
And an incomplete crossword block
With nothing left to show for it
She’s sleeping on the sofa
It's like she doesn't know that I exist
Everybody hates me now
Everybody hates me now
Everybody hates me now1Embed
