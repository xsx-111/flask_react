Lilo Lyrics
I needed someone to depend upon
I was alone, I was emotional
Searching for the right emoticon
To expand my mental lexicon

Then Gemma told me that she met someone
It was the person I'd been counting on
It felt good, it felt transitional
A feeling I'd been waiting on

You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave
And it's an easy ride

I saw myself an intellectual
I thought that I was capable
Every move was just habitual
And life was just a ritual
Then Gemma told me that she met somebody
Nobody else could take me from myself
I wasn't searching for it anymore
The feeling I'd been waiting for

You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave (I'm a patient wave)
And it's an easy ride

Floating like a lilo with you
Going where the tide goes
Floating like a lilo with you
Going where the tide goes
Floating like a–
Floating like a–
Floating like a–
Floating like a–

You were floating like a lilo
With your eyes closed, going where the tide goes
Caught in flux, you drifted 'til you hit the sides
Hold my breath another minute
I can keep my head, there's nothing in it
I'm a patient wave (I'm a patient wave)
And it's an easy ride10Embed
