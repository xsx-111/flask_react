Worms Lyrics
This doesn't sit right
And I feel unreal
She's my lullaby
And I can't sleep right

Only a day old, but I know what love is
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
I'm only a day old, haven't got to grips with it

I'm so much better
I don't have to be on my own
There's so much pressure not to be alone
You're sharing a house, you're sharing a life
You're sharing a home
There's so much pressure not to be alone

I'm only a day old, but I know what love is
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
I'm only a day old, haven't got to grips with it
I'm only a day old, but I know what love is
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
I'm only a day old, haven't got to grips with it

You keep repressing it
Invest yourself in something worth investing in
You keep repressing it
Only a day old, haven't got to grips with it5Embed
