Sister Havana LyricsCome around to my way of thinking
Don't you want to, want to get along?
Every day's just like a vacation with you
When I'm watching you and Fidel Castro in the sand, kissing
Girl you got to roll, Sister Havana
Overthrow, Sister Havana
She's coming on like a bicycle army
Everybody's waiting for the man to come down from the tower
Every day's just like a vacation with you layin' right here now
I'm watchin you and Fidel Castro in the sand, assassin
Girl you got to roll, Sister Havana
Overthrow, Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Sister Havana
Ooh, Sister Havana
(There's no time to lose)
I don't care what they say, no
(There's no time to lose)
We could have a holiday, yeah
(There's no time to lose)
But there's no time for hesitation
(There's no time to lose)
There's no time, no time for waitin'
(There's no time to lose)
There's no time
So let's take the time and get it on today
So girl, come on, you got to roll, Sister Havana
Overthrow, Sister Havana
Sister Havana (Sister Havana)
Sister Havana (Sister Havana)
Come around to my way of thinking
Come around to my way of thinking
Come around to my way of thinking
Well, come around sisterEmbed
