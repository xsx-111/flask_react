Erica Kane LyricsErica Kane another Emmy's passed you by
Erica Kane if joy was pain you had to cry
Erica if I was the man to dry your eyes
Erica Kane
Erica Kane
Erica Kane
See my life flash by just watching Erica
Seen the whole world through her eyes
Seems my whole life waits on hold for Erica
Men have given their life for Erica Kane
See my life flash by just watching Erica
Seen the whole world through her eyes
Seems my whole life waits on hold for Erica
Men have given their life for Erica Kane
(Send in the butcher)
She's got the rhythm down
She gets around if I'm not in town
She's got the rhythm down
She gets around if I'm not in town
She's got the rhythm down
She gets around when I'm not in town
Erica Kane let no one say your 2nd best
Erica Kane you'll find yourself in such a mess
But Erica, you'll step out when you put on that dress
Erica Kane
Erica Kane
Erica Kane
Erica Kane
