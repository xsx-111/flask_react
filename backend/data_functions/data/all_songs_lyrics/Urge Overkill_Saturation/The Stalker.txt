The Stalker LyricsThought you wanted, thought you wanted
I thought you wanted to save me
Now you got it, what you wanted
Now you're driving me crazy
You don't know me, never met me
But I know that you'll like me
Now I comin', now I'm comin'
I hope that you like me
Gonna come undone (got your address)
Got to keep me from (where you live)
Like a lost street bum (got your number)
They call me, they call me
Stalker
Thought you wanted, what you wanted
I thought you wanted to save me
What you wanted, now you got it
Now you drive me insane, yeah
You don't know me, never met me
But I know that you'll like me
Now I'm coming to your party
But you didn't invite me
Gonna come undone (got your address)
Off the T.V. from (where you live)
Like a lost street bum (got your number)
They call me, they call me
