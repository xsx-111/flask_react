Back on Me LyricsWhen I take you down
I don't wanna take you down
Don't ask why I never been there
'Cause I don't know, oh no
If I close my eyes, I don't wanna close my eyes
There are dreams of phantom doorways
There were dreams of you and me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Will you drag me down
Will you see just who I am
Don't have much and never will have
But I got dreams yeah, yeah
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on me
Turn your back on meEmbed
