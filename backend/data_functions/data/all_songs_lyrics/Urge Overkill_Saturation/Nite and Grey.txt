Nite and Grey Lyrics(I think you should know a few things. You were set up, all three of you, just like clay pigeons all the way down the line. Let us help you get them. Who was it. Who played Judas?)
1 2 3 4 1 2 3
Would you lie
Would you lie to me
Down in Memphis
Or New Orleans
Would you lie
Would you lie to me
'Cause I don't need you anymore
'Cause I got free
Nite and Gray
Night as Day
This is the last time
This is the last time
Nite and Gray
Night as Day
This is the last time
This is the last time
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Never been, Never bend a knee
I saw Jesus on the road
And I got freed
Never going down, going down to hell
'Cause I don't need it anymore, I'm already here
Nite and Gray
Night as Day
This is the last time
This is the last time
Nite and Gray
Night as Day
This is the last time
This is the last time
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Night as Day
This is the last time now now now
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Nite and Gray
Nite and GrayEmbed
