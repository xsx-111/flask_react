Woman 2 Woman LyricsAttitude!
Well I'll take my time gettin' over it
Girl blow my mind, there's no controllin' it
Didn't see that sign, it was an accident
Girl say goodbye cause don't empty hands don't want you no more
You're blowin' me smoke and I don't know why
But I'm curious
You give me the blink and now I know why
It's so obvious
You're down with the Charlie
You and I
I can't wait
My love is gonna get you straight

Don't listen to him
This ain't no rap
I know the college the girls say this
I know she's your friend, I saw you two
You know what I'm talkin' about
Do you know what?
My oh one, there's no other like a
Woman Woman
Why oh no
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
And I know you saw it, too
Attitude
You're just my kind, you're so mysterious
What's on your mind, you're so serious
Girl what's your sign, Vagittarius?
But that's not mine, now tell me you don't want me no more
You're blowin' me smoke and I don't know why
But I'm curious
You give me the blink and now I know why
It's so obvious
You're down with the Charlie
You and I
I can't wait
My love is gonna get you straight

Oh, if you could see your face
All them dudes down at Humboldt Park
Rex, Angel, they all said you was straight
I was asking about you at Humboldt Park
They all said you was straight
What was I supposed to tell them?
My oh one, there's no other like a
Woman Woman
Why oh no
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
My oh one, there's no other like a
Woman Woman
Why oh no
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
I got a Woman to Woman Woman
I got a Woman to Woman WomanEmbed
