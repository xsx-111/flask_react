Dropout LyricsWhat's the matter with you?
You've been down all day
What happened to you
To make you feel that way?
Baby ain't that a shame when they call you those names
Dropping out from school
Guess it wasn't so cool
Everyone, everyone needs, some space to breathe
All the time we have been blind, so blind
Yeah we just couldn't see it
Yeah you're too old to cry
Too young to die
What happens in the in-between?
Don't you think its strange, things just change
Its just a burnt out town a burnt out scene
You've been a dropout ever since you've been seventeen
Lonely child when will you see?
You need to be free
Often times people they find
They're not blind
Yeah, they just don't see
Lonely child listen to me
Its just a burnt out town
Its just a one horse scene
Gotta get away, gotta get away, you got to
Hanging out in the parking lot at Dairy Queen
You've been a dropout ever since you've been seventeen
Gotta get away, gotta get away, you got toEmbed
