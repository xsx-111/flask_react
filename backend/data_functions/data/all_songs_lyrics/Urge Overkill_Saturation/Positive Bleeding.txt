Positive Bleeding LyricsHey, look around today
Everything don't need to be the same
Feel, I'm feelin, lonely people
People just like me who go it alone
I guess I'm gonna go it alone
Now I live my life
Remote controllin' my destiny
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I can bleed when I want to bleed
So come on, come on
You can bleed when you want to bleed
Want to bleed
Bleeding
Bleeding
Hey, look around today
Everything don't need to be the same
Feel, feelin' lonely people
People just like me who go it alone
'Cause baby I'm a rolling stone
I live my life with no control in my destiny
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I can bleed when I want to bleed
So come on, come on
You can bleed when you want to bleed
Yeah yeah, come on
Everybody bleed when they want to bleed
Come on and bleed
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I can bleed when I want to bleed
Come on, come on
You can bleed when you want to bleed
Yeah yeah, come on
Everybody bleed when they want to bleed
'Cause I can bleed when I want to bleed
You can bleed when you want to bleedEmbed
