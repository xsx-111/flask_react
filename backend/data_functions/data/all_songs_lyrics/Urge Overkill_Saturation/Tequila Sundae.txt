Tequila Sundae LyricsGot no time for stimulation
Daylight runs and runs for hours
In a cold sweat under the black sun showers
Under the Silicon Valley sun
Flattery will get you nowhere
Oh my god I didn't wanna to hurt no one
In a false sleep in need of stimulation
I wish the zball was the sun
She was gone
Underneath the
Gone I believe her
A tequila sun
She was gone
Underneath the
Gone I believe her
I believe that woman
She was gone
Underneath the
Gone I believe her
A tequila sun
She dropped in the sun
With someone
With someone
Melt away!
Put yourself outside the future
Silicon sun rising above the ground
She was gone
Underneath the
Gone I believe her
A tequila sun
She was gone
Underneath the
Gone I believe her
I believe that woman
She was gone
Underneath the
Gone I believe her
A tequila sun
She dropped in the sun
With someone
With someone
She dropped in the sun
With someone
With someone
Don't melt away!
Got no time for stimulation
Let the cheeba be the sunEmbed
