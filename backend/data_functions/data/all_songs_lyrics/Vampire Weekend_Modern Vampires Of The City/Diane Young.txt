Diane Young Lyrics
You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters runnin' 'round the bend
When the government agents surround you again

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go it alone on your own for a bit

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Ooh, you let 'em go
Di-Di, Di-Di-Di-Di
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight

If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

Nobody knows what the future holds
And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time35Embed
