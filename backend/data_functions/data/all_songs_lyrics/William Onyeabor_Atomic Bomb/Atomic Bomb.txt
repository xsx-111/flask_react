Atomic Bomb LyricsI want to realize, man
The way I feel in me (how do you feel?)
I want to realize, women
The way I feel in me (how do you feel?)
I'm going to explode
(You mean you're gonna to explode?)
I'm going to explode, watch out
I'm going to explode
Like atomic bomb
Atomic bomb

I want to realize, oh man
The way I feel in me, how do you feel?
I want to realize women
The way I feel in me (how do you feel?)
I'm going to explode
(You mean you're going to explode?)
I'm going to explode
I'm going to explode
Like atomic bomb
Atomic bomb
