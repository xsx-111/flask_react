Colors LyricsMother Nature seems to love us so
When she smiles there is a subtle glow
And with tears of joy, the happiness flows
I see red and orange and purple
Yellow and blue and green
People say that life is misery
But in him there is no mystery
So he sends to us his rainbow of love
Red and orange and purple
Yellow and blue and green2Embed
