Hell Awaits Lyrics
Join us 
Welcome back


Existing on damnation's edge
The priest had never known
To witness such a violent show
Of power overthrown
Angels fighting aimlessly
Still dying by the sword
Our legions killing all in sight
To get the one called Lord

The gates of Hell lie waiting, as you see
There's no price to pay, just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Crucify your so-called "Lord"
He soon shall fall to me
Your souls are damned, your God has fell
To slave for me eternally
Hell awaits
The reaper guards the darkened gates
That Satan calls his home
Demons feed the furnace where
The dead are free to roam
Lonely children of the night
There's seven ways to go
Each leading to the burning hole
That Lucifer controls

Priests of Hades seek the sacred star
Satan sees the answer lies not far
Zombies, screaming souls, cry out to you
Satanic law prevails, your life is through

Pray to the moon, when it is round
Death with you shall then abound
For what you seek for can't be found
In sea or sky or underground


Now I have you deep inside
My everlasting grasp
The seven bloody gates of Hell
Is where you'll live your last
Warriors from Hell's domain
Will bring you to your death
The flames of Hades burning strong
Your soul shall never rest
The gates of Hell lie waiting, as you see
There's no price to pay, just follow me
I can take your lost soul from the grave
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved

Sacrifice the lives of all
I know they soon shall die
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell
And keep the fires growing deep inside
Hell awaits
