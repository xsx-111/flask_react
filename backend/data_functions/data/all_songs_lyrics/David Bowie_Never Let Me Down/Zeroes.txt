Zeroes Lyrics
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

You've arrived in the land of a thousand different names
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow is back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels

And me my little red Corvette has driven by
Fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainy day girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round
I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else

Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you, yeah

Hi, can I walk you home again today
Got to get forgive and forget hey, hey
Something good is happening and I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today
And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only because you're true
Someone out-timed my heart
Stopping and preaching and letting love in
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are

Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you, yes they were
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you, yeah
Tonight the Zeroes were singing for you

Doesn't matter what you try to do
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter what you try to do
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter where you try to go
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter who we really are
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Oh, It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Oh, It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It really doesn't matter
I do
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
It doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)Embed
