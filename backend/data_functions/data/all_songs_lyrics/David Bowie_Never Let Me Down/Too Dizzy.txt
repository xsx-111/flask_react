Too Dizzy Lyrics
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushing, pushing, pushing for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone

But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm going to blow away (ay)
What kind of love is he giving you
I'mma dizzy's
What I'm trying to say
(I said I'm) too dizzy
You can't have a lover
I'm too dizzy
It's me or no other
I'm a bad loser
I'm shaking in anger
I'mma too dizzy
You can't have no lover
You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itching, twitching, itching for a break
There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes

But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm going to blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
Imma dizzy's
What I'm trying to say
I said I'm too dizzy
You can't have a lover
I'm too dizzy
It's me or no other
(Oh) I'm a bad loser
I'm shaking in anger
I said I'm too dizzy
You can't have no lover
I said I'm too dizzy
Don't come any harder
I said I'm too dizzy
Don't come any closer
I said I'm too dizzy
(I said I'm) too dizzy
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
You can't have no lover (oh no)
Too dizzy
Too dizzy
I'm too dizzyEmbed
