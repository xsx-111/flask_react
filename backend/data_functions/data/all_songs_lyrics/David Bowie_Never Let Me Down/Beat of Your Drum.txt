Beat of Your Drum Lyrics
Photograph king, watches you go
Now, fashions may change, heaven knows
But you still leave a stain on me
Only to go
Colours may fade
Seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me
Wrong, negative fades, never the twain, reckless and tame

I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; can't beat it; I feel it)

Disco brat, follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all
This greedy intention
Only to go, picture you now
Music may change, hi-di-ho, keen to follow your nose
Wrong love out of tune
Sweet is the night
Bright light destroys me
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look through your things
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; I beat it; I beat it)

I'd like to beat on your drum (oh, yeah)
I'd like to beat on your drum (ah)
I like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum
(I'd beat it; I beat it; you beat it; I beat it)

Can't beat it
Can't beat it
I beat it
Ah yeah

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to yell it out loud
I'd like to beat on your drum
(Can't beat it; can't beat it; I beat it; I beat it)
Can't beat it
I beat it
Beat it out loud
Beat it out of the crowd
Beat it
Beat it
Beat it
Beat itEmbed
