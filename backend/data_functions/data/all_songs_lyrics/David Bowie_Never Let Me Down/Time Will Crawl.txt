Time Will Crawl Lyrics
Time will crawl

I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
'Til the twenty-first century lose
I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon, and he—
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot and he—
He made him fly through a hole
'Til he grew real old, and he—
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl
'Til our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
'Til our feet grow small
Time will crawl
'Til our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
I saw a black, black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm, warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl
Time will crawl
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
(Go!)

Time will crawl
Time will crawl

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep
Time will crawl
And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose

And our mouths run dry
Time will crawl
And our feet grow small
Time will crawl
And our tails fall off
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose

And our heads bowed down
Time will crawl
And our eyes fall out
Time will crawl
And the streets run red
Time will crawl
'Til the twenty-first century lose
Time will crawl
For the crazy child
Time will crawl
We'll give every life
'Til the twenty-first century lose
For the crackpot notion2Embed
