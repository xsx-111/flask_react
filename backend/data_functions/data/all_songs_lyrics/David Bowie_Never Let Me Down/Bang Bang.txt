Bang Bang Lyrics
Now, this isn't the right thing to do
So—
So, let's—
So, let's go

Young girls they know what they're after
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies

Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, reach for the sky

I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Because love is my bet and it's the best yet

Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, sun don't shine
Bang bang, you are angels
Bang bang, now, you all oughta' be in pictures

Oh girl
Oh girl
My problems can't follow me
Phone calls, I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely, ha-ha-ha, what does it mean

Bang bang, I got mine
Bang bang, and you are next in line

Bang bang, reach for the sky
Bang bang, sun don't shine

Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
(Well, uh,) young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye
Bang bang, then you closed, then you some closed, then you closed down
()
Bang bang, 
(Just come in first)

Bang bang
(If prayers had wings)
Bang bang
(And you were next in line)Embed
