Never Let Me Down Lyrics
When I believed in nothing
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint
In some place
I called her name
And though my days were slipping by
And nights so cruel
I thought I'd die

She danced her little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces
I screamed in pain
Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real
Swept over me

You danced a little dance 'til it made me cry
She was shaking like this honey doing that
Never let me down
She never let me down
Never let me down
She never let me down

When all your faith is failing, call my name
When you've got nothing coming, call my name
I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head
Until the bad stuff breaks

Dance my little dance 'til it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
