Naked Lyrics
Na√Øvety and childlike left behind
Deprived of the goodness of mankind
Past encounters have made her strong
Strong enough to carry on and on

Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down don't need to care
Lights are low exposed and bare

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
Naked

She knows exactly what to do with men like you
Inside out in her mind there's no doubt where you're coming from
The mystery will turn you on
Undress you with her eyes
Uncover the truth from the lies
Strip you down don't need to care
Lights are low exposed and bare

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
Naked

Hello, it's me
I, I thought you'd understand
Well maybe I should have kept my big mouth shut
I guess it ain't such a pretty picture
I'd rather be hated than pitied
Maybe I should have left it to your imagination
I just want to be me
This angel's dirty face is soft
Holding on to what she had before
Not sharing secrets with any old fool
Now she's gonna keep her cool
She wants to get naked
She wants to get naked

Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked
Naked
Nothing but a smile upon her face
Naked
She wants to play seek and hide, no one to hide behind
Naked
This child has fallen from grace
Naked
Don't be afraid to stare she's only naked1Embed
