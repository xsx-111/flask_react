Mama Lyrics
She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood (Mama)
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend

I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I've had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love
Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
You're my friend

But now I'm sure I know why (I know why)
Why you were misunderstood
So now I see through your eyes (See through your eyes)
All that you did was love (All I can give you is love)

Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
You're my friend

Me loving you, you loving me
A love that's true, and guaranteed
Me loving you (Me loving you)
You loving me (You loving me)
A love that's true (A love that's true)
And guaranteed (So true)
Me loving you (Me loving you)
You loving me (You loving me)
A love that's true (A love that's true)
And guaranteed (So true)
Me loving you (Me loving you)
You loving me (You loving me)
A love that's true (A love that's true)
And guaranteed (So true)
Me loving you (Me loving you)
You loving me (You loving me)
A love that's true (A love that's true)
And guaranteed (So true)
Me loving you (Me loving you)
You loving me (You loving me)
A love that's true (A love that's true)
And guaranteed (So true)1Embed
