Last Time Lover Lyrics
Treat me right, all night
Makes me feel good, like you should

Listen up, I gotta tell ya
About the ins and outs and goings-on
I wouldn't tell just anybody
About the fox that I've been chasing
He's resistant, I'm persistent
He didn't stop me from honing in
'Cause I'm a choosy not a floozy
I get my hit and then I run with it

Last time lover (Lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?

We got up and down to it (Oh yeah)
Like the dirty bass in the music (Uh)
I got my major chords strumming
Took some time and then we're really buzzing
First bite whet my appetite (Mmm)
Second helping's always better (Ah)
Started gettin' burning hot
I found my pride not easy
Slowed it down, I said stop
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?

Last time lover (Treat me right)
Lovin' undercover (All night)
Last time lover (Makes me feel good)
Lovin' undercover (Like you should)
Last time lover
Last time lover (Treat me right)
Lovin' undercover (All night)

Cool, sexy, ever ready
Someone fine, always steady
Gentle hands, dirty mind
Use your head and don't be blind
Words of love, they don't wash with me
What's the hard rush? No urgency you see
Crazy boy, potential lover
First and last lover, brother, ain't no other
Crazy, sweetie, cool but racy
Steady, ready, go, yes
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?

Last time lover (Treat me right)
Lovin' undercover (All night)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Last time lover (Makes me feel good)
Lovin' undercover (Like you should)
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?
Last time lover (Treat me right)
Lovin' undercover (All night)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me1Embed
