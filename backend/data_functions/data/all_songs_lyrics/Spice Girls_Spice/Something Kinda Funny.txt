Something Kinda Funny Lyrics
Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah

We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we got it, yeah hey)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on

Wherever you're going, high or low
Remember to sure enjoy the show
So climb aboard my journey deep inside
Better late than dead on time

Ooh, it's you I know that I have got to feed, yeah, yeah
Ooh, don't take from me more than you really need
More than you really need

We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we got it)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we got it, oh)

Happiness is just a state of your mind
Keep searching, who knows what you may find
Rules are for fools, and fool's paradise is hard to find
Play my game or get left behind
Ooh, it's you I know that I have got to feed, yeah, yeah
Ooh, take from me what you feel that you need
You feel that you need

We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we got it)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we got it, oh)

You've got it, you've got it, hey-yay-yay, hey-yay-yay
You've got it, you've got it, hey-yay-yay-yay-hey
You've got it, you've got it, hey-yay-yay, eh eh, hey-yay-yay, hey-yay-yay, eh eh eh eh (oh)

Feelin' kinda funny (hey)
Feelin' kinda queasy (hey-yay-yay, hey-yay-yay)
I ain't that easy (eh eh eh eh)

We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we got it, we got it, oh) (something kinda funny)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (hoo yeah, ooh yeah) (we got it, we got it, oh)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (something kinda funny) (we got it, we got it)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (ooh, ooh yeah) (we got it, we got it) (there's something kinda funny)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (we got it, we got it, oh) (there's something kinda funny) (we got it goin' on)
We've got something kinda funny goin' on (hoo yeah, ooh yeah) (I got it, you got it, oh, we got it goin' on)1Embed
