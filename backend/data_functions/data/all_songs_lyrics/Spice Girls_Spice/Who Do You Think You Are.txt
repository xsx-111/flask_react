Who Do You Think You Are Lyrics
The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good, as long as you're getting
What's driving you is ambition I'm betting

(I said-a) Who do you think you are?
(Do you think you are?) oh, oh, oh
(I said-a) Who, some kind of superstar?
(You have got to) oh, oh, oh

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show how good you are

You're swelling out in the wrong direction
You've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
Climbing the snake up the ladder, but you're wrong

(I said-a) Who do you think you are?
(Do you think you are?) oh, oh, oh
(I said-a) Who, some kind of superstar?
(You have got to) oh, oh, oh
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are

You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up, never lose control

(I said-a) Who do you think you are?
(Do you think you are?) oh, oh, oh
(I said-a) Who, some kind of superstar?
(You have got to) oh, oh, oh

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are

Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
(Swing it, shake it, move it, make it)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
(Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it)
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
(Swing it, shake it, move it, make it)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
(Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it)
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
(Swing it, shake it, move it, make it)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
(Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it)
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
(Swing it, shake it, move it, make it)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
(Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it)
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
(Swing it, shake it, move it, make it)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
(Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it)
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
(Swing it, shake it, move it, make it)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
(Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it)1Embed
