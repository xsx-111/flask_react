Rootie Tootie LyricsMet my future wife today
And her name is Kathy Mae
Rootie Tootie, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Sunday gal
Feelin' dandy, doin' swell
My gal is the village belle
Hotsy-totsy (Rootie Tootie)
Super-duper (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Monday gal
You should see the people stare
When we walk around the square
Bouncy-bouncy, (Rootie Tootie)
Upsy-daisy, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Tuesday gal
I'm not jealous, no siree
Just as long as she's with me
Wicky-wacky, (Rootie Tootie)
Humpty-dumpty, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Wednesday gal
She's got "purty" eyes of blue
And she thinks I'm "purty", too
Tootsie-wootsie, (Rootie Tootie)
Hunky-dory, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Thursday gal
Gonna make that lady mine
When she signs that dotted line
Hinky-dinky, (Rootie Tootie)
Yipsy-doodle, (Rootie Tootie)
Rootie Tootie, she's my Friday gal1Embed
