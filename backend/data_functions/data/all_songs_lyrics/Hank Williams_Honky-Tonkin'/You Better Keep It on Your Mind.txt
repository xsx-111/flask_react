You Better Keep It on Your Mind LyricsNow if you go out and start a playing around
Your baby's gonna tear your playhouse down
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You'll be moanin' and a groanin'
Lord you better keep it on your mind
Now wrong is wrong and right is right
If you make a snake mad he's sure gonna bite
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
I've had it proven to me
Lord you better keep it on your mind
Every fuss with a woman has got the same ole end
I don't believe the good Lord meant for a man to win
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You'll be singing blue and lonesome
Lord you better keep it on your mind
If you make your baby mad and she says goodbye
There ain't a thing you can do but sit at home and cry
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better call her sweet mama
Lord you better keep it on your mind
If the judge says pay her forty dollars a week
You'll dig up the money or you'll work the streets
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
When you're wearing striped britches
Son it's gonna stay on your mind
So kiss her every mornin' and love her every night
Boy you can't win no matter if you're right
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better keep it on your mind (all the time)
You better heed this warning
Lord you better keep it on your mindEmbed
