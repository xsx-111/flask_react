I Remember Nothing Lyrics
We were strangers
We were strangers
For way too long
For way too long
We were strangers (Violent)
For way too long (Violent)
We're strangers

Get weak all the time
May just pass the time
Me in my own world
Yeah, you there beside
The gaps are enormous
We stare from each side
We were strangers
For way too long

Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair
Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair
Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon
Me in my own world
The one that you knew (For way too long)
(We were strangers) We were strangers
(For way too long)
We were strangers
For way too long
For way too long5Embed
