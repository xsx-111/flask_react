Wasting My Hate Lyrics
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself
Ain't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?
Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself, hey!

Ain't gonna waste my hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
Better to give than to receive
Ain't gonna waste my hate, no, no
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you
Yeah, I think I'm going to keep it all for myself
For myself

Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself, yeah!
