2 X 4 Lyrics
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I'm going to make you, shake you, take you
I'm going to be the one who breaks you
Put the screws into you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on, come on, come and make my day
Make my day

Yeah, got some hell to pay you, I steal your thunder
The joy of violent movement pulls you under
Ooh, bite the bullet, well, hard
Yeah but I bite harder, so go too far, too far

(Friction, fusion, retribution)
(Friction, fusion)
I can't hear you, talk to me
(Retribution)
I can't hear you, so, talk to me
(Friction, fusion)
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
(Retribution)
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
Can't hear you, time to meet my Lord
I can't hear you, talk to 2 X 4, hey
Yeah, I'm going to make you, shake you, take you
I'm going to be the one who breaks you
Put the screws into you, yeah, my way
Yeah, come on, come on, come and make my day
Make my day

(Friction, fusion, retribution)
(Friction, fusion)
I can't hear you, talk to me
(Retribution)
I can't hear you, so, talk to me
(Friction, fusion)
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
(Retribution)
Oh, I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
Can't hear you, time to meet my Lord
I can't hear you, talk to 2 X 4, hey

Talk to two by four
It don't take no more

(Friction, fusion, retribution)
(Friction, fusion)
I can't hear you, talk to me
(Retribution)
I can't hear you, so, talk to me
(Friction, fusion)
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
(Retribution)
I can't hear you, are you talking to me?
Can't hear you, time to meet my Lord
I can't hear you, talk to 2 X 4, hey3Embed
