Bleeding Me Lyrics
I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better
I'm pushing to stay, yes
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better

Woah, woah oh, yeah
Woah oh oh, yeah, oh yeah

I'm sowing the seeds, yes
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted
This thorn in my side
Yes, this thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

Oh, it tears me and I bleed, yeah
And I bleed, oh yeah, oh yeah

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, whoa
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll, whoa
The bleeding of me, yeah
Yes, of me
The bleeding of me

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, woah-oh
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll, oh
The bleeding of me
Woah, oh
The bleeding of me

I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
I can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, oh
I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it
Oh, the bleeding of me, yeah
I'm bleeding me, yeah

I'm digging my way, yeah
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better, yeah
I'm pushing to stay, hey
Yes, I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better, yeah

With something better4Embed
