Book of Dreams Lyrics
I'm standing in the backyard listening to the party inside
Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness this life provides
The scars we carry remain, but the pain slips away, it seems
Oh won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams?

I'm watching you through the window with your girlfriends from back home
You're showing off your dress, there's laughter and a toast
From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen
Oh won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams?

In the darkness, my fingers slip across your skin, I feel your sweet reply
The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high just holding you to me
As through the window, the moonlight streams
Oh won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams?

Now the ritual begins, 'neath the wedding garland, we meet as strangers
The dance floor is alive with beauty, mystery, and danger
We dance out 'neath the stars, ancient light into the darkening trees
Oh won't you, baby, be in my book of dreams?Embed
