The Fox in the Snow LyricsFox in the snow, where do you go
To find something you could eat?
Because the word out on the street is you are starving
Don't let yourself grow hungry now
Don't let yourself grow cold
Fox in the snow
Girl in the snow, where do you go
To find someone who will do?
To tell someone all the truth
Before it kills you
And listen to your crazy laugh
Before you hang a right
And disappear from sight
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book
What do they know anyway?
You'll read it in a book tonight
Boy on the bike, what are you like
As you cycle round the town?
You're going up, you're going down
You're going nowhere
It's not as if they're paying you
It's not as if it's fun
At least not anymore
When your legs are black and blue
It's time to take a break
When your legs are black and blue
Time to take a holiday
Kid in the snow, way to go
It only happens once a year
It only happens once a lifetime
Make the most of it
Second just to being born
Second to dying too
What else would you do?
What else would you do?
What else would you do?
What else would you do?
Fox in the snow
(When your legs are black and blue)
Fox in the snow
(It's not as if they're paying you)
Fox in the snow
(When your legs are black and blue)
Fox in the snow
(It's not as if they're paying you)
Fox in the snow
