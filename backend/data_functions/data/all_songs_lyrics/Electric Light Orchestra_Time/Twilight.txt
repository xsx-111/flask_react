Twilight Lyrics
The visions dancing in my mind
The early dawn, the shades of time
Twilight crawling through my windowpane
Am I awake or do I dream
The strangest pictures I have seen?
Night is day, and twilight's gone away

With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me
From the open skies
(It's either real or it's a dream)
(There's nothing that is in between)

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile
Twilight, I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me

Across the night, I saw your face
You disappeared without a trace
You brought me here
But can you take me back?
In sight, the image of your light
That now is day and once was night
You lead me here, and then you go away
(It's either real or it's a dream)
(There's nothing that is in between)

(Twilight, twilight)
(Twilight) I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me

You brought me here
But can you take me back again?

With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me
From the open skies
(It's either real or it's a dream)
(There's nothing that is in between)

Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile
Twilight, I gave you time
To steal my mind
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile

Twilight (Twilight)
