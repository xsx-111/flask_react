Here Is the News Lyrics
Here is the news
Coming to you every hour upon the hour
Here is the news
The weather's fine
But there may be a meteor shower

For good old rocket lag

Someone left their life behind
In a plastic bag

I want my baby back

I wanna go back!
Here is the news
Somebody has broken out
Of Satellite Two

Look very carefully
It may be you
