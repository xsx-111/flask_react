The Bouncer LyricsFour!


Do you remember, you said to me, that you would wait, wait for me eternally?
I've been wondering and I've been hoping you're still the same, only you can say
I'll be so glad to be back with you, I'll do anything you want me to

That's what I want (What I want)
I'll be so happy (Happy)
Back home


I see the light shine in my window, and I know I am coming home
And as the light grows, grows ever brighter, I see your face, you're all alone
And when I tell you all things I've seen, you'll say, "Darling, you must have been dreaming."

That's what I want (What I want)
I'll be so happy (Happy)
Back home
Electric visions may cross
Strange decisions of course
I felt the stars above me
I have someone to love me

That's what I want
I'll be so happy back home

Believe me baby, when I say, "I wish I'd never, never, never, never been away."
For the things that I see they are meant for the eyes of a time
And when we walk alone together, that's how I want it to be, want it to be forever

That's what I want (What I want) I'll be so happy (Happy)
That's what I want (What I want) I'll be so happy (Happy)
Back home
