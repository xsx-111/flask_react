Epilogue Lyrics
You should be so happy
You should be so glad
21st century man

Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow
You still wander the fields of your sorrow

Then he arrives on this day of all days
May the world still remember him

Time (Time), time
Time (Time), time
Time (Time), time
Time (Time), time...Embed
