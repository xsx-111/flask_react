From the End of the World Lyrics
Oh you, you're so hard to get to
Oh you, you don't wanna play

You were no better before
I sent a letter before
I sent a dream to you last night
From the end of the world

Oh you, you keep me hangin'
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Oh you, look at the trouble I've found

You were no better before (Whoa, whoa)
I sent a letter before (Yeah, yeah)
I sent a dream to you last night
From the end of the world

I saw you last night, but you couldn't answer
You were a lonely little sidewalk dancer
When I woke up, I could not stand it
You were gone, but I got to hand it to you
(Whoa, whoa)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Dream to you last night)
(From the end of the world)

Oh please, if this is a game
I wish someone would win
Please, just let it fly
To me upon the wind

You were no better before (Whoa, whoa)
I sent a letter before (Yeah, yeah)
I sent a dream to you, baby, last night
From the end of the world

You were no better before
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I sent a letter before
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I sent a dream to you, baby, last night
From the end of the world
I sent a dream to you, baby, last night
From then end of the world
I sent a dream to you, baby
(Dream to you, baby, last night)
From the end of the world

I sent a dream to you, baby
From the end of the world1Embed
