When Time Stood Still LyricsFar beyond the things you see
Our time rolls on eternally
Got a thing about it
Just can't live without it
Sitting there inside your mind
Just waiting for the clock to chime
In a lonely land
Stood a lonely man
No pictures on an empty wall
Nobody there, no one at all
Just echoes in the ivory halls
When time stood still
Days lined up outside the door
For time had stopped; there was no more
In a lonely world
Such a lonely world
No pictures on an empty wall
No Toulouse, Vincent or Pablo
Just echoes in the ivory halls
When time stood still
No big machine or April showers
No submarines, no plastic flowers
Just echoes in the ivory towers
When time stood still
When time stood still
When time stood still
When time stood still2Embed
