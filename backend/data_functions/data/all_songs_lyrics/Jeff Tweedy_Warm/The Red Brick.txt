The Red Brick Lyrics
My lonely said to me
When love won't show
It's a cold case you're never going to close

Oh, I could never let it go
Oh, I could never let it go

So I drank myself
Back into your life
And I cried on the yellow telephone

Oh, I could never let it go
Oh, I could never let it go

Then I aimed my scope
Out a broken window
Oh, I could feel you in my bones

Oh, I could never let it go
Oh, I could never let you goEmbed
