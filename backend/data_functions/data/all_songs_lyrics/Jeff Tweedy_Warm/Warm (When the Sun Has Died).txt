Warm (When the Sun Has Died) Lyrics
Please take my advice
Worry into your song
Grow away from your anger
Distance belongs

I don't believe in Heaven
I keep some heat inside
Like a red brick in the summer
Warm when the sun has died

I donâ€™t believe in Heaven
I keep some heat inside
Like a red brick in the summer
Warm when the sun has diedEmbed
