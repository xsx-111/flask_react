Some Birds Lyrics
Some birds just sit useless, like fists
I wrestle on TV but no one ever lets me win
I lean on the wall like a broom
Confused by the scope of it all
Any fool can tell the truth

And no, I don't think I should
Add one to the sum
Of all that you fear

I’d love to take you down
And leave you there

In my window, I have a twin
I look out, he looks in
He has a point, I applaud
My goodness, my God
Is it my fault the countrysides
Are so full of suicide?
I break bricks with my heart
Only a fool would call it art
And no, I don't think that I should
Be one of the sum
Of all that you fear

I'd love to take you down
And leave you there
I’d love to take you down
And leave you there

So why fuss, why not bend
Like a nail, hammered in?
Oh, times are tough
If I recall, oh, it ain't easy
No, not at all

And no, I don't think I should
Complete the sum
Of all that you fear

I'd love to take you down
And leave you there
I'd love to take you down
Down and leave you there1Embed
