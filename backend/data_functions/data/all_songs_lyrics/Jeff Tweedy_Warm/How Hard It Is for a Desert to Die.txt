How Hard It Is for a Desert to Die Lyrics
I hear your laugh in my laughter
An old photograph that I've never seen
Where each set of eyes finds a different camera
Shining like the sun on the rain

I follow the wires to the horizon
There's zero chance that I'm gonna cry
I think that fame is a misunderstanding
How hard is it for a desert to die?Embed
