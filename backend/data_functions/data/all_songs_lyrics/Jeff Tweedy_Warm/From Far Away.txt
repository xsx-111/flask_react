From Far Away Lyrics
From outer space
I am you
At distances
You're me too
From far away
I assume
Everything
Needs less room

My ribs are turned
Like parentheses
And my lips have learned
What I donâ€™t believe
Could I find a world just right?
Or will I always look too high?

If I die
Don't bury me
Rattle me down
Like an old machine
Take my books
And my magazines
My photographs
Of you and me
Everything
I won't needEmbed
