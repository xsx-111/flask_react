Bombs Above Lyrics
All my life I've played a part
In the bombs above the ones you love
I'm taking a moment to apologize
I should have done more to stop the war
So I'm sorry

I leave behind a trail of songs
From the darkest gloom to the brightest sun
I've lost my way but it's hard to say
What I've been through should matter to you

A man so drunk he could hardly stand
Told me once holding my hand
Suffering is the same for everyone
He was right but I was wrong to agree

Hah
Hah
