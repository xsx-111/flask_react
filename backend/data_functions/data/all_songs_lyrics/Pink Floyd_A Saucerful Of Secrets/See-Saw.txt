See-Saw Lyrics
Marigolds are very much in love
But he doesn’t mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the see-saw land
All the way
She smiles

She goes up while he goes down, down

Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister’s throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn’t know so then

She goes up while he goes down, down

Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother’s way to leave (Ahhh-ah)
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
She’ll be selling plastic flowers
On a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds, she hasn’t got the time to care
All can see
He’s not there

She grows up for another man, and he’s down

Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother’s way to leave (Ahhh-ah)
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day
Another time (Ah-ah)
Another day (Ah-ah)
A brother’s way to leave (Ahhh-ah)
(Ahhh-ah, ahhh-ah)4Embed
