Peace Signs Lyrics
I woke up, I was already me
I was somewhat afraid, I was something
Peace signs
I told you I could no longer see
I was right in the fire, I was on my knees
Peace signs

Take it back, I felt no longer used
I had nothing to do, I was so you
Peace sign, I was already you
Peace sign, I was already you
Peace sign, I was already you

No lie, I was no longer wrong
I had questions in mind why you were strong
Hit back, it was already too
Hit back, it was already soon
Hit back, it was already too
Oh, you

I still dream that I think of you
In the calm of the night and I don't know what to do
Peace signs
When I wake up, I am already me
And I am not afraid, I am something
Peace signs
Peace signs
Peace signs
