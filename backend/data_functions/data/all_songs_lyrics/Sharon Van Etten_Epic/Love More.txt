Love More LyricsChained
To the wall of our room
Yeah, you chained me like a dog in our room
I thought that's how it was
I thought that we were fine
Then the day was night
You were high, you were high when I was doomed
And dying for...
With no life, with no light
Tied to my bed
I was younger then
I had nothing to spend but time on you
But it made me love, it made me love, it made me love more
It made me love, it made me love, it made me love more
Do what you said
The words she said left out
Over into the sky where I'll soon fly
And she took the time to believe in, to believe in what she said
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love more
She made me love, she made me love, she made me love moreEmbed
