One Day Lyrics
Sister don't mind that I'm not on time
She knows that I'm through with that
Sick of trying, don't let mind
Momma still love and daddy still love
They know that I'm here like that
Unlike mine, true and kind

Call me your sigh and I will now be
And I will be fine with that
You don't leave me now, you might love me back
Distance is fine, I know you can't care
And nothing is big like that
You don't see me now, I don't see you back

Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now, do you love me back?

Just to remind you, I'm a mistake
How come you don't want to know?
You don't wanna see, you don't wanna show
Kicking myself, I know that you're tough
Yeah, we can pretend we're that
Gotta see how you gotta leave that
Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now, do you love me back?

Snow is outside, but I'm by your fire
I feel all the love you bring
You gotta see how we can see this out
Summer in mind and spring by your side
We'll see all the love we'll keep
Gotta see that we can't be that

Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
Oh, one day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now, do you love me back?
You don't leave me now, do you love me back?
You don't leave me now, do you love me back?
You don't leave me now, do you love me back?4Embed
