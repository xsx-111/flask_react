DsharpG Lyrics
Everyone thinks I'm a liar
Wading on the edge of fire with you
In the hour of questions I wonder, who?
Who?
Why do they want? Who are we all?
What do we do? What do we do?

Everyone says I'm a fool to believe in that
Everyone says I'm a fool to believe in that
Following blind, following blind
Following who?
Who?
Why do they mind? Why do they mind?
What do they do? What do they do?

Everyone says you're a fool to believe in that
Everyone says you're a fool to believe in that
Covering eyes, covering eyes
Covering who?
Who?
Following blind, covering eyes
What do they do? What do they do?
So what if we care we're all fools who believe in that?
So what if we care we're all fools who believe in that?
Believing truth, believing truth
Believing who?
Who?
Following blind, following blind
What if I do? What if I do?
What if I do? What if I do?
What if I do? What if I do?
What if I do? What if I do?Embed
