Save Yourself Lyrics
I want every town, I need you to know
There's nothing left to sell me, I'm broke
I just want these holes for when I try to run
For no reason, or so I'm told

Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ancient in one long, incidental month
You had a bad day, I want home
You still make me smile, as much as I am reeling
It has been a while, please don't make me show
I'm not your gal

Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Just like everyone else
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Try and make me feel like I'm your number one
Every other one, well, shit, get real
Know you're balding still, you're older than you feel
Think a little harder, a little modest and humble be
I won't wait around
Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Just like everyone else
You're just like everyone else
You're just like everyone else
You're just like everyone elseEmbed
