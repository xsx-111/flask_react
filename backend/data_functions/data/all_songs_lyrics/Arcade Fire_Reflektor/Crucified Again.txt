Crucified Again LyricsOn the 12th of January
You don't need what you can't carry
Blood will flow into the ocean
Our voices break with the emotion

Crucified, been crucified again
In the night, they started singing
They had no right to keep believing
Down below, there's someone screaming
A broken church, no bells are ringing
Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
Preachers talk on televisions
Hand out the judgements of their religion
When I heard those women singing
They made a sound I could believe in

And again, and again
He who strikes the blow forgets it
But he who bears the scar remembers
The fire is burning down to embers
The fire is burning but I can't remember
Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified, been crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again
All you great and mighty nations
Who think you've paid for your high stations
Their cities may be built in the sand
But ours were built by their fathers hands

Crucified again, and again
And again, until the crowd cry, "do it again!"1Embed
