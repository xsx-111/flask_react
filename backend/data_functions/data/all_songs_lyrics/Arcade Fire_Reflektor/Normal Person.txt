Normal Person Lyrics
Those monitors are a little bit hot
Uh, sorry about that
Thank you guys so much for coming out, yeah
Oh man
Do you like Rock and Roll music?
‘Cause I don’t know if I do

Is anything as strange as a normal person?
Is anyone as cruel as a normal person?
Waiting after school for you
They want to know if you
If you're normal too
Well, are you?
Are you?
I'm so confused
Am I a normal person? You know
I can't tell if I'm a normal person, it's true
I think I'm cool enough
But am I cruel enough?
Am I cruel enough
For you?

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
They take their tea at two
All the normal people, they do
They burn the jungle down
While they were sleeping, it grew
You dream in English now
In proper English, look how
You're just the same as me
It's through

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everyone is normal now
I know
If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now
Mama don't make me go

When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it...No!
And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now
Mama don't make me go

Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together
You can change us, just where should you start?
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
Like you
How do you do?
How do you do?11Embed
