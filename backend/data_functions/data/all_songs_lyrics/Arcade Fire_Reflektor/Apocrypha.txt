Apocrypha Lyrics
You officers that are stationed in front of the stage behind the barricade: You will go to Mr. Maury Shapiro, the first aid man, and he will furnish you with earplugs. So as to keep you from having a headache. If he runs out of earplugs, he has got some cotton. We will not allow any dancing, running up and down the aisle. Is that clear with everybody?
'Cause I don't wanna be born, born again
But not right now, cause don't take me
Yeah, but God said "Son, it's time to go
And when you'll return, I don't know just yet."
But even stars, they die, when they get old
The precious ones that we used to know
So if you gon' shoot better hit your mark
Send that arrow, send it through my heart
My heart
He said "This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away."
She said "But Joan of Arc, a walk in the dark"
She said "I've seen how the world ends
First they love you, then they kill you
Then they love you again, and again. Again."
She said
"This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away."
She said
"This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away
This time I won't get turned away."
Jesus Christ, what did you do...
To deserve what they done to you?
Jesus Christ, what did you do...
To deserve what they done to you?
Downtown, see what we got
We got the riot
Oh, come on downtown, see what we got
We got the riot
We know something ain't right
We know something ain't right
I said, "Come on downtown, see what we got
We got the riot
We got a riot."

Hahaha... ha ha... Arcade Fire ladies and gentlemen!
