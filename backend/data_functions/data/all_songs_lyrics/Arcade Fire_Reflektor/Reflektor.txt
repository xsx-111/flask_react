Reflektor Lyrics

Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Cause you're my home

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
All right, let's go back
Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
Just a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
It’s a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor
Just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
It’s just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side
We all got things to hide
It’s just a Reflektor
But I see you on the other side62Embed
