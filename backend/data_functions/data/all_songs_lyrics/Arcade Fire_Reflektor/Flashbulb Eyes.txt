Flashbulb Eyes Lyrics
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no

Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
You know I've got nothing to hide
You know I got nothing
You know I got nothing

What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes
You know I've got nothing to hide
You know I got nothing
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes
You know I've got nothing to hide
You know I got nothing
You know I got nothing3Embed
