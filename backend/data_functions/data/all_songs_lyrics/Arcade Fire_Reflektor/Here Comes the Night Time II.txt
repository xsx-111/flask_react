Here Comes the Night Time II Lyrics
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

You hurt yourself again
Along with all your friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again
Here comes the night time
Coming on slow
Here comes the night time
I know that you know
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night1Embed
