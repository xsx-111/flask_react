Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice) LyricsYou and I were born in a little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
Oh no, oh
You came home from school and knew you had to run
Please stop running now, just let me be the one for you
But I know you can see things that we can't see
But when I say I love you, your silence covers me
Oh, Eurydice, It's an awful sound
I was so disappointed, you didn't want me
Oh, how could it be, Eurydice?
I was standing beside you by a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?
Just take all your pain, just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away, will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound

I know there's a way we can make 'em pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again."
I know there's a way we can leave today
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again."
You were born in the little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
There's so much inside you that you won't let me see
You fly away from me but it's an awful sound
When you hit the ground, it's an awful sound
When you hit the ground

I know there's a way we can make 'em pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again."
I know there's a way we can leave today
Think it over...
We know there's a price to pay
For love in the reflective age
I met you up upon a stage
Our love in a reflective age
Oh no, now you're gone12Embed
