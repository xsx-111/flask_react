Get Right Lyrics
Betta get right, before you die
Betta get right
Betta get right, before you die
Betta get right
Betta get right, before you die
Betta get right
Betta get right, before you die
Betta get right

Cause you can't take me down with you
Where you're going to
No you can't take me down with you
What you gonna do?
If I ever (ever) get stronger than
You could ever
Yeah forever (ever) get stronger than
You could ever
Huh, give me a chance

Betta get right
Betta get rightEmbed
