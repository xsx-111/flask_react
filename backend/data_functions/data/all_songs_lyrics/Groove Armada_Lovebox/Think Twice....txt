Think Twice... LyricsClose your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three
Close your eyes, rewind, I know just what you're thinking
Close your eyes and think of me
Larger than life, niceties, bigger than you, more than me
I've got the Monday morning blues
And, oh my God, I've got the home for you
And give the everyday morning you use
There's things right here I can't afford to choose
Close your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three
Close your eyes, rewind, I know just what you're thinking
Close your eyes and think of me
Sincere, caramel, champagne, down drain, tell him, no gain
It's so damn physical it will sustain
And too damn Technicolor to refrain
And much too taxing for my little brain
Why do we never know enough of happy ends?
Why do they never show?
All the times that we have been so good at caring
How many times we'll never know
Close your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three
Close your eyes, rewind, I know that you've been thinking
Close your eyes and think of me
Close your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three
Close your eyes, rewind, I know just what you're thinking
Close your eyes and think of me
Packed it like a punch, out to lunch
I got a little hunch that stood out from the bunch
As if that's not enough, I even knew the reason why
That God damn bitch of life, she made me cry
So I'd like to poke her squarely in the eye
And it hurt so much I feel like I could die, yeah1Embed
