Groove Is On LyricsCheck it out, yeah, ah, 'cause life is slow
When the groove is on, yeah, right here
Moving nice and slow now, yeah-yeah-yeah
Moving closer to me, close to me now, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, as if the groove is on, I'm a-spit my flow
Tripping lights fantastic, disco show
Get the mofo back in the bliss patrol
And not worry about friends or foe, oh
I just pop the X, maybe have lots of sex
I'm the next flight to a spot that's left
Saturated so (?) don't need to stop the press
Go back and I (?) the nest
As if the groove is on, I'm a-spit my flow
Tripping lights fantastic, disco show
Get the mofo back in the bliss patrol
And not worry about friends or foe, oh
As if the life is slow when the groove is on
Watch prints take shape in the music form
Anything I'm on hot now, it's the music you want
Baby it's the (?) to your soul, oh
Close it in, close it in, close it in, hit it again, hit again
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Tripping lights fantastic disco show
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Get it right here, moving closer to me
Your life is something to baby, no way, no (?) maybe's
(?) and you listen to me, come on, moving closer to me
Close to me, come on, yeah-yeah-yeah
Close it in, close it in, close it in, hit it again, hit again
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Tripping lights fantastic disco show
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on, moving closer to me
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Tripping lights fantastic disco show
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Life is slow when the groove is on
Check it out, yeah, ah, 'cause life is slow
When the groove is on, yeah, right hereEmbed
