Madder Lyrics1, 2, 3, 4... Do it now, do it now...
Day starts with a blast of feedback
Still spinning from the night that we had
In the mirror where I brush my teeth at
There’s three more heads, and they watching me back
Read the bread while I toast my pay check
Weather girl said grey's a safe bet
Phone ringing an I refuse to take it
Wanna play dead but I'm on the dayshift
Stepping out on to the weekly rota
On the tube share a seat with Olga
Train driver said it ain't a joke but
We're gonna be stuck till I fix the motor
Half hour in-between the stations
Start jogging when I hit the pavement
Ran straight into a situation
Cop says stop cause I ain't Caucasian
Whole hour on the explanation
Missed the bus and the cab was ancient
I’m really now in a situation
When I return to my destination
I get told to collect my payment
Clear the desk quick make it vacant
Now if I ever needed inspiration
Right about now where I lose my patience
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
Do it now, do it now
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bum bum bum, bummer, bummer, bummer
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This makes you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, bammer, bammer
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This want to make you feel
1, 2, 3, 4... Always said I want a new agenda
Do it now while I still remember
Small fish in a mixin blenda
All the bets set on the next offenda
I had enough being nice and anxious
I keep sweet all the trendy bankers
I’m looking more than the war the pension
Under attack of the apprehension
I’m too transformed to lose the motion
I might shout now out and open
All the hanging on the years of hoping
The same things now feel provoking
So hot that the tears are smoking
Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing
Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing
Now if I ever needed inspiration
Right about here’s where I lose my patience
Now if I ever needed inspiration
Right about here’s where I lose my patience
Do it now, do it now
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bum bum bum, bummer, bummer, bummer
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This makes you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, bammer, bammer
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This want to make you feel
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
Don't make you fell like, don't make you fell like
Madder, madder, madder... Do it now, do it now
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
Do it now, do it now
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bum bum bum, bummer, bummer, bummer
Don’t make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This makes you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, bammer, bammer
Don't make you feel like madder, do it nowEmbed
