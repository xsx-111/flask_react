Hands Of Time Lyrics
Keep looking through the window pane
Just trying to see through the pouring rain
It's hearing your name, hearing your name
I've really never felt quite the same
Since I've lost what I had to gain
No one to blame, no one to blame

Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Oh, it seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time

Keep looking through the window pane
Just trying to see through the pouring rain
It's hearing your name, hearing your name
I've really never felt quite the same
Since I've lost what I had to gain
No one to blame, no one to blame

Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Oh, it seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Seems to me, can't turn back the hands of time
Seems to me, yesterday was left behind
