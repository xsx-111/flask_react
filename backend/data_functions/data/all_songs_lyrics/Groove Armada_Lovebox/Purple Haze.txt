Purple Haze LyricsWell, let me see you one up there, aw, let me see you one up there
Well, let me see you one up there, aw, let me see you one up there
Aw, let me see you one, aw, let me see you one
Let me see you talk dance! On your mark get set girl
Me wanna see you one up there, me wanna see you one up there
Turn on! Let me see you one up there ready for party
When I put your one up there eye on my shanty
Let me see you one up there ready for starting
Body one up there. Come on! One up!
My recipe is Jack Daniels, non-filtered Camels
Сrates full of samples, dutches and examples
One Nike in the grave, one Nike in the rave
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
Man check this out. Ya muggin all silly, point in her face
Old school puffin a philly. Nothing to chase, nothing to lose
Solid ground stuck to my suit
You can cut your split ends, you can't cut your roots. Come on!
My recipe is Jack Daniels, non-filtered Camels
Сrates full of samples, dutches and examples
One Nike in the grave, one Nike in the rave
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze
Well, let me see you one up there, aw, let me see you one up there
Well, let me see you one up there, aw, let me see you one up there
Well, let me see you one up there, eh-he-he-he
Me wanna see you one up there, me wanna see you one up there
Me wanna see you one up there, me wanna see you one up there
It all makes sense after the 'shrooms and the purple haze. Turn on!
Me wanna see you one up there, me wanna see you one up there
Me wanna see you one up there, me wanna see you one up there
Me wanna see you one up there, me wanna see you one up there
Me wanna see you one up there, me wanna see you one up thereEmbed
