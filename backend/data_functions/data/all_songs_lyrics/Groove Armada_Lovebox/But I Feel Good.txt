Trying to get home find a phone
Geezer lighter the futures brighter
Trying to hit a saturday nighter

But I Feel High

Deeper down than this y'all
Deeper down
Yeah I was just following a Friday
Trying to get home find a phone
Geezer lighter the futures brighter
Trying to hit a saturday nighter
Yeah I was just following a Friday
I found a driver here's a fiver
I'll have to lend you excuse me is this the venue
Yeah I was just following a Friday
I was just going with the... uh
But I Feel Good
But I Feel High

Excuse me is this the venue
But I Feel Good
But I Feel High
