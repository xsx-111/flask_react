Remember LyricsWhat you, what you see
In your time to me and you know that you are free
And when you can be, don't think you only
What you see for remember
What you see, remember what you see
What you... Remember what you see... What you...
In your time to me and you know that you are free
And when you can be, don't think you only
What you see for remember
What you see (for remember), what you see (for remember)
What you see (for remember), what you see (for remember)
Remember what you see, remember what you see
Remember what you see, remember what you seeEmbed
