Bad Moon Rising (Live) LyricsI see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'
I know the end is comin' soon
I feel rivers overflowin'
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Don't go around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Alright!
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Well, don't go round tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't come around tonight
Well, it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the riseEmbed
