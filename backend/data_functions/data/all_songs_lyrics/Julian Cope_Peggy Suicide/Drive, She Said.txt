Drive, She Said LyricsCollusion!
Crawl on your knees down Collision Drive
Crawl!
Crawl, gotta crawl, like you're two feet tall
Crawl!
Face it, it's not very civilized
Yeah, we could crawl
But I'd rather drive, she said
Drive, she said
Yeah, we could crawl
But I'd rather drive, she said
Drive drive drive drive!
She shouts, screaming down, over cities and towns
"I have rights!"
But if you believe in me, then you believe
In human sacrifice
Here Peggy Peggy Sui-Suicide
Yeah, we could crawl
But I'd rather drive, she said
Drive, she said
Yeah, we could crawl
But I'd rather drive, she said
Drive, she said
Yeah, we could crawl
But I'd rather drive
Drive, she saidEmbed
