Head LyricsWhen she calls I'm always in the muddle
She's an ocean and I'm just a puddle
Never want to cause her any trouble
Do it now or causing me double
I can feel my head exposing now
I can feel my head exploding now
We went out dancing in the suburbs
In the gutter looking at the curb
Then my girl was skimming
Sent my head to spinning
I can feel my head exposing now
I can feel my head exploding now
When you kill something you believe in
You can hear its cries
You've got your antenna
Though you think you're no longer receiving
I can feel my head exposing now
An uncovered head exploding now
I can feel my head exposing now
Feel my head exploding now
Exploding now
Exploding now
