Pristeen LyricsPristeen. Pristeen
How much can you take?
Pristeen. Pristeen
How much can you take?
'Cause your lying to me was you first mistake
Your trusting in me was your major mistake
Pristeen. Pristeen
How much can you take?
'Cause your lying to me was your first mistake
Trusting in me was your major mistake
Pristeen. Pristeen
How much can you take?
I went down on Pristeen
Now, how much does it take
To go down on someone - someone that you hate?
'Cause her lying to me was her first mistake
Trusting in me was her major mistake
Pristeen. Pristeen, tell me how much can you take?Embed
