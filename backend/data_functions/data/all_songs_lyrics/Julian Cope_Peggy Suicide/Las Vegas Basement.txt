Las Vegas Basement LyricsEasy
When life's a bitter pill you swallow down
With your last breath
And find me alone
And trapped amidst superlatives and grief
Shine underneath
I was thrown out of the crib into the snow
I was born to entertain, so here I go
Not easy
But your hands around my neck could be construed
As your being rude
Find the dinner gong
Put down my fork, start my song
Cause I could be
Anything you want me to be
Top or bottom, face the monster, let him know
I was born to entertain, so here I go
Top or bottom, face the monster, let him know
I was born to entertain, so here I go (once moreâ€¦)
I was shown the door before I got to sing
Only to be now forgotten
Only to be now forgottenEmbed
