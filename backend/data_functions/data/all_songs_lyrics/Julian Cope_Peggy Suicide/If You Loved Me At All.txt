If You Loved Me At All LyricsHey, I had a love as hard as stone
Keep your nerve if you loved me at all
There lies my head, it's blown
Better still if you loved me at all
Don't have a faith just to call my own
Defend your race, defend it all if you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
Pretty, pretty, be my love
Listen to me if you loved me at all
All these thoughts come racing in
If you loved me at all
I can't allow my heart to be burning
I couldn't stop my head from busting
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
Pretty, pretty, be my eyes
See through me if you loved me at all
The boat of love has been capsized
In sight of land but we're cold & drifting
& if I seem to be yawning
The restless sea must be my yearning
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
Walk in your town & I knew you was changed
& if you loved me at all
You'd keep your hounds away, away
& hear my cries to be loving
Heed my cries to be hearing
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
[almost unintelligible groan & whispers -
But you can maybe make out phrases:]
Not a soul...
Down, down, down, soul...
In the sight of you...
Phenomonal doubts that scar...
Listen to the void...
Listen to the void
You don't love me at all
You don't love me at all
You don't love me at all
You don't love me at all
You don't love me at all!
(She doesn't love me at all!)
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
If you loved me at all
You don't love me love me love me
Love me love me love me!Embed
