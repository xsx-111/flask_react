You... LyricsYou
Think it's love because you're not intelligent
You
Think it's love because you're ignorant
I'm always telling things
That people use against me
 jealousy

You
Think it's cool to wear a smiley
I
Could give you loads of things but you don't want one of them
I'd love to hang around
But this is not a doorway
And if you live for now
You just destroy forever
You (x4)
You think it's cool (x3)Embed
