Double Vegetation LyricsSo freaked out
So humiliated
I feel outclassed
I feel overrated
Why did you & me both stand in line?
He said "I want you"
Each day we get closer to the big bad fire
I looked down at the sickness in you
Your hands reach out for my location
But you're so lost in the things you do
That you're caught in the double vegetation
Invent to conceal
All the holes in your heart
Oh, we discussed & discussed
Your disgusting routine
Why did you & me both stand in line?
He said "I want you"
Each day we get closer to the big bad fire
I looked down at the sickness in you
Your hands reaching out for my location
But you're so lost in the things you do
That you're caught in the double vegetationEmbed
