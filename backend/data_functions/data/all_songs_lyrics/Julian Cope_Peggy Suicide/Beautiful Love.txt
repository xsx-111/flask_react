Beautiful Love LyricsYou seem lonely oh Avalon
I feel evidence very strong
Beautiful love now beautiful love where have you gone
You make my life oh so long
Say make believe it ain't so wrong
Beautiful love now beautiful love where have you gone
I'd leave my life it weren't for you
Believe in love it weren't for you
Beautiful love now beautiful love what do you do
I know so
You seem lonely oh love adieu
You need to find a new bonjour
Even when you go I still love you so
Love you so
And even even when you leave
It doesn't matter when you leave
You're my beautiful love, beautiful love
My beautiful love
My beautiful love
My beautiful love
My beautiful love
My beautiful loveEmbed
