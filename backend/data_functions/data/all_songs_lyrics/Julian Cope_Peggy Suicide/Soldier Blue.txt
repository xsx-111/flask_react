Soldier Blue LyricsBecause I know what you did, and I'm proud to admit it
I was out in the street, I was strangely committed
To my left, to my right, on all fours and forsaken
On your hind legs you beat us
And I hope that you're proud, Soldier Blue
"That's another big problem
People can't separate the authorities and the people who have the authority vested in them
I think you see a lot of that in the demonstrations
Because they have that concept
That the war and the law enforcement are one
It's actually the people demonstrating
Demonstrating at the police department
Actually against policemen..."
I know what you did, and I'm proud to admit it
I was out in the street, I was strangely committed
To my left, to my right, on all fours and forsaken
On your hind legs you beat us
And I hope that you're proud, Soldier Blue
"...Wanted law enforcement
Guys are fighting
They're very fundable
They go to light the craphouse
And you see I can't do it 'cause I do business with these assholes...
And it looks bad for me you know uh...
So I want somebody to do it for me ya know
So I tell ya what...
Here's a stick and a gun and you do it
But wait 'til I'm outta the room
But wait 'til I'm outta the room."
Because I know what you did, and I'm proud to admit it
I was out in the street, I was strangely committed
To my left, to my right, on all fours and forsaken
On your hind legs you beat us
And I hope that you're proud, Soldier Blue
And I hope that you're proud, Soldier BlueEmbed
