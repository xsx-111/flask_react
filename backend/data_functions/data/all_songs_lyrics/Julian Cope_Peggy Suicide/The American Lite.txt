The American Lite LyricsI'm gonna douse myself in holy water
Got the fever inside
I'm gonna drown myself in holy water
Got the fever, it won't die
Fact my love is stronger now
And my life is leaving jail
She's got a love, it's getting wide and bright
Concentric circles running to the American lite
It's calling out now
Ha-ha, he-he, take that, baby, ha-ha, he-he
And then she zaps me with her keen, keen love
And then I rinse myself in holy water
Watch the fever rise
I wanna live beside my favourite daughter, yeah
My American lite
Sometimes I write a new song and I'm looking for approval
Does it sound like the elevators
Will it sound more of ...
(We can't come to the phone right now)
(But if you leave your name and number)
(We'll probably get back to you)
Probably get back to you
I stand outside
I put on my best phoney American accent
I cry "Let me in, let me in"
Ha-ha, he-he, take that, baby, ha-ha, he-he
And then she zaps me with her keen, keen love
Oh, I'll drown myself in holy water
I watch the fever rise
And I will turn my face to watch the princess moon
Raising high above queen mother Earth
Take my life, take my life
Thatt my love is stronger now
Have lovers ever been before
...
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Calling out now
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Circles running to the American lite
Concentric circles running to the American lite
Concentric circles running to the American liteEmbed
