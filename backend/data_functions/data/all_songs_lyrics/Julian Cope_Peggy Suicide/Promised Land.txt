Promised Land LyricsI'm out in my walking shoes
I'm walking to my promised land
Been talking and talked to
The devil he's at my right hand
And Jesus too
Waiting to help and
Waiting for my answers
Waiting for my prayer to find me there
Promised land
I'm walking through every shire
I pray that I will be received
The hate that she inspires
Has to be seen to be believed
And yet so scared
Witless and wondering
Every man is frightened
Praying for enlightened days ahead
Promised land
Walk on freedom shore
Won't see me again
See me no more
Gone to my promised landEmbed
