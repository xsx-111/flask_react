Safesurfer LyricsI saw my old man
Exploding out of a tunnel
I knew what came next
Recognized that cruel seed
That brought the downfall of the distant gaze
Distant gaze welcome in a son of Clovius Boofus
Just another sheep boy
Duck call, swan song
Idiot son of Donkey Kong and I say
You don't have to be afraid, love
Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin'
You don't have to be afraid, love
Cause I'm a safesurfer, darlin' (ad infinitum)Embed
