Goodnight Sweet Josephine LyricsGoodnight sweet Josephine
She's the queen of Clapham
Every night she goes out with men to trap 'em
In her net of ecstasy
Goodnight sweet Josephine
There's no-one else quite like you
If Josephine could
She'd give you her blood
I know that she would
Love to
Goodnight sweet Josephine
Goodnight sweet Josephine
Goodnight sweet Josephine
We love you
Goodnight sweet Josephine
We love you to distraction
Whatever she does
The police will take no action
They're all in love
With Josephine
It's right that Josephine
Should do just as she pleases
And whether or not
You like what she's got
She's guaranteed not
To fail you
Goodnight sweet Josephine
Goodnight sweet Josephine
Goodnight sweet Josephine
We love you
Goodnight sweet Josephine
Goodnight sweet Josephine
Goodnight sweet Josephine
We love you
Goodnight sweet Josephine
Goodnight sweet JosephineEmbed
