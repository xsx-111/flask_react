Smile on Me Lyrics
Smile on me, baby
Make me feel like summer's here
Smile on me, baby
Make me feel good when you're near
Prove it to me, baby
That our love is in the clear

Walk with me, baby
Make me hold my head up high
Walk with me, baby
Make me feel the greatest guy
I'm gonna love you, baby
Love you 'til you cry

Stay with me, baby
Make me always feel so fine
Stay with me, baby
Make me always feel so fine
So I can tell all the world
You always gonna be mine

Smile on me, baby
Make me feel like summer's here
Smile on me, baby
Make me feel good when you're near
Prove it to me, baby
Our love is in the clearEmbed
