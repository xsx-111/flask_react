Stealing, Stealing Lyrics
Stealing, stealing
Mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back
To the way I used to be

Well put your arms around me
Like a circle 'round the sun
Now the skies are blue
We can have a little fun
How I'm glad it's you
And not your sister with me now
I saw her yesterday
And she looked just like a

Oh, stealing, stealing
Mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back
To the way I used to be, yeah

Oh, stealing, stealing
Mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back
To the way I used to be
Well sit beside me, baby
Backs up to the sun
The sun is shining out now
Just for you and I
But don't ask me
To walk you home
Your mother scared me bad
So I'd rather stay at home

Stealing, stealing
Mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back
To the way I used to be

I'm stealing, stealing
Mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back
To the way I used to be

Stealing, stealing
Mama don't you tell on me
I'm stealing back
To the way I used to be
Stealing, stealing
Mama don't you tell on me...Embed
