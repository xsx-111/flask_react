Think About It LyricsWhen will the clouds all roll away?
When will the good people have their say?
I hope you're still round to see the day
Take a while
Think about it
Take a while
Think about it
Take a while
Think about it
Who can tell what is up or down?
You can be the king or be the clown
Then climb your tree, take a look around
Take a while
Think about it
Take a while
Think about it
Take a while
Think about it
Circles of life, an infinite plane
That which is now now will be again
Who can decide who is insane?
Take a while
Think about it
Take a while
Think about it
Take a while
Think about itEmbed
