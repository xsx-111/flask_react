Little Games Lyrics
Little games are for little boys
I'm growing up and changing all my toys
Aeroplanes, motor cars
Goldfish, and old jam jars
I just don't play these games no more

Little games are for little boys
Loving games are for bigger boys
Parties in Chelsea flats
Mixing with kinky cats
Are games I wanna play some more

Ooh, what they're doing to me
Darling, it's so plain to see
My temperature's rising
But that's not surprising
When you do what you do to me

Little games are for little boys
I found out there are other joys
Margaret, Josephine
Susie, and Catherine
They help me in my little games
Ooh, what they're doing to me
Darling, it's so plain to see
My temperature's rising
But that's not surprising
When you do what you do to me

Little games are for little boys
I found out there are other joys
Margaret, Josephine
Susie, and Catherine
They help me in my little games

My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Play my little games
My, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
Say I need you, I need you...Embed
