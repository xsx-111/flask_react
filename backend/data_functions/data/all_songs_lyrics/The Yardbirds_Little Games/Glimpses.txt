Glimpses Lyrics
Glimpses of clouds in a forest
Can reveal well within us
And to never linger on one is life
Energy radiates from the source
The life around us is but a reflection of our own
Flowing within never ending, boundless infinity
Time is just a cumular limit
Which with one glimpse can overcome

Can overcomeEmbed
