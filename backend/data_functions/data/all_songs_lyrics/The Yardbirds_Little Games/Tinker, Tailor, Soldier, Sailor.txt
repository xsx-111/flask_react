Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor Lyrics
Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief
Doctor, baker, fine shoe-maker
Wise man, madman, taxman, please

How can I know just what to be?
Please stop and give advice to me
Tell me
How many people do I help
Just by sitting on the shelf
Tell me
I don't want a trade at all
There's to living off the road


Who's gonna tell me what to do?
Then they will say that I am true
Maybe
Perhaps I'll come to a great success
Or possible a dreadful mess
Maybe
Having buys it's fortune, fame
Living's just a little game
