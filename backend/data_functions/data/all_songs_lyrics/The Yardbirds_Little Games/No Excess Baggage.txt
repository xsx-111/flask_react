No Excess Baggage Lyrics
I'm moving, I'm gonna see the world while I can
I'm moving, I'm gonna be a well rounded man
And there ain't no room for no one else
I've got to learn it all for myself

No excess baggage there to worry me
No excess baggage there to hurry me
No excess baggage, girl
I must roam, all alone, on my own

I'm hungry, I wanna taste the fruits of the world
So hungry, and assure I can love you girl
But if you're, what I'm searching for
My heart will lead me back to your door


But if you're, what I'm searching for
My heart will lead me back to your door

No excess baggage there to worry me
No excess baggage there to hurry me
No excess baggage, girl
I must roam, all alone, on my own
I gotta roam, all alone
No excess baggage
(On my own, I gotta roam)
No excess baggage
(All alone, on my own)
No excess baggage
(I gotta roam)
No excess baggage
(On my own, all alone)Embed
