Ten Little Indians LyricsTen little indians
Standing in a line
One stood looking at another man's wife
Then there were nine
Nine little indians
Their hearts were full of hate
One took his neighbor's goods
Then there were eight
Eight little indians
They just got down from heaven
One told a lie about another's best friend
Then there were seven
Seven little indians
All trying to get there kicks
One thought he found another way to get to heaven
Then there were six
Six little indians
Trying to stay alive
One took another's life
Then there were five
Five little indians
All trying to find the door
One pulled his mother down
Then there were four
Four little indians
All thinking that they gotta be free
One little indian forgot to say his prayers
Then there were three
Three little indians
Deciding what they're gonna have to do
One took the name of God in vain
Then there were two
Two little indians
Thinking that they oughtta have some fun
One took a liking to a picture of himself
Then there was one
One little indian
Out looking for the sun
At six o'clock, the moon came out
Then there was noneEmbed
