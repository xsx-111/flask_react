Puzzles LyricsYou never talk straight to me
It's all puzzles to me
If there's sense in what you talk about
I can never see
If you don't want me to spend your life with you
Go and find someone new
'Cause I know there's so many better girls than you
Puzzles, hanging on my mind now
Puzzles, puzzles in my mind
In my mind
That's all I find
In my mind
Life's puzzles
I will never know
Which way to go straight
Love, war, people arguing
How can they know what to hate?
Ever since I began thinking
I wondered why things were so
But no matter how hard I contemplate
Puzzles will never go
Puzzles, hanging on my mind now
Puzzles, puzzles in my mind
In my mind
That's all I find
In my mind
Ooh, puzzlesEmbed
