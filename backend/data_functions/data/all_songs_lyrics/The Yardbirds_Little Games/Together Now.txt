Together Now LyricsTell me the time
Dandelion clock say quarter to nine
The garden awakes
A passing bee says that everything's fine
Eyes wide
Deep inside
Now I know
Time has brought us love
Day breaks
Love awakes
All that's you
All that's me
Together now
Corn flowers blue
Sway in the breeze, and say that I love you
Great when you smile
It's like you feel when the sun is shining through
Eyes wide
Deep inside
Now I know
Time has brought us love
Day breaks
Love awakes
All that's you
All that's me
Together now
Eyes wide
Deep inside
Now I know
Time has brought us love
Day breaks
Love awakes
All that's you
All that's me
Together now
Eyes wide
Deep inside
Now I know
Time has brought us love
Day breaks
Love awakes
All that's you
All that's me
Together nowEmbed
