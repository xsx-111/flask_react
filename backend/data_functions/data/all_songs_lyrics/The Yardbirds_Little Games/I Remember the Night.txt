I Remember the Night Lyrics
I remember the night
I was holding you tight
And I'll never forget how you were
You had brocades of blue
And an umbrella, too
With a beautiful long piece of fur
And as I held you close
And you'd propose a toast
With champagne and I'd cry out, "Yes sir!"
And we took all our cares
Up the apples and pears
And I'll always remember the night

You wore velvet and lace
What an awful disgrace
Was the man who was sick in your soup
He was rude, wasn't he?
And I told him to flee
But he gave me a punch in the tooth
Then he left, but before
All the brandy he poured
Down your dress, and you raised the roof
And we took all our cares
Up the apples and pears
How well I remember the night
(All together, now!)

I remember the night
I was holding you tight
And I'll never forget how you were
You had brocades of blue
And an umbrella, too
And a beautiful long piece of fur
And as I held you close
You'd propose a toast
With champagne and I'd cry out, "Yes sir!"
And we took all our cares
Up the apples and pears
I'll always remember the night

I'll always remember the night
I'll always remember the nightEmbed
