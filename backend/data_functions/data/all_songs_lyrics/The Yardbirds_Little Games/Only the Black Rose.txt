Only the Black Rose Lyrics
Gone, gone away, gone away
Almost nothing to do
Gone away, now I'm far from you
Though I'm alone now and there's nobody near
I hush my voice, lest they should hear
My prayers go up to the sky, deep within me I die
I'll never cry, no one must see me this way
Left, left to find, someone kind
Who won't leave me behind
Who will guide me, when I am blind?
Soothe my brow, when thoughts hurt my brain
Help me laugh, when faced with pain
I long to find someone who will remind me of you
Only the black rose knows what I will do
Silence, silence now
Not a sound, stillness everywhere now
And the trees to the wind gently bow
Only visions of the past and the gloom
And for the moment you're in the room
And just as flowers bloom and die
No one watching to cry

Only the black rose stands up to the sky
Only the black roseEmbed
