You Know Who (Is Doing You Know What) Lyrics
I heard some news this morning
And it almost devastated me
It hit my heart without a warning
The story is on the street
I overheard a conversation
It was all about you
I can't believe what they're saying baby
It better not be true

They say, you know who is doing you know what
How am I supposed to feel?
You know who is doing you know what
I thought our love was real

They say you can't believe everything you hear
But you've got me feeling insecure
I thought you and I, had a good thing going
Now baby I'm not so sure
I'm going to have mixed emotions
When I see you tonight
I'm afraid I see the true story
When I look in your eyes
They say, you know who is doing you know what
Baby I've got to know
You know who is doing you know what
I don't want to let you go, oh no

I don't want to be jumping to conclusions
I would rather keep my trust in you
Is your love for me just an illusion?
Baby, tell me is it true?

You know who is doing you know what
I've got to keep my courage up
You know who is doing you know what
Are you going to turn your back on love?

You know who is doing you know what Embed
