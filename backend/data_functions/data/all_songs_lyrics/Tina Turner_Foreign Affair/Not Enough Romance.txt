Not Enough Romance Lyrics
Should've never made an eye contact
Should've been a heart of stone
When you stopped me to say hello
Would've been twice as easy to just say no
'Cause I don't want to lose at love again, hmm
But as a couple we were quite handsome
And the moon was out that night
So we let our hearts go dancing
If that thing is missing in my life

There's not enough romance in this world 
There's too many people thinking only of themselves
You got to give love for its return

Want to sing about new lovers
Stand up against the odds
Nothing can change a thing that strong
And myself I know my emotions
I got my love to share
And when you need something so tender
What you're looking for is so rare

We take a lot of chances playing some foolish games
But that's the only price that you got to pay, oh ho
I got to keep believing hungry hearts run free
Everybody needs a good loving
It's anything you want it to be, oh ho, oh yeah
There's too many people thinking only of themselves
Got to give love for its return


There's not enough romance in this world Embed
