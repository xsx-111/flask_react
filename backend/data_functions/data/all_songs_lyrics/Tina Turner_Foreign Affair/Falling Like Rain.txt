Falling Like Rain Lyrics
Really brings me down, I don't know how
That you can say you're not my kind
Couldn't find a cloud for miles around
Why do you change your story line
It all goes gray again
Sometimes I don't know when
To come out of the storm
It feels like forty days
And forty nights I've been
Beating on your door

Hey I'm falling like rain
Oh I, I love you, love you, love you
Falling like rain
Oh I, I'm coming down around you
I will always think about you

My sentimental ways
Don't seem to phase
You know I don't ever
Want to force your hand
If you met me one time
Just half the way
I could meet you where you are
Just meet me where I am
'Cause every now and then
You've got to drive right in
Deeper than deep
You take a chance and then
You give the wheel a spin
Anyone can see

Falling like rain
It feels like forty days
And forty nights I've been
Beating on your door

 
I love you, love you, love you
Falling like rain
Oh I, I'm only giving love you
I will always think about you
Oh you, love you, love you, love youEmbed
