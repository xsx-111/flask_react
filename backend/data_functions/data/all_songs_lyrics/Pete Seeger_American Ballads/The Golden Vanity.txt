The Golden Vanity LyricsThere was a lofty ship, and she put out to sea
And the name of the our ship was the Golden Vanity
And she sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As she sailed upon the lonesome sea
We had not been out but two weeks or three
When we were overtaken by the Turkish Revelee
As we sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As we sailed upon the lonesome sea
The quickly up spoke our little cabin boy
Sayin', "What will you give me if I will them destroy
If I sink 'em in the low and lonesome low
If I sink 'em in the lonesome sea?"
The man that them destroy," our captain then replied
"Five thousand pounds and my daughter for his bride
If he sink 'em in the low and lonesome low
If he sink 'em in the lonesome sea"
Then the boy he smote his chest and overboard jumped he
And he swum till he came to the Turkish Revelee
As they sailed upon the low and lonesome low
As they sailed upon the lonesome sea
Now he had a little tool that was made for the use
And he bored three holes in her side all at once
And he sunk her in the low and lonesome low
And he sunk her in the lonesome sea
Then he swam back to the ship and he beat upon the side
Sayin', "Captain, pick me up, for I'm drifting with the tide
And I'm sinking in the low and lonesome low
And I'm sinkin' in the lonesome sea"
"I will not pick you up," the Captain then replied
"I'll shoot you, I'll drown you, I'll sink you in the tide
And I'll sink you in the low and lonesome low
And I'll sink you in the lonesome sea"
Then the boy he took his tool; in our side he bored holes three
Saying, "Captain, I'll take you with me to the bottom of the sea
And I'll sink you in the low and lonesome low
And I'll sink you in the lonesome sea"
And we sank into the lonesome sea
And we sank into the lonesome seaEmbed
