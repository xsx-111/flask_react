Fair Margaret & Sweet William LyricsLady Margaret sitting in her high hall door
Combing her long yellow hair
Saw sweet William and his new-made bride
Riding from the church
So near she throwed down her ivory comb
Throwed back her long yellow hair
Said I'll go down to bid him farewell
And never more go there
It was all lately in the night
When they were fast asleep
Lady Margaret appeared all dressed in white
Standing at their bed feet
How do you like your pillow, said she
How do you like your sheet?
And how do you like that fair young lady
Lying in your arms asleep
Very well do I like my pillow, says he
Very well do I like my sheet
But better do I like that fair young maiden
Standing at my bed feet
Once he kissed her lily white hand
Twice he kissed her cheek
Three times he kissed her cold corpsey lips
And fell in her arms asleep
Is Lady Margaret in her room?
Or is she in the hall?
No, Lady Margaret's in her cold black coffin
With her pale face to the wallEmbed
