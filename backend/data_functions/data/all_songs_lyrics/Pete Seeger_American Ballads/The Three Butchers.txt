The Three Butchers LyricsJohnstone he was riding along
Fast as he could ride
When he thought he heard a woman
He heard a woman cry
Johnstone getting off his horse
Searching the woods all round
When he came upon a woman
With her hair bent to the ground
Woman,dearest woman
Who brought you here for a span
Who had brought you here this morning
With yer hair bent to the ground
Oh it were three bold and struggling men
With swords gleaming on
Who that brought me here this morning
With me hair pinned to the ground
Well, Johnstone being a man of his own
Being a man and bold
He has taken off his overcoat
To cover her from the cold
Johnstone getting on his horse
The woman gets on behind
They rode down that lonesome highway
Their fortune for to find
They were riding all alone
Fastest they could ride
When she threw her fingers to her lips
And gave three shivering cries
And out sprang three bold and struggling men
With swords gleaming on
Uh, that commanded Johnstone
Commanded him to stand
I'll all stop them,said Johnstone
I'll stop,then said he
For I never was in all my life
Afraid of any three
Johnstone killing two of them
Not watching the woman behind
While he was after the other one
She stabbed him from behind
Day was free and a market day
People all passing by
Could that saw awful murder
Could have seen poor Johnstone dieEmbed
