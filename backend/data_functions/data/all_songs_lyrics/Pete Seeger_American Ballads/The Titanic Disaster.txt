The Titanic Disaster LyricsIt was on one Monday morning just about one o'clock
When that great ship Titanic began to reel and rock
People began to scream and cry saying, Lord I'm a-goin to die
It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad, it was sad, it was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down
When that ship left England it was making for the shore
The rich refused to associate with the poor
So they put the poor below; they were the first to go
It was sad when that great ship wеnt down
It was sad, it was sad, it was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and wivеs, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down
While they were building they said what they would do
We will build a ship that the water can't go through
But God with power in hand showed the world that it could not stand
It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad, it was sad, it was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down
Those people on that ship were a long ways from home
With friends all around they didn't know that the time had come
Death came riding by, sixteen hundred had to die
It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad, it was sad, it was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down
While Paul was sailing, his men all around
God told him that not a man should drown
If you trust in me and obey I will save you all today
It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad, it was sad, it was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went down
You know it must have been awful with those people on the sea
They say that they were singing "Nearer My God to Thee"
While some were homeward bound sixteen hundred had to drown
It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad, it was sad, it was sad when that great ship went down
Husbands and wives, little children lost their lives
It was sad when that great ship went downEmbed
