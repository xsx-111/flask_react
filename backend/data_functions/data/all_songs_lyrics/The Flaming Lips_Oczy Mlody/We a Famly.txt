We a Famly Lyrics
One, two, three, four

It’s been a long, cold winter
Feels like it's been forever, yeah
We both travelin'
I’m somewhere south of Wichita
You're somewhere up there under the moon
I can't see you

Flying along, the engines hummin'
Jesus and the spaceships comin' down (down, down, down)
Oh, and I just can't imagine
Life without you could ever happen (now, now, now, now)

It's you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

We a family, we a family, we a family
We a family, we a family, we a family

It’s been a long hot summer
I miss you, it's a bummer, yeah
We both travelin'
You're somewhere south of Wichita
I'm up here somewhere under the moon
I can’t see you
Flyin' along, the engines hummin'
Jesus and the spaceships comin' (down, down, down, down)
Oh, and I just can't imagine
Life without you ever happen now (now, now now)

It's you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

We a family, we a family, we a family
We a family, we a family, we a family
We a family, we a family, we a family
We a family

We a family
