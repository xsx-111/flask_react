Galaxy I Sink LyricsI saw the universe in your giant eye
I want to touch your mind hole and go inside
Last night
Last night
And when you look at me it's like the sun
I understand how space and time begun
Last night
Last night
Your face, I sink
In time, I sink
And I will never reappear
Your love, I sink
You're everything, I sink
The threat that you'll disappear
And with the floating specs in my tired eyes
I can see all dimensions of my life
At night, at night
How can the stars really know me now
When I fear their light will burn me up?
