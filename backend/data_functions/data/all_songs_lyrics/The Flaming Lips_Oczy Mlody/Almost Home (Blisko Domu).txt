Almost Home (Blisko Domu) Lyrics
Oh, we're almost home
Oh, oh, almost home
Oh, we're almost home
Home
Oh, we're almost home
Oh, oh, almost home
Oh, we're almost home
Home
Oh, we're almost home
Oh, oh, almost home
Oh, we're almost home
Home
Oh, we're almost home
Oh, oh, almost home
Oh, we're almost home
Home

The thought soon becomes the word
The word then becomes the deed
If the deed is evil (evil)
Blame the thought that is the seed
Change the spark that makes the need
Did your mind invent your mind?
The insect crawls out on the leaf
The leaf falls into the fire
Burning up my fragile dream
Of how the world is full of love
It's not what I thought it was
Hurting us until we're dust

Us, us, us
Us, us, us
Us, us, us

The action needs its energy
It takes it from your hate and greed
Makes you scared, there's gonna be
A stranger grabbin' you by the throat
Or is it someone that you know?
You fear revenge from those you've hurt
