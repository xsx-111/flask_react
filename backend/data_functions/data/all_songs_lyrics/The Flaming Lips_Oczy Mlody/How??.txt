How?? Lyrics
White trash rednecks, earthworms eat the ground
Legalize it, every drug right now
Are you with us or are you burnin’ out?
Kill your rock 'n roll, motherfuckin’ hip-hop sound

I tried to tell you but I don’t know how
I tried to tell you but I don’t know how

How??
How??
How??
How??

A thousand suns are in the sky right now
Let them shine now, shine for just one hour

I tried to tell you but I don’t know how
I tried to tell you but I don’t know how

How??
How??
How??
How??
How??
Back when we were young, we killed everyone
If they fucked with us with our baby guns
We were young with our baby guns
We were young with our baby guns

A bird is singing, singing really loud
A jet is flying, flying through a cloud

I tried to tell you but I don’t know how
I tried to tell you but I don’t know how

How??
How??
How??
How??
How??
