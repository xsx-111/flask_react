Listening to the Frogs with Demon Eyes Lyrics
Glistening in the moonlight
Listening to the frogs
Hiding ourselves in the trees
Watching with demon eyes
Here we go again
Here we go

Have you ever seen someone die
In the summertime, in the summertime?
Is that what your demon eyes see?
Have you ever gone through the hole in the night sky?

I can't see the moon though I know it's there
I can't see the end but I know it is there
I can't see the sun but I feel it's there
I can't see your love but I know it is there

I know it's forbidden
We can squash the stars
New holes in the darkness
Darkness in the dark
Yeah, here we go again
Here we go
Have you ever seen someone die
In the summertime?
Is that what your demon eyes see?
Have you ever seen someone die
In the summertime?
Is that what your demon eyes see?
Have you ever seen someone die
In the summertime?
Is that what your demon eyes see?Embed
