Midnight Blue LyricsMidnight blue
Midnight blue
I see the lonely road that leads so far away
I see the distant lights that left behind the day
But what I see is so much more than I can say
And I see you in midnight blue
I see you cryin' now, you've found a lot of pain
And what you're searchin' for can never be the same
But what's the difference 'cause they say what's in a name?
And I see you in midnight blue
(Midnight blue)
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)
I see you standing there far out along the way
I want to touch you, but the night becomes the day
I count the words that I am never gonna say
And I see you in midnight blue
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)
Can't you feel the love that I'm offering you?
Can't you see how it's meant to be?
Can't you hear the words that I'm saying to you?
Can't you believe like I believe?
It's only one and one, it's true
Still I see you in midnight blue
(Midnight blue)
I see (I see) beautiful days
And I feel (I feel) beautiful ways
Of loving you, everything's midnight blue
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue2Embed
