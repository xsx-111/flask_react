Confusion Lyrics
Everywhere the sun is shining
All around the world, it's shining
But cold winds blow across your mind

Confusion (confusion) - it's such a terrible shame
Confusion (confusion) - you don't know what you're saying
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
(Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
(To lean on)

Every night you're out there, darling
You're always out there running
And I see that lost look in your eyes

Confusion (confusion) - I don't know what I should do
Confusion (confusion) - I leave it all up to you
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
(Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
(To lean on)
Dark is the road you wander
And as you stand there under
The starry sky, you feel sad inside

Confusion (confusion) - you know, it's driving me wild
Confusion (confusion) - it comes as no big surprise
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
(Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
(To lean on)

Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion1Embed
