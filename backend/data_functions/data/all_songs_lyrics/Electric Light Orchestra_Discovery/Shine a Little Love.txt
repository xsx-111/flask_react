Shine a Little Love Lyrics
Although the things you've done, I wouldn't criticize
I guess you had your way
You see, I gotta make you understand

I know it sounds a foolish thing to say
But it don't matter, baby
'Cause today's another day

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn
Remember, tonight we're gonna say
We'll never stop, we got a good thing goin' on

I know you've heard it all before
But I really need you, darlin'
Every day, I need you more
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

Can you understand (yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)
Hu, hu, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu

It's been a year now and it's gettin' so much better
Came home without a word
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her

They couldn't see and they just didn't understand
And lookin' in the mirror
There were fools at either hand

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see
Can you understand (yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)
Hu-ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-hu-aah, hu

How many days had I been waitin' there to tell you
I really can't believe
We're walkin' out into the world tonight

We'll do it all again until the break of light
And the feeling in your heart
Will soon be shinin' in your eyes

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

You shine a little love on my life (Shine on me)
You shine a little love on my life (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see
You shine a little love on my life (Shine)
You shine a little love on my life (E.L.O.)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see1Embed
