Little Town Flirt LyricsHere she comes
(Here she comes)
That little town flirt
(Here she comes)
You're falling for her
And you're gonna get hurt
Yeah, I know it so hard to resist
The temptation of the tender red lips
But you can get hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Foolin' around with that little town flirt

(Here she comes)
Through that look in her eyes
(Here she comes)
She plays around
With every guy that goes by
Yeah, I know she's gonna treat you wrong
So your heart just get better be strong
'Cause you can get hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Foolin' around with that little town flirt
I know how you feel, you think her love is real
You think this time she'll be sincere
But you think you got a paper heart
When she starts to tear it apart
That's when she'll let you go
