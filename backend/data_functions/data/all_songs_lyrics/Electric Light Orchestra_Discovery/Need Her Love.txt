Need Her Love Lyrics
She gives me love that I
Could never hope to have
She tells me that she needs me
She tells me that she's glad
And if she goes away
I'm like someone
Who's left out in the rain

I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love

She came in from the west
A summer breeze I couldn't rest
I had to take a fast train
To be there by her side
She made me feel so good
She made it like
It should be all the time

I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love
Just when I
Was thinkin' of her
She came along
And made me want her

I need her love
I need her love
I need her love


If she goes away
I'm like someone
Who's left out in the rain

I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love

The boats that sail
The planes that fly, she is with me
I wonder if she wonders
If this is all for real?
I couldn't stand to see
Her cry because of me
That would be sad
I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love

She tells me everything
She makes me smile, she tries to sing
But never shares her suffering
If things are going wrong
She makes it like a dream
If things are as they seem
The world is good

I need her love
I need her love
I need her love
I need her
I need her love
Ooh, I need her love
Ooh, I need her love
Yeah, yeah, I need her love2Embed
