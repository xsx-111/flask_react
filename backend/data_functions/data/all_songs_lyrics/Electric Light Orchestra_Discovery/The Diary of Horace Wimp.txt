The Diary of Horace Wimp Lyrics
Monday (Monday)
Late again today
He'd be in trouble
Though he'd say he was sorry
He'd have to hurry out
To the bus

Tuesday (Tuesday)
Horace was so sad
He'd never had a girl
That he could care for
And if he was late once more
He'd be out, uh-oh

Don't be afraid
Just knock on the door
Well, he just stood there
Mumblin' and fumblin'
Then a voice from above

Said, "Horace Wimp, this is your life
Go out and find yourself a wife
(Come on, Horace)
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life planned"
(You can do it)
(Come on, Horace)
Wednesday (Wednesday)
Horace met a girl
She was small
And she was very pretty
He thought he was in love
He was afraid, uh-oh

Thursday (Thursday)
Asked her for a date
The caf√© down the street
Tomorrow evening
His head was reeling
When she said, "Yes, okay"

Don't be afraid
Just knock on the door
Well, he just stood there
Mumblin' and fumblin'
Then a voice from above

Said, "Horace Wimp, this is your life
Go out and find yourself a wife
(Come on, Horace)
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life planned"
(You can do it)
(Come on, Horace)
Friday (Friday)
Horace, this is it
He asks the girl
If maybe they could marry
When she says, "Gladly"
Horace cries, boo hoo

Sunday (Sunday)
Everybody's at the church
When Horace rushes in
And says, "Now here comes my wife
For the rest of my life"
And she did

Don't be afraid
Just knock on the door
Well, he just stood there
Mumblin' and fumblin'
Then a voice from above

Said, "Horace Wimp, this is your wife
Go out and find yourself a life
(You can do it)
Make a stand and be a man
And you will have a great life planned"
(Horace Wimp)
(Horace, Horace, Horace, Horace)
