On the Run LyricsWhatever I do, wherever I go
The same afterglow is keepin' me low
Do-do-do-don't wanna lose it
But don't wanna stay here too long
They see you go by, I tell you no lie
You're up in the sky, make everyone cry
Do-do-do-don't wanna lose it
But don't wanna stay around here
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again
I hear them talkin' and they go on and on
They think that nothing is wrong, and so they just carry on about you
Do-do-do-don't wanna lose it
But I gotta move out of here
I see them waiting there for most of the day
I know you asked them to stay, but they just won't go away
Do-do-do-don't wanna lose it
But I gotta do it again
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again
I know it ain't real, but when you are near
You're saying the things that I wanna hear
Do-do-do-don't wanna lose it
But I gotta do it again
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say, when it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again
Run around, gotta go, gotta run around
Run around, gotta go, gotta run
Run around, gotta go, gotta run around
Run around, gotta go, gotta run
Woman, I gotta move around
Woman, I gotta get away
Woman, I gotta move around1Embed
