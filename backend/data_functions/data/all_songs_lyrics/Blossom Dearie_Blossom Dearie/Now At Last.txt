Now At Last Lyrics(Bob Haymes)
Now at last I know
What a fool I've been
For I've lost the last love
I shall ever win
And at last I see
How my heart was blind
To the joys before me
That I left behind
When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I
When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I know
When the wind was fresh
On the hills
And the stars were new in the sky
And a lark was heard in the still
Where was I
Where was I
When the spring is cold
Where do robins go
What makes winters lonely
Now at last I knowEmbed
