Wait Till You Seem Him Lyrics
Wait till you see him, see how he looks
Wait till you hear him laugh
Painters of paintings, writers of books
Never could tell the half

Wait till you feel the warmth of his glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely, all of it thrilling
I’ll never be willing to free him
When you see him, you won’t believe your eyes


Wait till you feel the warmth of his glance
Pensive and sweet and wise
All of it lovely, all of it thrilling
I’ll never be willing to free him
When you see him, you won’t believe your eyesEmbed
