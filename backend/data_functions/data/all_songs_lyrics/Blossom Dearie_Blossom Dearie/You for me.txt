You for me Lyrics(Bob Haymes)
You for me
Only you can do the things that you do for me
Give a friendless heart
An endless start to romance
Then watch it dance
Your subtle glance
Gave me the chance to discover
That your for me
I'm the fish at sea
And you're the lure for me
Take a look & see
You've hooked
The she who'll agree
Quite cheerfully
To be for you
If it's you for me
You for me
Only you can do the things that you do for me
Give a friendless heart
An endless start to romance
Then watch it dance
Your subtle glance
Gave me the chance to discover
That your for me
I'm the fish at sea
And you're the lure for me
Take a look & see
You've hooked
The she who'll agree
Quite cheerfully
To be for you
If it's you for meEmbed
