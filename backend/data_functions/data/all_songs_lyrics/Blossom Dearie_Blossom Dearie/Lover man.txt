I don't know why, but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I've never had
Never had no kissin', oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be
The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me, but there's no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be
I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance can be
Like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears
Huggin' and a-kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man oh where can you be
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you beEmbed
