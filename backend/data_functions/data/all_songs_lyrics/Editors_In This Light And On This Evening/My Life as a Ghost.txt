My Life as a Ghost Lyrics
The kids are dancing tonight, maybe we'll join them
There's blood in the air tonight, it crushes the boredom
Grab your coats and get to the boats, head to the coast
Tonight we sail to the edge of the world

Get out of this house now, head for the horizon
Tonight we take the town, so pick your poison
Here's a toast, a life as a ghost is better than most
If we have our love in the gutter

Dance, fucker, dance
You were born to entertain
Sing, choir boy, sing
Wash your sins down the drain
In a violent haze
Under the streetlights' gaze
Dance, fucker, dance
You were born to entertain

Now without water
Death takes us before hunger
We dug a well for the water
We put on this fire
Dance, fucker, dance
You were born to entertain
Sing, choir boy, sing
Wash your sins down the drain
In a violent haze
Under the streetlights' gaze
Dance, fucker, dance
You were born to entertain1Embed
