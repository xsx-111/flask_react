Like Treasure Lyrics
Ain't it just like the old days?
Wait and see how the hand plays
Living out our second-hand cliches
Ain't it just like the old days?

You are what you eat
You'll become digested
Well love, it isn't felt
No, love is tested

You will keep forever
I'll bury you like treasure

We gotta get friends in high places
Hide behind their plastic faces
Rip up the flag and replace it
Dance with our friends in high places

You are what you eat
You'll become digested
Well love, it isn't felt
No, love is tested
You will keep forever
I'll bury you like treasure
You will keep forever
I'll bury you like treasure

I used to want to be you
Now where's your shadow? You're see through
I used to want to be you
Now where's your shadow? You're see through

You will keep forever
I'll bury you like treasure
You will keep forever
I'll bury you like treasureEmbed
