Walk the Fleet Road Lyrics
A winter wind blows
In from the north
Scratches your spine
Cold like the forth
But you're a long way from home
Through the dark we tiptoe
The hospital looms
As we walk the fleet road

Hold your tongue
Swallow your venom
You're too young
Hold your tongue

No push and no shove
Spit your verbal mace
Hate can turn to love
Not for this human race

Hold your tongue
Swallow your venom
You're too young
Hold your tongue
Hold your tongue
Swallow your venom
You're too young
Hold your tongue

My heart
Will explode
As we walk
The fleet roadEmbed
