This House Is Full of Noise Lyrics
Baby don't go and lose it again
You would always run
Out of the sun and into the rain
This house just creeps, it won't let you sleep
All that noise, there in your brain
Won't give you peace

It says I won't let you go
Where there's rivers or townfolk
I won't let you see
Cause you're safe here, safe here with me

Baby, don't go and love him again
You will always leap
Into a fire, into a flame
This house just aches, to keep you safe
You're in every single thing
You're in the walls, you're in the space

It says I won't let you go
Where there's rivers or townfolk
I won't let you see
Cause you're safe here, safe here with me
It says I won't let you go
Where there's rivers or townfolk
I won't let you see
Cause you're safe here, safe here with me

Don't let your friends know you can't pay your debts
Don't let your friends know you can't pay your debts
Don't let your friends know you can't pay your debts
Don't let your friends know you can't pay your debts
Don't let your friends know...1Embed
