For the Money Lyrics
Here's where the wind leaves its mark across your face
And the ocean knows more than we'll ever know
Wake from our sleep, we are crippled but unique
A cat in a bag meets the undertow

Make to the fields that are neighbouring your town
Take all that you can carry
Play with the fire and let the money burn
It only bought a lack of sincerity

Who's gonna make us better
If we won't believe there are things left to say?
And who's gonna take away the slaughter
And put us to bed at the end of the day?

Here's where the wind leaves its mark across your face
A perfect place to fall on your sword
Keep your hands to yourself, overestimate your wealth
Don't touch what you can't afford

Who's gonna make us better
If we won't believe there are things left to say?
We watch as the dust settles around us
Now put us to bed at the end of the day
And everyone says
One for the money
Two for the money
Three for the money
Four for the money
Five for the money
Six for the money
Seven for the money
Eight for the moneyEmbed
