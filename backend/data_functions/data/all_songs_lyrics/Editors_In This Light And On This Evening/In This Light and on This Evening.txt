In This Light and on This Evening Lyrics
I swear to god
I heard the earth inhale
Moments before
It spat its rain down on me
I swear to god
In this light and on this evening
London's become
The most beautiful thing I've seen

I swear to god
I heard the earth inhale
Moments before
It spat its rain down on me
I swear to god
In this light and on this evening
London's become
The most beautiful thing I've seen

I swear to god
I heard the earth inhale
Moments before
It spat its rain down on me
I swear to god
In this light and on this evening
London's become
The most beautiful thing I've seenEmbed
