Bricks and Mortar Lyrics
No one understands
The way you found your god
There's a bullet in your hand
Give a dog a bone
He'll eat for the day
But teach him how to kill then

I am the coast defence
I am the city wall
Stealing pounds and pence from you all
Still no one understands
The way you found your god
There's a bullet in your hand

Pour salt water on the wound
Pour salt water on the wound
This home is more than bricks and mortar
Pour salt water on the wound
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

When the boy's older
He'll have the arms of a soldier
Those arms will never hold her again
It's just like I told you
When the boy's older
He's gonna be a soldier for them
Pour salt water on the wound
Pour salt water on the wound
This home is more than bricks and mortar
Pour salt water on the wound

I hope life is good for you
I hope life is good for you
I hope life is good for you
I hope life is good for you
Ohhhhhhhhhh!Embed
