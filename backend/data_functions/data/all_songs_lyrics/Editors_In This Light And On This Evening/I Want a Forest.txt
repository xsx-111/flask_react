I Want a Forest Lyrics
There's blood in the sky
It bleeds from the land
Behind those eyes
Diamonds turn to sand
Such a beautiful fall
I saw the surface break
The water's so cold
Your body shakes

On a stormy day, the clouds move
Too fast to see
The shapes they make or how they wrap
Our little world right up, oh

I'm in your garden
But I want a forest
I'm in God's garden
I'll make it a forest, I'll make it a forest

You cut your ideas
In your own way
The silly little plans
The games you play
You try to make me lose faith
We're all made that way
There's a diamond in the rough
There's a needle in the hay
On a stormy day, the clouds move
Too fast to see
The shapes they make or how they wrap
Our little world right up, oh

I'm in your garden
But I want a forest
I'm in God's garden
I'll make it a forest, I'll make it a forest
I'm in your garden
But I want a forest
I'm in God's garden
I'll make it a forest, I'll make it a forestEmbed
