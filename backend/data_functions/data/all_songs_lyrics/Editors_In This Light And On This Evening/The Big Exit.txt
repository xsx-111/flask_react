The Big Exit Lyrics
Eyes permeate my skin
An alcoholic din
Fills the room we're in
Girl, I think it's time we leave
Like a thief on Christmas Eve
Take and you shall receive

No need to ask, you already know
The way I feel inside

Once we're out amongst the shadows
See how much our love grows
Reflected in shop windows
I love you as my blood flows
As the rain ruins my best clothes
You're a secret only I know

No need to ask, you already know
The way I feel inside
No need to ask, you already know
The way I feel inside
Damn the passing hours
Damn the summer flowers
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours

No need to ask, you already know
The way I feel inside
No need to ask, you already know
The way I feel inside

They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours
They took what once was ours

No need to ask, you already know
The way I feel inside
No need to ask, you already know
The way I feel insideEmbed
