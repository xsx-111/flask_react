These Streets Are Still Home to Me (Version 1) Lyrics
I like it when you cry
You can see how much you care
Addiction fills the streets
Well these streets are still home to me

If this was easy what a way we degrade
Temptation and angels we are meant to fade

I don't believe in fate and I don't believe in god
But I do believe in love and I believe in what we have

If this is easy what a way we degrade
Temptation and angels we are meant to fade
If this is easy what a way we degrade
Welcome home friend there is light in the shadeEmbed
