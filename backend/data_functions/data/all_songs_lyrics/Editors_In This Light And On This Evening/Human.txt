Human Lyrics
Girl, you did this to yourself
I wish your good heart and good health
Once, your ships were coming in
Now your hands have shed their final skin

Scratching in the dark, in the dark with no remark
And you're human yet
Searching for belief, with the grit in your teeth
And you're human yet

Babe, you did this to yourself
I wish your good heart and good health
Once, your ships were coming in
Now your hands have shed their final skin

Scratching in the dark, in the dark with no remark
And you're human yet
Searching for belief, with the grit in your teeth
And you're human yet
Scratching in the dark, in the dark with no remark
And you're human yet
Searching for belief, with the grit in your teeth
And you're human yet
A human yet
Human yet
Human yetEmbed
