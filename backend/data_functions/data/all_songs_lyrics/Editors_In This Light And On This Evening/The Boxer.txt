The Boxer Lyrics
A bruised full moon play-fights with the stars
This place is our prison, its cells are the bars
So take me to town, I want to dance with the city
Show me something ugly and show me something pretty

Damn this place
Makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face
By the count of three

An unwanted son pulls rank in the sky
The boxer isn't finished, he's not ready to die
I'm attracted to the light, I am attracted to the heat
It's a violent night, there are boxers in the streets

Damn this place
Makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face
By the count of three

Damn this place
Makes a boy out of me
The ring meets my face
I'm a fallen oak tree
Dazed in the final count
Dazed in the final count
I'm dazed in the final count
Dazed in the final countEmbed
