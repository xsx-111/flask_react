Heartbreaker Lyrics
I heard she broke your heart again
So now you're going to come and see me
We're back to the start again
When's she going to set me free?
I've been there time and time again
The girl's no good for me and you, she hurts me too

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker
I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker

Well, now that girl may have friends in the business
And great qualities that I have yet to see
But in my eyes, she's done us wrong enough times
For you to side with me

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker
I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break her
Heartbreaker, I'll break herEmbed
