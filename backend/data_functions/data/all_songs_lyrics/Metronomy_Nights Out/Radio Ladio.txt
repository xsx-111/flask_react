Radio Ladio Lyrics
See that girl?
She's taking my breath away
Yeah, what's her name?
She's taking my breath away

Hey, young girl
You're taking my breath away
So, what's your name?
You're taking my breath away

What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name?

Her name is
R-A-D-I-Ohhhh, L-A-D-I-Ohhhh
R-A-D-I-Ohhhh, L-A-D-I-Ohhhh
R-A-D-I-Ohhhh, L-A-D-I-OhhhhEmbed
