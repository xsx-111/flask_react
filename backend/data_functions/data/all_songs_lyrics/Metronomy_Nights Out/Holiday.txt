Holiday Lyrics
I've been watching my money
Saving up for a holiday
A week in Paris, a trip to Rome
I can't afford to go on my own

So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen

I've prepared my bikini
Prepared for my holiday
We won't go to Paris
It's full of things you like too much
We won't go to Germany
It's full of girls that you like to touch
We won't go to Paris
It's full of things you like too much
We won't go to Germany
It's full of girls that you like to touch

So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen1Embed
