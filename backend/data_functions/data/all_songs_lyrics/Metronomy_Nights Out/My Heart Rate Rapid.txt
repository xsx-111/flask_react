My Heart Rate Rapid Lyrics
When's she gonna do right, my friend?
When's she gonna do right?
When's she gonna do right my friend?
What's she gonna do right?

Those who doubt it, sure, I've got it
I'm gonna tell her with my heart rate rapid

It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love

Those who doubt it, sure, I've got it
I'm gonna tell her with my heart rate rapid

It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love

When's she gonna do right, my friend?
When's she gonna do right?
When's she gonna do right my friend?
What's she gonna do right?
Those who doubt it, sure, I've got it
I'm gonna tell her with my heart rate rapid

It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love


It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love, it might be love
It might be love1Embed
