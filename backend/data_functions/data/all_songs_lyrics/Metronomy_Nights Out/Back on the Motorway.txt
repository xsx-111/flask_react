Back on the Motorway Lyrics
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover

I went and messed around with her heart
So now she's run off with my car
But I can't live without her and it's so hard to take
So I've set out to find her, I'm back on the motorway.

At this wheel, I drive the earth for her
Every carriageway, a mile for her
These five gears and wheels could drive to her
But this carriageway can't take me there

Driving at ninety miles per hour
It's hard to know what's coming
Then on the horizon something makes me brake
I can see my darling ahead on the motorway.

I can see us lying on the bonnet of a Chevrolet
So why's my baby lying at the side of the motorway?
I wish that I had never said the things that I told her today
'Cause now she's left me crying on the shoulder of the motorway
At this wheel, I drive the earth for her
Every carriageway, a mile for her
These five gears and wheels could drive to her
But this carriageway can't take me there

We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your lover
We are never going to go with your loverEmbed
