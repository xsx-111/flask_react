On Dancefloors Lyrics
Hearing is getting me down
Is getting me down to the disco floor
Hearing is wearing me down
It's wearing me down from my ears
All those evenings spent disappointed on dancefloors
I'll add to now and learn one day

I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this than you

Sometimes I'll put up with it, alright
But I can't even dance the way I might
Were it just me and you tonight

I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this than you3Embed
