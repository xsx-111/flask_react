There at the Top Lyrics
She's independent
She's a modern woman
She needs no prompting
On her should 'n' shouldn't
It's always bosses
Who wish that she wouldn't
Files in the cabinet so neatly numerical
Makes all the clients so neatly alphabetical

Turn of 21
She's looking at her map (looking at her map)
And looking at her watch (looking at her watch)
Bags on the rack (bags on the rack)
Seems like she's there
Seems like she's there at the top
Seems like she's there at the top

There for her service
Comfy red Granada
Up to the Midlands
With a taped Sinatra
Plans all the hotels
And airway charter
Found under covers with some representative
The deal is effected but still only tentative
Turn of 21
She's looking at her map (looking at her map)
And looking at her watch (looking at her watch)
Bags on the rack (bags on the rack)
Seems like she's there
Seems like she's there at the top
Seems like she's there at the top


Shorthands a letter
Heading on the paper
Slimline her lunchbreak
Will it ever make her
Slender and modern
So all the men will take her
Back to the mirror in the Empress Hotel
Where the businessman smiles and the object is sell

Turn of 21
She's looking at her map (looking at her map)
And looking at her watch (looking at her watch)
Bags on the rack (bags on the rack)
Seems like she's there
Seems like she's there at the top
Seems like she's there at the top
There at the top
There at the top
There at the top
There at the top
There at the top
There at the top
There at the topEmbed
