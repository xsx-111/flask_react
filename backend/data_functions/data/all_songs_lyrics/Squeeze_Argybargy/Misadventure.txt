Misadventure Lyrics
Hitched a hiker up above the border
She'd spent some time in Morocco and Gibraltar
And stole my wallet with a picture of my missus
With fond remembrance of everything with kisses

From the Isle of Dogs to the Egyptian sands
Where the Arabs chew on dates
And I haven't forgot what it's like to be
With misadventure and her mates
Misadventure and her mates

I miss the East End high up on the Khyber
And I'm the target for a dozen rebel snipers
It's not so bad though, with some beers in the freezer
And something fancy in the air-conditioned sleeper

From the Isle of Dogs to the Egyptian sands
Where the Arabs chew on dates
And I haven't forgot what it's like to be
With misadventure and her mates
Misadventure and her mates
In moving carpets through the customs at Dover
Thinking my journey was going to be over
Then they discovered a shipment of Moroccan
And said excuse me sir, there's something you've forgotten

From the Isle of Dogs to the Egyptian sands
Where the Arabs chew on dates
And I haven't forgot what it's like to be
With misadventure and her mates
Behind prison walls and gatesEmbed
