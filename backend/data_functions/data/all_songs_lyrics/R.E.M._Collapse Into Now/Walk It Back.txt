Walk It Back LyricsWalk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
What
What would you
Have had me say
Instead of what I said?
Where
Where would I go
How could I follow that
Except to do what I did
Which is to
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... Walk it back
Time
Reverse and rewind
Erase and revise
And try to start again
You
Don't you turn this around
I have not touch the ground
In I don't know how long
You say to
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Time
Time
Time, it cannot abide
You
You can't turn away
You've asked me to stay
But something needs to change
Why can't you?

Walk it back
Hmmm... Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Walk it back
Hmmm... Walk it backEmbed
