Blue LyricsYellow circus left the stakes of broken ropes, useless mud
The ties that bind, ha ha
I can be bad poet
Street poet, shit poet
Kind poet too
Subway, almost 4AM
Halloween night
Had enough to drink to make my own party
All my fellow riders in half costume, half asleep
Half silly, gone to seed
I don't mark my time with dates, holidays, fate, wisdom, luck, karma, or whatever's
Convenient. I am made by my times
I am a creation of now
Shaken with the cracks and crevices
I'm not giving up easy
I will not fold
I don't have much
But what I have is gold
(I saw your face)
I sing in platinum, I dress in brass (Good, lifting snow)
I eat a zinc. Let it pass
Compare a toast. I like that
I understand courage (Ever lifting smoke)
I still roll with the shout of a cab driver's attitude today
I try to see outside myself
I understand the eyes
Excuse all the highs
Sorry, I am sorry. Ha ha
(Boy of the moon)
I like you, love you, every coast of you (I'm not your face)
I've seen your eddies and tides and hurricanes and cyclones
Low ebb tide and high, full moon
Up close and distant, I read you
Like the sky, the sea, the ocean, the sun, the moon
Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue
Naked and blue (Naked and blue)
Breathing with you. Touch. Change. Shift. Allow air. Window open. Drift. Drift away. Into now (Revenge you)
I want Whitman proud. Patti Lee proud. My brothers proud
My sisters proud. I want me. I want it all. I want sensational. Irresistible
This is my time and I am thrilled to be alive
Living. Blessed. I understand
Twentieth century, collapse, into now
Cinderella boy, you've lost your shoe
Cinderella boy, your coach awaits
A sun makes shadows all over your face
As you sit naked and blue into meEmbed
