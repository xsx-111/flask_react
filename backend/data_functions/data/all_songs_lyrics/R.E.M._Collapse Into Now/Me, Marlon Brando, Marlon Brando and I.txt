Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I LyricsWe live and dream about the future
Please ask Neil I need to pow-wow, now
Sift through the annals of our flavored times
Our heroes and all their fatal flaws
Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I, sing
Lay me down down down down
Lay me down down down down down
Help me off to sleep
Take me deep again
We live and dream about our heroes
I listened closely, and I said
"I'm not sure where to place myself here, friend
I might pawn the gold rings instead."
The winners write the rule books
The histories and lullabies
Lay me down down down down
Lay me down down down down down
Help me off to sleep
(down, down, down)
Take me deep again
(down, down, down)
I heard what you said
(down, down, down)
I picture brass rings in your head
(take me down, down, down)
While golden and bronze are... bon bons
(down, down, down)
Brass is mixed with leadEmbed
