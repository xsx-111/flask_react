That Someone Is You LyricsWith the restraint
Of New Order covers
Young Marble Giants
I sat... quietly, waiting...
For someone else to make the first move
Someone else to make the first move
That someone is you
That someone is you!!!
That someone has pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me...
And with the fury lock of Sharon Stone Casino
Scarface, Al Pacino, '74 Torino. I need
Someone else to make the first move
Someone else to make the first move
That someone is you
That someone is you
That someone has pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pulled me up and out of me...
You
Pull me up and out of cartoon quicksand
Pull me up and out of meEmbed
