All the Best Lyrics
So over me
So pie in my face
So talk to me
Tell me where to place this
In my Quasimodo heart
That's where I slipped and fell
I rang the church bell 'til my ears bled
Red blood cells

I think
I'll sing and rhyme
I'll give it one more time
I'll show the kids how to do it
Fine, fine fine

I hold the mirror up
You tell me what is what
You tell me which part of my story, baby, stuck stuck stuck
I'm in a part of your dreams
That you don't even understand
It's just like me to overstay my welcome, man

Let's sing and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it
Fine fine, fine
Fine
I just had to get that off my chest
Now it's time to get on with the rest
All the best, all the best
All the best, all the best, best, best
It's just like me to overstay
My welcome, bless

Let's sing and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it
Fine fine, fine
Let's sing and rhyme
Let's give it one more time
Let's show the kids how to do it
Fine fine, fine
FineEmbed
