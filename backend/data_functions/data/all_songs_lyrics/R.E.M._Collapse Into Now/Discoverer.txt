Discoverer Lyrics
Hey baby
This is not a challenge
It just means that I love you
As much as I always said I did
I was wrong
I have been laughable wrong
Sandpaper, paper mâché, chalk
And hung out wet
Oh the city and your skin now
Na-na na-na, na-na
I didn't have to be afraid
I didn't have to feel so stupid
I can see myself
I can feel

That just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was
Let's all get on with it now

Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Laughing!
Discoverer!
Floating across Houston
This is where I am
I see the city rise up tall
The opportunities
And possibilities
I have never felt so called
Remember that vodka espresso night of discovery
Remember that?
Laughing
Discovery
Oh how I look back and reflect
How I felt it
How it set
I don't have to feel so wrong
Now I wake up dreaming saffron, turmeric, and brass

That just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was
Let's all get on with it now

That just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was
Let's all get on with it now
Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Discoverer!
Discoverer!
