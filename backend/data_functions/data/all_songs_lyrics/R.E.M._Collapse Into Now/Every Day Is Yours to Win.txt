Every Day Is Yours to Win LyricsWith the walk and the talk
And the tick tock clock
With the rock and the roll
And the bridge and the toll
With the brilliance and the light
And the stink and the fight
And the road ahead of you
I cannot tell a lie
It's not all cherry pie
But it's all there waiting for you, yeah you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, I know
With the warp and the wooze
And the subterfuge
Does it all look bitter and blue?
Well i'm nothing but confused
With nothing left to lose
And if you buy that, i've got a bridge, for you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, I know
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, I know
Every day is new again
Every day is yours to win
And that's how heroes are made
I wanted to win
So I said it again;
That's how heroes are made
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, I know
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, I knowEmbed
