Mine Smell Like Honey LyricsI would dare you but I know I don't need to
You're going to do just what you want to
You're going to take the leading chair at the fairground
You're going to sing the praises of your fruit
Mine smell like honey uhh
Mine smell like honey uhh
Mine smell like huh huh huh huh
Honey uhh
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper
Track a trail of honey through it all
If the end comes faster than we had expected
And predictions lead us to the final fall
If the flowers crack the grain, the weave, the patterns of the pavement
I can hear you shouting over it all
Mine smell like honey uhh
Mine smell like honey uhh
Mine smell like huh huh huh huh huh huh huh
Honey uhh
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper
Track a trail of honey through it all
Dig a hole, dig it deeper, deeper
Climb a mountain, climb it steeper, steeper
Dig a hole! Dig it deeper, deeper
Track a trail of honey through it all
You track a trail of honey through it all
You track a trail of honeyEmbed
