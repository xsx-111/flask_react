It Happened Today Lyrics
This is not a parable
This is a terrible
This is a terrible thing
Yes I will rhyme that after
After all I've done today
I have earned my wings

It happened today, hooray hooray
It happened, hip hip hooray

We'll leave the allegory
To another Bible story
Out of deference, defiance and choice
And close in on a promise after
After all I've done today
I have earned my voice

It happened today, hooray hooray
It happened, hip hip hoorayEmbed
