Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter LyricsI feel like an alligator
Climbing up the escalator
Climbing up the escalator, I feel strong
I feel like an aviator, pilot 
I'm feeling violent 
Turn up and fly it, beat
HEY, HEY, ALLIGATOR YOU HAVE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
I HAVE GOT, HAVE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
I FEEL LIKE AN AUTOPILOT
I'm heroic STRONG AND SILENT
I FEEL LIKE A RAGE COMING UNDER MY HOOD
I FEEL GOOD AND CALM LIKE A ROBOT WOULD
I feel like an autopilot
I feel like an autopilot
I am not a hater hater hater hater hater
HEY, HEY, ALLIGATOR YOU HAVE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
I HAVE GOT, HAVE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
[I feel like a contradiction
I'm a walking science fiction
I don't know which way to turn
I have got a lot to burn!
I got a lot a lot to burn!]
IF I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY YOU STARED AT ME
IF I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY YOU STARED AT ME!
I COULD KNOCK YOU SIDEWAYS
I could knock you blind
I could show your found to the lost and find
I am not an agitator
I feel like an alligator
Climbing up the escalator
HEY, HEY, ALLIGATOR YOU HAVE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
I HAVE GOT, HAVE GOT A LOT TO LEARN
