Crazy Girl LyricsWhen I met you
You were sexy
You were freaky
I thought my luck was in
Then I noticed
You were crazy
I did not know what to do
Cos I thought it was love
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
What we had now its gone
I want something that you cannot give
Somewhere where the sun will shine
Why must we be so imcompatible
Freaky cos I thougt I was in love
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky) Kind of special in so many ways
What we had now its gone
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
What we had now its gone
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
Crazy Girl (Freaky)
