Do Your Thing (Album Mix) Lyrics
I don't need no TV
I don't need no news
All I need is a bumpin' beat
To bump away my blues

I don't give a damn what the people say
I'm gonna do it my way, gonna do it my way
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, ba-bang, bang, bang)
I'm gonna let it all out and do my thing
Boom, boom, boom and a-bang, bang, bang
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang

Do your thing
Do your thing
Make my body sing
Do your thing
Do your thing
Your thing, my thing
Oh, oh, oh, oh

(Because it's new thing, new swing)
(New thing, new swing)
(New thing, new thing, new thing, oh)
Say, shut your mouth!
You're in a fateful tiz
Free the mayhem in your mind
Release the need inside of you
You're gonna suffer
Because the crowd's so loud
Do your thing, do your thing
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, ba-bang, bang, bang)
I'm gonna let it all out and do my thing
Boom, boom, boom and a-bang, bang, bang
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang

Do your thing
Do your thing
Make my body sing
Do your thing
Do your thing
Your thing, my thing
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Boom, boom, boom and a-bang, bang, bang
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang
Boom, boom, boom and a-bang, bang, bang
Do your thing, do your thing
Boom, boom, boom and a-bang, bang, bang
Boom, bang, boom, bang, bang
Boom, boom, boom and a-bang, bang, bang
Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing
Do your thing
Do your thing
Make my body sing
Do your thing
Do your thing
Do your thing
Your thing, my thing
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
