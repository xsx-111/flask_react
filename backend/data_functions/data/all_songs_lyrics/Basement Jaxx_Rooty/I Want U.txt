I Want U LyricsI don't know if I can give you anything to make you feel right
I can but try 'cos I can't stand the madness in my head
The whole night through
I've been thinking, I've been sinking
Lost on Mars, got no paddle
Not a super-catch, ain't no model
Hardly seem to count, I'm just an ordinary bod
Down di di...
I want you and everything you say just makes me want
You and every single day I just want
You in every single way and I just want
You and I'm just lost
I don't know if I can give you anything to make you feel right
I can but try 'cos I can't stand the madness in my head
The whole night through
I've been thinking, I've been sinking
Lost on Mars, got no paddle
Not a super-catch, ain't no model
Hardly seem to count, I'm just an ordinary bod
Down di di...
I want you and everything you say just makes me want
You and every single day I just want
You in every single way and I just want
You and I'm just lostEmbed
