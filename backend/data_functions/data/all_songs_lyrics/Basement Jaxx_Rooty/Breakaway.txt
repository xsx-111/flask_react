I, I've got to break away
Cause no one out there listens to a single word I say
I, I've got to break away
Cause no one out there listens to a single word I say
I, I've gotta get away
I'm living the same old shit each and every damn day
I, I've gotta get away
I'm living the same old shit each and every damn day
I'm on fire, and I've got to, got to..break out
Breakout
I've had enough of this, got to break it through
I, I've got to break away
Cause no one out there listens to a single word I say
I, I've got to break away
Cause no one out there listens to a single word I say
I, I've gotta get away
I'm living the same old shit each and every damn day
I, I've gotta get away
I'm living the same old shit each and every damn day
Got to leave all this trouble, living life on the double
And my mind's going mad in emotional muddle
Can't see, can't think, all trapped in a bubble
All I want is to...break out...
Break out, break out
And you can't put me out
I've had enough of this, gotta break it through...Embed
