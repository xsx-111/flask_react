Get Me Off LyricsGive your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
I want to undress you
Wanna caress you (wanna caress you)
Don't wanna be coy (coy hoy)
It's time to get me off
I want to undress you
Wanna caress you (wanna caress you)
Don't wanna be coy (coy hoy)
It's time to get me off
Come on baby, thrust me, trust me, get me off
You're my poison and I cannot get enough
Come on baby, thrust me, trust me, get me off
You're my poison and I cannot get enough
Get me off
Get me off (get me off!)
Get me off (games, games, get me off!)
Get me off (get me off!)
Get me off
Get me off (get me off!)
You got to get me off!
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
I want to undress you
Wanna caress you (wanna caress you)
Don't wanna be coy (coy hoy)
It's time to get me off
I want to undress you
Wanna caress you (wanna caress you)
Don't wanna be coy
It's time to get me off
Come on baby, thrust me, trust me, get me off
You're my poison and I cannot get enough (take it)
Come on baby, thrust me, trust me, get me off
You're my poison and I cannot get enough
Get me off
Get me off (get me off!)
Get me off (games, games, get me off!)
Get me off (get me off!)
Get me off
Get me off (get me off!)
You got to get me off!
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
(Take-take it, take it)
(Take-take it, take it)
(Get me off, so good)
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body with me
The music's pumpin' and I wish you'd do the same to me
I (come on, you know you can do it, you know you wanna do it)
You're so freaky, treat me, make me come
Oh baby, baby, please (give your body to me)
You got to get me off
(Get me off)
Get me off
Get me off
Get me off
You got to get me off
(Get me off)
You got to get me off
You got to get me off
You got to...
Give your body to me
Give your body to me
Let your body be free, free
Your body, your body
It's time to get me offEmbed
