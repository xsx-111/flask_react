Broken Dreams LyricsI'll tell you how my day has been
How the sun has caught my face
How I lull myself to sleep
Waving shadows on my face
Chasing dreams that just passed by
Broken dreams, I'm just too late
Chasing dreams that just passed by
Broken dreams, I'm just too late
Chasing dreams, chasing dreams, chasing dreams
Chasing... chasing. (broken dreams)
Chasing dreams, chasing dreams, chasing dreams
Chasing... ( oh oh ) chasing. (broken dreams)
If only you could keep me warm
If only you could keep me from harm
If only you could
Chasing dreams that just passed by
Broken dreams, I'm just too late
Chasing dreams that just passed by
Broken dreams, I'm just too late
Chasing dreams, chasing dreams, chasing dreams
Chasing... chasing. (broken dreams)
Chasing dreams, chasing dreams, chasing dreams
Chasing... ( oh oh ) chasing. (broken dreams)
