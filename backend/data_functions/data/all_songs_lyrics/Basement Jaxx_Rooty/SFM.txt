She's a funky feline machine
Crazy cat inside your dream
She's a honey, she sting like a bee
You're the punk and she's the queen
She's and angel she's a dove
With a taste for a villain's blood
Packin heat, struttin on the street
Chew you up an make you meat
Sexy feline machine
She's a sexy feline machine
You can't stop her
Ya ya ya ya ya
She's a sexy feline machine
Crazy cat inside your dream
She's a honey, she sting like a bee
You're the punk and she's the queen
Sexy feline machine
She's a sexy feline machine
Everything is not as it seems
You can't stop her
Sexy feline machine
She's a sexy feline machine
You can't stop her
Ya ya ya ya yaEmbed
