Romeo Lyrics
You keep on giving me the hold up, (Hold up)
You know I wish you'd make your mind up. (Mind up)
Cuz when we get it on, you're so-so (So-so)
You used to be my Romeo. (Woa oh ay oh)
Cuz you see my dear, I have, had enough
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
You're neurotic like a yo-yo, (Yo-yo)
You used to be my Romeo (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go
You used to be my Romeo

You keep on giving me the hold up. (Hold up)
You know I wish you'd make your mind up, (Mind up)
Cuz when we get it on you're so-so. (So-so)
You used to be my Romeo (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Cuz you see my dear, I have, had enough
Of keeping quiet about all this stuff
You're neurotic like a yo-yo
Oh you used to be my Romeo
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
You used to be my Romeo
Let it go oh oh oh
Let it all go
Cuz you left me laying there
With a broken heart
Staring though a deep cold void
Alone in the dark
And I miss the warmth in the morning
And the laughter when I can't stop yawning
But the tears on the pillow have dried my dear
Gonna let it all go cuz I have no fear

(Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)
Let it all go (Woa-oh-ya-oh)

Let it all go
My Romeo
You used to be my Romeo
You used to be my Romeo
You used to be my Romeo
You used to be my Romeo
You used to be my Romeo
Let it goEmbed
