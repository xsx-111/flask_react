Seems Like a Lifetime Ago (Part One) LyricsNow that the summer life is gone
Memories grow dim
Slide out of sight
Well it, seems like a lifetime
Since that April day
Innocent sin
Adolescent delight
Time in its cold hearted way
Leaves us pleading
But hears our helpless cries
Then with a tear for impression
I urge you back to my side
Maybe somehow you'll need me
But you'll never know why
Love came to melt the winter snow
But it seems like a lifetime agoEmbed
