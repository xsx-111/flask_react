Adios a la Pasada (Goodbye to the Past) LyricsWhat a complex thing it is to live
To trust enough to continue giving
Or believing in love
When passion is not tempered by logic
And ambition is not balanced by gratitude
The truth is obscured
In this age of instantly cured
Which values nothing of value
And puts the price on what it is
Which is priceless
What it is, is this
Is what it is
You and I exist
Therefore we are becoming
Here we are in this precisely now
How amazing is this life
Say goodbye to the guilt
Leave the past behind
Leave the pain with the past
Lighten up the cross
It's a long journey ahead
You are innocent victims
Of circumstance and coincidence
Be gentle with yourselves
Forgive yourselves
Release yourselves from the past
Wow
What a wonder is this life
Here we are in this precisely now
What a wonder is this lifeEmbed
