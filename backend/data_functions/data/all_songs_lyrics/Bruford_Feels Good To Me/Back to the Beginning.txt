Back to the Beginning LyricsCome and get it
Rise and shine
This prison door is fabric
All in the mind
Nature, who made the lock
Always loosely defined the key
No use in running
Wounded and lame
Shotgun ready
Load, and take aim
Whatever the TV said
Forget it
Or better just think about
A way to grow old
Racing engine
Temperature high
Temptation fills you
And you know you comply
I'd fight addictions grip
But I'm losing the will to try
Don't know who's winning
Don't know who cares
Come back and ask me
In seventy years
Imagine, one simple step, oblivion!
Consider - the devil!
Or the deep blue sea
Slavery's a state of mind
Got little to do with chains
It creeps up close
And lies in wait
To anaesthetise your brains
No use making the same mistakes
For ever and ever amen
When we're caught in a circle
We can't stop spinning
Back to the beginning again
Early morning, crack of dawn
One moments peace
Before the gathering storm
No man can rest assured
When his dreaming is cracked and torn
Time slips
Leaves fall
Death comes
Stand tall
Delivered or so you think
But angels stand watching
While devils come close for the kill
Devils sing quotations
From eve to early morn
Demons use statistics
To juggle from horn to horn
So don't quote me examples
Of your progress through the years
When you're caught in a circle
And you can't stop spinning
Back to the beginning again
No use making the same mistakes
For ever and ever amen
Caught in a circle
And you can't stop spinning
Back to the beginning againEmbed
