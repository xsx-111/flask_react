Out Of Control Lyrics
Hot damn
Never dreamed a man could know such speed
Never had a chance to fill my need
It's just what I always wanted
To be the last of a dying breed
Said I thought I had my number down
I'd seen every scene to hit this town
Looks like no one wants to tell you
When something like this comes around

There they go, everyone's going
Everyone's gone this time
There they go, everyone's going
Don't you get left behind
Looks like it's gonna explode
Looks like it's gonna explode
Looks like it's gonna go totally out of control

Look out
I ain't never seen such chaos before
I ain't got no point of reference no more
And when I get my trip together
I'll be making a rush for the door
Doesn't anybody here know the rules
Hasn't anybody gotten through school
And the more I hear the answers
The more that I feel like a fool
Here I go, everyone's going
Everyone's gone this time
Here I go, everyone's going
Don't you get left behind
I think I'm gonna explode
I think I'm gonna explode
I think I'm gonna go totally out of control


Here I go, everyone's going
Everyone's gone this time
Whoa here I go, everyone's going
Don't you get left behind
Yeah, everyone's going
Everyone's gone this time
I think I'm gonna explode
I think I'm gonna explode
I think I'm gonna go totally out of control

Totally out of control
Yes I"m out of control
Totally out of control
I"m going out of control
Totally out of control
Completely out of control
Totally out of control
I know I"m out of control
Totally out of control
I must've lost my control
Totally out of control
I'm oh so out of control
Totally out of control
Yeah I"m out of control
Totally out of control
Yes I"m out of control
Totally out of control
I"m out of control...Embed
