Lucky Guy Lyrics
Some people don't seem real at all
Unafraid of any mountain
Sure that the gods won't let him fall
Should he fall, he will always get up again

And if he's hurt, he never shows it
If he's wrong, nobody knows it
Seems like he never has to try
He just must be a lucky guy
Yeah, oh, ooh-ooh-ooh


And when there's pain, he never minds it
When it's lost, he always finds it
Nobody really knows just why
He just must be a lucky guy
I wish I was that lucky guyEmbed
