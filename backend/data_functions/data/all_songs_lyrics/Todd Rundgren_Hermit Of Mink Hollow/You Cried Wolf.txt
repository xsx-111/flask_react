You Cried Wolf Lyrics
You cried wolf once too often
You cried wolf, you made me run
You cried wolf, I caught you bluffing
You'll cry wolf but I'll be gone

If you need someone to love
You only had to ask
Instead you pulled a false alarm
Baby, just for a laugh
You can have your little joke
But when they see what you've done
You will holler for assistance and nobody will come

You cried wolf once too often
You cried wolf, you made me run
You cried wolf, I caught you bluffing
You'll cry wolf but I'll be gone

You can threaten me forever
With the same old song
But you can toy with my emotions
Baby, only so long
'Cause the very next time
I see you talk through your hat
You will get no more attention, I can promise you that
Because you cried wolf once too often
You cried wolf, you made me run
You cried wolf, I caught you bluffing
You'll cry wolf but I'll be gone
I'll be gone


You cried wolf
You cried wolf
Hey, you cried wolf
Yeah, you cried wolf
Baby baby you cried wolf (once too often)
You know, you know you cried wolf (once too often)
I said you cried wolf (once too often)
You cried wolf, darling you cried wolf (once too often)
You cried wolf, yeah you cried wolf (once too often)
You cried wolf, you cried wolf (once too often)
Woo hoo (once too often)
Woo hoo (once too often)
Woo hoo hoo (once too often)
You cried wolfEmbed
