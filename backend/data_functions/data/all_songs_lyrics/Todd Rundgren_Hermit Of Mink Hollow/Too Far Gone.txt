Too Far Gone Lyrics
Why don't you write your mother
Why don't you call your family
They're expecting an answer
Spare them your strange behavior
What of your expectations
Weren't you going to show us all
Some new kind of dancer
This season's singing savior

I'm too far gone, and it's no use pretending
I could ever forget what I done
I'm already too far gone
I got no bridges left to burn
It's better to keep moving on
It's such a long way down, too far to fall
Too much trouble to turn back around

Think of your friends and neighbors
Suffering through your lamest years
You must owe them something
Come now, you must remember
Haven't you finished playing
Get down to business soon
Because your lean years are coming
June now, but come December

I'm too far gone, and it's no use pretending
I could ever forget what I done
I'm already too far gone
I got no bridges left to burn
It's better to keep moving on
It's such a long way down, too far to fall
Too much trouble to turn back around
I'm too far gone, and it's no use pretending
I could ever forget what I done
I'm already too far gone
I got no bridges left to burn
It's better to keep moving on
It's such a long way down, too far to fall
Too much trouble to turn back aroundEmbed
