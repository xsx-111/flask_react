Determination Lyrics
Girl the last time I saw you, you were crying my name
When I put you on the spot, will you still feel the same

Show me some determination
Show me, show me the measure of your dedication
I need to see just a reflection of your inspiration
Don't you break down on me, don't you break down on me

I'm looking for someone, someone strong enough to believe in
Everybody's looking for someone strong enough to stand on his feet
And never break down

I'll put my life on the line and believe what you say
I'll go out on a limb if you meet me halfway

Show me some determination
Show me, show me the measure of your dedication
Let me see just a reflection of your inspiration
Don't you break down on me, don't you break down on me

I'm looking for someone to show me what they mean by devotion
Everybody's looking for someone prepared to put aside his emotion
And never break down
And you're a new wave raver and you like to talk tough
But can you still cut the mustard when the going gets rough

Show me some determination
Show me, show the measure of your dedication
I need to see just a reflection of your inspiration
Don't you break down on me, don't you break down on me

Give me an indication of your determination
I need a demonstration of your determination
Give me an indication of your determination
I need a demonstration
Yeah, oh oh oh

Determination
You've got to show me, show me the measure of your dedication
I need to see, I need to see just a reflection of your inspiration
Don't you break down on me, don't you break down on me

Three days in the rain and I ain't had no sleep
But I won't break down now, I got a promise to keep
Showing my determination, 'cause that's the way I am
Showing the measure of my dedication
Just a reflection of my inspiration
Don't you break down on me, don't you break down on meEmbed
