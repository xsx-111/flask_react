Hurting For You Lyrics
Yesterday
I just saw the one you left behind, yesterday
I could tell that he was hurting for you
Sad, but he can't deny it
There was nothing else he could do
He was one of the many struck by it

Hurting for you
Finished before it started
It's the only thing left to do
'Cause the last of the broken-hearted
Is hurting for you

Day to day
That's how you should learn to live your life, day to day
Put aside those dreams that keep hurting for you
Don't let the pain remind you
There is nothing else you can do
Better not ever let the day find you

Hurting for you
Finished before it started
It's the only thing left to do
'Cause the last of the broken-hearted
Is hurting for you
Sympathy
I don't want to sound like what I feel seems like pity at all
Destiny
But in the great design of life we are all so pitifully small
Yeah


The last of the broken-hearted is
Hurting for you
Sad but I can't deny it
There was nothing else I could do
I was one of the many struck by it
Hurting for you
Don't let the pain remind you
There is nothing else that you can do
Better not ever let the day find you
Hurting for you
Finished before it started
It's the only thing that's left to do
'Cause the last of the broken-hearted
Is hurting for youEmbed
