I Believe It LyricsOh Lord
Ah, you know I believe it
To my soul
Ah, to my soul
To my soul
Oh Lord
Yeah, I believe it in the mornin’
Oh, so early in the mornin’
And I believe it in the evenin’
Oh, so late in the evenin’
From Friday night through to Sunday morn
When the sun comes up until the first sight of dawn
Oh, Lord
Take me higher
Oh, take me higher Lord
Take me higher
Oh, come on now Lord
Jesus died for my sins
Lord, look at the state I’m in
Look alright, but I’m fucked within
Can’t go through this all again
Lord – Jesus
Gotta help me
Find my way
Find my wayEmbed
