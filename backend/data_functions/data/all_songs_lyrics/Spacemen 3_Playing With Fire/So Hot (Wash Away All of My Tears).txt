So Hot (Wash Away All of My Tears) LyricsLord, it's so hot
And I ain't got a lot
I don't need much but I ain't satisfied right now
Just want the water, I just want an ocean
An endless river to wash away all of my tears
Lord, it's so hot
And my heart's bleeding
I ain't been with you and it's you I'm needing right now
Just want the water, I just want an ocean
An endless river to wash away all of my tears
When you're hot, and Lord how it's steaming
You've gotta go back to the river, babe
I just want the water, I just want an ocean
An endless river to take me back to my babe
So hot
So hot
So hotEmbed
