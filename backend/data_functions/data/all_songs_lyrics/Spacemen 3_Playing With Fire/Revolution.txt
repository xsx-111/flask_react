Revolution LyricsWell, I'm sick, I'm so sick
Of a lot of people trying to tell me
What I can't or can't do
With my life
And I'm tired, I'm so tired
Of a lot of people in a lot of high places
Who don't want you and me
To enjoy ourselves
Well I'm through with people
Who can't get up their ass
To help themselves change this government
And better society
So hold on a second
I smell burnin'
And I see a change
Comin'
Round
The bend
And I suggest to you
That it takes
Just five seconds
Just five seconds
Of decision
To realize
That the time
Is right
To start thinkin' about
A little
