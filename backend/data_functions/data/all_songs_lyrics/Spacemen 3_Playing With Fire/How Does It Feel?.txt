How Does It Feel? LyricsWhen I saw you, you looked so surprised
And the oceans flowed through your blue-grey eyes
And I stood and gazed through hot summer days
So tell me, how do you feel?
Well, I dream of you the whole night through
And I don't even shut my eyes
Because what I see is pure heaven to me
So tell me, are you for real?
We could make love and live as one
And burn our fingers on the sun
But I have seen what love denies
I've drunk the teardrops from her eyes
We could make love and live as one
And burn our fingers on the sun
We could make love and live as one
And burn our fingers on the sun
So tell me, how does it feel?
So tell me, how does it feel?
So tell me, how does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Tell me, how does it feel?
Well, tell me, how does it feel?Embed
