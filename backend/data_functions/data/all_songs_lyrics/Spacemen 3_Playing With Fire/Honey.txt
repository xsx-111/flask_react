Honey LyricsHoney, won't you take me home tonight?
Honey, won't you take me home tonight?
Honey, won't you take me home tonight?
The night is warm and the stars are bright
Take my hand, baby, hold me tight
Every move gonna feel so right
See the moon smiling through the night
I feel so good and my mood is right
Oh, honey, won't you take me home tonight?
Honey, won't you take me home tonight?
Feels so right, feels so right
Honey, won't you take me home tonight?
Feels so right, feels so right
Listen to the wind whistling through
Surely ain't nothin' that we can't do
Surely ain't nothin' that we can't doEmbed
