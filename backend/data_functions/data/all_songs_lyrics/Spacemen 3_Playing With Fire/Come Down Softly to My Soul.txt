Come Down Softly to My Soul LyricsHeaven, come softly down to my side
Oh girl, you make me feel like I am so alive
I feel, feel just like I'm in heaven
And I know, Lord, that this feeling it has just begun
Come down softly to my soul
Heaven, won't you stay with me for all time
Oh girl, stay within me and be always mine
Feels, feels just like I'm in heaven
And I know, Lord, that this feeling has just begun
Come down softly to my soulEmbed
