Lord, Can You Hear Me? LyricsLord, help me out
I'd take my life, but I'm in doubt
Just where my soul will lie
Deep in the Earth or way up in the sky
Lord, can you hear me when I call?
Lord, can you hear me when I call?
Lord, can you hear me when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, hear me at all?
All, all my lovers left my side
Can't get enough of life to keep me satisfied
Oh, I've lost about everything
Lord, look what state I am in
Lord, can you hear me when I call?
Lord, can you hear me when I call?
Lord, can you hear me when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, hear me at all?2Embed
