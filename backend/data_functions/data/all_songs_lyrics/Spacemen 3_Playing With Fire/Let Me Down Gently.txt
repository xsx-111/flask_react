Let Me Down Gently LyricsDarlin'
If you find your love
Ever startin' to fade
Let me down gently, honey
Ever so gently
And maybe, just maybe, and it's only a maybe
Well, maybe I won't feel a thing
Darlin', oh darlin'
I feel so fine with you
Though it's not been easy, it's true
And you know, I've nothin' to gain
But honey, if I had the chance, you know
I'd do it all againEmbed
