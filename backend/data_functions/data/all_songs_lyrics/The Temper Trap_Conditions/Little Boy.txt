Little Boy LyricsI was a little boy
But I grew up too fast in the world
I had my favourite toys
But I grew up way too fast in the world
I was a little boy
I met a little boy
But I'm so tight in a hole
He had his favourite toys
And all the weight of the world
I knew this little boy
I was a little boy
But I grew up too fast in the world
I had my favourite toys
But I grew up way too fast in the world
I was a little boy
Ooooh
I was a little boy
But I grew up too fast in the world
I had my favourite toys
But I grew up way too fast in the world
I was a little boy
I was a little boyEmbed
