Fader Lyrics
I'm in transit
Floating, stranded on this boat
And I pledge my self allegiance
To a better night's sleep at home
And the sweet, sweet sun's comin' down hard
The sun's comin' down hard, it burns the bones
So hold a hand for cover, hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm

Woo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Talk, don't change a thing
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh
Oh, it's fading, fader
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Words don't sink, they swims
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh
Oh, it's fading, fader

Bless this mess
We tried our best, that's all that we can do
While the angels walk with the lonely ones
In the cold rain to rescue you
And this fable world's comin' down hard
The wall's comin' down hard on all our homes
So hold a hand for cover, hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Talk, don't change a thing
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh
Oh, it's fading, fader
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Words don't sink, they swims
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh
Oh, it's fading, fader


Woo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Talk, don't change a thing
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh
Oh, it's fading, fader (I'm in transit)
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh, oo-ooh
Words don't sink, they swims
(Ah, sweet as a moment, be that it may)
Woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh, woo-oo-oo-ooh
Oh, it's fading, fader

(I'm in transit)
Oh, it's fading, fader (Ah, sweet as a moment, be that it may)
Oh, it's fading, fader
Oh, it's fading, fader4Embed
