Down River Lyrics
Finally we have seen some things
Some awfully nice, some dreadfully bad
But we will sing, wash the blood off our knees
'Cause our love breaks through rough seas, our ship will sail
And I don't understand how this world would work
'Cause time will tell us nothing
I'll take a chance on something

(Feeling old, feelings this time take you)
Down river, down river, down river, down
(Walk these stairs, put the pieces back together)
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop now, go

Finally, we have seen some things
But bells in your hallways don't move you in the right place
So we will sing, cast our hopes out to sea
Though our hearts break, through violent winds, our ship will sail
And I don't understand how this world would work
'Cause time will tell us nothing
I'll take a chance on something

(Feeling old, feelings this time take you)
Down river, down river, down river, down
(Walk these stairs, put the pieces back together)
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop now, go
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop now, go
Go, don't stop
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop
Go, don't stop, go, don't stop now, go1Embed
