Resurrection Lyrics
In the cold stone walls
House where the bleeding did fall
A mother is crying outside
In the darkest of hours
Left with her perilous thoughts
They circle to squeeze dry her soul

She said, "Lord, I'mma lose my baby
Lord, I'mma lose my way
If living means I'm dead here
Come hurry and resurrect me"

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

When the sun goes down
Into another night's arms
We're babies in a scavenger's glimpse
Then a neon cross shines
And shows us to tread on the low
Of guilt trips while love grips the blind
I said, "Lord, I'mma lose my head here
Lord, I'mma lose my way
If pushing means I'm stuck here
Come hurry, and resurrect me"

I'mma drop my head before I'm ready to stop
I'mma drop my head before I'm ready to stop
I'mma dig that grave and fall in line for the chop
Before I'm ready to stop, if I'm ready or not
I'mma drop my head before I'm ready to stop
I'mma drop my head before I'm ready to stop
I'mma ride my time before they throw out the clock
Charge my blood by the hour and make me pay for the talk

I said, "Lord, we gonna lose our heads here
Lord, we gonna lose our way"

I'mma dig that grave
I'mma dig that grave
Baby, blow this scene, hang our boots up to lean
And die until the resurrection of the things we believe
I'mma dig that graveEmbed
