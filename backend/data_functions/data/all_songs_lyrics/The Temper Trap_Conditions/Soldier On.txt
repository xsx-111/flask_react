Soldier On Lyrics
Who wants to know?
All that is gold is rusting
No one will know
When seasons cease to change, and
How far we've gone
How far we're going
It's the here and the now
And the love for the sound
Of the moments that keep us moving

Waves crash along
The battered, lonely lighthouse
Tomorrow she's gone
And if not, someday, somehow
Are these hands a waste?
Well, this side of mortality is
Scaring me to death
To death

Don't think about it at all
Just keep your head low
Don't think about it at all
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Soldier on, soldier on
Keep your heart close to the ground
Soldier on, soldier on
Keep your heart close to the ground

Don't think about it at all
Just keep your head low
Don't think about it at all

Yeah, will you take me tonight?
Yeah, will you take me tonight?
Yeah, oh
Yeah, will you take me tonight?
Oh, oh, oh, tonight


Soldier on, soldier on
Keep your heart close to the ground5Embed
