Hearts LyricsOh well it's ok to think so
But don't leave it sitting
Don't stand infront of the headlights
And you know what I mean
You think you're just like the rest of them
All you're days are for living
You might be waiting a while
So might aswell do some dying

Never Never go back
A Never never go again
Never Never go back
A Never Never go again
Never Never go back
A Never never go again
Never Never go back
A Never never go again
Oh well it's ok to think so
But don't leave it sitting
Don't stand infront of the headlights
And you know what I mean
You think you're just like the rest of them
All you're days are for living
You might be waiting a while
So might aswell do some dying
Was-Ting
Wat-Ching
On small screens
Oh I see you coulda been
Eyes so open
And when you see it walking in the distance
Don't stop nothing
Don't stop for me
You're slowly dying
For absolutely nothing
So say nothing
This will pull your hearts
So Cold sooo
This will pull your hearts
So cold sooo
Sooooo Cooold your hearts
So cold soo ColdEmbed
