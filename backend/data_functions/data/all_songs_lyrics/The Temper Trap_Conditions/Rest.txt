Rest Lyrics
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Bereaved lady
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
Cut you like a stone and left your side
Stop
Stop

Ooh, baby
Slow, steady
Heaven's waiting
For you, baby
Ooh, baby
Ooh, baby
He took your soul and left you out to dry
Stop

Now, you're home feet at last
And the cracking whip that howled and scarred your back
Has stopped
Ooh, ooh, it stopped
Ahh, baby
Ahh, baby
Love, baby
Your
Your only crime
Ooh, baby
Stop
Ooh, ooh, ooh, stopEmbed
