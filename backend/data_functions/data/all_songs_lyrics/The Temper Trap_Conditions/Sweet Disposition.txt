Sweet Disposition Lyrics
Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream aloud
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream aloud

So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream aloud
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream aloud
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
Won't stop 'til it's over
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
Won't stop 'til it's over
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
Won't stop 'til it's over
A moment, a love, a dream aloud
A moment, a love, a moment, a love
Won't stop to surrender44Embed
