Love Lost Lyrics
Our love was lost
But now we've found it
Our love was lost, oh, lost
And hope was gone
Our love was lost
But now we've found it
And if you flash your heart, oh, heart
I won't deny it

I promise
I promise

Your walls are up
Too cold to touch it
Your walls are up, oh, up
Too high to climb
I know it's hard
But I can still hear it beating
So if you flash your heart
I won't mistreat it

I promise
I promise
I promise
Our love was lost
In the rubble are all the things
That you've, you've been dreaming of
Keep me in mind
When you're ready
I am here to take you every time

Oh, our love was lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost
Our love was lost
But now it's found3Embed
