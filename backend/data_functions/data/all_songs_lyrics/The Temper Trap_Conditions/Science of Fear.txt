Science of Fear Lyrics
Brakes on, brakes on, the car is runnin' empty
Brakes on, brakes on, the car is runnin' empty
Downhill, head-on, this crash is comin' slowly
Downhill, head-on, this crash is comin' slowly

Move
Or watch the slow death of your way of life

There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And it keeps us here

My ears, my eyes, my brain is slowly bustin'
Black smoke, red sky, the television's sayin'
Downhill, head-on, another crash is comin'
Downhill, head-on, another crash is comin'

Move
Or watch the murder of you way of life
There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still
My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere, nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

Brakes on, brakes on
Brakes on, brakes on
Brakes on

There's a science to fear
It plagues my mind
And it keeps us right here
And the less we know
The more we sit still, sit still
My baby's stuck on a road
That leads to nowhere, nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere3Embed
