Fools Lyrics
Fools
They don't know what they're on about
Those fools
Don't get my dreams

And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it
All
You can't wait to watch me fall

High, high, high
Singin' stories on a wrecking ball
Colliding fast
To bring you down

If you want it, you want it, you want it
If you want it, you want it, you want it
All
Sometimes, things we build to fall

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it
All
And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it
And I want it, I want it, I want it
