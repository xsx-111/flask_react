If You Were There Lyrics
You're the one that makes my day a dream come true
Yet and still you wonder if I think of you
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not around
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound

If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

There's no need for you not to have faith in me
'Cause it's by your side girl that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way, no no

If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care
I care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
I care for you, baby

No no, there's no need for you not to have faith in me
'Cause it's by your side, girl, that I long to be
Yes, there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say, no no
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way

If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

I care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
I care for you, baby
You know I care for you
I care for you, baby, ooh
Care for you, baby
I swear I care for you
Care for you, babyEmbed
