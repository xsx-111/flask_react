You Walk Your Way Lyrics
You'd been dreaming away
But it's time to wake up
And find me gone
Oh, but don't get me wrong
And I'm drifting away
Tender years we thought would never end
Let's pray they'll come again

Well, after all this time it took for us to grow
(After all this time)
There's no sign of love right now you know
(After all this time)

So you walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)

'Cause I'm used to planning my days
But it's time I stopped including you
Don't you be blue
'Cause although I'm walking away
There's just one wish in mind to meet again
And we will, my friend
Said after all this time it took for us to grow
(After all this time)
There's no love between us, girl, you know
(After all this time)

So you walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
And I'll walk mine (I'll walk mine)

After all this time it took for us to grow
(After all this time)
There's no love between us, girl, you know
(After all this time)

So you walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
And I'll walk mine (I'll walk mine)

And we'll meet again (You walk your way)
We will my friend (I'll walk mine)
And things will be much better then
Oh (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
You walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
Oh, walk your way (You walk your way)
Let me walk mine (I'll walk mine)
Walk (You walk your way)
Oh (I'll walk mine)Embed
