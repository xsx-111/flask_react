Thorn LyricsI've got a thorn in my side
About the size of your eye
I feel it sticking through
I feel it sticking through
You're all watching me
With such intensity
It doesn't matter what I do
It doesn't matter what I do
Take your eyes off me
Maybe then you'll see
The world was staring at you
The world was watching you
You're just a thorn in my side
Wasting effort, wasting time
It doesn't matter what I do
It doesn't matter what I do
It doesn't matter what I do
Your world is dying too
(Well, my baby left me
Well, my baby left me
Yeah, she ran
That's right, she ran
Well, I got all the time in the stinking world
And a shotgun in my hand)Embed
