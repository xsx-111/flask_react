Let It Slide LyricsLet it slide
Let it slide
Let it slide
Let it slide
They can make it sound so nice
Everybody's got a price
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Give it away
Give it away
Give it away
Give it away
Nobody's here to stay
They own you to the grave
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Try to hide
Try to hide
Try to hide
Try to hide
Everybody's got a price
They can make it sound so nice
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Hell to pay
Hell to pay
Hell to pay
Hell to pay
They own you to the grave
Nobody's here to stay
Ho, ho, ho, ho1Embed
