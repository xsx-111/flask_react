Check-Out Time LyricsHe checked out
Gone for good
He checked out
Without a doubt
Like a regular guy
Like you or me
Unfinished business
His too small voice
Had died in his head
No one else could hear
When I told him loud and clear
It's check out time
It's check out time
He was always good
At following directions
He ran them out til the end of the road
He did what he was told
Step by Step
He never wanted to run
..Might be wrong
This voice he heard
The voice of a liar
He took it in his stride
Til they told him
It's check out time
Check out time
Check out time
Check out time
Check out timeEmbed
