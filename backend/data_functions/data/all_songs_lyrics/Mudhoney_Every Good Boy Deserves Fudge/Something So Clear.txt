Something So Clear LyricsGray skies feel so good today
Gray skies feel so good today
Bring me cold, cold rain
Clear the debris out of the way
Never thought something so clear
Never thought something so clear
Could hurt so bad
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming
Like a bird flying at a window
Didn't see it coming
Didn't see it coming
Like a bird dead out on the sidewalk
Never thought something so clear
Never thought something so clear
Could hurt so bad
There's a certain comfort in being confused
I find certain comfort in being confused
It's clear to me, and it's clear to you
No more confusion, we're through
Never thought something so clear
Never thought something so clear
Could hurt so badEmbed
