Shoot The Moon LyricsLooking for a life in the back of your mind
Looking so hard, you're going blind
Swear you tasted it, down the sun
Sooner or later, darkness will come
I've seen it
It's getting dark
It's getting dark
It's getting
On your high horse overlooking the plains
You're in a place where no one remains
Shoot the moon, it's already shot
It's coming for you or. are you gone?
I've seen it
It scares me
It scares you
It's so
Shoot the moon
What you got's been shot to hell
Shoot the moon
What you got's been shot to hell
Shoot the moon
What you got's been shot to hell
Can't keep on holding her
That's too fun
You know she's gone
She's no longer around
Can't keep on holding her
That's too fun
You know she's gone
She's no longer around
She's no longer around
No longer around
No longer around
No longer around
No longer around
No longer around
No longer around
No longer aroundEmbed
