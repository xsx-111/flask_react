Move Out LyricsA day is so long without
A day is so long within
Confounded, so crowded, move out
Move right along alone
Move right along, I've been
Surrounded, surrounded, move out
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
It isn't this way
Move out
Step from the right side
Move to the outside
Change all directions
Leave no reflections
Move out
Keep out the inside
Use the tricks you've tried
Which leave no reflection
And take all direction
Move out
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
It isn't this way
Move out
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
Time and time again
It isn't this wayEmbed
