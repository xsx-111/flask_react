Good Enough Lyrics
I've made mistakes
That I'm sure I'll make again
Guess I liked them enough
The first time around
No way to fight 'em
No use denying
The way it grows
Uh-huh

Whatever happens
Never thought for a second
That I'd let go
Uh-huh

Everybody says: "you must've lost your head"
Well, one more time is good enough for me
Yeah, one more time is good enough for me

It's a hard road to your heart
And there was a time when I never thought I'd get that far
Uh-huh
Everybody says: "you must've lost your head"
Well, one more time is good enough for me
Yeah, one more time is good enough for meEmbed
