Into the Drink LyricsYou're messing, baby, messing hard
Messing all the time
Messing, sugar, messing busy
You're messing in my mind
Well, I don't got what you want
And I don't care what you think
Better back off, back off, back off, baby
You'll get dumped into the drink
Into the drink
Into the drink
Into the drink
I don't need your judgment
And I don't believe your lies
I don't feel your lousy love
I got rights to exercise
But I don't got what you want
And I don't care what you think
Better back off, back off, back off, baby
You'll get dumped into the drink
Into the drink
Into the drink
Into the drink
Your useless piece of weaponry
Will never shoot me down
If I didn't do it, no one could
So waste another round
Well, I don't got what you want
And I don't care what you think
Better back off, back off, back off, baby
If you don't, into the drink
Into the drink
Into the drink
Into the drinkEmbed
