Broken Hands LyricsI could see you coming
From miles away
I didn't want it, no
No, not today
I could feel you coming
I felt so out of touch
Hanging on so tight for life
While the bones in your hand got crushed
How come I always know
When the worst is gonna come?
Sometimes it's so hard to know
When you can't change what's gonna come
How could they make you go?
How could they break your hands?
How come I always have to know
These things I can't stand?
I loved your fragile fingers
So thin, so smooth, so long
I lose my bank of memory
How did we ever get on?
I loved your fragile fingers
Oh, how they used to soothe me
I need to hear your play again
To smooth my hard feelings
How come they've made you go?
How come they broke your hands?
How come I always have to know?
How come I never understand?
I never understand
Oh, understandEmbed
