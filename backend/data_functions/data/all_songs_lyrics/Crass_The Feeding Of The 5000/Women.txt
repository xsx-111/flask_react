Women LyricsFuck is women's money
We pay with our bodies
There is no purity in our love
No beauty, just bribery
It's all the fucking same
We make soldiers with our submission
Wars with our isolation
Fuck is women's money
We pay with our bodies
There no purity in motherhood
No beauty, just bribery
It's all the fucking same
We are all slaves to sexual histories
Our awareness of whoredom can be release
War is men's money
They pay with their bodies
There is no purity in that game
Only blood, death and bribery
It's all the fucking same
But we've got the power
Don't just stand there and take submission on the strength of fear
Fight war, not warsEmbed
