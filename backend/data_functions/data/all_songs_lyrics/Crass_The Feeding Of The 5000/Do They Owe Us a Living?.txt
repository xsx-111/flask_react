Do They Owe Us a Living? LyricsFuck the politically minded, here's something I want to say
About the state of the nation, the way they treat us today
At school they give you shit, drop you in a pit
You try, you try, you try to get out, but you can't because they've fucked you about
Then you're a prime example of how they must not be
This is just a sample, what they've done to you and me

Do they owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they fucking do
They don't want me anymore, threw it on the floor
Used to call me sweet thing, I'm nobody's plaything
And now that I am different, love to bust my head
You'd love to see me cop out, love to see me dead

Do they owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they fucking do
The living that is owed to me, I'm never going to get
Buggered this whole world up, up to their necks in debt.
Give you a lobotomy for something you ain't done
Make you the epitome of everything that's wrong

Do they owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they fucking do
Don't take any notice of what the public thinks
So much on the TV, just don't want to think.
Used you as a target, they want to sell advice
When you don't want to hear it, say you're full of vice

Do they owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they do, course they do
Owe us a living?
Course they fucking doEmbed
