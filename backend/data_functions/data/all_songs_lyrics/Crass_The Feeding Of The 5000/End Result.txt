End Result LyricsI am a product
I am a symbol of endless, hopeless, fruitless, aimless games
I'm a glossy packages on the supermarket shelf
My contents aren't fit for human consumption
I could tragically injure your perfect health
My ingredients will seize up your body function
I'm the dirt that everyone walks on
I am the orphan nobody wants
I am the staircarpet everyone walks on
I am the leper nobody wants to touch...
Much
I am a sample
I am a scapegoat of useless, futureless, endless, mindless ideas
I'm a number on the paper you file away
I'm a portfolio you stick in the drawer
I'm the fool you try to scare when you say
"We know all about you, of that you can be sure"
Well, I don't want your crazy system
I don't want to be on your files
Your temptations I try to resist them
Cos I know what hides beneath your smiles, it's...
EST
I am a topic
I am subject a for useless, futureless, endless, mindless debates
You think up ways that you can hide
From the na√Øve eyes of your figurehead
But don't you find that it ain't easy?
Wouldn't you love to see me dead?
Your answer is to give me treatment
For crying out when you give me pain
Leave me with no possible remnant
You poke your knives into my brain, you send me...
Insane
I am an example
I'm no hero of the great, intelligent, magnificent human race
I'm part of the race that kills for possessions
Part of the race that's wiping itself out
I'm part of the race that's got crazy obsessions
Like locking people up, not letting them out
I hate the living dead and their work in factories
They go like sheep to their production lines
They live on illusions, don't face the realities
All they live for is that big blue sign, it says, it says Ford
I'm bored
Bored
