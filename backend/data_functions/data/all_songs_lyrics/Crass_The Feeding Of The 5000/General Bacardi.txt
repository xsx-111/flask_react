General Bacardi LyricsI've seen it all before
Revolution at my back door
Well who's to say it won't happen all again
'Cause the generals sip Bacardi, while the privates feel the pain
They talk from the screen and T.V. tube
They talk revolution like it's processed food
They talk of anarchy from music hall stages
Look for change in colour supplement pages
They think that by talking from some distant tower
That something might change in the structure of power
They dream, they dream, never walk on the street
They dream, they dream, never stand on their feet
I've seen it all before
Revolution at my back door
Well who's to say it won't happen all again
'Cause the generals sip Bacardi, while the privates feel the pain
Alternative values were a fucking con
They never really meant it when they said "Get it on"
They really meant, "Mine, that's mine", can't you see?
They stamped on our heads so that they could be free
They formed little groups, like rich man's ghettoes
Tending their goats and organic tomatoes
While the world was being fucked by fascist regimes
They talked of windmills and psychedelic dreams
I've seen it all before
Revolution at my back door
Well who's to say it won't happen all again
Cause the generals sip Bacardi, while the privates feel the painEmbed
