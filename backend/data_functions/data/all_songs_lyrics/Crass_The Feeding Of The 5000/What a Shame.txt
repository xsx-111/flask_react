What a Shame LyricsIt doesn't take much to bring you down
There are plenty of people standing round
They wait till you slacken off just a bit
Then they fill you up with passive bullshit
It's too good
It can't last
What a shame
Watch out for the quiet ones at the back
All they want is the smallest crack
Everything's happening down the front
Innocent bystander you're the biggest runt
Fuck the punks
Punks are fucked
It's too loud
Awful row
They can't play
They'll give up
In the end
What a shame
Oh, what a shame!
Oh, what a shame!
It's still the same
That's what you think
Watch out for the quiet ones at the back
All they want is the smallest crack
Everything's happening down the front
Innocent bystander you're the biggest runt
We all now
It's so bad
But we say so
What a shameEmbed
