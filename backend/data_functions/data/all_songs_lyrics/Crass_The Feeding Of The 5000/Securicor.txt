Securicor LyricsI'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I am working for Securicor
Take the money and come back for more
I want to do it cause I know I should
For the customer and the common good
I walk around with a big Alsatian
He'll re-arrange you with no provocation
And I'm the bugger who has got the lead
You'll have to be bright if you want to get at me
Securicor cares
Securicor cares
Securicor scares the shit out of you
Do you want to come closer?
I block the pavement with my club and hat
I deal in money that you can't get at
You want to use me 'cause I'm up for rent
Tough shit, 'cause I'm real busy
You ought to know me cause I've been a cop
Out at the army where I learned a lot
Some kids still chuckle when they see my van
But it's not all money sonny, you want to come closer?
Securicor cares
Securicor cares
Securicor scares the shit out of you
Do you want to come closer?
Do you want to come closer?
Well I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army
I'm a private in a private army2Embed
