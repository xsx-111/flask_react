So What LyricsThey ask me why I'm hateful, why I'm bad
They tell me I got things they never had
They tell me go to church and see the light
Cause' the good lord's always right
So what, so what?
So what if Jesus died on the cross?
So what about the fucker, I don't give a toss!
So what if the master walked on the water?
I don't see him trying to stop the slaughter!
They say I wouldn't have to live from bins
If I would go along, confess my sins
They say I shouldn't commit no crime
Cause' Jesus Christ is watching all the time
So what, so what?
So what if he's always over my shoulder?
I realise the truth as I get older
I get to see what a con it is
Because it's my life, mine not his
Well, they say they're going to send me away
Said that God'll make me pay
We're sorry but you got to go
But you were naughty, you said "No"
So what, so what?!
So what if I see through the lies?!
So what if the people I despise
Twist my arm and make me work
I'm no deaf, no fucking jerk!
I'm no spastic lying in the street!
I'm no superstar elite!
I'm just a person, a human being!
"No you're not, you're a part of the machine!"
"You're a part our machine because we want you to be!"
"We've got you now and you'll never be free!"
"We can even have your body after you're dead"
"We can take the eyes out of your fucking head"
"Yes we'll take them out, use them again"
"We can do it you know cos we've got your brain"
"We'll crucify you like they crucified him"
"We'll make you obey our every whim"
"We got the power, the power and the glory"
I've heard that before in a different story
But the story I heard covered up the truth
Didn't touch on the actual factual proof
Didn't say about the bodies in the concentration camps
Didn't say about the knives underneath the lamps
Doesn't say that the ovens are still warm
Doesn't say that this wretched little form
Is a human being who wants to live
But not in the snot and shit they give
They say that I had better keep quiet
Or they're gonna douse my light
Jesus Christ can't save my life
But I can always use my knife
So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?
So what?!Embed
