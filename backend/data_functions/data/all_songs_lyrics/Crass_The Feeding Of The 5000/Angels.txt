Angels LyricsThe angels are on TV tonight, grey puke, celluloid shit
The army have sent a mission to Ireland, just to see to it
Kojac is on the streets again, grey puke, fucking shit
The army say they seek peace in Ireland and they'll see to it
That they keep in line, horizontal hold
Keep in line, vertical hold
Keep in line, brightness
Keep in line, contrast
Keep in line, vision on
Coronation Street is on twice a week, grey puke, fucking shit
The army say they seek peace in Ireland and they'll see to it
The army are on the news report
Real wars, bullets, death
They're beating the fuck out of someone they caught just to see to it
That they keep in line, horizontal hold
Keep in line, vertical hold
Keep in line, contrast
Keep in line, brightness
Keep in line, vision offEmbed
