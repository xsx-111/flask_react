You Pay LyricsYou're paying for prisons
You're paying for war
You're paying for lobotomies
You're paying for law
You're paying for their order
You're paying for their murder
Paying for your ticket
To watch the farce
Knowing you've made you're contribution
To the system's fucked solution
To their political pollution
No chance of revolution
No chance of change
You've got no range
Don't just take it
Don't take their shit
Don't play their game
Don't take their blame
Use your head
Your turn instead
It's not apologise
It's not economize
It's not make do
It's not pull through
It's not take it
It's not make it
It's not just you
It's not madmen
It's not difficult
It's not behave
It's not, oh well, just this once
It's fucking impossible
It's fucking unbearable
It's fucking stupid
Fucking stupid1Embed
