Big Dipper Lyrics
Once, when I was little, someone pointed out to me
Some constellations, but the Big Dipper's all I could see
That Brontosaurus must have stood a thousand miles high
That Brontosaurus laying on its side, up in the sky

Bottoms up and this time, won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time, won't you rescue me?
You should have been here last night
And heard what the Big Dipper said to me

Jack thought it twice and thought that that had made it true
Some brains just work that way; that's what chemicals can do
He thought he'd have a beer; he thought he was alone
He thought an Albertson's stir fry dinner would make his apartment a home

Bottoms up and this time, won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time, won't you rescue me?
You should have been here last night
And heard what the Big Dipper said to me

I thought I bored me but I learned to think like you
Now, nothing bores me; that's that nothing is thought through
Why?
Why?
Bottoms up and this time, won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time, won't you rescue me?
Thought it up but this time, it's all I can see
You should have been here last night
And heard what the Big Dipper said1Embed
