The Source Lyrics
Morning comes and I'm up on time again
Upon getting up, I'm down on what I got up for
Boring, dumb, and fine
It's been a long time, my friend
And you haven't changed, neither have I
So why you want to bring that up?
I feel it started at the source

What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?

When you see a documentary and know the outcome and that it's fucked
You still hope Hitler will blow up
And that Kennedy will duck
I feel it starting at the source

What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?Embed
