Stab LyricsMake it a time, make it anytime
Make sure that it's not the only kind that others find
I've got a mind, I've got half a mind
To shut down the whole system at the spine with fishing line
I'm really glad there's a grasp to grab
It's only a stab in a wet paper bag, is that so bad?
I wrote a song, it was slow and long
I wrote the words and the music wrong but life goes on
And on and on and on and on and on and on...Embed
