Twin Falls Lyrics
Christmas, Twin Falls, Idaho
Is her oldest memory
She was only two
It's the first time she felt blue
Cafeteria, Harrison
Elementary
Beneath a parachute
I saw her without shoes
7 up, I touched her thumb
And she knew it was me
Although she couldn't see
Unless, of course, she peeked

My mom's good, she got me out of
Twin Falls, Idaho
Before I got too old
You know how that goes
That's where she still was the summer
She turned 17
In 1983
Three weeks after me
Last I heard was she had twins
Or maybe it was three
Though I've never seen
(Except for in my dreams/
But that don't bother me)2Embed
