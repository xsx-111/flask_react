Reasons Lyrics
Come through me
You arrive and I'm on fire
Subdue me
To explode that you inspired
So groovily
Second episode of all smiles
Let's make a movie
In the name of all great liars
Improvising, Kaufman style

They are all reasons to me
They are all reasons to be
They are all reasons to see
They are all reasons to me

How the hell do you do this?
Change the colors, shapes, and size
I'm clueless
Not one thing I recognize
So foolish
Every now's a big surprise
Help me to get through this
Stay with me until I die
There's nothing else I want to try
They are all reasons to me
They are all reasons to be
They are all reasons to see
They are all reasons to me
They are all reasons to me
They are all reasons to be
They are all reasons to see
They are all reasons to meEmbed
