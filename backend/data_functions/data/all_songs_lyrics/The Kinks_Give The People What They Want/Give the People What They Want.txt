Give the People What They Want LyricsHey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Give the people what they want
Well, it's been said before, the world is a stage
A different performance with every age
So open the history book to any old page
Bring on the lions and open the cage
Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please
The Roman promoters really did things right
They needed a show that would clearly excite
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight
Threw the Christians to the lions and sold out every night
Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please
Give 'em lots of sex, perversion and rape
Give 'em lots of violence and plenty to hate
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want, whoo
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
When Oswald shot Kennedy, he was insane
But still we watch the re-runs again and again
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim
"Hey Mom, there goes a piece of the president's brain!"
Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Blow out your brains and do it right
Make sure it's prime time and on a Saturday night
You gotta give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they wantEmbed
