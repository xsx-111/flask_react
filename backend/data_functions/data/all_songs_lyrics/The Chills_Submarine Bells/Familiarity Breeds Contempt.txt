Familiarity Breeds Contempt LyricsYou don't need to repeat it, repeat it
I hared it the first time time time
Well, you won't stop by
And tell me what the trouble is
I couldn't care less, ha ha, but my double does
And he told me we're both superseded
So why not drop by, burst my bubble for me
So simple to be cynical
Respond to things with ease
Once an attitudes selected
Then behavior is a breeze
They think they've got it covered
But they've got it all wrong
Hard people make hard times far worse
Not the reverse
It's the contemporary trap
They want to tell you where it's at
When the past is thought irrelevant
Our destiny's black
For they've limited themselves
To an urbanite perspective
And the build-up, rear-down
Press-gang acid attack
Familiarity breeds contempt
And suppresses attempts
Familiarity breeds contempt
Sour seeds grown into stifling creepers
Bitterness feeds on a drive alive
And now my heart bleeds
Familiarity breeds contempt
And a row of resentments
Familiarity breeds contempt
And I'm not exemptEmbed
