Part Past Part Fiction LyricsSitting in a foriegn setting
Bands in backgrounds always play
Their phoney lonely cacaphony
It didn't have to be this way
Some place alone, yeah yeah
And no one known, yeah yeah
So far from home here, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Oohh oohhh, ooohh
I really didn't choose to leave you
To tear myself away so long
To travel and unravel all the fabric we'd sewn
So now something's wrong
And the world we used to know has gone
Some place alone, yeah yeah
And no one known, yeah yeah
So far from home here, yeah yeah
Years of awkward confrontation
I'd like to set your mind at ease
But stuck here in these muddled ages
I find the words won't please
Where could we dwell
Within our past alive and well
Escape from all that's hard to bear
To where the child that you were creeps near, without fear
Scary things aren't always clear
To hide in fiction and nostalgia can be eerie too
You cannot drive and stare rearview
Oohh oohhh, ooohh
Some place alone, yeah yeah
And no one known, yeah yeah
So far from home here, yeah yeah, yeah yeahEmbed
