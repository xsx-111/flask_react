Heavenly Pop Hit LyricsEach evening the sun sets in five billion places
Seen by ten billion eyes set in five billion faces
Then they close in a daze and wait for the dawning
But the daylight and sunrise are brighter in our eyes
Where night cannot devour golden solar power
Once we were damned, now I guess we are angels
For we passed through the dark and eluded the dangers
Then awoke with a start to startling changes
All the tension is ended, the sentence suspended
And darkness now sparkles and gleams
And it all seems larger than life to me
I find it rather hard to believe
And so I stand and the sound goes straight through my body
I'm so bloated up, happy, I can throw things around me
And I'm growing in stages and have been for ages
Just singing and floating and free
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit if anyone wants it
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit
It's something that we're humming as we
Swoop low on trees or we sweep under carpets
We can dive into suns, though it's not recommended
We can hover silent and listen closely
It all seems larger than life to me
I find it hard to believe
So where was our home, well, our home was in tears
For its fruit had gone bad, they'd been that way for years
Yet their lives are elastic, they should be fantastic
They should be expanding
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit if anyone wants it
Oh (Dum dum, da de da da)
Dum de dum dum, dum de dum dum
It's a heavenly pop hit for anybody
Oh, for those that still want itEmbed
