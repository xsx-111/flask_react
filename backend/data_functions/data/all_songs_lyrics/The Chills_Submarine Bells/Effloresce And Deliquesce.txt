Effloresce And Deliquesce LyricsEffloresce and deliquesce, carefree sparkling effervesce
Sparks ignite the starry-eyed, soon a supernova
Effloresce and deliquesce
He bursts froth and then regrets
She brakes down and when he goes slowly ices over
Effloresce and deliquesce
She may weep but he knows best
Crystallize before his eyes
Tears can't conquer power
Now they're acting, watch this happening
Then undergo change to tease the other
Now they're fighting, this part's frightening
Lies are flying
The silence boiled over
Over-reaching
Se them trying
Counter-acting changes in each other
Other forces force them higher
Tears are scalding
Anger flows like fire
Effloresce and deliquesce
She burst forth and then regrets
He breaks down and when she goes slowly ices over
Effloresce and deliquesce
He is weary, needing rest
She is too but in an hour thy burst into flowerEmbed
