How Do You Do? LyricsI gotta listen to you
I gotta hear about the things
I should or shouldn't do
All about the deals I blew
How do you do
I shook a thousand hands
I met a man with master plans
And sweaty hands
Do you wanna be a rich man
How do you do
But then it's alright
The band was good and it was Saturday night
It was alright
And that's what matters
That really matters, sometimes that matters
The crowd went wild in that famous line
But then it's alright
The band was good and it was Saturday night
It was alright
That really matters, sometimes that matters
And then they sat me in a chair
Take this pen and put your name right there
This ensures that we take care of you
I gotta listen to you
I gotta hear about the things
I should or shouldn't do
All about the deals I blew
How do you do
I know about you
Who are you
What do you do
How do you doEmbed
