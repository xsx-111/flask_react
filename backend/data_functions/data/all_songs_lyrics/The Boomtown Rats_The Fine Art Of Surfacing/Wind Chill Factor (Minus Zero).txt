Wind Chill Factor (Minus Zero) Lyrics
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-hoo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-hoo)

I took a tube train through the subway systems
I rode those tunnels like a six-foot mole
I came back out and I was gasping for air
I made it to your place, I was praying you'd be home

We, we really shouldn't be alone tonight
Let's go to a movie where everybody fights
But in the end there's dancing, songs, and smiles
You need lots of smiles when it's

Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 below, there you go
Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 below, there you go

(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-hoo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-hoo)
It's one of those days where I don't like myself (Uh-huh?)
But I get along with myself okay (Okay?)
I'll slip beneath these sheets and shiver here awhile (Mm-hm, mm-hm)
I find this happening more frequently these days

Still, I practice nightly, I try to keep ahead
This art of surfacing is all but dead
But I keep coming up with time enough to breathe
I take what I need when it's

Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 below, there you go
Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 below, there you go

(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-hoo)
(Doo-doo-doo)
(Doo-doo-doo-hoo)

Do you agree (No)
With anything (No)
At all? (No)
Do you believe (No)
In anything (No)
At all? (No)
Oh-ho, oh-ho
You know when winter comes to visit these big cities (Doo-doo-doo)
And the wind starts howling through the elevator shafts? (Doo-doo-doo-hoo)
Well, our love is like one of those older, colder buildings (Doo-doo-doo)
My concrete's cracked, and I begin to feel the draught (Doo-doo-doo-hoo)

You start to laugh (No)
You say you've won (No)
It's just I lost (no)
That's not the same (no)
I hobble (No) to my corner and I'll view the (No) situation
And we'll settle (No) finally for some form of deep freeze (No) hibernation
And it's

Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 below, there you go
Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 below, there you go
Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 below
Wind chill factor minus zero
Wind chill factor minus 10 belowEmbed
