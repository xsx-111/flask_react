Keep It Up Lyrics
Oh, in her two pound coat, she really thinks she's cloaked in mystery
She's actin' like some character from Agatha Christie
I got a pain in my shoes and all I wanna do is dance

Uh-oh, I can remember those carefully sharpened eyeballs
Sparkling like bloodshot diamonds in the snowfall
She always said she thinks she knows where things are roughly at
Well maybe she does, but then she says

Does it feel nice? Does it feel right? Does it feel alright?
Does it feel good? Quite nice
Can you keep it up? Can you keep it up, upright?
Does it let you down? "I heard it let you down" Sometimes

Snap me in your breach, I want to be your bullet
I want a little kiss that's gonna take my breath away
And every lover tries to do things in a different way
Ah-hey-hey-hey

Does it feel nice? Does it feel right? Does it feel alright?
Does it feel good? Quite nice
Can you keep it up? Can you keep it up, upright?
Does it let you down? "I heard it let you down" Sometimes
Snap me in your breach, I want to be your bullet
I want a little kiss that's gonna take my breath away
And every lover tries to do things in a different way
But that's what they all say

Give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up

Does it feel nice? Does it feel right? Does it feel alright?
Does it feel good? Quite nice
Can you keep it up? Can you keep it up, upright?
But does it let you down? "I heard it let you down" Sometimes

(Does it feel nice?)
(Is it alright?)
(I heard it let you down) Sometimes
(Can you keep it up?) Quite nice
(I heard it's quite nice) Alright
(Is it alright?) Quite nice
(I heard it let you down)
Give it up!
(Can you keep it up?) Sometimes
(I heard it let you down) Alright
(Can you keep it up?) All night
(I heard it let you down) Quite nice
(Can you keep it up?)
(I heard it let you down)
(Can you keep it up?)
(I heard it let you down)
(Can you keep it up?)Embed
