When the Night Comes Lyrics
The offices are emptying their
Pale-faced wards into the street
Flickering their strip-light eyes
Shivering they readjust their lives from the air-conditioned heat
The humdrum and mundane
It's nearly driving them insane
You get hooked so quick to anything, even your chains
You're crouching in your corner till they open up your cage

(When the night comes) It'll help you disappear
(When the night comes) Forget about the day that brought you here

Frankie takes the train and makes it
Home in time to catch the evening news
Opening a can of beans, he learns the world has
Turned without much help from him
Hey Frank, why not get drunk tonight?
Hey Frankie, I think it'll be alright
You'll be too far gone to notice when the neighbors start complaining
They're used to it by now cause every day's the same

(And when the night comes) It'll help you disappear
(When the night comes) Forget about the day that brought you here
And when the night comes
He might get on the phone
Oh, she's a stuck-up bitch
But she lives on her own
Oh, and he heard her talking dirty to the girls the other day
And she knew that he had heard her and she looked "As if to say"
And then later up in marketing while going through the files
She bent a little too far down, then turned around and smiled
He got her number, he got the phone
He dialed the number, he heard the tone
He said "Tonight's the night that I've been waiting for
Oh, I know you've seen me worship you from afar
And I might tell you that I love you and I will but just for
Tonight" One night's alright (Tonight)
Just one night, just one night, just one night


In his three piece cunning camouflage
Nobody can guess what Frankie's thinking
Last night she said "I don't know if I'm drowning
Maybe it's because I'm sinking"
He said "It'll be okay
I'll get outta here one day"
And she said "Frankie, you're no different from any of the rest
They've nailed you to your table and chained you to your desk"
(And when the night comes) I'll help you disappear
(When the night comes) Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Forget it, forget it, forget about the day that brought you hereEmbed
