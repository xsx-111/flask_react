Real Different LyricsThe world at any time might take its own thalidomide
It's just one of those things
You see eternity fell out of love when we invented self-destruct
It was one of those things
Now you're walkin' in, you're walkin' out, you're steppin' in and steppin' round and it don't change a thing
These fools who have given you these mystical new points of view
That never meant a thing
Oh let's get drunk and watch the TV, a special's on tonight
I'll fill my pocket full of stones and I'll throw 'em at the light
'Cuz I stop and I think, well
It could be different
A new day but it's
No different
It's all changed, but it's
No different
So stop
And walk away-a-hey-hey, for more of the same
I don't wanna argue with ya, anyway the end result's always the same
It's just I tune into the never-never, everything will sing forever
Ain't it always the same
They're beamin' local hope out on the on the stero waves
Salvation's on the dial but a foot's in the grave
So you stop and think, well it's
Real different
It's not new but it
Seems different
It all changed well
What's the difference
Stop
And turn away
For more of the same
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-uwoh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-uwoh
It's the little things they do
That scare me so
Somethin' in their smile
That tells me things ain't kooooosher
I'm getting too different, I'm getting too dangerous
Doctor, what's the cure
Tonight's another set of rules, tonight is not like other nights
I'm almost sure
The doctor clicks his tongue with his real head case
And awaits the generator of rehabilitation
He stops and thinks well
This could be different
A new day but it's
No different
All changed but
It's not different
So stop
And turn away-hey-hey-hey
Maybe someday
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-uwoh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-uwoh (repeats)
It's no different
(doodoo, a-doodoo, a-doo-doo, a-doodoo, a-doot doot!)Embed
