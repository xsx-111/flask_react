Having My Picture Taken Lyrics
", fellas, watch the beardie."

My camera sees things my eyes can't see
I have it focused from here to eternity
Catch the moment, catch your breath, catch the light
Let me freeze your frame
Synchronize machine and brain
Hey, don't mind me, I'm having my picture taken (Having it taken)

I can choose each day who I want to be
And you can choose each day who you want to see
We'll pan the rounds and we'll scan the crowd
Of all those distant scenes
Immortalize a slice of time
But don't mind me, I'm having my picture taken

(Flash) Another instant in an instamatic
(Click) Another reflex set on automatic
(Snap) Another moment of the life dramatic
You really should have been there, it was so fantastic
(So fantastic, so fantastic)
Ooh, having my picture taken
Ooh, having my picture taken
Ooh, I'm having my picture taken
Ooh, having my picture taken (Having it taken)


(Flash) Another instant in an instamatic
(Click) Another reflex set on automatic
(Snap) Another moment of the life dramatic
You really should have been there, it was so fantastic
(So fantastic, so fantastic)

Ooh, I'm having my picture taken
Ooh, having my picture taken (Having my picture taken)
Ooh, I'm having my picture taken (Having my picture taken)
Ooh, having my picture taken (Having my picture taken)

"Oooh, magic, huh? Best I've ever done."Embed
