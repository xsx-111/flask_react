Diamond Smiles Lyrics
Traffic's wild tonight
Diamond smiles her cocktail smile
Tonight, she's in heavy disquise
She looks at her wrist to clock the passing time
Weather's mild tonight
She wonders, will they notice her eyes?
She wonders, will her glamour survive?
And can they see she's going down a third time?

Oh, everybody tries
It's Dale Carnegie gone wild
But Barbara Cartland's child
Long ago perfected the motionless glide
In the low voltage noise
Diamond seems so sure and so poised
She shimmers for the bright young boys
And says, "Love is for others, but me it destroys"

The girl in the cake
Jumped out too soon by mistake
Somebody said the whole thing's half baked
And Diamond lifts her glass and says "Cheers"
She stands to one side
There's no more to this than meets the eye
Everybody drinks Martini dry
And talks about clothes and the latest styles
Woah-oh-oh
They said she did it with grace
They said she did it with style
They said she did it all
They said, before she died
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I remember Diamond's smile

Nobody saw her go
They said they should have noticed 'cause her dress was cut so low
Well, it only goes to show, ha ha
How many real men any of us know
She went up the stairs
Stood up on the vanity chair
Tied her lame belt around the chandelier
And went out kicking at the perfumed air

Oh-oh-oh
They said she did it with grace
They said she did it with style
They said she did it all
They said, before she died
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I remember Diamond's smile
