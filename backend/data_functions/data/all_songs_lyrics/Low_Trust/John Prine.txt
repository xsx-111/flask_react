John Prine LyricsI verified the math
And double-checked the syntax
I tried to heal your body
But it just kept coming back
You never had a chance
I thought I was a poet
I had so much to say
But now I want to see the blood
I want to make them pay
Yeah, I can see the day
I made a place for children
They wanted all the answers
I gave them all my lectures
And now they're perfect dancers
'Cause I'm a perfect dancer
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la laEmbed
