Shots & Ladders LyricsThey're gonna build a ladder
It's gonna take you forever
You're always such a disaster
But all you hear is laughter
They want to keep you for more tests
Stick a needle in your chest
And send you home to your own bed
And kiss your beautiful forehead
See how you feel in the morningEmbed
