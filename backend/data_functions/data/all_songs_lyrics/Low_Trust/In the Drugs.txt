In the Drugs LyricsI was a child
I was on fire
But I stayed alive
While all else died
I held my breath
What could I say
And I closed my eyes
Like Marvin Gaye
But now I've had enough
It's in the drugs
It's in the drugs
It's in the drugs, ahhh
It's in the drugs
You had your plan
A heavy hand
But the weight was more
Than you could stand
Breaking like dolls
Singing like birds
We always get
What we deserve
But now I've had enough
It's in the drugs
It's in the drugs
It's in the drugs, ahhh
It's in the drugs
It's in the drugs1Embed
