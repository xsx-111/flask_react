Canada Lyrics

I'm not scared of waking up
I'm not afraid of getting cut
'Cause you can't take that stuff to Canada
No, you can't take it anywhere
You can't take it anywhere

You could la la la la la
You could la la la la
And you could lie to all your friends
You could lie to your friends
But you can't take that stuff to Canada
You can't take that stuff up there
No, you can't take it anywhere
You can't take it anywhere

I used to have a golden tongue
Used to have a golden tongue
But now the words just feel like stones
Yeah, the words feel like stones
'Cause you can't take that stuff to Canada
You can't take that stuff up there
You can't take it anywhere
You can't take it anywhereEmbed
