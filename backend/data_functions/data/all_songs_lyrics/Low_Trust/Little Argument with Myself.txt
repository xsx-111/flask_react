Little Argument with Myself LyricsI want to believe
Yes I want to believe
I want to believe
Yes I want to believe
Just keep counting the stars
Like someday you'll find out
Just how many there are
And we all can go home
'Cause there's nothing as sad
As a man on his back
Counting stars
But I want to believe
Yes I want to believe
'Cause there's nothing as sad
As a man on his back
Counting starsEmbed
