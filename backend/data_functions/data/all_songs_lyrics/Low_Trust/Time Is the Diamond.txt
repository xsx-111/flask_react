Time Is the Diamond Lyrics
If I'm not a lion
And I'm not an island
If time is the diamond
Well all right
Well all right
Well all right

Got a weak pair of lungs
From a childhood disease
Will it ever come clean
Well all right
All right
All right

Tried to learn from the past
Keep my fist in my mouth
But they just keep falling out
All right
Well all right
All right

If I'm not a lion
And I'm not an island
If time is the diamond
Well all right
Well all right
Well all right
All right
If I'm not a lion
And I'm not an island
If time is the diamond
Well all right
All right
Well all right
All right
All right
All right
All right
(All right)
Well all right1Embed
