La La La Song LyricsAll these years you've been speaking without breathing
Spinning closer to the sun
Had your way with an unsuspecting public
Little threads are all it takes
La, la, la
I have learned all your secrets, so familiar
I know where you lay your head
Fear of God and a disappointing father
Holds the hand around your neck
La, la, la
Sometimes I could just choke myself with laughter
Sometimes everything's so true
So when you come down from your death-defying labors
I'll still be in love with you
La, la, laEmbed
