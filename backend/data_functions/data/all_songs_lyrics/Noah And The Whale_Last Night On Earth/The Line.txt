The Line LyricsShe looks out her window
And the stars don't feel that far away
She watches the wind blow
Blowing all her problems away
But then she'll ask, as she cleans up the glass
"Is this the line?
Is this the line?
Is this the line between heaven and hell?
Is this the line where I get up and walk out?
Is this the line where you get drunk you yell?"
She fixes her make-up
Treading lightly on the floor
Hoping he won't wake up
As she makes her way towards the door
But then she'll say, as she waves him away
"Is this the line?
Is this the line?
Is this the line between heaven and hell?
Is this the line where I get up and walk out?
Is this the line where you get drunk you yell?"
She says "I've lived my life like a diamond
Bright and hard like a diamond"
She says "I've lived my life like a diamond
Bright and hard like a diamond"Embed
