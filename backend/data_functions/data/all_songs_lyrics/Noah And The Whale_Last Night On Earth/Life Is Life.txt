Life Is Life LyricsWell he used to be somebody
And now he's someone else
Took apart his old life
Left it on the shelf
Sick of being someone
He did not admire
Took up all his old things
Set em all on fire
He's gonna change
Gonna change his ways
Gonna change
Gonna change his ways
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
Left his house at midnight
Resolute and young
In search of something greater
Than the person he'd become
Threw his bags on to the back
Of his run down eighties car
Headed out to god knows where
The distance is too far
He's gonna change
Gonna change his ways
Gonna change
Gonna change his ways
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
(Your life is your life gotta live like it's your life)
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven
And it feels like his new life can start
And it feels like heaven4Embed
