Just Me Before We Met LyricsLooking through the photos you find in my drawer
Laughing so hard you're rolling around on the floor
At all the bad haircuts
And smoking cigarettes
The lustless romantic
Trying hard to impress
Well that's just me before we met
Well that's just me before we met
Putting down the photos, you look up at me
Enjoying the thought of the person that I used to be
The things I was proud of
The things I regret
Some things I remember
Some things I forget
Well that's just me before we met
Well that's just me before we met
But that's just me before we met
But that's just me before we met
Well I've always had a wild imagination
And it sees through your heart
Which I know can be, a wild combination
Like a flame forms from a spark
But don't be shy, be brave, little champion
It's better to live than to hide
Well that's just me before we met
Well that's just me before we met
But don't be shy, be brave, little champion
Well that's just me before we met
But don't be shy, be brave, little champion
Well that's just me before we met
But don't be shy, be brave, little champion
Well that's just me before we met
But don't be shy, be brave, little champion
Well that's just me before we met
But don't be shy, be brave, little champion
Well that's just me before we met
Well that's just me before we met
Well that's just me before we metEmbed
