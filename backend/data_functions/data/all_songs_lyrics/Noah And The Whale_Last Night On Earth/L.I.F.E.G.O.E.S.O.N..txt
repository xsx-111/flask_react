L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N. Lyrics
Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock'n'roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes that've seen it all
Working at a nightclub that was called "The Avenue"
The bar men used to call her "Little Lisa, Looney Tunes"
She went down on almost anyone
And from the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own way

Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home
Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
When chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal
And from the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own way

On my last night on Earth, I won't look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on Earth, I'll pay a high price
To have no regrets and be done with my life

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own way6Embed
