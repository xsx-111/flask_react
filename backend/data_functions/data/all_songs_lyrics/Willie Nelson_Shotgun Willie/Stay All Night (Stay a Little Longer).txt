Stay All Night (Stay a Little Longer) Lyrics
Can't go home if you're going by the mill
Cause the bridge's washed out
At the bottom of the hill
Big Creek's up Little Creek's level
Plow my corn with a double shovel

Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer

Sitting in the window singing to my love
Slop bucket fell from the window up above
Mule and the grasshopper eating ice cream
Mule got sick so they laid him on the beam

Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer

Well you ought to see my Blue Eyed Sally
She lives away down on Shinbone Alley
Number on the gate the number on the door
The next house over is the grocery store
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longer
Stay all night stay a little longer
Dance all night dance a little longer
Pull off your coat throw it in the corner
Don't see why you can't stay a little longerEmbed
