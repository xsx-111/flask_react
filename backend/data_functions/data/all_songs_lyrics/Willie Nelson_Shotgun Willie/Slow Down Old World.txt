Slow Down Old World Lyrics
Slow down slow down old world
There's no hurry cause
My life ain't mine anymore

I lived too fast
Now it's too late to worry
And I'm too blue to cry anymore
I once was a fool for the women
Now I'm just a fool nothing more

Slow down slow down old world
There's no hurry cause
My life ain't mine anymore

I once had a way with the women
Till one got away with my heart

Slow down slow down old world
There's no hurry cause
My life ain't mine anymoreEmbed
