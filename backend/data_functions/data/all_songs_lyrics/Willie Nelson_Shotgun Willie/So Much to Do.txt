So Much to Do Lyrics
My oatmeal tastes just like confetti
The coffee's too strong, so forget it
The toast is burning, well let it
There's just so much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone

My tie is lost, I can't find my sweater
There's the doorbell, I hope that's your letter
My head aches, I hope I feel better
There's just so much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone

So much to do since you've gone
Too much to do all alone
And time, time rolls on like a river
And oh there's so much to do
And I just can't do without you1Embed
