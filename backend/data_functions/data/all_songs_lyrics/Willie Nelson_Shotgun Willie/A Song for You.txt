A Song for You Lyrics
Well I've been a lot of places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages with ten thousand people watching
Now we're alone and I am singing my song for you

And I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
No one more important to me darling can't you please see through me
Now we're alone and I am singing my song for you

Well you taught me precious secrets of a truth with holding nothing
You came out in front but I was hiding
Now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
And I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over remember when we were together
Now we're alone and I am singing my song for youEmbed
