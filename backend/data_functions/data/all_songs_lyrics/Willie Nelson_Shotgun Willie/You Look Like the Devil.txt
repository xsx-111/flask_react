You Look Like the Devil Lyrics
You look like the devil in the morning you've been out a working through the night
Holding hands and kissing everybody I'm glad to say that you can't blow my mind

You look like the devil when you're crying I'm so glad that you feel so strong that way
You got a great big smile for everybody I'm so glad I've met you yesterday


You look like the devil in the morning you've been out a working through the night
Holding hands and kissing everybody I'm glad to say that you can't blow my mind


You look like the devil when you're crying I'm so glad that you feel so strong that way
You got a great big smile for everybody I'm so glad I've met you yesterday

I'm so glad I've met you yesterdayEmbed
