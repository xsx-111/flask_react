Saying Something LyricsLeaning on a rope that's the worst kind of holiday
Another melody line will take you miles away
I recognise the noise and the feeling of the drunken sway
I nearly fell down the stairs in the old fashioned way
I'm not saying I'm ready
I'm not saying it's here
But I haven't felt anything quite like this for a year
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
I'm hard to please
Yes I'm hard to please
And all that I could do was sit here watching you
Another brilliant view it's only rhythm of Blues
In spite of all the dangers I keep moving on
It was a brilliant line but for a different song
I'm not saying I'd do it
I'm not saying I won't
But when you tell me about how you always say that you do then you don't
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
I'm hard to please
Yes I'm hard to please
The fire in me still burns even through the snow
The fire in me won't go out, no
Times that we love all the heroes
Times that we leave all the weirdos
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
The fire in me still burns even through the snow
The fire in me won't go out, no
Times that we love all the heroes
Times that we leave all the weirdos
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
That's saying something, saying something
I'm hard to please
Yes I'm hard to pleaseEmbed
