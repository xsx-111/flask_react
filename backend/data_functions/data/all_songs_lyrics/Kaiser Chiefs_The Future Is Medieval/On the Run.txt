On the Run LyricsWho got hit and who hit first?
Who was bad and who got worse?
Who got caught up in the life? (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Who went down and who got higher?
Who ran back into the fire?
Who was really hypnotised? (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And if I didn't believe you then
Then I won't believe you now
And if I didn't believe you then
Then I don't believe you now
I'm on the run
I'm on the run
I'm on the run
We'll ride into the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Who was them and who was us?
Who stood up and robbed the bus?
Who is wrong and who decides? (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Who went left and who was right?
Who went out on a mischief night?
Who was really hypnotised? (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And if I didn't believe you then
Then I won't believe you now
And if I didn't believe you then
Then I don't believe you now
I'm on the run
I'm on the run
I'm on the run
We'll ride into the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm on the run
We'll ride into the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, I live for these moments, just like this one
Oh, I live for these moments, just like this one
Oh, I live for these moments
Oh, I live for these moments, just like this one
Oh, I live for these moments, just like this one
Oh, I live for these moments, just like this one
Oh, I live for these moments, just like this one
(I'm on the run)
(I'm on the run)
(I'm on the run)
(I'm on the run)Embed
