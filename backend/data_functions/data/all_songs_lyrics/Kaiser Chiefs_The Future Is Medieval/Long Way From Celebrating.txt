Long Way From Celebrating LyricsI'm only here trying to make a living
I need another midnight idea
Forty-five bottles lay abandoned
And my discount disappeared
Two lines written in the paper
And one of them is my name
I'm a long long way from celebrating
And it's never gonna be the same
Do I miss you?
I don't know
I just need something
For my soul
'Cos I'm a long long way from celebrating
Ever since I knew that you were crazy
You're like a human TV
Spending time with you is some challenge
With a reaction guaranteed
We'll all be home in time for tea and medals
And I could lick the pattern off a plate
I'm a long long way from celebrating
It's gonna be bitter sweet
Do I miss you?
I don't know
I just need something
For my soul
'Cos I'm a long long way from celebrating
Would I miss you?
Don't think so
Just gimme something
For my soul
'Cos I'm a long long way from celebratingEmbed
