Man on Mars LyricsPut a man on Mars today
It wasn't the first time
I've seen it all before
Took my hat off in the rain today
It wasn't the first time
I've seen it all before
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
All along
And the coffee is medicine
It's hard to remember
I've seen it all before
And the picture of the factory floor
Like rats in a suitcase
I've seen it all before
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
All along
Put a man on Mars today
It wasn't the future
I've seen it all before
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you
Trust you to know everything about me
All alongEmbed
