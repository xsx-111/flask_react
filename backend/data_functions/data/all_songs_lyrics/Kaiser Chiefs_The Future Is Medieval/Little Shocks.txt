Little Shocks Lyrics
I don't want much, I'm happy with what I've got
On the second floor, I pass a ruffian on the stairs
What the driver saw, through ï»¿the letter box of number four
I don't have much, it will be deafening when I do

And all these little shocks, I'll be riding my imaginary dynamo
I wish I could give you undivided attention
Every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could give you undivided attention
Every minute of the day but I can't

Bless my heart, and everything will be explained
In the diaries, especially the latter part
I'll be a somebody, I found an empty glass today at home
Give me ability, to knock the pen away from his hand

And all these little shocks, I'll be riding my imaginary dynamo
I wish I could give you undivided attention
Every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could give you undivided attention
Every minute of the day but I can't
I wish I could have you just a little bit more
Just a little bit more of your time
I wish I could give you undivided attention
Every minute of the day but I can'tEmbed
