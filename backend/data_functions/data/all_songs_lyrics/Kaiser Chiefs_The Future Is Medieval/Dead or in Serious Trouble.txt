Dead or in Serious Trouble LyricsHis photograph was taken in 1980 in New York on a subway train
He emerges days later, the sun in his eyes, and it started all over again
It spreads through the city like a hand-made virus and catching a glimpse of their lives
Beggars and bankers and flyboys and hookers all hang on together inside
He's either dead or in serious trouble, ah ah ah
He's either dead or in serious trouble, ah ah ah
Criminally minded and partially blinded, surviving on minimal sleep
Scars on his face and a stone in the place where his heart would previously beat
Travelling even faster in the wake of disaster and reaching at you from the bleak
Escaping and hiding or simply surviving, way down in the fluorescent deep
He's either dead or in serious trouble, ah ah ah
He's either dead or in serious trouble, ah ah ah ah ah
His photograph was taken in 1980 in New York on a subway train
Then he hit self-destruct with a battering ram and it started all over again
He's either dead or in serious trouble, ah ah ah
He's either dead or in serious trouble, ah ah ah
He's either dead or in serious trouble
He's either dead or in serious trouble
He's either dead or in serious trouble
He's either dead or in serious troubleEmbed
