Coming Up for Air LyricsIn the west of town there's no promised land
And if you can get that through your head then fine
And if you want me to be honest with
You can ask me and I'll tell you everything
And if you want to know a lie
Then I'll tell you a lie
If you want to know the truth
Then I'll tell you
Oh when you're coming up for air
And you think there's someone there
No you won't see me
'Cos I'm faster than you think
As the world flies by and I close my eyes
To empty office buildings and the five-a-side
Where the air is thin in the morning light
If I'm on this road I'm gonna wait again
And if you want to know a lie
Then I'll tell you a lie
If you want to know the truth
Then I'll tell you
Oh when you're coming up for air
And you think there's someone there
No you won't see me
'Cos I'm faster than you think
If you want the truth then just ask me
I will give it to you but you won't like it much
And if that's okay then we'll get on fine
And if not then we can call it quits
And if you want to know a lie
Then I'll tell you a lie
If you want to know the truth
Then I'll tell you
Oh when you're coming up for air
And you think there's someone there
No you won't see me
'Cos I'm faster than you think
And if that's okay then we'll get on fine
And if not then we can call it quitsEmbed
