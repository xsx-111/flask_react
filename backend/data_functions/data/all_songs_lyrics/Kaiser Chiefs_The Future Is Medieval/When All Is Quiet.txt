When All Is Quiet LyricsWhen you've got 24 hours left on the clock
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
When you are the last apple pie in the shop
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
Think about me
Think about me
When all is quiet, won't you think about --
Maybe I have missed the greatest day of my life
I hope that isn't true
I hope that isn't true
Ladies I have kissed could've all been my wife
But none of them were you
None of them were you
My darling
Oh, my darling
Think about me
Think about me
When all is quiet, won't you think about me?
I've been waiting for you (wasting my time)
Most of my life (wasting my time)
When all is quiet, won't you think about --
Think about me
Think about me
When all is quiet, won't you think about me?
I've been waiting for you (wasting my time)
Most of my life (wasting my time)
When all is quiet, won't you think about me?
Think about me
Think about me
Think about me
When all is quiet, won't you think about me?Embed
