Cousin in the Bronx LyricsMy cousin in the Bronx
He knows everyone
And he says "Start a revolution without me
I'll definitely be at the next one"
My cousin in the Bronx
I should probably get a taxi home
Oh oh oh oh
Especially around at this time of night
Oh oh oh oh
Never stay out of the party
Forever more than a record now
My cousin in the Bronx
He knows everyone
And he says "Start a revolution without me
I've got to cut my hair"
My cousin in the Bronx
He knows everyone
And he says "Start a revolution without me
I'll definitely be at the next one"
My cousin in the Bronx
Why am I always the last one to leave?
Oh oh oh oh
Walking home with my Saturday clothes on
Oh oh oh oh
You can print out all the posters
It could get last in the gasters
My cousin in the Bronx
He knows everyone
And he says "Start a revolution without me
I've got to cut my hair"
My cousin in the Bronx
He knows everyone
And he says "Start a revolution without me
I'll definitely be at the next one"
