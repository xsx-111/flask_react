I Dare You LyricsI dare you not to tear out your heart
I dare you not to fall apart
I have to leave
No-one ever drowned in their tears
No-one ever died from their fears
I don't believe
I have a sentimental thought in me
'Cos life is the simplest thing
When you realise you don't care
Oh darling, don't worry
You'll never have to see me again
Don't roll your eyes
You'll never have to see me again
I'm daring you to count up to ten
I'm daring you to do that again
I have to go
No-one ever learned how to spell
No-one ever went to Hell
I have to go
I know to cut my team and sell my soul
'Cos life is the simplest thing
When you realise you don't care
Oh darling, don't worry
You'll never have to see me again
Don't roll your eyes
You'll never have to see me again
Oh darling, I'll tell you
'Cos life is the simplest thing
When you realise you don't care
Oh darling, don't worry
You'll never have to see me again
Don't roll your eyes
You'll never have to see me again
Oh darling, I'll tell you
You'll never have to see me again
Oh darling
Don't worry
I'll tell youEmbed
