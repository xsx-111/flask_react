Kinda Girl You Are LyricsI only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I first heard you on the radio
And felt my heart explode
No other choice, I heard a voice and fell in love with you
From St. Bartholomew's to Gloucester Avenue
No one can do what you do, oh
I thought you were American, oh oh oh
I thought you were American, oh oh oh
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
Then I saw you in a centrefold
You were looking cold
In just an artfully positioned piece of mistletoe
Mentally dressing you, I want to rescue you
And make you mine, all mine, oh
I thought you were a miracle, oh oh oh
I thought you were a miracle, oh oh oh
Hey!
I thought you were incredible, oh oh oh
I thought you were incredible, oh oh oh
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you are
I only wanna see the
I only wanna see the kinda girl you areEmbed
