My Place Is Here LyricsYou can rely on me
You know
For the way to go
Ah ah ah ah
I am a migratory bird
You know
And I will return
Ah ah ah ah
And if I ever knew what you were up to
And if I ever knew what you were up to
And if I ever knew
And if I ever knew
I know my place is here
I won't stay away for too long
I know my place is here
I won't stay away for too long
You realise
I memorised
Every silouhette
Ah ah ah ah
And every line
You ever wrote to me
So I don't forget
Ah ah ah ah
And if I ever knew what you were up to
And if I ever knew what you were up to
And if I ever knew
And if I ever knew
I know my place is here
I won't stay away for too long
I know my place is here
I won't stay away for too long
What if I stayed at home?
We'd never talk on the phone
I'd never miss you
We'd never make up
We'd know exactly what the other one was doing all the time
What if I stayed at home?
We'd never talk on the phone
I'd never miss you
We'd never make up
We'd know exactly what the other one was doing all the time
I know my place is here
I won't stay away for too long
I know my place is here
I won't stay away
I won't stay away
I know my place is here
I won't stay away
I won't stay away
I know my place is here
I won't stay away for too longEmbed
