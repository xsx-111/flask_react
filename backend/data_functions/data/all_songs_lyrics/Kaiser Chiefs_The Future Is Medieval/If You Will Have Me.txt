If You Will Have Me LyricsI don't know if you'll hear this song
And if you do you might not know
That it's a tribute to the man who made our world go around
I don't know if you'll hear this song
But if you do you're not alone
So dance while you can and cry while you can let the world go around
And if you will have me
I want to be the son that I was
And if you will have me
I want to be the boy from the photograph
I miss the daily phone call
And I miss the good advice
And my brother misses everything, he's just looking for you
It's the longest of goodbyes
So many lows and no real highs
There seems so little we can do, we see glimpses of you
And if you will have me
I want to be the son that I was
And if you will have me
I want to be the boy from the photograph
You can't fight life, so dance while you can
You can't fight life, so just dance while you can
And if you will have me
I want to be the son that I was
And if you will have me
I want to be the boy from the photograph
And if you will have me
I want to be the son that I was
And if you will have me
I want to be the boy from the photographEmbed
