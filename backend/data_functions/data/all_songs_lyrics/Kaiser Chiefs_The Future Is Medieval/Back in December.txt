Back in December LyricsIn the summer
No-one remembers
How cold it was
Back in December
Back in your hometown
It's hard to imagine
Walking around
In a similar fashion
I know 'cos I've seen it
I know 'cos I feel it
Yes I know 'cos I've been it
And nobody can tell me I'm wrong
In the playgrounds
Dream of the future
Making your own money
Doing whatever suits you
Suddenly you're older
And so reminiscient
Of playing soldiers
And the girls you were kissing
I know 'cos I've seen it
I know 'cos I feel it
Yes I know 'cos I've been it
And nobody can tell me I'm wrong
And nobody can tell me I'm wrong
Yes I know 'cos I've seen it
I know 'cos I feel it
Yes I know 'cos I've been it
And nobody can tell me I'm wrong
Look back into the world
Don't forget the world
Step into the world
In the shadows
This generation
All looked up to winners
And their low expectations
In the city
Or out in the rat race
Nothing in their pockets
But a smile on their faces
I know 'cos I've seen it
I know 'cos I feel it
Yes I know 'cos I've been it
And nobody can tell me I'm wrong
'Cos I've seen it
I know 'cos I feel it
Yes I know 'cos I've been it
And nobody can tell me I'm wrong
And nobody can tell me I'm wrongEmbed
