Problem Solved LyricsProblem solved
It's easier said than done
Problem solved
Reveals another one to be done
Convinced I'm not
I know if there's still a lot to be done
Convinced I'm not
I wish I was happy with my lot
I wish I was happy, happy, happy with my lot
I've seen you walking down the street
You know who you are
Smiling all the time
An empty head
Is not something that I would aspire to
That being said
It mut be nice to be oblivious
Content I'm not
I know that there's still a lot to be done
Content I'm not
I wish I was happy with my lot
I wish I was happy, happy, happy with my lot
I've seen you walking down the street
You know who you are
Smiling all the time
What does it take to make you listen?
What does it take to make you understand?
What does it take to make you listen?
What does it take to make you understand?
A problem solved
Don't be too quick to reach for champagne
Plenty more
Business rattling around my brain
Convinced I'm not
I know if there's still a lot to be done
Convinced I'm not
I wish I was happy with my lotEmbed
