Fly on the Wall LyricsIn the middle of the night, oh oh oh oh
You hardly know what's wrong from right, oh oh oh oh
And it doesn't even matter, oh oh oh oh
When you are hidden from the light, oh oh oh
Anywhere, I know it's clear
Anywhere, I know it's clear
I'm a fly on the wall
The greatest thing you ever said, oh oh oh oh
Was on your own and in your head, oh oh oh oh
And did it ever even happen? Oh oh oh oh
Or written down or ever read? Oh oh oh
Anywhere, I know it's clear
Anywhere, I know it's clear
I'm a fly on the wall
I'm a fly on the wall
I'm a fly on the wall
I'm a fly on the wall
I'm a fly on the wall
I'm a fly on the wall
I love to watch a gradual fall
I want to see the whites of your eyes
I need to feel the tone of your voice
I have to be the fly on the wall
Anywhere, I know
Anywhere, I knowEmbed
