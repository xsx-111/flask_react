Heard It Break LyricsI swear I heard it break
I swear I heard it break, break
I swear I heard it break, break
I swear I heard it break
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain
I could've sworn that I heard it snap
But they tell me it's just a sprain
It's been broke before but this hurts some more
Stretched beyond normal capacity and possibly torn
But they do say a sprain hurts more than a break
Or is that just to make you feel better about it?
I swear I heard it break
I swear I heard it break, break
I swear I heard it break, break
I swear I heard it break
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain
Something is wrong a crack in the world
That'll never be right again
I'm not coping well and it's starting to tell
One thousand missed oppurtunites and possibly more
All I had to do was to look after you
And it turns out that I'm the one who needs looking after
I swear I heard it break
I swear I heard it break, break
I swear I heard it break, break
I swear I heard it break
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain
It feels like I broke my heart again but it's just a sprain2Embed
