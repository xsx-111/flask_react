Out of Focus LyricsIt's like nothing happened
When everything happened
You took it away
But that's the way I like it
I found myself laughing
'Cos everyone's laughing
I don't belong
I'm making up the numbers
Then there was nothing
In my mind
Then there was nothing
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mind
I wasn't behaving
I wasn't invited
She could put it away
But that's the way I like it
It's not entertaining
Being entertaining
I don't even work here
I operate the curtains
Then there was nothing
In my mind
Then there was nothing
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mind
Then there was nothing
In my mind
Then there was nothing
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mind
I was just out focus (Just out of focus)
In my mindEmbed
