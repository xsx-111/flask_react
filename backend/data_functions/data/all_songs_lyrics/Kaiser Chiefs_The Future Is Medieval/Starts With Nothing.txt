Starts With Nothing LyricsIt starts with nothing and it ends in nothing
You start with nothing and you leave with nothing
It'll start with nothing and will end in nothing
You arrive with nothing and you leave with nothing
You're on your own on the last train home
Open your eyes, you have arrived
You're on your own again
At the end
It starts with nothing and it ends in nothing
You start with nothing and you leave with nothing
It'll start with nothing and will end in nothing
You arrive with nothing and you leave with nothing
Nobody knows where the money goes
You are alive and a passerby
And leave it all behind
Never mind
It starts with nothing and it ends in nothing
You start with nothing and you leave with nothing
It'll start with nothing and will end in nothing
You arrive with nothing and you leave with nothing
Yes, that is my final answer (Yes, that is my final answer)
Yes, that is my final answer (Yes, that is my final answer)
Yes, that is my final answer
Yes, that is my final answer
Yes, that is my final answer
Yes, that is my final answer
You're on your own on the last train home
Another time around the circle line
With nothing up your sleeve
As you leave
It starts with nothing and it ends in nothing
You start with nothing and you leave with nothing
It'll start with nothing and will end in nothing
You arrive with nothing and you leave with nothingEmbed
