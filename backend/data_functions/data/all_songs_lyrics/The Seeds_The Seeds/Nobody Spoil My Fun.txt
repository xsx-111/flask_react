Nobody Spoil My Fun LyricsYou know there's always someone
Who wants to spoil your fun
When your fun has just begun
So I'm going to find some little girl
And we're going to go on the run
I'm going to take her down to broadway
Where the lights and the music are gay
Gonna teach her how to play
Every night and every day
'Cause I want
Yes, I want
Nobody spoil my fun
You know I'm gonna dress her up, real fine
So much, your going to blow your mind
And then she's gonna put her high-boots on
You know you want to go along
I'm going to show her how to lose
Her baby baby blues
And then I'm going to give her love
A love she really can use
'Cause I want
Yes, I want
Nobody spoil my fun
You know I'm going to find me a place
Where the band plays night and day
And where every policeman who's calling
They don't get in at all
And where if you, a pound on the wall
A no one cares at all
And the phone ringing out in the hall
Just tore it right off the wall
'Cause I want
Yes, I want
Nobody spoil my fun
You know we're going to dance all the night and day
No matter what the people say
And when the sun comes shining through
There'll just be me and you
And when I want to hold you tight
And a no one will say, it ain't right
And when I go and kiss your lips
Gonna send ya on your trip
'Cause I want
Yes, I want
Nobody spoil my fun
Yeah, I'm with you baby
I don't want nobody
To spoil our fun
Come on down
Down to Broadway
Where the lights
And the music
Are so gay
Gonna teach ya
How to play
Yeah, every night
And every day
It's alright
Yeah, come on
Come onEmbed
