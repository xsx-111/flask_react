No Escape LyricsNowhere to run and nowhere to hide
I can't kill this bad pain inside
What can I do when your Love is gone
All I can do is just live on
No escape from your heart
No escape from your lips
No escape from you baby you bring the tears
No escape from you darlin' all the night and day
No escape from you baby what else can I say
No escape
No escape
No escape
What can I do without you loss
I need your love whatever it'll cause
How can I hide this tears inside
What can I do when your love dies
No escape from your heart
No escape from your lips
No escape from you baby yeah you bring the tears
No escape from you darlin all the night and day
No escape from you baby no place to stay
No escape
No escape
No escape
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
I can't kill this bad pain inside
What can I do when your Love is gone
All I can do is just live on
No escape from your heart
No escape from your lips
No escape from you darlin' you bring the tears
No escape from you baby all the night and day
No escape from you baby no place to stay
No escape
No escape
No escape
No escape
No escape
No escapeEmbed
