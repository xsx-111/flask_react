Excuse, Excuse LyricsYou're slippin', you're fallin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've hit the ground
You no longer hear each happy sound
You no longer tell day from night
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've hit the ground
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
Who took the sun, has painted it black
Who took the skies and turned them grey
Who took your dreams, your dreams away
What happened to each happy day
You're slippin', you're fallin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
A glass vacuum locked your mind inside
And now you've taken one long ride
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you touched the ground
Who took your dreams, your dreams away
Who tookthe nights and changed the day
Who took your thoughts, your thoughts away
Who has come and changed the play
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
A glass vacuum with a bubble inside
Have you been lost, passed the day
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
What you, what you, what you gonna do
With this life you've been running through
What you, , what you, what you going to do
You just can't keep running away
And the nights, the nights have all turned black
An empty heart lies cold inside
And now you're lost, you're lost inside
You're heart's taken another ride
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
You're slippin', you're fallin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've hit the ground
Each sunrise comes and brings the new dawn
Replacing the one that's come and gone
The path by you've walked once before
Has now been filled with candy stores
You're slippin', you're fallin', you're fallin'
Back down you're slippin', you're slippin'
You're fallin' back down, you're slippin', you're slippin'
You're fallin' back down, you're fallin', you're fallin'
You're fallin', you're fallin', fall fall fall fall fall
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
Each new day that comes has come and gone
The master's rain has come to fall
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', he's counting the dawn
You're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
The master has counted, counted the dawn
Who took the stars and painted them grey
Who took your smile, your smile away
Who took your laughter, your laughter away
Who has come and changed the day
As you're slippin', you're slippin', you're fallin' back down
You're slippin', you're slippin', you've touched the ground
Without love you're fallin', why, you're fallin' back down
Without love you just can't go on, you're fallin', fallin', fallin' back down
Fallin', you're fallin', fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fallEmbed
