Lose Your Mind LyricsDo you wanna lose your mind?
Leave your cares and worries behind
Do you wanna have some fun?
Tell me baby it's just begun
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Tell me baby is it coming on?
If you've got troubles and tears
I'll make you forget your years
If you want something new
I've got love that's good for you
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Well I gotta plot to make you see
You know my love never let you be
I gotta plot gonna fade away
You know I love you night and day
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Do you wanna weave a spell?
Cast black magic from down below
Do you wanna hypnotize?
Make the whole world realize
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Tell me baby is it coming on?
Well I gotta plot to make you see
I'm gonna take you to every sea
I gotta plot to love you so
You know my love never let you go
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Tell me baby do you feel it now?
Tell me baby do you feel it now?Embed
