Try to Understand LyricsWon't you try to understand, oh!
Everybody needs some love, oh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
I'm getting all your love
And every day, oh my heart
I'm in love with you, oh!
And every hour that is by
My love still is true, oooooh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
Everybody's searchin' for love, oh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
I give you all my love
No man can walk away
Once he saw your smile, oh!
No man can stay away
Once he's had your love, oooooh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
Everybody's lookin' for love, oh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
I give you all my love
Won't you try to understand, oh!
Everybody needs someone, oh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
I wanna be the one
Come back into my heart
I still love you girl, oh!
Come back into my arms
Let me love you now, oooooh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
Everybody needs to love, oh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
I give you all my love
Won't you try to understand, darling
That everybody needs someone
And I need your love, so bad
And each night and day
That you're away
All I can do is sit
Won't you try to understand, oh!
I really need your love, oh!
Won't you try to understand, oh!
It's you I'm thinking of
Won't you try to understand
Won't you try and understandEmbed
