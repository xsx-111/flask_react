Out in the Parking Lot LyricsThis next record is dedicated to some personal friends of mine:
The L.A.P.D
For every cop that has ever taken advantage of somebody
Beat 'em down or hurt 'em
Because they have long hair
Listen to the wrong kind of music
Wrong color
Whatever they thought was the reason to do it
For every one of those fuckin' police
I'd like to take a pig out here in this parkin' lot
And shoot 'em in their muthafuckin' faceEmbed
