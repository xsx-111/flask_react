Country House Lyrics
So the story begins

City dweller, successful fella
Thought to himself, "Oops, I've got a lot of money" (Lot of money)
Caught in a rat race, terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit (To the limit)
Caught up in the century's anxiety
Yes, it preys on him (Preys on him)
He's getting thin (Getting thin)
Try the simple life

He lives in a house
A very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats
And the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills
And piles up analyst bills in the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm
That's the rural charm in the country

He's got morning glory and life's a different story
Everything's going Jackanory (Jackanory)
Touched with his own mortality
He's reading Balzac and knocking back Prozac
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
(Close your eyes, try it)
Oh, it's a century's remedy
For the faint at heart (Faint at heart)
A new start (New start)
Try the simple life
He lives in a house
A very big house in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
He's got a fog in his chest
So he needs a lot of rest in the country
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh
Takes herbal baths in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
But you'll come to no harm
On the animal farm in the country
In the country, in the country, in the country

Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why
Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why

Oh, he lives in a house
A very big house in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
Watching afternoon repeats
And the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills
And piles up analyst bills in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
Oh, it's like an animal farm
That's the rural charm in the country
Oh, he lives in a house
A very big house in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
He's got a fog in his chest
So he needs a lot of rest in the country
He doesn't drink, smoke, laugh
Takes herbal baths in the country
(Blow, blow me out, I am so sad, I don't know why)
But you'll come to no harm
On the animal farm in the country
Who's that? La-la
I wanna be, I wanna be13Embed
