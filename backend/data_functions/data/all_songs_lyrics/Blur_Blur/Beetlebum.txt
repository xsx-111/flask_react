Beetlebum Lyrics
Beetlebum, what you done?
She's a gun, now what you done, beetlebum?
Get nothing done, you beetlebum
Just get numb, now what you've done, beetlebum?

And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence's gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
Nothing is wrong, she turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone

Beetlebum, because you're young
She's a gun, now what you done, beetlebum?
She'll suck your thumb, she'll make you come
'Cause she's your gun, now what you done, beetlebum?

And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence's gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
There's nothing wrong, she turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it16Embed
