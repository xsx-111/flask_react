Got the Blues for Murder Only LyricsDown in old Mexico where a child will slap your face
Down in old Mexico where a child will slap your face
They make a bread with cayenne pepper, drink gun powder to kill the taste
Women down in Mexico they's bad as bad can be
Women in old Mexico they're bad as bad can be
They eats rattlesnakes for breakfast and drink the rattlesnakes' blood for tea
Down in old Mexico their bed is made out of thorns and trees
Bed is made out of thorn trees and the pillows out of rocks and stones
They got rattlesnakes for body guards, wildcats will watch over them all night long
I'm going back to old Mexico where there's long, long reaching guns
I'm going to old Mexico where there's long, long reaching guns
When they want real excitement they kill each other one by one
Down in old Mexico where's everybody's wild and free
Down in old Mexico where everybody's wild and free
'Cause over here in this country they don't kill 'em fast enough for me
Down in old Mexico where they kill 'em both night and day
Down in old Mexico where they kill 'em both night and day
Where the chief locks up the jail house and the judge goes home and staysEmbed
