Racketeers Blues LyricsIf you've got over fifteen grand's, better split it ninety-nine different ways
If you've got over fifteen grand's, you better split it ninety-nine different ways
'Cause the racketeer
Has got no certain place to dig your grale
When they demand your money, you've got to give it up with a smile
When they demand your money, you've got to give it up with a smile
And if you refuse, they'll read about you in a short little while
When the gang is out to get you, it don't do no good to run
When the gang is out to get you, it don't do no good to run
It's true you can dodge a log but you can't dodge them slugs out the machine gun
You slave hard for your money, just to give it to some other one
You work hard for your money, just to give it to some other one
And if you refuse, the answer will be from a racketeer's gun
When the gang is out to get you, they'll follow you everywhere
When the gang is out to get you, they'll follow you everywhere
You can even move towards hell ...
Find you thereEmbed
