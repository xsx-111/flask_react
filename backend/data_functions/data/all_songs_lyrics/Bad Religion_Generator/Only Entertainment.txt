Only Entertainment Lyrics
Trance fixated on the big blue screen
Your window to the outside, a melancholy dream
A medium upon which you build reality
This episodic currency that everybody needs

Somebody's delivery lulls you to sleep
The man behind the weather map, the editor-in-chief
They control the world of power and disease
And you cannot suppress your curiosity

See, it's only entertainment
Superficial urgency
Poster-board mentality
Only entertainment
Tightly constrained (Ah, ah)
The buzz that remains (Ah, ah)
Is the story of how we run our lives

(Hey!) Many are the people, poor and suffering
From the lack of coverage from the transmission beam
And if it ever gets there, you'll be offended too
'Cause you cannot distinguish chicanery from truth
See, it's only entertainment
A superficial episode
As life continues to unfold
Only entertainment
Controlled and copied (Ah, ah)
They've planted the seed (Ah, ah)
That sprouts into your picture of the world (Ah, ah, ah)

Can't someone protect me
(Turn away! Turn away!)
From this electron beam?
(Turn away! Turn away!)
Hey you, Mr. FCC
(Turn away! Turn away!)
Have you no advice for me?
(Turn away! Turn away!)
(Turn away! Turn away!)
See, it's only entertainment
(Turn away! Turn away!)
(Turn away! Turn away!)
Only entertainment
Only entertainment

(Ah, ah) Unofficial facsimile
(Ah, ah) Leading you to poverty
Only entertainment
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
Only entertainment
Only entertainmentEmbed
