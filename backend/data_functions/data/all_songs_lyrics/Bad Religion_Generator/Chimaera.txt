Chimaera Lyrics
You took a time bomb and a case of crackers
And you made a maelstrom of organic debris
Then you took a work bench and a rusty anvil
And you polished them for everyone to see

You have created an unhealthy monster
Yet you're nowhere, but nowhere to be found
So I guess I'll just cope with my provisions
From now until the day they lay me down

You took a baboon and made him perfect
You took a lion and stripped him of his pride
Then you took a million more varieties, a scalpel, and a sartory
And you stitched up a horrible surprise

You have created an unsocial monster
Yet you're searched for all over the globe
And most believe that things could sure be better
If you'd come down here and tell us what you know

Who is to blame for this? Someone tell me please
His handiwork is flawed and it's there for all to see
Mutations, aberrations, and blatant anomalies
They multiply and give rise to this monstrosity

You took the most abundant, smallest bits of matter
And you instilled them with affinity
And then you stratified accumulations
Weeded out bad variations
Blended up your unique recipe

You have created a powerful monster
With direction and purpose all its own
And if you were here, would things be any different?
Or are you just a mosaic of thoughts alone?Embed
