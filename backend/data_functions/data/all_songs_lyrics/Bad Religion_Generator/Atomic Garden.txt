Atomic Garden Lyrics
Everybody wants to dance in a playpen
But nobody wants to play in my garden
I see the hippies on an angry line
Guess they don't get my meaning

I'm enchanted by the birds and my bossoms
I'm enamored by young lovers on the weekend
I like the Fourth of July
When bombs start flashing

And I wish I had a shiny red top
A bugle with a big brass bell would cheer me up
Or maybe something bigger that could really go "pop"
Then I could make the gardening stop

Come out to play (Come out to play)
Come out to play
And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day
In my atomic...

All my scientists are working on a deadline
So my psychologist is working day and night time
They say they know what's best for me
But they don't know what they're doing
And I'm glad I'm not Gorbachev
'Cause I'd wiggle all night like jelly in a pot
At least he's got a garden with a fertile plot
And a party that will never stop

Come out to play (Come out to play)
Come out to play
And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day
In my atomic...

I hope there's nothing wrong out there
I'm watching from the room, inside my room


Come out to play (Come out to play)
Come out to play
And we'll pretend it's Christmas Day
In my atomic... Garden!
