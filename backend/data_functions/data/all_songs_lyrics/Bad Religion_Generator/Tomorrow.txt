Tomorrow Lyrics
Every day, we profit so
Leaning towards the great unknown
Asking how it pertains to tomorrow

Aim for places we've not been
Trample paths that go between
Yesterdays foundations and tomorrow

It's the way they say it's got to be
We spear ahead and forge our destiny
Who do they represent? Who do you believe?
Make a sound decision for others to heed

Try to set a faster pace
Try to build a master race
One that will make a contribution to tomorrow


It's the way they say it's got to be
We put aside our fears and make history
The clothes are in the dryer and the writing's on the wall
We're doing everything we can to stop this fall
Every day, we profit so
Leaning toward the great unknownEmbed
