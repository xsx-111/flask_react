Generator Lyrics
Like a rock, like a planet
Like a fucking atom bomb
I'll remain unperturbed by the joy and the madness
That I encounter everywhere I turn

I've seen it all along in books and magazines
Like a twitch before dying, like a pornographic sea
There's a flower behind the window, there's an ugly laughing man
Like a hummingbird in silence, like the blood on my door
It's the generator

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Like the blood on my door
Wash me clean and I will run
Until I reach the shore

I've known it all along like the bone under my skin
Like actors in a photograph, like paper in the wind
There's a hammer by the window, there's a knife on the floor
Like turbines in darkness, like the blood on my door
It's the generator
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Like the blood on my door
Wash me clean and I will run
Until I reach the shore


Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh1Embed
