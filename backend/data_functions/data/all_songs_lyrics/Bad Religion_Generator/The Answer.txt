The Answer Lyrics
Long ago in a dusty village full of hunger, pain, and strife
A man came forth with a vision of truth and the way to a better life
He was convinced he had the answer and he compelled people to follow along
But the hunger never vanished and the man was banished
And the village dried up and died

At a time when wise men peered
Through glass tubes toward the sky
The heavens changed in predictable ways
And one man was able to find
That he had thought he found the answer
And he was quick to write his revelation
But as they were scrutinized in his colleagues eyes
He soon became a mockery

Don't tell me about the answer, 'cause then
Another one will come along soon
I don't believe you have the answer
I've got ideas, too
But if you've got enough naivety
And you've got conviction
Then the answer is perfect for you

An urban sprawl sits choking on its discharge
Overwhelmed by industry
Searching for a modern day savior from another place
Inclined toward charity
Everyone begging for an answer without
Regard to validity
The searching never ends, it goes on and on
And on for eternity

Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah, ah

Don't tell me about the answer, 'cause then
Another one will come along soon
I don't believe you have the answer
I've got ideas too
But if you've got enough naivety
And you've got conviction
Then the answer is perfect for you
(The answer is perfect for you)Embed
