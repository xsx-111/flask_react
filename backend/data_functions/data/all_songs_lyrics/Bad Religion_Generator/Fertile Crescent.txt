Fertile Crescent Lyrics
Come and see the brilliant light
Don't let your emotions mask your sight
It's the manifestation of a deeper fight
That affects me and you
My optimism was runnin' high
A new world order was on my mind
But I couldn't believe it when I heard them say
They're blowing it away

And the fertile crescent is burning today
And baby, my emotions are, too
The cradle of humanity has led us all astray
And we're all in this together, don't you know?
'Cause our species has nowhere else to go

Aggression rears its ugly head
Retaliation brings further dread
The two are linked by unseen threads
That wind back through time
I don't agree with the outdated trend
Nationalism is an evil friend
But hatred is instilled by invisible lines
Drawn in our minds
And the fertile crescent is haunting us today
And baby, our instincts are, too
The ghost of humanity is warning us this way
And I think we all should heed it, don't you know?
'Cause we've got nowhere else to go


The fertile crescent is haunting us today
And baby, our instincts are, too
The ghost of humanity is warning us this way
And I think we all should heed it, don't you know?
'Cause we've got nowhere else to goEmbed
