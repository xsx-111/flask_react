No Direction Lyrics
A sullen figure walked along a dusty road
His life was holy and he couldn't bear the load
He left his people and a simple life behind
He raised his torso and he looked into the sky

Shouting his questions, looking for directions
"What do I do now?"

Now a confused school girl stares at the TV tray
The stresses of maturing compound every day
She glances up to see her favorite video
And gets ideas from Madonna's nasty clothes

In need of affection, she craves the directions
Her heroes offer her

Everyone's looking for something
And they assume somebody else knows what it is
No one can live with the decisions of their own
It seems, so they look to someone else
To tell 'em what to be, tell 'em what to wear
Tell 'em what to say, tell 'em how to act and think
Compel others compulsively, until the world is all like them

A righteous student came and asked me to reflect
He judged my lifestyle was politically incorrect
I don't believe in self-important folks who preach
No Bad Religion song can make your life complete
Prepare for rejection, you'll get no direction from me

You'll get no direction from me
You'll get no direction from me
One, two!2Embed
