Two Babies in the Dark Lyrics
There's a light on in the hallway, so I can't understand
Why you hide underneath the covers
There's a baby in your womb, so don't be scared tonight
Raggedy Ann is in the closet picking posies

Two babies in the dark, like diamonds in the sand
While papa's far away making up children's stories
The little one's inside, so afraid to be alone
She's tired of being brave until the daddy comes home

So if you chance to see her, please tell her it's alright
'Cause everybody fights the tendency to snap
Sometimes it's not a matter of being brave and strong
'Cause noises in the house are terrifying

Two babies in the dark, like diamonds in the sand
While papa's far away making up children's stories
The little one's inside, so afraid to be alone
She's talking to herself, now, 'cause no one's home

I'll put you to sleep at night
Like a foreign movie
I'll sing you lullabies
And I'll teach you about everything
And I'll only ask one thing
Please save me, ah
