Heaven Is Falling Lyrics
As I walk beneath the valley
I shall fear no evil
'Cause thanks to King George and his rainbow cabinet
Today, murder is legal
God, I know that it's wrong
To kill my brother for what he hasn't done
And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is fallin' (Fallin')

It sounds like heaven is fallin'
You promised me a new day a'dawnin'
I see a thousand points of light
Like so many points of hatred, shame, and horror


God, I want to be a man
But I don't want to die with a rifle in my hand
And as the planes blacken the sky
It sounds like heaven is fallin' (Fallin')

It sounds like heaven is fallin'
You promised me a new day a'dawnin'
Well nothing here looks new to me
But a score of mothers' sons caught 'tween the devil and the deep blue sea1Embed
