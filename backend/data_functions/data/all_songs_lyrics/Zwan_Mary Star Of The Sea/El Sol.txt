El Sol LyricsEmpty armed
And half a soul to go
And all I wanted
Was you here next to me
A little sunshine, sympathy
Now everybody knows
That I've been hanging down so low
Cause now I'm feeling old
Soon I'll be feeling out so cold
Wondering will you call?
And now I'm feeling high
Soon I'll be feeling left for dead
Sometimes someone saying, "yes"
Changes what you'll bet
And all I wanted
Was just to hold you close
A little sunshine
Just to butter my toast
And your love next to mine
I have to let you know
That we were meant to be just right
Heaven sent, not sympathized
By everybody's lie
And now I'm feeling high
Now I'm feeling left so dead
Kicking up the dust in bed
Wondering, I guess
Sunshine
Sunshine (it's all I wanted)
Sunshine
And some tea
And your love (it's all I wanted)
Your love (it's all I wanted)
Your love
Next to mine
I have to let you know
I had to let you go
So I could see my lie
Fade from your eyes
And to my surprise
That's what I wanted
It's all I wanted
It's what I wanted
Me and you
Sunshine (it's all I wanted)
Sunshine (it's all I wanted)
Sunshine
And some tea
That's all I wanted
That's all I wanted
That's all I wanted
That's all I wantedEmbed
