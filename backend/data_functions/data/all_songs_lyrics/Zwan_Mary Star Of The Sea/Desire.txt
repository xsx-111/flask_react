Desire LyricsNorthern star
Am i frightened
Where can i go to rest
I can't sleep
And i'm still fighting
Wait, don't breathe
The time destroys a man
A child who understands
That anyone who desires
Is not my kind
Not my truth
Fade away, it's all we do
Fade away from the truth
Desires
Fade away
Desires
Fade away
Desires
And northern star
Please enlighten
The lost prayers of my soul
Childhood dreams
Of death and titans
We were meant to be free
To give ourselves away
So please don't be afraid
Of anyone who desires
They're not my kind
Not my truth
Fade away, it's all we do
Fade away from the truth
Desires
Fade away
Desires
Fade away
Desires
Fade away
Desires
'cause anyone who desires
Is not my kind
I have no use for youEmbed
