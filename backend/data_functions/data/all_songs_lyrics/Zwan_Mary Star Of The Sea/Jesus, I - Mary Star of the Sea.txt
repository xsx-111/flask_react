Jesus, I / Mary Star of the Sea LyricsJesus, i've taken my cross
All to leave and follow thee
Jesus, i've taken my cross
All to leave and follow thee
I'm destitute, despised, forsaken
All to leave and follow thee
And follow thee
Man make trouble to distress me
To drive my heart to the cross
Yeah, man make trouble to distress me
To drive this heart to the cross
I'm resolute, reviled, forsaken
All to leave and follow thee
And follow thee
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Reborn
Reborn
Reborn
Reborn
So perish every fond ambition
God and trouble are all i've known
Yet how rich is my condition
God and heaven are all my own
God and heaven are all my own
Rooms full of salt
Fault my pluck
And a poets charm so far, ever far
Little stars that burn the holes in my soul
And everything just feels like rain
The road we're on, the things we crave
And everything just feels like rain
The nights i sleep, what's left to dream
When everything feels like rain
Dreampt as i dive
Find the deep
Out of reach of all the stars
Ever far
Listless tides along the changing shore
And everything just feels like rain
The road we're on, the things we crave
And everything just feels like rain
If i should sleep, what's left to dream
When everything feels like rainEmbed
