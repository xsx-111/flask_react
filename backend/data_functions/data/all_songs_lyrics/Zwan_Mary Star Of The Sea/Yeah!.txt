Yeah! LyricsYeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
I gave you everything
What'd you give to me
A pocket full of empty rings
With diamonds that can sing
The most that I could ever hope
Is that you'd start to feel so real
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
What I want is what you want
But what I want is more
I'm tired of the questions
Am I left in scorn
The drugs are my addiction
She's laying on the tiles of my floor
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
'Cause you are my faults
As you are my own
And you built my will
But what I want you can't fucking kill
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Everyone is not as one
Everyone's the same
They're asking for a moment
They're looking out to blame
So am I independent
Or am I just playing my own games
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
'Cause you are my faults
As you are my own
And you built my guilt
But when I can you just never will
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
'Cause you are my faults
Well you are my own
It's your will in my guilt
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!Embed
