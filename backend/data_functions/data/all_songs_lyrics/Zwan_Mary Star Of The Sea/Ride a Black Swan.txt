Ride a Black Swan LyricsA black swan rode me into my place of destiny
To love, to feel so madly
Stubborn to disagree
With people who think that life is just a memory
To be denied
I'll take this picture for ages
Of just you and i
As the world goes 'round
It's got me thinking
That the things i want
Just keep me sinking down
A white horse picks my dreams up
To take my hopes to god
My prayers have nestled brightly
To dim my sense of awe
I want you to be someone i can't deny
A house of fire
I want you to be something i realize
As the world goes 'round
It's got me thinking
That the things i want
Just keep me sinking down
As the world goes 'round
It's got me thinking
That the things i want
Will keep me sinking down
Remove my spirit from darkness
Love become my heaven
As the world goes 'round with our love
I want you to be my message
I want you to be my friend
I want you to be that answer
An answer i must defend
I want us to solve our distrust of everyone
And trust in god
I want us to solve our distrust of who we are
As the world goes 'round
It's got me thinking
That the things i want
Just keep me sinking down
As the world goes 'round
It's got me thinking
That the things i want
Just keep me sinking down
As the world goes 'round with our love
As the world goes 'round with our love
Remove my spirit from darkness
Love become my heaven
Remove my spirit from darkness
Love become my heaven
Remove my spirit from darkness
Love become my heaven
As the world goes 'round with our love
As the world goes 'round with our loveEmbed
