Honestly LyricsI believe
I believe
I believe
I believe the love you talk about with me
Is it true, do I care
Honestly, you can try to wipe the memories aside
But it's you that you erase
'Cause there's no place that I could be without you
It's too far to discard the life I once knew
Honestly, all the weather storms I bring
Are just a picture of my needs
'Cause when I think of you as mine
And allow myself with time
To lead into the life we want
I feel love, honestly
I feel love, yes, honestly
I believe you mean the best that life can bring
I believe in it all
Honestly, you can try
Your heart is just as long as mine
Is it ours to let go
'Cause there's no place that I could be without you
It's too dark to discard the life I once knew
Honestly, a single wrong is not enough
To cover up the pain in us
'Cause when I think of you as mine
And allow myself the time
To lead into the life we want
I feel love, honestly
I'll make a joke so you must laugh
I'll break your heart so you must ask
Is this the way to get us back
I don't know, honestly
I don't know, yes, honestly
There's no place that I could be without you
Honestly
There's no place that I could be without you
There's no place that I could be without you
There's no place that I could be without you
There's no place that I could be without you
