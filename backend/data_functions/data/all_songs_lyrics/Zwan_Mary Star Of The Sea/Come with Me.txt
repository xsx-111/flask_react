Come with Me LyricsAll you need
Is something I'll believe
Flashlights in the hall
But no call
'Cause when my day is done
I find where I belong
Waiting on the curb
For you to come to carry on
It won't be long, we'll turn around
I care enough to wake you up
To make us mine, I'll make you shine
Stay the night
Stay all your life
Just come with me
Come with me
Won't you come with me
Come with me again
Come with me (stay the night)
Won't you come with me (stay all your life)
Come with me again (just come with me)
Fell so hard I broke my jaw
I couldn't talk to you
Went underground to play around, it's true
But I came back to get you at that place
So I could breathe
It's 3 a.m
And I'm up again
Answering the call of all
The flowers by the bed
Make me wish my head
Was lying and possessed
By truth alone, a certain home
A wooden gate, a rabbit hole
We'll turn around, it won't be long
Capture that place, won't it be fun?
Come with me
Won't you come with me?
Come with me again
Come with me (stay the night)
Won't you come with me? (stay all your life)
Come with me again (just come with me)
Come with me
Won't you come with me?
Come with me again
Come with me (stay the night)
Won't you come with me? (stay all your life)
Come with me again (just come with me)
She means more to me
Than any living thing
Younger than the blush of Spring she sings
(Stay the night) Won't you come with me?
(Stay all your life) Come with me again (just come with me)Embed
