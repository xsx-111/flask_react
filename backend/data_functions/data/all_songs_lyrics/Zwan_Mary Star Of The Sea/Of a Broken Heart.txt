Of a Broken Heart Lyrics
If only I die
Just once in my life
If only to try
To take a guess, to be the best
A feeling I hide
That runs this world, that keeps us alive
I want you to climb with me

Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I die

The heart of a child
Is in your hands now
So let's see you smile
'Cause I'm not impressed with your loneliness
And it's been a while
Since you forgave all your changes made
So let's count the miles together

Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I die
If only I die
Just once in my life
If only to try together

Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I die of a broken heart
A broken heart
Until I dieEmbed
