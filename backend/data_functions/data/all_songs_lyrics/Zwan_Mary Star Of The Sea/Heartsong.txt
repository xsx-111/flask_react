Heartsong LyricsCome in
Make yourself at home
I'm a bit late
Hate to make you wait
But heart songs
Are still on my mind
There's never the time
To write down these lines
How can you say
That i don't need you
Just be sure
No more, no less
Let love confess to you
What you must do
Come on
Let's hit the road
I'm up to my tricks
I know they seem cold
But heart songs
Are all that i am
I use the same words
To say the same things
How can you say
That i don't need you
Just be sure
No more, no less
Let love confess to you
What you must do
How can you say
That i don't need you
Just be sure
No more, no less
Let love confess to you
What you must do
How can you say
That i don't need you
Just be sure
No more, no less
Let love confess to you
What you must doEmbed
