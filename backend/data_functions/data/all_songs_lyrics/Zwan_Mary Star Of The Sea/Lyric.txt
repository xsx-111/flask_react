Lyric LyricsHere comes my faith to carry me on
A faith, not a grave
A fight to to stay strong so I
Stand accused of playing numb
I know it is wrong
For I give my strength
I give my heart
Take these chains
And hold them as ours
For I must shine
And I will star
In a season all mine
A lyric, a time, a crusade, a line
One minute, a friend, a road without end
A lyric, a time, a crusade, a line
One minute, a friend, a road without end
So here is the view
I cast about
I'm leaving no room
For you to get out
You'll never get out
Dove, can't you cry
Without and aside
Of need. I want new vibes
I need you as my way
Across my life
To spend these years
Create a new thought
For I give you strength
And offer my heart
Take these chains
And hold them as ours
For I'm a star
And I will shine
In a season all mine
A lyric, a time, a crusade, a line
One minute, a friend, a road without end
A lyric, a time, a crusade, a line
One minute, a friend, a road without end
A lyric, a time, a crusade, a line
One minute, a friend, a road without end
A lyric, a time, a crusade, a line
One minute, a friend, a road without end
A road without endEmbed
