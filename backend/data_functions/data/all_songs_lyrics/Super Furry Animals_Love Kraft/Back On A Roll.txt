Back On A Roll LyricsBack on a roll
Records gone gold
Get on with the show
Don't see the point of us going home
Yes we rock and roll
Buying shit on the go
Driving denver snow
Getting on with the show
On with the show
Back on a roll
Don't see the point of us going home
Back on a roll
Records gone gold
Get on with the show
No need to f**king phone home
Yes we work in the dark
Sometimes living it large
Colours we can see
Listen cat frequency
Cat frequency
Those cat frequency
Hello kitty remember me
Back on a roll
Records gone gold
Get on with the show
Hello kitty remember me
Purr
Yeah
Hell yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Back on a roll
Get on with the show
No going home
Back on a roll
Get on with the show
No going homeEmbed
