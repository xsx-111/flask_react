Cloudberries Lyrics1. humming bird
She came into the room
Didn't know her name
How I danced inside
No one to confide
In the darkest winter
I made a sound like a long lost humming bird
2. friends of friends
Took a CIRCLE of friends
To the village SQUARE
Old love TRIANGLES
Made us so aware
Of a distant era
But we're still here
To sing as humming birdsEmbed
