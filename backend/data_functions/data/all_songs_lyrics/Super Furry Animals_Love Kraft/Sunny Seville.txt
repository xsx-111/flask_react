Sunny Seville LyricsSha la la la la la la la la la la la la
She came to the city, my village beauty, of innocent smile
She said he's the painter, then an impersonator, she's versatile
And now she's sucking on dictaphone
The breasts won't leave her alone
I'm back on the pills
She's over the hill
To sunny Seville
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la
Four bra sizes later, she's all over the papers and having a ball
She married a banker, who dies at the altar, and left her all
Well you could say she's out of luck
And that she never really gives a fuck
I'm back on the pills
She's over the hill
To sunny Seville
I'm back on the pills
She's picked up my bills
From sunny Seville
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la la
I'm back on the pills
She's over the hill
To sunny Seville
Oh honey I'm ill!
Pass me the pills
Pick up the bill
She's flushed into faze
And fazed into fuzz
Back in the haze
I'm back on the pills
She's over the hill
To sunny SevilleEmbed
