Atomik Lust LyricsIf your moon should eclipse me
And block out my sun
Ride on typhoons and hurricanes
Watch skymap on re-run
Fine times to walk on wine
Heads down no stress
Find some atomik lust
Whenever, more or less
So long, the thrills long gone
No more duress
No more atomik lust
Whenever, more or less
Let's get our shit together
Insane with crackbrainz
I'd love to see the ending someday
Of Citizen Kane
Fine times to walk on wine
Heads down no stress
Find some atomik lust
Whenever, more or lessEmbed
