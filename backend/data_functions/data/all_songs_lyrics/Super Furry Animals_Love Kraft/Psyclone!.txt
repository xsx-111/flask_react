Psyclone! LyricsPterodactyl, brontosaurus
Tyrannosaurus Rex
Gather around
The sound of thunder now awaits us
A meteorite is coming on down
Count your chicken
We're taking over
Take the turbulence and twinkle your toes
Count your chicken
We're taking over
Take the pressure and take it away
Chicken, chicken
Keep on talking
See a mothership in the sky
Space invader taking over
Time is chicken
Ticking away
Count your chicken
We're taking over
Take the turbulence and twinkle your toes
Count your chicken
We're taking over
Take the pressure and take it away
I feel a Psyclone coming on
(x4)
Count your chicken
We're taking over
Take the turbulence and twinkle your toes
Count your chicken
We're taking over
Take the pressure and take it away
I feel a Psyclone coming onEmbed
