Ohio Heat LyricsSycamore trees blowing green in the distance
She sucked on her thumb in her beautiful jail
A sentence to serve as her dynasty blows up inside her balloon
Salty Maureen had a bun in the oven
The daughters of charity let out a sigh
As she suffered they pleaded for mercy she needed a long time ago
A long time ago
In the greenest cypress groves
We were beaming golden glow
Ohio heat
Sweet as sugar from a beet
Sleek as foxes in the street
Evolution seemed complete
Day after day and hour upon hour
She counted the seconds till she could no more
As she climbed through the window and lowered herself with some sheets all tied
Up
Ran through the fields till the ocean got closer
Found a deserted and rusty old boat
As she fled for her life she did capsize and die a long time ago
A long time ago
In the greenest cypress groves
We were beaming golden glow
Ohio heat
Sweet as sugar from a beet
Sleek as foxes in the street
Evolution seemed complete
Ohio heat
Sweet as sugar from a beet
Sleek as foxes in the street
Evolution seemed complete
Ohio heat
Blowing bubblegums discreet
Now there's flowers on the street
Where she smoked and skipped her feet
From time to time on the flying tiger line
She appears in my sleep when my dreams are lucid deep
Ohio heat
Sweet as sugar from a beet
Sleek as foxes in the street
Evolution seemed complete
Ohio heatEmbed
