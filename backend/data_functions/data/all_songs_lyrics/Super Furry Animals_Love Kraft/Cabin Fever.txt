Cabin Fever LyricsWelcome back my friend.,
Where the hell have you been?
It's nice to feel that smile again
I can see
You can see
Wait and see
The things that were once said
We'll put away to bed
Forget me not and learn I will
It's not so hard to love again
There's nothing we can't do
Time, it passed me bye
When we thought of you
And never more, we're evermore
The snail it moves so slow
As I look down below
And from above I see so clear
This bird's-eye view that we now fear
Some things we can't explain
Can't believe we're there again
Snap out of it my friend
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
"We said goodbye today
Don't need you anyway
Praise the Lord, send it on
Pass the ammunition"
The time when you were near
We had nothing left to fear
But no more than...
Just as if no reason why
If we're to change that we should still go on
It's nice to know you're here
And we got there in the end
The future now is wide open and clearEmbed
