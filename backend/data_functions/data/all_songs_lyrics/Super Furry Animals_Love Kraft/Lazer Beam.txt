Lazer Beam LyricsWhistle your dog goodbye
To a radical new vision
No more imperial colonial bastards
No more romantic comedies
This is a fanfare introduction
To a high-powered purposful theme
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
The resistance in the distance
Creeping closer, have no fear
Land in anguish, we escape it
In our rocket propelled spaceship
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Human being, human doing
Human error, human terror
Human nature, human hate ya
Human crying, human leaving
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
We will conquer utopia in space chariots
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Take a shine of our lazer beam
And we'll cleanse all the evil within you
Point your random finger
Point it to the sky
Point your random finger
Come on and testify
Human kind loves money
We just love to fly
(Fly, fly, fly)
So point your random fingerEmbed
