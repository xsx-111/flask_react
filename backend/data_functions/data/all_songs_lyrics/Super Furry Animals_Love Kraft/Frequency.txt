Frequency LyricsThere goes my life
Ticking away
There goes my life
Slipping away
Long to sleep later
But alarms keep singing
Take another leaflet from the stand
Put a stake on some land (Frequency)
Bring another baby to the world
Clone a boy, then a girl
Famine and war
Rabies and plague
Or angle-poise lamps
Limos and shades
Polar bears
Molting as the ice caps melt down
Take another leaflet from the stand
Put a stake on some land (Frequency)
Bring another baby to the world
Clone a boy, then a girl
Hand in hand, we can break the command
Hand in hand, we can break the command
Hand in hand, we can break the command
Hand in hand, we can break the command
Take another leaflet from the stand
Choose a color that's bland (Frequency)
Win the burger franchise for the world
Win the ranch, get the girl
You say history will be your judge
But the jury's whipped, gagged, and drugged
Take away the blinkers from your eyes
Humans split, polarizedEmbed
