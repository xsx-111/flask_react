Horn LyricsGo, go with the flow
Rock, rock the freeway
Drink, smoke, love, enjoy the ride
Right or wrong
Hair down long
We vote her out
Nationwide screams and shouts
Go, go with the flow
Rock, rock the freeway
Billions of bees feed on honey trees
Join the core
And some more
You choose the place
Final resting place face to face
Twinkle twinkle
Rain and ears
Twinkle twinkle
City Arms
Go, go with the flow
Rock, rock the freeway
Go, go with the flowEmbed
