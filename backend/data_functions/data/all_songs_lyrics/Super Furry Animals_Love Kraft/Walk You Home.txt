Walk You Home LyricsCan't forget that smile
Can't believe we met
Such a sudden kiss
And you never even said goodbye
The future ain't what it used to be
I'll always think of you lovingly
Seasons change
And rearrange
A new light shines
(If she read my mind)
"You could be drinking with me"
"So why don't you go up and ask?"
I'm so very shy
I couldn't look at her in the eye
When the lights came on I knew it was time to go
One thing I know I must never do ever again is delay
In asking you if I could ever be able to (if I might ever be)
I don't know (I don't know what to say)
Shit, I've f**ked up again (I've f**ked up again)
I wanna walk you home tonight
Please can I walk you home tonight?
I wanna walk you home tonight
Please can I walk you home tonight?
I wanna walk you home tonight
Please can I walk you home tonight?
I wanna walk you home tonight
Please can I walk you home tonight?
I've been scared of asking you
Just incase you might let me down girl
Don't let me down girl
Don't let me down girlEmbed
