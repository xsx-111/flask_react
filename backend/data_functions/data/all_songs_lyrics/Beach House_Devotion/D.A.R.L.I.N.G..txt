D.A.R.L.I.N.G. Lyrics
Where did you come from?
You're no stranger
How I know you will return
So I won't be sad
D.A.R.L.I.N.G...

In this harbor of a room
You'll find your anchor soon
In the parting of our ways
May it never happen, any way

In the highest blackened moon
There'd be more life
In the right shade of our sighs
Death be gone
D.A.R.L.I.N.G...

In this harbor of a room
You'll find your anchor soon
In the parting of our ways
May it never happen, any way
All of your charms
Couldn't keep you from...Embed
