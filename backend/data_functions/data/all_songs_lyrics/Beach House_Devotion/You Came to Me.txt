You Came to Me LyricsInvite your sister
Into the garden
All cannot play
Fistful of wildflowers
Handpicked by someone
Who nearly fell
Friend, foe, or feather
If we row to get there
I'll give my gift to you
In all kinds of weather
If not now, not ever
Please do not go
Hands over your eyes
In all of your sighs
Is it the right time
For the game we play?
In all kinds of weather
If not now, not ever
This is the right time
For a holiday
You came to me
In my dreams
And you spoke
Of everything
Of sweet remedies
And diamond rings
Holy worlds dig early beds
