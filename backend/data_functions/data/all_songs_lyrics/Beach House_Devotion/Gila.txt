Gila Lyrics
Man, you got a lot of jokes to tell
So you throw your baby's pennies down the well
You give a little more
Than you like
You pick apart the past
You're not going back

Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a

Sure, you've got a handle on the past
It's why you keep your little lovers in your lap
You give a little more
Than you like
Pick apart the past
You're not going back
Don't you waste your time
No, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a
Hoping for the last ship to arrive
I am blessed with a kingdom, half mine

Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a
Gila-a-a-a-a7Embed
