Holy Dances Lyrics
In the night
I called your name
Heart of mine
One letter at a time
I'll be found in a
Land of savages
Ah...

Maybe you don't know
What you've got
Spent your money
On the desert lot
Holy dances and
Acronyms for her

Bury your maps
They'll take all
Your pots and pans
Cross all your hands
One finger at a time
You'll be found in a
Land of savages
Baby you don't know
What you've got
Husk to hide
And I know you're not
Spending money on a desert rose
Holy dances and acronyms, for bones2Embed
