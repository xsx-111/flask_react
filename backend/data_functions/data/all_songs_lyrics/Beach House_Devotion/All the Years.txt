All the Years Lyrics
I was sitting on a rock
Just waiting for a key
To sleep inside the house
Of old serenity
So I climbed onto your altar
Begged Please, don't let me falter
We'll put our oaths at stake in
A heaven that all icicles make

All my devotion
Compelled by an ocean
Of all the years to come
Of all the years to come
Of all the years to come
Of all the years to come

So we'll work until the night is quite
What once all our dreams were like
Doing all the housework
Returning all the schoolbooks
For good
Let's go on pretending
That the light
Is never ending
So we'll still have the summers
Let's be good to one another,  yay heyEmbed
