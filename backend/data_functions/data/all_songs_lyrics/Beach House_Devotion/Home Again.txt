Home Again Lyrics
Home again
Driven back
She's still waiting for a friend
Little purple
Organdie
Remember what you've always
Meant to me

Something in the way a heart is held upon a hand
Swimmin’ in the coral waters, head above the sand

Heaven, baby
Is in the hour
With your heart in handfuls
Forbidden flowers
Bread and bonnets
Along the way
Better take your chances
While there's still a ray

Something in the way a heart is held upon a hand
Swimmin’ in the coral waters, head above the sand
Constant home of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with me
Will I swim, out on, your ocean
Constant home of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with me
Will I swim, out on, your ocean
Constant home of my devotion
Must be you, the door to open
Home again, be here, be with me
Will I swim, out on, your ocean3Embed
