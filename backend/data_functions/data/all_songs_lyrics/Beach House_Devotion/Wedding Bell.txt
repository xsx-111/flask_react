Wedding Bell Lyrics
Hello you're hoping
Tomorrow's never sewn
But you're singing
The only words you know
Would you cry
If I lied, told a tale

I chose ya
You're ringing
The only wedding bell
And we're swimming
The seas we know so
Well I tried to stay alive
In our beds, in our heads
Oh, but your wish is my command

Oh, is your heart still mine to sail?
I've met yours, now meet mine

I chose ya, you're ringing
The only wedding bell
And we're swimming
The seas we know so well
I tried to stay alive
In our beds, in our head
Oh, but your wish is my command4Embed
