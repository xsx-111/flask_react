Astronaut Lyrics
Come over to my house
I'll pour some tea for us
One sugar or two
Your hand is right in front of me
Your finger fragile-ly
Holy on my side

Faster than an astronaut
Who's coming home to what
He left long ago
I've made this brand new bed
For you
I trust the things we do
Holy or not

Open the gate, 'cause you're
Already late
At the end of the lane
Is a glass of lemonade
Keep on the path
When you hear the laugh
In the white of her palm is your heart
I'll be brave for a while
I won't bring you down
Anymore than you are 

Please
Be my baby
Don't mean maybe or not
Look out the window
There's a bright yellow cat3Embed
