Demonizer Lyrics
Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth
Hellions the steed
Bloods on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring
Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy
The beast of a god
Regaled of his race
Prepared to onslaught
And bare face to face
Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The painkiller rises again

The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out!
Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's Gideon's quest
To take Satan's throne
The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminate all when vermin rebel
A maelstrom begins
To disintegrate
And pulverize all in its' wake


Demonizer!
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demonizer!
(Out, out, out, demons out)
Demons out!Embed
