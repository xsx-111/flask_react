Revolution Lyrics
If you think it's over
Better think again
There'll be no compromise
Time to hit the power
Feel adrenaline
Move into overdrive

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

If you think I'd back down
Or accept defeat
Brace for the aftershock
Take it to the limit
Take it to the streets
Give it everything you've got

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

Time to come together
Revolution
Living on forever
Revolution
Get ready for the revolution

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution, yeah!

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Here comes the revolution (Get ready for the revolution)
Time for retribution (Retribution)
Here comes the revolution (Something's in the air)
Time for retribution (Time to change, it's time to change)
(It's time to change, it's time to change)
Here comes the revolution (It's time to change)
Time for retribution
(You better watch out tonight)
Here comes the revolution
(You better watch out tonight)
Time for retribution (You better watch out tonight)
(You better watch out for the revolution)
(You better watch out for the revolution)
(Bring it down, bring it down)
(Bring it down, bring it down)Embed
