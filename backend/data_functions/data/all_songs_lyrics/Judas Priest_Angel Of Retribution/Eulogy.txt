Eulogy Lyrics
And so now it comes to pass
By the eventide on mass
See them gather yet alas
They remain still as stained class

For they know only too well
That the story they will tell
Conjures up an ageless spell
Guarded by the sentinel

So, it goes forevermore
Ever steady to the core
That the sign that they came for
Waves majestic from the floor1Embed
