Lochness Lyrics

Grey mist drifts upon the water
The mirrored surface moves
Awakened of this presence
Dispelling legends proof
A beastly head of onyx
With eyes set coals of fire
Its leathered hide glides glistening
Ascends the heathered briar

This legend lives through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternities
On and on and on

Lochness confess your terror of the deep
Lochness distress malingers what you keep
Lochness protects monstrosity
Lochness confess to me

Somehow it heeds the piper
From battlements that call
From side to side it ponders
Impassioned in the skirl
This highlands layer of mystery
Retains a lost worlds empathy
Resilient to discovery
On and on and on

Lochness confess your terror of the deep
Lochness distress malingers what you keep
Lochness protects monstrosity
Lochness confess to me
(This legend lives through centuries
This legend lives through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternity
Prevailing in eternity
Your secret lies safe with me
Your secret lies safe with me)

This creature's peril from decease
Implores to mankind for release
A legacy to rest in peace
On and on and on
Lochness confess your terror of the deep
Lochness distress malingers what you keep
Lochness protects monstrosity
Lochness confess to me
