Deal with the Devil Lyrics
Forged in the black country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realize
Driving in that transit
Down to holy Joe's
Used to lose our head
While metal flowed
Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood
Won't let us die
We built our world of metal
Watched it grow
Fueled the fury solid to the bone

Got to deal with the Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the Devil
From a heart made of steel

Rolling down the m-way
Took it to the smoke
Banging heads there
Until we all went broke
When we don the leather
And the whips and chains
Nothing matters more
We can't be tamed
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow
Into one voice
Took on all the world
It had no choice
Got to deal with the Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the Devil
From a heart made of steel

We hit at night
You're in our sight
Then we can feel
What we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
Upon this stage
We let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind


Got to deal with the Devil
Because you know that it's real
Done a deal with the Devil
From a heart made of steelEmbed
