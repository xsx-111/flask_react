Wheels of Fire Lyrics
Born on the other side
Of the track
Got to get out of here
I won't look back

Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive
Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire, let them roll

Too fast to give a damn
Stand my ground
No one or anything
Can tie me down


Ride to live
Live to ride
Wheels of fire
Forever

Wheels
Wheels of fire...Embed
