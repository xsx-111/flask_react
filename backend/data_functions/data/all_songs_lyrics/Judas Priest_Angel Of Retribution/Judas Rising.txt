Judas Rising Lyrics
White bolts of lightning
Came out of nowhere
Blinded the darkness
Creating the storm
War in the heavens
Vengeance ignited
Torment and tempest
Attacks like a swarm

Forged out of flame from chaos to destiny
Bringer of pain forever undying
Judas is rising

Eternal betrayer
Ice cold and evil
Taking no prisoners
Dark prince of the world (Dark prince of the world)
Humanity trembles
Enslaving you sinners
You can't beg for mercy
For none will be saved

The burden of shame
Echos the prophecy
Ascending from Hell
Forever despising
Judas is rising
Apprentice revealed
Deceivers are crying
My crucified steel
Evangelizing
Judas is rising
Judas is rising1Embed
