Snowblind Lyrics
The air is still we are struck like matches
Too beautiful to really care what's right
The rumours burn like roman candles
In the broken lights

This blood has lived in her
The blood has lived in you
For one snowblind moment
This love has lifted her
This love has lifted you
For one snowblind moment too

There's aniseed in your lace-wing kisses
The morning comes with the blackbird's song
We find our keys on the kitchen table
And forget what's done

This blood has lived in her
The blood has lived in you
For one snowblind moment
This love has lived in her
This love has lived in you
For one snowblind moment too
You are frozen by the moment
The thing is what can we do
When I'm frozen by the moment too
All the statues on the tube can't
Hold a candle to you
When you're frozen by the moment too

This blood has lived in her
The blood has lived in you
For one snowblind moment
This love has lifted her
This love has lifted you
For one snowblind moment too1Embed
