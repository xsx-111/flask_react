Sabotage LyricsShe knows that there are places I won't go
But if I did, I'd make her follow
A trail of seeds that leads across the road
And colours like a raven's shadow
Alone in the climate of her greed
Her heels on the wheels of nothing
Her love is sabotage
Her love is sabotage
I touch her things when I think I'm alone
With self control that approaches mania
No barriers, no boundaries for her
Her touch is like a raven's shadow
Alone in the climate of her greed
Her love is the shape of mother
Her love is sabotage
Her love is sabotage
Her will is done
Her will is done
Her will is done
I climb to the scaffold smiling
My hands on the cross I'm holding
Love is sabotage
Her love is sabotage
I smile as the rope cuts through me
So cold in this London summer
Love is sabotage
Her love is sabotage
And her will is done
And her will is done
And her will is done
And her will is done
And thy will be done
Thy will be done-Embed
