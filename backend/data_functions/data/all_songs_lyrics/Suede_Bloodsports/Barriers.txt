Barriers Lyrics
Aniseed kisses and lipstick traces
Lemonade sipped in Belgian rooms
Couldn't replace the graceful notions
That clung to me when I clung to you

And they touched you like no one touched you
When you broke they were there with glue
And their kindness was not a weakness
When they were there they were there for you

But will they love you
The way, the way I loved you?
We jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers

And our world it was wrapped in tinsel
Invitations and fountain pens
But the heart is a lonely hunter
It trapped you once and it'll trap you again

Will they love you
The way, the way I loved you?
We jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers
Will they love you
The way, the way I loved you?
We jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers

Jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriers
Jumped over the barriersEmbed
