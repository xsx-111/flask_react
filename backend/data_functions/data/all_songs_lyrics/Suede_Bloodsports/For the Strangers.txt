For the Strangers LyricsLips like semaphore to my heart
We slither and slide and slip
Stings like aerosol in my eyes
And nothing compares to this
And its ever so clear
And its ever so plain
For the strangers the strangers
And its ever so clear
And its ever so plain
For the all strangers out there
Pips from oranges spat away
To gutters and drains and bins
Left like promises on a train
When you delivered yourself to him
And its ever so clear
And its ever so plain
For the strangers the strangers
And its ever so clear
And its ever so plain
For the all strangers out there
A paper trail on the road
That was left for the gulls
Like the birds flying north
Its been growing guns
And its ever so clear
And its ever so plain
For the strangers the strangers
And its ever so clear
And its ever so plain
For the all strangers out there
For all the strangers
For all the strangers out there
For all the strangers
For all the strangers out there
For all the strangers
For all the strangers out there
For all the strangers
For all the strangers out thereEmbed
