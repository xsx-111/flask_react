Faultlines LyricsWith the sunrise burning into your green eyes
Adam and Eve on faultlines
Greet the golden dawn
Is it birdsong?
Or is it just the car alarms?
Making us feel so young, naked as the faun
Celebrate the pale dawn
Celebrate the birdsong
Celebrate, this is your time
Although we live in the wreckage and on the faultlines
And everything we owned
Not everything we are
With every word we breathe
We live, we live again
And you love me
More than I deserve to be
The palace of cards you built for me
Is all just paper now
Is it birdsong?
Or is it just the car alarms?
Making me feel so young
Savage like the dawn
Celebrate the pale dawn
Celebrate the birdsong
Celebrate, this is your time
Although we live in the wreckage and on the faultlines
And everything we owned
Not everything we are
With every word we breathe
We live, we live again
Celebrate
There is no fear now
There is no fear now
For us to feel
Celebrate
There is no fear now
There is no fear now
For us to feel, for us to feelEmbed
