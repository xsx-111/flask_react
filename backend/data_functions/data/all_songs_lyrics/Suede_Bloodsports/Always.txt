Always LyricsDon't wish it away, just say it's over to my face
I face the morning with dreams that make my pillow wet
She said she was into me but I was always in the way
She pushed me away
But I will always be near
I will always be near
Always be near
I set my clock for 7.30 every day
And wait for you like I'm in a book or in a play
I'm there outside with a weightlessness you can't escape
You can't wish me away
Cause I will always be near
I will always be near
Always be near

I will always be near
I will always be near
Always be near
Like a sniper in the wings, like the endless chattering
Like the rope that twists in your hand and it's starting again
Like a shadow on your lung, like the verse I've sung
Like the knife that twists in your hand and it's starting again
I will always be near
I will always be near
Always be nearEmbed
