Hit Me LyricsYou touch the place where we meet
Where you and I become she and he
I'm not as strong as I pretend to be
You feel the scratches and scars
You feel the parts of me we call ours
But drop me once
And I will fall to bits
Come on and hit me
With your majesty
Come on and hit me
With all your mystery

La la la la la...
And the moment we touch we are young
You feel my pulse and we become one
But drop me once
And I will fall to bits
Come on and hit me
With your majesty
Come on and hit me
With all your mystery
La la la la la...
Come on and hit me
With your majesty
Come on and hit me
With all your mystery
