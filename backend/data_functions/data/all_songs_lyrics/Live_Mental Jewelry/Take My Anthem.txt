Take My Anthem LyricsWar in me
War overseas
Ain't no difference between
Blood in me
Blood overseas
Ain't no difference between
War in me
War overseas
Ain't no difference between
The blood in me
And blood overseas
There ain't no difference, no difference, no difference between (nah)
The chills in your spine are, oh so sweet
People honor you so high
You've got to defend the stage at your feet
No!
Take, take - take my anthem today (now)
Take, take - take my anthem today
Take it away
Hands on me
And hands overseas
There ain't no difference between
And the heart in me (yeah)
And the heart overseas
There ain't no difference, no difference, no difference between (nah)
The chills in your spine are, oh so sweet
People honor you so high
You've got to defend the stage at your feet
No!
Take, take - take my anthem today (now yeah)
Take, take - take my anthem today
Take it away
I'll take it away
I'll take it away
I'll take it away (now)
I'll take it away
I'll take it away
I'll take it away
I'll take it away
(Oh no)
(Oh no)
(Oh no)
(Oh no)
The war in me
The war overseas
There ain't no difference between (yeah)
(No)Embed
