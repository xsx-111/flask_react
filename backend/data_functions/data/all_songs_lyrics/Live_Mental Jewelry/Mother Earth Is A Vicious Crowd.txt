Mother Earth Is A Vicious Crowd Lyrics
Pollution, Cain, and misery
Oceans of golden mystery
Armies boisterous and armies loud
Portraits of a vicious crowd

Talk to me, talk to me now
Hey, man, you're all that I have
Hey, man, you're all that I have

Me, myself, myself, and I
We're born to work and born to die
I have chosen my anthems, of these, I am proud
Portraits of a divided crowd

Talk to me, talk to me now
Hey, man, you're all that I have
Hey, man, you're all that I have
Hey, man, we're all that we have
Talk to me, talk to me now, yeah
Talk to me, talk to me now
Talk to me, talk to me now
Leave it behind
Could you leave it behind now?
Could you leave it behind, yeah, yeah
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Leave it all behind

Talk to me, talk to me now, yeah
Talk to me, talk to me now, oh
Talk to me, talk to me now

Oh
Talk to me now
Talk to me now
Oh, vicious crowd
Talk to me now
Oh, vicious, vicious crowd
Vicious crowd, vicious crowd
Talk to me now
Oh, vicious crowd
Talk to me, talk to me now
Oh, oh, oh yeah
Talk to me nowEmbed
