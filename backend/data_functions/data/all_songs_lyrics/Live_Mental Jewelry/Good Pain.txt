Good Pain LyricsHe said, he said, he said
"There was nothing to fear boy"
And he said, he said, he said
"Worthless are your tears boy"
"Just realize your senses
And realize your earth
Just relize your essence first"
I'll never know now
I'll never be the same again
I want to walk in the sun
I am alive and well again
No more bittersweet
No more good pain
No more
So many of us stand in the middle
Looking back to the worst
Looking forward to the fall
Making weapons of peace for the defense
Of the bloodstains on our
Peaceful sidewalks
You say the buildings got too tall
And they're going to fry your brother
Well I say you'd better walk away, walk
Away, walk away
And find your mother
No more bittersweet
No more good pain
If I can't sing this song
And tell you all about it
Then I'll just pack it up right now and
Walk away
Don't even doubt it
So when our sherry glass is full
And the day is way too young
You'd bettter sip today, sip today, sip today
Before it's done
No more bittersweet
No more good pain
No more good pain
No more good pain,good pain
No more good pain
No more good pain,good pain
So many of us stand in the middle
Looking back to the worst
Looking forward to the fall
Making weapons of peace for the defense
Of the bloodstains on our
Peaceful sidewalks
So many of us stand in the middle
Looking back to the worst
Looking forward to the fall
Making weapons of peace for the defense
Of the bloodstains on our
Peaceful sidewalks
There's a line we've got to cross tonight
There's a line you've got to cross tonight
There's a line we've got to cross tonight
There's a line you've got to cross tonight
No more bittersweet
No more good pain...
No more good pain
No more good pain, good pain
No more good pain
No more good pain, good pain....
No more weapon of peace, no more good pain
No more sickening sweet, no more good pain
No more famine and sweet, no more good pain
No more good painEmbed
