10,000 Years (Peace Is Now) Lyrics
The world is burning down
Can't you smell the smoke in the air?
War, disease, and famine
This demon, she is everywhere
Poets and preachers and politicians
They've all had their say
And we got ten thousand years devoted to nothing
But tomorrow and yesterday
Ten thousand years
Woah, woah

If all of the ignorance in the world
Passed a second ago
What would you say?
And who would you obey?
I am here to say that

Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace is now

Mr. President, I hereby pardon you of all your crimes
For they are just as much mine
For selfishness and separation have led me to believe
That the world is not my problem
The world is not my problem
I am the world
And you are the world
And I, yes, I am the world
And you are the world
If all of the ignorance in the world
Passed a second ago
What would you say?
And who would you obey now?
I am here to say that

Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace must be now

Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace is now, yeah
Peace is now, la-la-la, yeah, yeah, yeah, la-la-la, yeah
Peace is now, la-la-la, yeah, yeah, ah
Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace is now
Peace is nowEmbed
