Pain Lies On The Riverside Lyrics(I, I)
I have never taken life
Yet I have often paid the price
And you, you are a victim of this age
And the guilt that hangs around your neck
Has got me locked up in a cage
You've got to learn to live until no end
But first you must learn to swim
All over again
Oh no because...
Pain lies on the riverside (yes)
And pain will never say goodbye (no no)
Pain lies on the riverside
So put your feet in the water
Put your head in the water
Put your soul in the water
Join me for a swim tonight
I have forever, always tried
To stay clean and constantly baptized (oh)
I'm aware that the river's banks they are dry
And to wait for a flood
Is to wait for life
I've got to learn to live until no end
But first I must learn to swim all over again
Yeah yeah yeah because...
Pain lies on the riverside (yeah)
And pain will never say goodbye (no no)
Pain lies on the riverside
So put your feet in the water
Put your head in the water
C'mon put your soul in the water
Join me for a swim tonight
For a swim tonight
(Oh my Lord)
I've got to learn to live until no end
I've got to learn to swim
All over, all over, all over again
Yeah yeah yeah because
Pain lies on the riverside
(oooh nah nah nah nah)
And pain will never say goodbye (no no)
Pain lies on the riverside
So put your feet in the water
Put your head in the water now
C'mon put your soul in the water
Join me for a swim tonight
For a swim tonight
To swim (all over, all over, all over, all over again)
To live (all over, all over, all over, all over again)
Live (all over again)Embed
