Mirror Song LyricsI know that I should think about giving
And think about
Helping out
And think about
Think about living
But I can't seem to rescue myself
I know that I should think about giving
And think about
Helping out
And think about
Think about living
But I can't seem to rescue myself
What about my bank account
And my holy desert shield
That keep me dry under that arms?
Flags and mental jewelry's all I know
And they keep me happy and warm inside
So I said unto this man
"Who are you and where do you come from?"
And he proceeded to tell me many,many,many,many,many,many,many things
But I said nothing at all
For the flower in the corner, by the room
In the window, and the sun
Said it all
What about my bank account
And my holy desert shield
That keep me dry under that arms?
Flags and mental jewelry's all I know
And they keep me happy and warm inside
At least they said they would
Said they could
Mama Said they would
Do me good
I know that I should think about giving
And think about
Helping out
And think about
Think about living
But I can't seem to rescue myselfEmbed
