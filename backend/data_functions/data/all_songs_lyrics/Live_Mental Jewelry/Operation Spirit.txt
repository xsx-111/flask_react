Operation Spirit LyricsDid you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Heard a lot of talk about the ocean
Heard a lot of talk about the sea
Heard a lot of talk about a lot of things
Never meant that much to me
Heard a lot of talk about my spirit
Heard a lot of talk about my soul
But I decided that anxiety and pain
Were better friends
So I let it go
Did you let it go
Did you let it go
Did you let it go, my friend
Let's get it back
Let's get it back together,yeah! Woo!
Heard a lot of talk about this Jesus
A man of love, a man of strength
But what a man was two thousand years ago
Means nothing at all to me today
He could have been telling me about my
Higher self
But he only lives inside my prayer
So what he was may have been beautiful
But the pain is right now
And right here
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go, my friend
And let's get it back
Let's get it back together
Let's get it back together
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Did you give it up?
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go, my friend
And let's get it back
Let's get it back together
Let's get it back together
Let it go!
Let it go!
Let it go, my friend
And let's get it back
Let's get it back together
Let's get it back together, Oh yeah!Embed
