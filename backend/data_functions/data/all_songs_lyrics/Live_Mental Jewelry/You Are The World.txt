You Are The World Lyrics
If you've ever known love
If you've ever known peace
If you've ever known joy
Make sure that you are on time

If you've ever known war
If you've ever known pain
If you've ever said no
Make sure that you are on time
You are on time
That you are on time
We are on time

For you are the world
For you are the world
For you are the world
For you are the world, la-da-da-da

If you've ever known love
If you've ever known peace
If you've ever known joy
Make sure that you are on time
That you are on time, now, Lord
If you've ever known war
And if you've ever known pain
And if you've ever said no
Make sure that you are on time, Lord
You are on time
That you are on time now, yeah
That you are on time now

For you are the world
For you are the world
For you are the world
For you are the world, ah yeah

Fighting, mating, warring
You are all this now (Woo, yeah)
Be aware, not scared
Look at me now
Silence, I say

You are the world, yeah
You are the world, oh, Lord
You are the world, I said, I said
You are the world, ah yeah
If you've ever known love
If you've ever known peace
If you've ever known joy
Make sure that we are on timeEmbed
