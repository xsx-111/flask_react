Tired of Me Lyrics
You say, "Hold on to the reins"
I say, "Let them go tonight"
My brain waves, confused between what is and ain't
She cries, "Groundless and free"

Tired of the water
Tired of the wine
Tired of the future
Tired of time
Tired of the madness
Tired of the steel
Tired of the violence
Tired of me

Used steel, used steel am I
What was pliable in love is now hard and crystallized
The intellect is fine for counting money and recalling times
That she cried, "Groundless and free"

Tired of the water
Tired of the wine
Tired of the future
Tired of time
Tired of the madness
Tired of the steel
Tired of the violence
Tired of me
Tired of me, yeah
Oh-oh yeah

I'm so tired, I'm tired, yeah
I'm so tired, don't know why
And I'm so tired, I'm tired
And I'm so tired, don't know why, yeah
And hope is a letter that never arrives
Delivered by the postman of my fear

You say, "Hold on to the reins"
I say, "Let them go tonight"
My brain waves, confused between what is and ain't
She cries, "Groundless and free"

Tired of the water
Tired of the wine
Tired of the future
Tired of time
I am tired of the madness
I'm tired of the steel
Tired of the violence
Tired of me
Tired of me
Tired of me
Tired of me
Tired
Tired of meEmbed
