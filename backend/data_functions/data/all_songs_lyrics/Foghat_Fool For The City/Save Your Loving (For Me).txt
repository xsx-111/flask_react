Save Your Loving (For Me) LyricsPrice / Peverett - Knee Trembler Music - ASCAP
Listen to me baby, I'll tell you what I need
Come on and spend some time with me
Come on, one night is all I need, hey-hey
Give me satisfaction when you steady roll
Give me what you got and you can give me more
C'mon, that's how it's gotta be
I need somebody, save your loving for me
I need somebody, save your loving for me
Oh, I'm gonna rock you babe
C'mon, show me the games you play
Rock on until the break of day, hey-hey
Let me come on over spend some time with you
I know a lot of things that we can do
C'mon, don't give it all away
I need somebody, save your loving for me
I need somebody, save your loving for me
{Solo}
You're my all day study, you're my midnight dream
You need love, I need love, rock me baby, 'til I scream
I need somebody, save your loving for me
I need somebody, save your loving for me
I need somebody, save your sweet love for me
I need somebody, save your loving for me
I need, hoo hoo, I need your sweet loving
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby yeah
Give me some of your sweet, sweet lovingEmbed
