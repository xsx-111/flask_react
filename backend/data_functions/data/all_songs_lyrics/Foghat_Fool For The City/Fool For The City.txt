Fool For The City LyricsGoin' to the city, got you on my mind
Country sure is pretty, I'll leave it all behind
This is my decision, I'm comin' home to stay this time
'Cause I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
Fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
Breathin' all the clean air, sittin' in the sun
When I get my train fare, I'll get up and run
I'm ready for the city, air pollution here I come!
'Cause I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
I'm like a fish out of water
I'm just a man in a hole
The city lights turn my blues into gold
I ain't no country boy, I'm just a homesick man
I'm gonna hit the grit just as fast as I can
I'm tired of layin' back, hangin' around
I'm gonna catch that train, then I'll be city bound
I ain't no country boy, I'm just a homesick man
I'm gonna hit the grit just as fast as I can
I'll get off on Main Street, step into the crowd
Sidewalk under my feet, yeah, traffic's good and loud
When I see my inner city child, I'll be walkin' on a cloud
'Cause I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
I'm a fool for the city, I'm a fool for the city
I'm a fool, (Fool for the city) A fool for the city, (Fool for the city)
I'm a fool, (Fool for the city) A fool for the city, (Fool for the city)
I'm a fool, (Fool for the city) A crazy fool, (Fool for the city)
I'm a fool yea, (Fool for the city) A fool for the city, (Fool for the city)
Fool for the city
Fool for the city
I ain't no country boy, woo!
Fool for the city
Fool for the city
Woo!
Fool for the city
Fool for the city
A fool for the city (Fool for the city) (Fool for the city)
Whoo! (Fool for the city) (Fool for the city)Embed
