Take It Or Leave It LyricsAh yea, whoa, ah yea
Take it or leave it, tell me what you wanna do
Take it or leave it, now the choice is up to you
Can't wait until tomorrow, tomorrow may be too late
Take away the sorrow, I can't wait
Take it or leave it, can't I make you understand?
If you can believe it, you hold the future in your hand
If the choice was up to me girl, you would stay by my side
Our world would be a free world, ain't no lie
If our love was in vain, who's gonna help me hide the pain
Lonely days, lonely nights, without you girl, it's just not right
Oh it's just not right, whoa
{Rod - Solo}
Take it or leave it, I can't wait another day
I got love if you need it, won't you tell me right away
Losin' track of all the hours, Hours run into days
My mind is running out of power, you got me in a haze
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it
Got love if you need it, whoa, take it or leave it
Baby I want to know, I've got to know
Now if you need my love, tell me right now
Oh yea, tell me right now, yeah, yea
Lonely days, lonely nights
You know baby, it's a- it's just not rightEmbed
