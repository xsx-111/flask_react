My Babe LyricsI'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby, say my babe, she's so fine
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby, say my babe, she's so fine
I love to love my baby, love to love her all the time
Well I love her, don't you love her, say I love her, do you hear?
I love her, don't you love her, say I love her, do you hear?
Upsets my soul, she whispers sweet words in my ear
I love the way she walks, I love the way she talks
She makes me feel so good, just like a young man should
She never make me cry, that's why, she's my babe, she's my babe
Nothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater
And a real tight skirt, that don't fit
Nothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater
And a tight skirt, that don't fit
She wants to have fun, people let me tell you that's it!
I love the way she walks, (Strut that stuff)
I love the way she talks, (Vachement bien)
She makes me feel so good, (Feel so good)
Just like a young man should, (Feel so good)
She never make me cry - that's why, she's my babe - she's my babe
Alright!
{Rod - Slide Solo - 3 verses}
I love the way she walks, I love the way she talks
She makes me feel so good, just like a young man should
She never make me cry, that's why, oh baby, that's why .....
Talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby, say my baby, not your baby
Say my babe, she's so f-i-n-e
I love the way she walks, (Strut your stuff)
I love the way she talks, (Vachement bien)
She makes me feel so good, (Feel so good)
Just like a young man should, (Feel so good)
She never makes me cry, that's why, Oh!
I love the way she walks, (She's so fine)
I love the way she talks, (Feel so good)
She makes me feel so good, (Feel so good)
Just like a young man should, (Feel so good)
She never makes me cry, that's why, she's my babyEmbed
