Terraplane Blues LyricsRobert Johnson - Horoscope Music - BMI
Well I feel so lonesome - you'll hear me when I moan
Yes, I feel so lonesome - you'll hear me when I moan
Who been drivin' my Terraplane - for you since I been gone
I'd said I'll flash your lights, mama - and the horn won't even blow
I even flash my lights, mama - and this horn won't even blow
I got a short in this connection - way way down below
The coils ain't even buzzin' - the generator won't get that far
All in a bad condition, I gotta have the batteries charged
I'm cryin', please - plea-hease don't do me wrong
Who been drivin' my Terraplane ...
{Rod - Solo}
Mr. Highway man, please don't block the road
Mr. Highway man, please, don't block the road
She ran a cold one hundred, Booked and I got to go
I'll get deep down in this connection - keep on tanglin' with your wires
And when I mash down on your starter, your spark plug will give me fire
I'm crying please, please don't do me wrong
Who been drivin' my Terraplane ...
I said who?, yeah
Keep on tanglin' with your wires
Whoo!Embed
