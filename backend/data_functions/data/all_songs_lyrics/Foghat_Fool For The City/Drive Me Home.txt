Drive Me Home LyricsYeah, drive me 'ome, come on!
Well it's midnight, I feel alright, I'm as high as a Georgia pine
Tell all the world, 'bout that little girl of mine
But I cheated, I mistreated, lied with a heart of stone
Now I need somebody, to drive this bad boy home
Drive me home, drive me home
I can't make it on my own, drive me home
Baby won't you drive me home. Whoo!
I feel hazy and it's crazy, forgot everything, I know
Before I leave, give me one more for the road
All the sad songs and the bad songs the jukebox played tonight
A little rock and roll will make everything alright
Drive me home, drive me home
I can't make it on my own, drive me home
Baby won't you drive me, honey won't you drive me home
{Dave - Solo}
Drive me home, drive me home
Can't make it on my own, I'm stoned to the bone
Baby won't you drive me home
Yea, c'mon!
Yea, c'mon drive me home woman, I'm stoned to the bone
Oh let me get into your car. Stir the stick, whoo!
Put your foot down baby!
Ah, ya haven't been drinkin' have ya?
Ya have? Up ahead, slow down
You're goin' too fast, look out, oh! (Crash!)
Fuckin' hell! What are you doin'? Oh, ... Oh, look out for that tree!
C'mon and drive me home, c'mon and drive me home
C'mon and drive me home, c'mon and drive me home
C'mon and drive me home, c'mon and drive me home
C'mon and drive me home, c'mon and drive me...
Home, home, home ....Embed
