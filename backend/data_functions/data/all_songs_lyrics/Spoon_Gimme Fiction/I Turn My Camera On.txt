I Turn My Camera On Lyrics
I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way
The way I'm slippin away
I turn my feelings off
Y'made me untouchable for life
And you wasn't polite

It hit me like a tom
You hit me like a tom
On on and on

When I turn my feelings on
I turn my feelings on inside
Feel like I'm gonna ignite
I saw them stars go off
I saw them stars go off at night
And they're looking alright
Keep on blowin up
Keep on blowin em off
Get up roll it out
Keep on showin em out
Y'hit me like a tom
It hit me like a tom
On and on a tom

I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way
I feel me slippin away
I wipe my feelings off
Y'made me untouchable for life
And you wasn't polite

Y'hit me like a tom
I don't know where it's from
It hit me like a tom-tom
