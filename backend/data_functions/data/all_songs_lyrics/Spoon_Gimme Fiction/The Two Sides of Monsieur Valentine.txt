The Two Sides of Monsieur Valentine LyricsEvery morning I've got a new chance
I want to land the part of Eddie in The Stranger Dance
Because he gets to swordfight the duke, he kidnaps the queen
And you think the score's set but you can't truly see
'Til you know the two sides of Monsieur Valentine
'Til you know the two sides of Monsieur Valentine
Every morning, I pull on them pants
But I don't get out so much since I acquired St. Vitus' dance
I turn the news on a while, I practice my scene
You think things are straight but they're not what they seem
'Til you know the two sides of Monsieur Valentine
In his coat and his boots and his blackheart machine
No, no one knows the two sides of Monsieur Valentine, oh yeah
Every morning I've got a new chance
I want to play the part of Eddie in The Stranger Dance
He makes love to the duke, he swordfights the queen
He steals the whole show in his last dying scene
No one sees the two sides of Monsieur Valentine
No, no one sees the two sides of Monsieur Valentine
Oh, no one sees the two sides of Monsieur Valentine, oh yeahEmbed
