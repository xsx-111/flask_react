My Mathematical Mind Lyrics
I want to change your mind
Said I want to set it right this time
I'm looking through you
You know who you are
And planning for the apocalypse
Is not considered
Considered cool
I don't suggest it myself
But no I won't sweat
I want to change your ways
Said I'm going to get it right one of these days
And I'm looking through you
Riding the brakes
Bringing about the apocalypse
Is not considered
Considered cool
Still you go setting it up
But never give it a thought
Just got setting it up

My mathematical mind can see the breaks
So I'm going to stop riding the brakes
No more riding the brakes
Instead I'm going to see your stakes
Yeah I'm going to see the stakes2Embed
