Uncle Remus Lyrics
Whoa, are we moving too slow
Have you seen us, Uncle Remus
We look pretty sharp in these clothes (Yes, we do)
Unless we get sprayed with a hose
It ain't bad in the day if they squirt it your way
Except in the winter when it's froze
And it's hard if it hits on your nose (On your nose)

Just keep your nose to the grindstone they say
Will that redeem us, Uncle Remus
I can't wait 'til my fro is full grown
I'll just throw away my du-rag at home
I'll take a drive to Beverly Hills just before dawn
And knock the little jockeys off the rich people's lawn
And before they get up I'll be gone, I'll be gone
Before they get up I'll be knocking the jockeys off the lawn
Down in the dew2Embed
