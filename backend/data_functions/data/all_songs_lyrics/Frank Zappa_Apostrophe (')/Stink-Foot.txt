Stink-Foot Lyrics
In the dark where all the fevers grow
Under the water where the shark bubbles blow
In the morning by your radio
Do the walls close in to suffocate ya
You ain't got no friends an' all the others: they hate ya
Does the life you been leadin' gotta go, hmmm?
Well, lemme straighten you out about a place I know
Get yer shoes and socks on people, it's right around the corner!

Out through the night an' the whispering breezes
To the place where they keep The Imaginary Diseases
Out through the night an' the whispering breezes
To the place where they keep the Imaginary Diseases, mmm
This has to be the disease for you
Now scientists call this disease bromidrosis
But us regular folks who might wear tennis shoes
Or an occasional python boot
Know this exquisite little inconvenience
By the name of: "Stink-Foot"

Y'know, my python boot is too tight
I couldn't get it off last night
A week went by, and now it's July
I finally got it off
And my girlfriend cry
"You got stink-foot!
Stink-foot, darlin'
Your stink-foot puts a hurt on my nose!
Stink-foot! Stink-foot! I ain't lyin'
Can you rinse it off, d'you suppose?"
Here Fido! Fido!
C'mere little puppy, bring the slippers
"Arf, arf, arf!"
Heh heh heh... sick

Well then Fido got up off the floor an' he rolled over
An' he looked me straight in the eye
An' you know what he said?
"Once upon a time, somebody say to me"
(This is a dog talking now)
"What is your Conceptual Continuity?"
"Well, I told him right then"
(Fido said)
"It should be easy to see
The crux of the biscuit is the Apostrophe"
Well, you know the man who was talkin' to the dog
Looked at the dog an' he said: (sort of staring in disbelief)
"You can't say that!"
He said:
"It doesn't, and you can't!
I won't, and it don't!
IT hasn't, it isn't, it even ain't
And it shouldn't
It couldn't!"
He told me "No no no!"
I told him "Yes yes yes"!
I said: "I do it all the time;
Ain't this boogie a mess!"
