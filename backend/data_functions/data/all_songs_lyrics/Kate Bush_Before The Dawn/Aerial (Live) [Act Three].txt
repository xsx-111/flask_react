Aerial (Live)  Lyrics
Ring it
Shake it down
Bring it on
Let it in

The dawn has come
And the wine will run
And the song must be sung
And the flowers are melting
In the sun

I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I feel I gotta be up on the roof
I feel I need to be up on the roof
I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I feel I wanna be high on the roof
Up, up on the roof
Up, up on the roof

And the wine will run
And the song must be sung
And the flowers are melting
What kind of language is this?
What kind of language is this?
I can't hear a word you're saying
Tell me what you are singing
In the sun


All of the birds are laughing
All of the birds are laughing
Come on let's all join in
Come on let's all join in
I want to be up on the roof
I've gotta be up on the roof
Up, up high on the roof
Up, up on the roof
In the sun

I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I feel I need to be up on the roof
I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I feel I wanna be up on the roof
Up, up on the roof
High, high on the roof
In the sun

Come on, come on, see my beautiful wings
My beautiful wings are ready to fly
You'd better get up on that roof
You'd better get up on that roof

Come on, come on, see my beautiful wings
My beautiful wings are ready to fly
You'd better get up on that roof

My beautiful wings, my beautiful wings
My beautiful wings, my beautiful wings
My beautiful wings, my beautiful wings
