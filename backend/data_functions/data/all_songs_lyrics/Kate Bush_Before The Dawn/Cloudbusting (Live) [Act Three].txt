Cloudbusting (Live)  Lyrics
I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark
What made it special
Made it dangerous
So I bury it
And forget

But every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
And I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
And you looked too small
In their big black car
To be a threat to the men in power
I hid my yo-yo
In the garden
But I can't hide you
From the government
Oh, God, Daddy
I won't forget

'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
And I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, yeah


And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen
And I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen
Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen, oh, yeah
Just saying it could even make it happen
I wanna hear ya!
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
"We're cloudbusting, daddy"
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Alright!
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
That's more like it!
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo

The sun's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Your son's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo

Oh, my god. Thank you so much. What a beautiful sight, look at you all. Ah! I will always remember this. This is beautiful. Thank you so muchEmbed
