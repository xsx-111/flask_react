King of the Mountain (Live)  Lyrics
Could you see the aisles of women?
Could you see them screaming and weeping?
Could you see the storm rising?
Could you see the guy who was driving?
Could you climb higher and higher?
Could you climb right over the top?
Why does a multi-millionaire
Fill up his home with priceless junk?

The wind is whistling
The wind is whistling
Through the house

Elvis are you out there somewhere
Looking like a happy man?
In the snow with Rosebud
And king of the mountain

Another Hollywood waitress
Is telling us she's having your baby
And there's a rumour that you're on ice
And you will rise again someday
And that there's a photograph
Where you're dancing on your grave
The wind is whistling
The wind is whistling
Through the house
The wind is whistling
The wind is whistling
Through the house

Elvis are you out there somewhere
Looking like a happy man?
In the snow with Rosebud
And king of the mountain
Elvis are you out there somewhere
Looking like a happy man?
In the snow with Rosebud
And king of the mountain now

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooooooh!

The wind it blows
The wind it blows the door closed
The wind it blows
The wind it blows
The wind is whistling
The wind is whistling
Through the house
The wind it blows
The wind it blows


The wind it blows
The wind it blows
A-ha! A-ha!
Oh, there's a storm rising
The wind it blows
The wind it blows
A-ha! A-ha!
Oh, there's a storm rising
Can't you see it?
Can't you see it?
There's a storm rising!

Oh, the wind it blows
Oh, the wind it blows
A-ha! A-ha!
Oh, there's a storm rising
Yes, there's a storm rising
Can't you feel it?
Can't you feel it rising?
Oh, the wind
Oh, the wind it blowsEmbed
