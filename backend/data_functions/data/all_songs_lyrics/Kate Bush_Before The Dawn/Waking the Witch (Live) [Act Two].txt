Waking the Witch (Live)  Lyrics
"Wake up."
"A good morning, ma'am. Your early morning call."
"You must wake up."
"Wake up."
"Wake up, man!"
"Wake up, child! Pay attention!"
"Come on, wake up!"
"Wake up, love!"
"We should make the night, but see your little lights alive."
"Stop that lying and sleeping in bed; get up!" ("Ma needs a shower, get out of bed!")
"Little light..."
"Can you not see that little light up there?"
"Where?"
"There!"
"Where?"
"Over here..."
"You still in bed?!"
"Wake up, sleepy head!"
"We are of the going water and the gone
"We are of water in the Holy Land of water."
"Don't you know you've kept him waiting?!"
"Look who's here to see you!"

Listen to me, listen to me, baby!
Listen, baby, help me!
Baby, help me, help me!
Listen to me, talk to me!
You won't burn
Red, red roses
You won't bleed
Pinks and posies
Confess to me, girl!
Red, red roses
Go down!

Spiritus Sanctus in nomine...
Spiritus Sanctus in nomine...
Spiritus Sanctus in nomine...
Spiritus Sanctus in nomine...

Poor little thing
Red, red roses
The blackbird
Pinks and posies
Wings in the water
Red, red roses
Go down!
Go down!
Pinks and posies
Deus et dei domino inferno...
Deus et dei domino inferno...
Deus et dei domino inferno...
Deus et dei domino inferno...

What is it, child?
Bless me, father
Bless me father
For I have sinned, uh
Help me, listen to me, listen to me, tell me!
(Red, red roses...)
Help me, baby! Don't go!
(Red, red roâ€” ...)

I question... your innocence
She's a witch!
Help this blackbird!
There's a stone around my leg
Damn you, woman!
Help this blackbird!
There's a stone around my leg
What say you, good people?!
"Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!"
Help this blackbird!
Well, are you responsible for your actions?
Wake up the witch...
Help this blackbird!
"Get out of the waves!"
"Get out of the water!"

Okay, Jim, there's no sign of her. Backtrack up the search area to the northern quadrant. Woah, woah... hover still a moment. Is that something in the water there at about 4 o'clock? Swing to starboard 3-1-20. Good. Good. Now, drop down to about 40 feet


No, false alarm. It's just a lump of flotsam, probably from the wreck. As you were, Jim. North by northwest against her likely drift


Roger that, command. Can confirm we've now hoisted up the crew of the "Celtic Deep" and all but one of the passengers. Bit shaken up, some minor injuries, but nothing major. Sticks in the craw to leave the job unfinished, so we'll continue searching the area for the missing female as long as we've got fuel in the tank. Better have the police track down the passenger list and contact her family pronto. Over
Help this blackbird!1Embed
