Prologue (Live)  Lyrics
Over here!
Over here!

We're gonna be laughing about this
We're gonna be dancing around
It's gonna be so good now
It's gonna be so good

Oh, so exciting
Mmm, go on and on
Every time you leave us
So Summer will be gone
So you'll never grow old to us

It's gonna be so good now
It's gonna be so good
Can you see the lark ascending?
What a lovely afternoon

Oh, so romantic
Swept me off my feet
Like some kind of magic
Like the light in Italy
Lost its way across the sea
Roma, Roma mia
Tesoro mio, bella
Pieno di sole luce
Balli cos√¨ bene, bene

Pianissimo
Pianissimo
What a lovely afternoon
What a lovely afternoon

Oh, can you hear the birdsong?
The mistlethrush and the wood pidgeon
The chaffinch and the robin
The blackbird and the siskin
Like golden light dripping
And golden bells...


Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding dong
Ring it, shake it down
Bring it on, let it in
Ring it, shake it down
Bring it on, let it in
Ring it, shake it down
Bring it on, let it in
Ring it, shake it down
Bring it on, let it in

Summer has come
Summer be long

What a lovely afternoon
What a lovely afternoon
Oh, will you come with us
To find the song of the oil and brush?Embed
