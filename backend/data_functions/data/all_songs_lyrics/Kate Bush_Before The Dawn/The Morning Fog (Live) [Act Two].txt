The Morning Fog (Live)  Lyrics
The light
Begin to bleed
Begin to breathe
Begin to speak
D'you know what?
I love you better now

And I am falling
Like a stone
Like a storm
Being born again
Into the sweet morning fog
D'you know what?
I love you better now
D'you know what?
I love you better now

And I'm falling
And I'd love to hold you know

Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
I'll kiss the ground
I'll tell my mother
I'll tell my father
I'll tell my loved ones
I'll tell my son
I'll tell my sisters
I'll tell my brothers
How much I love them

Oh, my goodness. Thank you. Thank you. What an overwhelming response. Thank you so muchEmbed
