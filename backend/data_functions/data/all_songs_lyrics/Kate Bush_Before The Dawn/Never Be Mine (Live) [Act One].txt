Never Be Mine (Live)  Lyrics
I look at you and see
My life that might have been
Your face just ghostly in the smoke
They're setting fire to the cornfields
As you're taking me home
The smell of burning fields
Will now mean you and here

This is what I want
This is where I want to be
This is what I need
This is where I need to be
This is what I want
But I know, I know that this will never be mine

The thrill and the hurting
The thrill and the hurting


I want you as the dream
Not the reality
That clumsy goodbye kiss could fool me
But looking back over my shoulder
At you happy without me
This is what I want
This is where I want to be
This is what I want
This is where I need to be
This is what I want
But I know, I know, I know
Oh, I know, oh, I know...

The thrill and the hurting
The thrill and the hurting
Can never be...

This is what I need
This is what I wantEmbed
