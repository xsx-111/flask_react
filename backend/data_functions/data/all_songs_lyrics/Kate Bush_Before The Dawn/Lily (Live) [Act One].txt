Lily (Live)  Lyrics
"Oh thou, who givest sustenance to the universe
From whom all things proceed
To whom all things return
Unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun
Hidden by a disc of golden light
That we may know the truth
And do our whole duty
As we journey to thy sacred feet"

"Good evening!"

Well I said, "Lily, oh, Lily I don't feel safe
I feel that life has blown a great big hole through me"

And she said, "Child
You must protect yourself
You must protect yourself
I'll show you how, with fire"

Gabriel before me
Raphael behind me
Michael to my right
Uriel on my left side
In the circle of fire
I said, "Lily, oh, Lily I'm so afraid
I fear I am walking in the Veil of Darkness"

And she said, "Child
Take what I say
With a pinch of salt
And protect yourself with fire"

Gabriel before me
Raphael behind me
Michael to my right
Uriel on my left side
In the circle of fire


Who's on the left? Who's on the right?
Gabriel before me
Raphael behind me
To the right
Michael to my right
Got the devil to handle
Uriel on my left side
And Michael here in the light
In the circle of fire
Gabriel before me
Raphael behind me
Michael to my right
Uriel on my left side
And put your angels up
In the circle of fire
And put them all around usEmbed
