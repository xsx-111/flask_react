Hello Earth (Live)  Lyrics
In-board cut-off
In-board engines out
We confirm inboard cut-off
Down range 35 miles, 30 miles high. Standing by for the off-board engine cutdown now
And ignition
11, Houston. Thrust is Go, all engines, you're looking good
Columbia now 9 times the speed of sound
Roger that, Dan, I've got a solid TACAN locked on, uh, TACAN 23
The, uh, tracking data, map data, and pre-planned trajectory are all one line on the block

Hello, Earth
Hello, Earth
With just one hand held up high
I can blot you out, out of sight
Peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo, little Earth
With just my heart and my mind, driving home
And you asleep on the seat

I'd get out of my car
Step into the night
And look up at the sky
And there's something bright
Traveling fast
Just look at it go!
Just look at it go!


Hello, Earth
Hello, Earth
Watching storms start to form
Over America
Can't do anything
Just watch them swing with the wind out to sea

All you sailors
Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!
All life-savers
Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!
All you cruisers
Get out of the waves! Get out of the water!
All you fishermen head for home
Go to sleep, little Earth

I was there at the birth
Out of the cloudburst, the head of the tempest
Murderer!
Murderer of calm!
Why did I go?
Why did I go?


Tiefer, tiefer
Irgendwo in der tiefe
Gibt es ein licht
Go to sleep, little Earth...1Embed
