Tawny Moon (Live)  Lyrics
I'll give every cloud a silver lining
Every star will be bright and shining
Tawny owls swoop, the howling wolf
Every swimming pool will shiver with excitement
I've made the wind blow and starry heavens hang
I ache from head to toe, I've got blisters on my hands

Oh man, I'm painting the moon tonight
Oh man, I'm painting the moon tonight

She's been travelling o'er the plains of Africa
Climbing every mountain near and far
Near and far, far and near

Oh, my love, my love, my Luna
Night is nearly here
Here comes the night, she shimmies across the track
I've got to get it just right, I've got blisters on my hands

Ladies and gentlemen
We present to you tonight... the Moon!
Come on, don't be shy!
Tawny Moon
I'm gonna dance all night with Tawny Moon

Just a touch of liver
Mixed with the glow
I'll paint the face that had made the oceans roll
Bright and full, mystical

Oh, my love, my love, my Luna
I hear you call
You wrote the book on love then threw it away
You'd better all behave when Luna takes the stage

Oh, man, look at the moon tonight
Oh, man, a magical moon tonight

Can you hear the nightingale?
Sweetly sung
She knows precisely why
The unrequited poet cries
She comes, she goes
She goes, she comes
Oh, my love, my love, my Luna
Queen of Bedlam
Make the woodwind blow and strike up the band
I've got to get it just right, I've got blisters on my hands

Rise and shine, Tawny Moon
I'm gonna paint all night with the Tawny Moon
I'm gonna dance all with with the Tawny Moon1Embed
