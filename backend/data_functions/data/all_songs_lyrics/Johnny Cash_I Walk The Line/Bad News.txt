Bad News Lyrics
Ha ha ha, Come on, bad news, ha ha
Well, bad news travels like wild fire, good news travels slow
They all call me Wildfire, ha ha, because everybody knows
I'm bad news everywhere I go

Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me go
They tried to hang me in Oakland and the did in Francisco
But I wouldn't choke, I broke their rope and they had to let me go
Because I'm bad news everywhere I go

Well, now I've picked peaches in Georgia, I lumber jacked in Maine
I've been hired, fired and jailed in any town you can name
Because I'm bad news everywhere I go
Always getting in trouble and leaving little girls that hate to see me goEmbed
