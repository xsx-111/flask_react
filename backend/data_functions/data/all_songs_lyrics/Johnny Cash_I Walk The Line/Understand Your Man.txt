Understand Your Man Lyrics
Don’t call my name out your window, I’m leaving
I won’t even turn my head
Don’t send your kinfolk to give me no talking
I’ll be gone, like I said
You’d just say the same old things
That you be saying all along
Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut
Till I’m gone
Don’t give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
Understand your man
I'm tired of your bad mouthing
Understand your man
Now, you can give my other suit to the Salvation Army
And everything else I leave behind
I ain't taking nothing that'll slow down my traveling
While I'm untangling my mind
I ain't going to repeat what i said anymore
While I'm breathing air that ain't been breathed before
I'll be as gone to as a wild goose in winter
Then you'll understand your man
Meditate on it
Understand your man
You hear me talking now
Understand your man
Remember what i told ya
Understand your man1Embed
