Hey Porter Lyrics
Hey porter, hey porter!
Would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be 'til we cross
That Mason-Dixon Line?
At daylight, would ya tell that engineer
To slow it down?
Or better still, just stop the train
'cause I want to look around

Hey porter, hey porter!
What time did you say?
How much longer will it be 'til I
Can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie, will you tell that engineer
To ring his bell?
And ask everybody that ain't asleep
To stand right up and yell

Hey porter, hey porter!
It's getting light outside
This old train is puffing smoke
And I have to strain my eyes
But ask that engineer if he
Will blow his whistle please
'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
And I feel that Southern breeze
Hey porter, hey porter!
Please get my bags for me
I need nobody to tell me now
That we're in Tennessee
Go tell that engineer to make
That lonesome whistle scream
We're not so far from home
So take it easy on the steam


Hey porter, hey porter!
Please open up the door
When they stop the train, I'm gonna get off first
'cause I can't wait no more
Tell that engineer I said thanks a lot
And I didn't mind the fare
I'm going to set my feet on Southern soil
And breathe that Southern air2Embed
