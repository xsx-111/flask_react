Another Life Lyrics

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away, yeah
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end todayEmbed
