Drifter Lyrics
Rock and roll, yeah!

Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sitting here, think it's gonna be a new day
Gonna get my song and I can't go wrong
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song

I keep on drifting

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
And it won't take long
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
I want you to sing along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah!Embed
