Wrathchild Lyrics
I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be

And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Oh... yeah!

Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious peace of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Yeah!2Embed
