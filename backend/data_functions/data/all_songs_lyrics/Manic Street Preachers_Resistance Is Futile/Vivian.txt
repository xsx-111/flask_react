Vivian Lyrics
You work these streets with a camera round your neck
It's your weapon of choice, it's your ultimate defence
I've seen your face but I've really seen your smile
Did you leave the ruins or did you build a life?

Vivian, did you ever realise?
All that mystery that you left behind

Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian

I've looked inside your soul but we never heard your voice
Did we ever see beneath your disguise?
The museums and galleries have become your home
Would it mean that much if you were looking down?

Vivian, did you ever recognise?
All that history you never compromised
Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
(Did you ever recognise?)
Ah, Vivian
(You never compromised)

Vivian, did you ever recognise?
All that history you never compromised

Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
Ah, Vivian
(Did you ever realise?)
Ah, Vivian
(The mystery you left behind)
Ah, Vivian
(Did you ever recognise?)
Ah, Vivian
(You never compromised)Embed
