Hold Me Like a Heaven Lyrics
I walk between the dividing lines
I dance around the exit signs
I hate the world more than I hate myself
I can't pretend that it's a cry for help

Tattered manifestos litter the mind
Diplomatic plans ravaged by time
It never really was the truth or lies
We just gave up and said our goodbyes

So hold me, hold me, hold me like a heaven
I want some faith and wanna be forgiven
I wanna feel your divine intervention
So hold me, hold me
So hold me, hold me like I'm lost in your heaven

What is the future of the future?
When memory fades and gets boarded up
All the ties that bind have come undone
Seconds of hate, tiny screams of love

So hold me, hold me, hold me like a heaven
I want some faith and wanna be forgiven
I wanna feel your divine intervention
So hold me, hold me
So hold me, hold me like I'm lost in your heaven
So hold me, hold me, hold me like a heaven
I want some faith and wanna be forgiven
I wanna feel your divine intervention
So hold me, hold me
So hold me, hold me like I'm lost in your heavenEmbed
