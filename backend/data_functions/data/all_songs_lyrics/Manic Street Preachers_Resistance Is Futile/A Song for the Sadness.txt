A Song for the Sadness Lyrics
Memories are all we leave?
Fragments of lost melancholy
Traces of a generation gone
Tiny pieces of broken glass
Sh-sh-sh-shining like golden glitter
Looking up at the dying stars
Unloved by all who pass this way
I never really got a chance to say

Like islands in the stream that get washed away
One more time in the ghetto you say
I've convinced myself that I have walked the line
I've never deserted by luck or by design
A song for the sadness
To clear away the madness
A song for the sadness
A song for the sadness

You made me with a true kindness
That I still feel runs through my flesh
Out of us time made such a mess
I can't ignore and I must confess
Like islands in the stream that get washed away
One more time in the ghetto you say
I've convinced myself that I have walked the line
I've never deserted by lack or by design
A song for the sadness
To clean away the badness
A song for the sadness
A song for the sadness
A song for the sadness
To clear away the madness
A song for the sadness
A song for the sadnessEmbed
