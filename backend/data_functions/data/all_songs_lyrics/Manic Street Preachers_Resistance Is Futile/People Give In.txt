People Give In Lyrics
People get tired
People get old
People get forgotten
People get sold
People get sold

There is no theory of everything
No immaculate conception, no crime to forgive
Torn between the then and now
Never really knowing the why and how
People break down
People move on
People can't cope
People stay strong
People give in
People stay strong

People get happy
People get lost
People cave inwards
People lose trust
People lose trust
There is no theory of everything
No immaculate conception, no crime to forgive
Torn between the then and now
Never really knowing the why and how
(Woah)
People break down
People move on
People can't cope
People stay strong
People give in
People stay strong

Break down
Move on
Stay strong
Break down
Move on
Break down
Stayâ€¦

There is no theory of everything
No immaculate conception, no crime to forgive
Torn between the then and now
Never really knowing the why and how
People break down
People move on
People can't cope
People stay strong
People give in
People stay strongEmbed
