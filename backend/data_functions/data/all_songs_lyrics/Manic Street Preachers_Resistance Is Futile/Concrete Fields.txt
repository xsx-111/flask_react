Concrete Fields Lyrics
My old school has closed its doors
The once green fields are now concrete floors
And the roads are choking, full of misery and fear
But my vision's getting clearer and my mind it feels so free
And the work is hard and the wages are low
But the smiles still appear and the rivers still flow
And all I can do is sit here and moan
But my heart still bleeds for this place that I call home


My boyhood made of dreams of love
The happiest of times sitting with my mum and dad
But the bridges, the houses now dominate
The vaping and the super schools, the breeding grounds of hate
But those once green fields still live in my mind
They seemed so perfect so simple and so kind
Just me and my brother were kicking a ball
The world so close and so beautiful
And I got no answers, I place no blame
I just feel longing and I wanna hear you name
As I walk and I run through these once green fields
It's easy to see what has disappeared
And the air is getting heavy with memory and loss
The joy and the freedom, but freedom at what cost?
And the air is getting heavy with memory and loss
The joy and the freedom, but freedom at what cost?


Is this your inheritance? Is this all that's left?
The mountains we climbed are now mountains of debt
And the air is getting heavy with memory and loss
The joy and the freedom, but freedom at what cost?
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun
Yeah, we had joy, we had fun, we had some seasons in the sun
Yeah, we had joy, we had fun, we had some seasons in the sun
Yeah, we had joy, we had fun, we had some seasons in the sunEmbed
