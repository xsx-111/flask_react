In Eternity Lyrics
I fell in love, in love with you a million times
Your clothes, your hair and the sweetest of smiles
We'll never see, see the like of you again
A master of pleasure and a master of pain

Dark is a way
Light is a place

Closed the curtains in L.A
Opened them up on a Berlin day
Self-made and self-realised
Always ready to disguise
In eternity
In death as in life
In eternity
The king and queen of style

There is no journey, no start and no ending
We all still arrive and keep on departing
You place a light on a different universe
Made life better with the wonder of your words
Dark is a way
Light is a place

Closed the curtains in L.A
Opened them up on a Berlin day
Self-made and self-realised
Always ready to disguise
In eternity
In death as in life
In eternity
The king and queen of...


Closed the curtains in L.A
Opened them up on a Berlin day
Self-made and self-realised
Always ready to disguise
In eternity
As death as in life
In eternity
The king and queen of style

Closed the curtains in L.A
Opened them up on a Berlin dayEmbed
