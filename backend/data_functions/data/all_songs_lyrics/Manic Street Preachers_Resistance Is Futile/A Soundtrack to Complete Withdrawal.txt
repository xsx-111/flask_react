A Soundtrack to Complete Withdrawal Lyrics
Everything has no one to save us
(Fraction mammoths, the gaps are growing)
The dying decades, that first reveals all
Total withdrawal, silence for all
The last generation by polarisation
Solitary youth, this laziness finds its truth

I will be your weakness, I will help you make sense
I will be your battle ground, can I tie your blindfold?

So far while you hold my fingers tight
Second soundtrack to withdraw tonight
So far while you hold my fingers tight
Second soundtrack to withdraw tonight

So keep walking slow like a pilgrim
(Even when your heart is breaking)
A gentle crew rise to their feet you know
Total withdrawal, silence for all
The last generation by polarisation
Solitary youth, this laziness finds its truth
I will be your weakness, I will help you make sense
I will be your battle ground, can I tie your blindfold?

So far while you hold my fingers tight
Second soundtrack to withdraw tonight
So far while you hold my fingers tight
Second soundtrack to withdraw tonight


So far while you hold my fingers tight
Second soundtrack to withdraw tonight
So far while you hold my fingers tight
Second soundtrack to withdraw tonightEmbed
