Holding Patterns Lyrics
The universe it waits
All the miseries that we make
The global emptiness
Identikit heroes, giant alter-egos
Internal monologues
The branded demagogues
To all the first responders
And all the early adopters

Bad blood chlorine
The most modern of our pain
Perpetual, eventual
Perpetual slavery, eventual shame
Holding patterns are all that matter
Holding patterns draw back curtains
Hold back morning, no returning

All the mess we made
Failure to communicate
The missing millions
All are sinning from the beginning
No point in hanging on
Legacies are too far gone
Scared souls are never free
Black moons and hyper-galaxies
Bad blood chlorine
The most modern of our pain
Perpetual, eventual
Perpetual slavery, eventual shame
Holding patterns are all that matter
Holding patterns draw back curtains
Hold back morning, no returning


Bad blood chlorine
The most modern of our pain
Perpetual, eventual
Perpetual slavery, eventual shame
Holding patterns are all that matter
Holding patterns draw back curtains
Hold back morning, no returningEmbed
