The Left Behind Lyrics
From an open book to a closed shop
Feeling like an animal
The one that time forgot
The squadron never dies, falls quickly to demise
Some self-sacrifice, some limits to your vice
Oh!

I never wanted you to change
I prefer to stay the same
I never wanted it to change, oh yeah

Waiting for the end of time
Waiting to be left behind
Acting like a passer-by
Waiting for the end of time

I was lonesome warrior
I was a willing conquistador
I believed in a higher truth, believed it more than you
The squadron never dies, falls quickly to demise
Some self-sacrifice, some limits to your voice
My fingernails are getting broken
My grip is somehow getting loose
I never wanted it to change, oh yeah

Waiting for the end of time
Waiting to be left behind
Acting like a passer-by
Waiting for the end of time
We'll be
Waiting for the end of time
Waiting to be left behind
Acting like a passer-by
Waiting for the end of time
