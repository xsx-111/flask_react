Mirror Gaze Lyrics
I've made some sense of emptiness
I've learnt to love me less and less
I finally let go of my weaker self
I made the crash and I made the wreck
I've got no time to stand and correct
'Cause everybody hurts
Like the wise man said

I built the rod
For my own back
I got the monkey
Sitting on my neck

Beyond all this
Oblivion runs
Beyond all this
There lies a place for us
Beyond all this
There lies another way
Beyond all this
Oblivion runs
Beyond all this
There lies a place for us
Beyond my eyes
There is a mirror gaze
Only in a poem do you find some truth
The fiction is merely a hiding place
The mirror's my enemy
The shadows are my friend
I've made some sense of emptiness
I've learnt to love me less and less
I finally let go of my weaker self

I built the rod
For my own back
I got the monkey
Sitting on my neck

Beyond all this
Oblivion runs
Beyond all this
There lies a place for us
Beyond all this
There lies another way
Beyond all this
Oblivion runs
Beyond all this
There lies a place for us
Beyond my eyes
There is a mirror gaze
There lies another way
There lies another way


Beyond all this
Oblivion runs
Beyond all this
There lies a place for us
Beyond all this
There lies another way
Beyond all this
Oblivion runs
Beyond all this
There lies a place for us
Beyond all this
There lies another wayEmbed
