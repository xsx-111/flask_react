Distant Colours Lyrics
Say what you want
Break my heart a thousand times
But it's still right here
So you left me with lies
Let the banners unfold
Let them fall to the floor
We once had each other
But now we're not so sure

Are we living in the past?
Where there's nothing left to fear
Won't you say that you love me?
Tell me what I want to hear
A cold war for the mind
My distant colours still bleeding
A broken promise for the soul
Never loving never healing

I no longer know my left from my right
Between your hopes and fears
And my choice to decide
So say what you want
Break my heart a thousand times
But it's still right here
Will we ever survive?
Are we living in the past?
Where there's nothing left to fear
Won't you say that you love me?
Tell me what I want to hear
A cold war for the mind
My distant colours still bleeding
A broken promise for the soul
Never loving never healing

Never ever healing
My distant colours still bleeding
Still bleeding

Are we living in the past?
Where there's nothing left to fear
Won't you say that you love me?
Tell me what I want to hear
A cold war for the mind
My distant colours still bleeding
A broken promise for the soul
Never loving never healingEmbed
