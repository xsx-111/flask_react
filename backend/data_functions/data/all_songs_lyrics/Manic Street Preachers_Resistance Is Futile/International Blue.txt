International Blue Lyrics
You wrote your autograph on the far side of the sky
You recorded the falling rain but you never told us why
You painted with fire only the ashes now remain
The monochrome desire you left us too young to explain

Will you lead us to an empty room?
And frame it with the sky so blue
The little boy who saw the truth
He left us with international blue
International blue

Here's my gift to you a soundtrack to the void
The deepest of interludes the myths that you destroyed
And I saw that colour through a clear wide window
And I saw that colour and I knew I had to go
 
Will you lead us to an empty room?
And frame it with the sky so blue
The little boy who saw the truth
He left us with international blue
International blue
International Blue
