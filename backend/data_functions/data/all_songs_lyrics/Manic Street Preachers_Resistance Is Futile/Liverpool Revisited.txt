Liverpool Revisited Lyrics
As I wake to a sunset
The light dances on the Mersey
And I think of the '96
As the tears fall down on me

And there is courage
There is pride
You can see it in your eyes
Fight for justice fight for life
There are angel in these skies

As the night falls around me
I see joy and devotion
These times will never leave
Like the rain on the ocean

There is dignity and pride
There is poetry and life
There are ghosts within these stones
There's defiance in these bones

And all the hatred they tried to throw at you
But you stayed so strong
Yeah all the hatred it never was the truth
So keep keeping on

This is forever
We'll never leave you now
This is forever
We'll never leave you nowEmbed
