Sequels of Forgotten Wars Lyrics
There will be no parades for the likes of us
The wars we fight are doomed to be lost
Iâ€™ve seen the reflections of my broken blood
The callous deception of never giving up

No stranger to the cause
No stranger to these wars

We dream no more no shock and awe
Nowhere to go for rock and roll
A blue screen for a tribal horde
The sequels of forgotten wars

A twist and a turn towards apocalypse
A pause for effect before your deadly kiss
Echo echo in a chamber of purity
To a lip-synced moral maze soliloquy

No stranger to this cause
Still a stranger in these parts
Progressive thoughts for idle hands
Platforms for corruptive brands
A blue screen for a tribal horde
The sequels of forgotten wars


No medication left to take
Just defeat and the bitterest of tastes
A blue screen for a tribal horde
The sequels of forgotten warsEmbed
