Dylan & Caitlin Lyrics
The blank page awaits
Love has deserted and made
A fool and a drunk out of me
My wishes no longer made real

Alone with this feeling again
Love has deserted the pain
The alcohol starts to sink in
The drinking blinds us to sin

I never meant to believe in you
It's so hard just surviving the truth
Words don't cover the scars anymore
The tears last longer than before

Together the tenderness cries
Together the tenderness cries

In dreams I will be by your side
In books, photographs and in voice
In verse and metre and rhyme
I'm sorry and I wish that I tried
Dylan don't leave me behind
Love has divided and died
The beauty still shines in your eyes
American corrupted and lied

I never meant to believe in you
It's so hard just surviving the truth
Words don't cover the scars anymore
The tears last longer than before

Together the tenderness cries
Together the tenderness cries

I never meant to believe in you
It's so hard just surviving the truth
The words don't cover the scars anymore
The tears last longer than before

Together the tenderness cries
Together the tenderness criesEmbed
