Pretty Good LyricsI got a friend in Fremont
He sells used cars, ya know?
Well, he calls me up twice a year
Just to ask me how'd it go
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually, everything is just about the same
I met a girl from Venus
Her insides were lined in gold
Well, she did what she did, said "How was it, kid?"
She was politely told
"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually, everything is just about the same"
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen
Molly went to Arkansas
She got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well, she was doing good till she went in the woods
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain
'Cause actually, all them dogs are just about the same
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen

I heard Allah and Buddha
Were singing at the Savior's feast
And up in the sky an Arabian rabbi
Fed Quaker oats to a priest
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain
'Cause actually, all them gods are just about the same
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
'Cause actually, everything is just about the same1Embed
