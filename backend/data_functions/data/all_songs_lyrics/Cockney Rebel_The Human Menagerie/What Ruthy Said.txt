What Ruthy Said LyricsYou're wearing grey today, you're from Berlin, I'd say you're a model
Can I be blue for you like I'm in fashion too ? See me wobble
We'll be a pair of swells and dig the best hotels, hit the throttle
We'll do the rumba too and say the life we knew was so gay
Oh teach me to rock, I'm getting caught in a pocket of Saki
We can go to a hop and do Suburban Bop, cool and sharply
Queue for the cops, you got no reason to not be Malaki
Your Gossamer and Fluff are gonna be enough for today
Oh we'll dig the sand and sea down in Alicante on the borders
We'll dig the hustle-around and hear the virgin sound of your daughters
American Bordeaux, we'll hit a rhythm slow, oh the tortures
But what Ruthy said must have gone to your head like they say, oh ...Embed
