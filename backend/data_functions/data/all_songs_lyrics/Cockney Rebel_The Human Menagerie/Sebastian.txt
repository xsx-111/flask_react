Sebastian LyricsRadiate simply, the candle is burning so low for me
Generate me limply, I can't seem to place your name, ch√©rie
To rearrange all these thoughts in a moment is suicide
Come to a strange place, we'll talk over old times we never spied
Somebody called me Sebastian
Somebody called me Sebastian
Work out a rhyme, toss me the time, lay me you're mine
We all know oh yeah
Your Persian eyes sparkle, your lips, ruby blue, never speak a sound
And you, oh so gay, with Parisian demands, you can run around
And your view of society screws up my mind like you'll never know
Lead me away, come inside, see my mind in kaleidoscope
Somebody called me Sebastian
Somebody called me Sebastian
Mangle my mind, love me sublime, do it in style
We all know oh yeah
You're not gonna run, babe, we only just begun, babe, to compromise
Slagged in a Bowery saloon, love's a story to serialise
Pale angel face, your eye-shadow and glitter is outta sight
No courtesan could begin to decipher your beam of light
Somebody called me Sebastian
Somebody called me Sebastian
Dance on my heart, laugh, swoop and dart, la la di da
We all know you yeahEmbed
