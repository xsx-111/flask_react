Hideaway LyricsLet 'em come a-running and take all your money and hideaway
Let 'em come a-running and take all your money and flee
Let 'em come a-running and take all your money and hideaway, hideaway, hideaway
It was summer or maybe spring, I can't remember
It was summer or maybe spring, I can't remember
We found our hearts and stole them from our bodies
We couldn't understand the villain's call
We'd often recall the beginnings
We'd often try in vain to change it all
We couldn't help but keep ourselves from sinning
In summer, summer, or maybe spring, or maybe spring, or maybe spring
Oh let 'em come a-running and take all your money and hideaway
Let 'em come a-running and take all your money and flee
Let 'em come a-running and take all your money and hideaway, hideaway, hideaway
It was summer or maybe spring, I can't remember
It was summer or maybe spring, I can't recall
We'd try to always calm our elders
But always we did seem to fall
We'd never try to tame the burning embers
It didn't seem to matter how we'd fare
It seemed we couldn't even escape december
It was summer, summer, or maybe spring, or maybe spring, or maybe spring
Oh it was summer, summer, or maybe spring, or maybe spring, or maybe spring
Let 'em come a-running and take all your money and hideaway
Let 'em come a-running and take all your money and flee
Let 'em come a-running and take all your money and hideaway, hideaway, hideaway, hideawayEmbed
