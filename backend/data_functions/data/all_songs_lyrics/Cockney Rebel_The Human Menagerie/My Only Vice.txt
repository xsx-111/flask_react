My Only Vice LyricsSimply Lorraine sings for a while in a three-octave harmonica style
It's easy to see her harmony stabbing at my songs from behind
Just trying to stick her cosmic philosopher's words into rhymes
Nobody tells it the same, to her everything's just like a game
But she'll make it seem some big machine's driving you clean outa your mind
Come on admit it, that's just the limit, we've travelled from mad to sublime
She's a lady from a background of pearls
Who's tormenting and bending my world
Oh my only vice is the fantastic prices I charge for being eaten alive
So Nina can paint dragons on guitars, she can roll up a Victorian vase
That gal can sweep, skip, jump and leap into a room full of clowns
No one'll tame her, no one'll claim her til she's been at least all around
Doreen is a hunk of a man, she can wipe every boy from the land
But Lorraine can fly it outa sight, then bring it on back to the fold
Give me a chance, I want romance, don't give me your heart quite so cold
She's a lady from a background of pearls
Who's tormenting and bending my world
Oh my only vice is the fantastic prices I charge for being eaten aliveEmbed
