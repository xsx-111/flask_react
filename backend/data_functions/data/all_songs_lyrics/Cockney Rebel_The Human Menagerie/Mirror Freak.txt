Mirror Freak LyricsExhibition yourself, we'll hold a show on the shelf
'Cause we can feel a change is on the way
You're not a skin or a spiv, boy who are you trying to kid?
You're jolly handsome, super wizard, OK?
Would you resort to telling all your friends lies
When they can see right through your flimsy disguise?
We all consider you far out so there can be little doubt
You're gonna make it in a big big way
Oh we can feel a new existence beginning
And the yobs have made a go at forgiving
And the new man he appears to be winning
Oh what a shame, such a bore
Oh when I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight
You pat your hand in the air and when they ask you say: "Yeah"
And they'll be happy to believe you're both kinds
Then shake a fist or a leg and prove the image is dead
Or the chances are you'll trip up their minds
Oh you're too cute to be a big rock star
But if you're cool you may not push it too far
Oh just believe in yourself and take a tip from the elf
And sing a boogie to the image fatale
Oh we can feel a new existence beginning
And the yobs have made a go at forgiving
And the new man he appears to be winning
Oh what a shame, such a bore
Oh when I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight
You feel Loretta's deep breaths, you put a hand on her breast
You feel her come on like some movie-star chick
You slide her body across, you fight so hard to be boss
But sweet Loretta she knows all the tricks
So you perform like it's your very best show
You turn her on but she's never gonna know
Then you can shuffle your hips or M-M-Mae West your lips
But you're the same old thing we've always known
Now we can feel a new existence beginning
And the yobs have made a go at forgiving
And the new man he appears to be winning
Oh what a shame, such a bore
Oh when I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
You know I don't wanna turn on tonight, night, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonight, night
I said I don't wanna turn on tonightEmbed
