Liquid Sunshine LyricsIt's just a sunshine song and it won't take long to play for you
(It's just a sun-shine so-ng)
It's just a sunshine song and won't take long to lay on you
It's just a sunshine song, a fun shine song we'll play for you (Li-quid
Sun-shine)
(And I think I played it right,  yeah)
It's just a sunshine song to take you home, we'll play for you
(Liquid funshine)

It's just a sunshine song, loud and strong to lay on you
It's just a sunshine song, all day long, the whole day through
