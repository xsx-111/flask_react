I Believe in Love Lyrics
I made a promise to myself
Locked it away deep down inside
Told my heart we'd wait it out
Swore we'd never compromise
Oh, I'd rather be alone
Like I am tonight
Than settle for the kind of love
That fades before the morning light

Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard its voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have a choice
Today I got the answer
And there's a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it

I believe in love
I believe in love
A love that's real, love that's strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes, I believe in love

I believe in love, I believe in love
A love that's real, love that's strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes, I believe in love

Yes, I believe in loveEmbed
