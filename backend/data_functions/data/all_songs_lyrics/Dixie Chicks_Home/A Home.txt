A Home Lyrics
I mistook the warnings for wisdom
From so-called friends quick to advise
Though your touch was telling me
Otherwise

Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh, but I was just young, I was scared
I was wrong

Not a night goes by I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home

Guess I did what I did believing
That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore
Than never knowing
Not a night goes by I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home
A home

Four walls, a roof, a door, some windows
Just a place to run when my workin' day is through
They say home is where the heart is
If the exception proves the rule, I guess that's true

Not a night goes by I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home
A homeEmbed
