Landslide (Sheryl Crow Remix) Lyrics
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well


Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well, I'm getting older too
So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought it down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills

Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
The landslide'll bring you downEmbed
