White Trash Wedding Lyrics
You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

You finally took my hand
You finally took my hand
It took a nip of gin
But you finally took my hand

You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring

Mama don't approve
Mama don't approve
Daddy says he's the best in town
And mama don't approve

You can't afford no ring
You can't afford no ring
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ring
Baby's on its way
Baby's on its way
Say I do and kiss me quick
Because baby's on its way
I shouldn't be wearing white
And you can't afford no ringEmbed
