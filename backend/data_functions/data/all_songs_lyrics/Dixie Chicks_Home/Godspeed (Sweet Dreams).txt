Godspeed (Sweet Dreams) Lyrics
Dragon tales and the "water is wide"
Pirates sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you

Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon will find the mouse
And I love you

Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams

God bless mommy and matchbox cars
God bless dad and thanks for the stars
God hears "Amen," wherever we are
And I love you
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams1Embed
