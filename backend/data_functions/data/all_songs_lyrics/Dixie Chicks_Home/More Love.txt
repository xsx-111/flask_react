More Love Lyrics
I'm so close to you baby but I'm so far away
There's a silence between us and there's so much to say
You're my strength, you're my weakness, you're my faith, you're my doubt
We gotta meet in the middle to work this thing out

More love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love

We're afraid to be idle
So we fill up the days
We run on the treadmill
Keep slavin' away
'Til there's no time for talkin'
'Bout trouble in mind
And the doors are all closed
Between your heart and mine
More love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love


Just look out around us
People fightin' their wars
They think they'll be happy
When they've settled their scores
Let's lay down our weapons
That pulled us apart
Be still for just a minute
Try to open our hearts

More love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love
I can hear our hearts cryin'
More love
I know that's all we need
More love
To flow in between us
To take us and hold us
And lift us above
If there's ever an answer
It's more love
More loveEmbed
