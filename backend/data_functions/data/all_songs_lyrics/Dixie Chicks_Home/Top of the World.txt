Top of the World Lyrics
I wished I was smarter
I wished I was stronger
I wished I loved Jesus
The way my wife does
I wished it had been easier
Instead of any longer
I wished I could have stood
Where you would've been proud
But that won't happen now
That won't happen now

There's a whole lot of singin' that's never gonna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Think I broke the wings off that little songbird
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now
Top of the world

I don't have to answer
Any of these questions
Don't have no God to
Teach me no lessons
I come home in the evenin'
Sit in my chair
One night they called me for supper but I never got up
I stayed right there in my chair
There's a whole lot of singin' that's never gonna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Think I broke the wings off that little songbird
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now

I wished I'da known you
Wished I'da shown you
All of the things I
Was on the inside
I'd pretend to be sleepin'
When you come in in the mornin'
To whisper goodbye
Go to work in the rain
I don't know why
Don't know why

'Cause everyone's singin', we just wanna be heard
Disappearin' every day without so much as a word, somehow
Wanna grab a hold of that little songbird
Take her for a ride to the top of the world right now

Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world1Embed
