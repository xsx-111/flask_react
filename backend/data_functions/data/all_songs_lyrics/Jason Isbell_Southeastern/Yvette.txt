Yvette Lyrics

I can barely make out
A little light from the house
On the cul-de-sac
Bedroom upstairs
It's a family affair

I've watched you in class
Your eyes are cut glass
And you stay covered up
Head to your toe
So nobody will notice you

I might not be a man yet
But that bastard will never be
So I'm cleaning my Weatherby
I sight in my scope
And I hope against hope
I hope against hope

Your mother seems nice
I don't understand why
She won't say anything
As if she can't see
Who he turned out to be

And I might not be a man yet
But your father will never be
So I load up my Weatherby
And I let out my breath
And I couple with death
I couple with death


Saw your father last night
And in the window the light
Made a silhouette
Saw him hold you that way
He won't hold you that way anymore, YvetteEmbed
