More than Rain Lyrics
It's more than rain that falls on our parade tonight
It's more than thunder, it's more than thunder
And it's more than a bad dream now that I'm sober
Nothing but sad times, nothing but sad times

None of our pockets are lined with gold
Nobody's caught the bouquet
There are no dead presidents we can fold
Nothing is going our way
And its more than trouble I've got myself into
It's more than woe-begotten gray skies now


And its more than a bad dream now that I'm sober
There's no more dancing, there's no more dancing
And its more than trouble I've got myself into
Nothing but sad times, nothing but sad times

None of our pockets are lined with gold
Nobody's caught the bouquet
There are no dead presidents we can fold
Nothing is going our way
And it's more than goodbye I have to say to you
It's more than woe-begotten gray skies now
And it's more than goodbye I have to say to you
It's more than woe-begotten gray skies now
And it's more than woe-begotten gray skies nowEmbed
