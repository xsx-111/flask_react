Train Song LyricsI broke down in East St. Louis on the Kansas City line
And drunk up all of my money that I borrowed every time
And I fell down at the Derby, the night's as black as a crow
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
What made my dreams so hollow was standing at the depot
With a steeple full of swallows that could never ring the bell
Oh I've come ten thousand miles away, not one thing to show
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
I remember when I left without bothering to pack
Don't you know I've left with just the clothes I had on my back
Now I'm so sorry for what I've done and I'm out here on my own
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me home
It was a train that took me away from here
But a train can't bring me homeEmbed
