Hang on St. Christopher LyricsHang on St. Christopher through the smoke and the oil
Buckle down the rumble seat, let the radiator boil
Got an overhead downshift and a two-dollar grill
Got an '85 cabin on an '85 hill
Hang on St. Christopher on the passenger side
Open it up, tonight the devil can ride
Hang on St. Christopher with a barrelhouse dog
Kick me up Mt. Baldy, throw me out in the fog
Tear a hole in the jackpot, drive a stake through his heart
Do a hundred on the grapevine, do a jump on the start
Hang on St. Christopher now, don't let me go
Get me to Reno and bring it in low, yeah
Hang on St. Christopher with the hammer to the floor
Put a hi-ball in the crank case, nail a crow to the door
Get a bottle for the jockey, gimme a 294
There's a 750 Norton bustin' down January's door
Hang on St. Christopher on the passenger side
Open it up, at night the devil can ride
Hang on St. Christopher, now don't let me go
Get to me Reno, got to bring it in low
Put my baby on the flat car, got to burn down the caboose
Get 'em all jacked up on whiskey, then we'll turn the mad dog loose
Hang on St. Christopher on the passenger side
Open it up, tonight the devil can ride
Oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
