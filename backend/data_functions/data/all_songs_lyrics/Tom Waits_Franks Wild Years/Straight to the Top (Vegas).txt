Straight to the Top (Vegas) LyricsI'm going straight to the top, whoa
I'm going where the air is fresh and clean
I'm going straight up to the top
If you know me, you know what I mean
I can't let Mister Sorrow try and pull ol' Frankie down
We live for tomorrow, I have found you
Straight to the top
I'm going up where the air is fresh and clean
I know I'm never gonna stop
Until I know, I know I'm wild and free
Hey, I'm going straight up to the top
And if you know me, you know what I mean
I can't let ol' Mister Sorrow try and pull me down
I live for tomorrow, I have found you
I'm going straight to the top, whoa
I'm going up where the air is fresh and clean
Yeah, whoa
I can't let Mister Sorrow pull ol' Frankie down
We live for tomorrow, I have found you
Straight to the top, oh yeah
Up where the air is
Up where the air is
Up where the air is
Up where the air is
Up where the air is fresh and clean, whoa
Whoa, how about that band? Whoa!Embed
