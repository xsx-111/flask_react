Innocent When You Dream (78) LyricsThe bats are in the belfry
The dew is on the moor
Where are the arms that held me
And pledged her love before
And pledged her love before
It's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
I made a golden promise
That we would never part
I gave my love a locket
And then I broke her heart
And then I broke her heart
It's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
Running through the graveyard
We laughed my friends and I
We swore we'd be together
Until the day we died
Until the day we died
It's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream1Embed
