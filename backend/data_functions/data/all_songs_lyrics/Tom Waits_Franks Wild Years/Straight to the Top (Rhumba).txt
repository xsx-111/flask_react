Straight to the Top (Rhumba) Lyrics
I'm going straight up to the top, oh yeah
Up where the air is fresh and clean
I'm going straight up to the top, oh yeah
If you know me, you know what I mean
I can't let sorrow pull ol' Frankie down
Live for tomorrow, I have found you
I'm going straight to the top, oh yeah
Up where the air is fresh and clean

I just know that I will never stop, no no
Until I know I'm wild and free
I'm like a champagne bubble, pop pop pop
I'm like those birds high up in the tree
I can't let sorrow pull ol' Frankie down
Live for tomorrow, I have found you
I'm going straight up to the top, oh yeah
Up where the air is fresh and clean

I can't let sorrow
Pull old Frankie down
Live for tomorrow, I have found you
I'm going straight up to the top, oh yeah
Up where the air is
Up where the air is
Up where the air is
Up where the air is
Up where the air is fresh and clean, yeahEmbed
