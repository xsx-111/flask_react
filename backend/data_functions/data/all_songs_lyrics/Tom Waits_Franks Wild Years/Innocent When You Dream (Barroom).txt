Innocent When You Dream (Barroom) Lyrics
The bats are in the belfry
The dew is on the moor
Where are the arms that held me
And pledged her love before
And pledged her love before

And it's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
It's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream

I made a golden promise
That we would never part
I gave my love a locket
And then I broke her heart
And then I broke her heart

And it's such a sad old feeling
All of the fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
We're running through the graveyard
And we laughed my friends and I
We swore we'd be together
Until the day we died
Until the day we died

It's such a sad old feeling
All of the fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
And it's such a sad old feeling
The fields are soft and green
And it's memories that I'm stealing
But you're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dream
When you dream
You're innocent when you dreamEmbed
