Please Wake Me Up LyricsI put my chips on her shoulder
Running in carnival time
She bought the things that I told her
They made her eyes sparkle and shine
Together we'll ring in the new year
I know that she'll be my queen
And if I fall asleep in your arms
Please wake me up in my dreams
Her outfit was all made of vinyl
Like nothing that I've ever seen
When our divorces are final
She'll fit right into my scheme
Together we'll right in the new year
I know that she'll be my queen
And if I fall asleep in your arms
Please wake me up in my dreamsEmbed
