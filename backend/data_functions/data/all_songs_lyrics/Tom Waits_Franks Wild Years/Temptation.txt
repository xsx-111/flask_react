Temptation Lyrics
Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
Everything is made from dreams
Time is made from honey slow and sweet
Only the fools know what it means

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I can't resist

I just know that she's made of smoke
But I've lost my way, yeah
She knows that I am broke
But I must play, yeah

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I can't resist
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I just can't resist
Dutch pink and Italian blue
She is there waiting for you
My will has disappeared
My confusion is oh so clear

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I can't resist
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
I just can't resist

Rusted brandy in a diamond glass
Everything is made from dreams
Time is made from honey slow and sweet
Only the fools know what it means

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
