Blow Wind Blow LyricsBlow wind blow
Wherever you'll be goin'
Put on your overcoat
Take me away
You gotta take me on into the night
Take me on into the night
Blow me away
Blow me away
Mary's on blacktop
There's a husband in the dog house
In the middle of a shakedown
I got quiet as a church mouse
Turned out Raleigh's on the dashboard
Sugar Daddy caught a polocar
There's no solitary tap dance way out of here
Blow wind blow
?
Put on your overcoat
Take me into the night
Take me into the night
Blow me away
I ride upon a field mouse
I was dancin' in the slaughterhouse
And if you swing along the beltway
You skid along there all day
'Cause I went a little crazy
And I sat upon a highchair
And I'm smokin' like a diesel
Way out here
If you go in low
Wherever you been goin'
Put on your overcoat
Take me away
You gotta take me on into the night
Take me on into the night
Blow me away
Blow me away
You gotta blow me away
Blow me away
