Yesterday Is Here LyricsIf you want money in your pocket
And a top hat on your head
A hot meal on your table
And a blanket on your bed
Today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait
Till yesterday is here
I'm going to New York City
And I'm leaving on a train
And if you wanna stay behind
Wait till I come back again
Today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait
Till yesterday is here
If you want to go where the rainbows end
You will have to say goodbye
All our dreams come true, baby, up ahead
And it's out where your memories lie
And the road is out before me
And the moon is shining bright
What I want you to remember
As I disappear tonight
Today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait
Till yesterday is here
Today is grey skies
Tomorrow is tears
You'll have to wait
Till yesterday is hereEmbed
