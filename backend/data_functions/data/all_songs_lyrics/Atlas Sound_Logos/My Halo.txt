My Halo LyricsMy halo burned a hole in the sky
My halo burned a hole in the ground
My halo burned a hole in the sky
My halo is a part of my cry
And so I will wait for polarity to change
For years and years and years the canvas cracked
My portrait turned black
My halo is strange
No cure for the pain
My body will burn
The leaves will still turn
And so I will wait for polarity to change
For years and years and years the canvas cracked
My portrait turned black
And so I will wait for polarity to change
For years and years and years the canvas cracked
My portrait turned black
My portrait turned blackEmbed
