Logos LyricsLogos is the king of life
Always under the bed
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Logos is the king of life
Who gives us the drive
We need to stay
Anything we find out
Always drives us away
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Spirits floating in the night
Will they ever find their way?
Logos is the king of life
Fights away all decay
Everything was bathed in light
Everything loved it's way
Everything makes sense when you
Look at it from another way
Logos is the king of life
Leads away decay
Logos is the king of life
Fights away all that decay
Spirits drifting in the night
Will they ever find their way?Embed
