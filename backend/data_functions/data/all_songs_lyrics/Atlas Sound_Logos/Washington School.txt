Washington School LyricsShine! Shine a light
Shine! Shine a light
Too much of, too much of, too much of a good thing
Too much of, too much of, too much of a good thing
Sick one, face down
Waste of underclass
Underground
Sick one faced me
Ripped out
Burn the sheets
Onslaught, onslaught
Shine a light on meEmbed
