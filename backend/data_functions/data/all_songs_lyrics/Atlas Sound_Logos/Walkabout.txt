Walkabout Lyrics
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?
What did you want to see?
What did you want to be when you grew up?

To go away and not look back
And think of what the others say
To go ahead and change your life
Without regard to what is said
And everyone must do the same
You find yourself lost again
Forget the things you've left behind
Through looking back you may go blind
