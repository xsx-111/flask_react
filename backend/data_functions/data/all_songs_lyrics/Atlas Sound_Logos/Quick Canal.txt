Quick Canal LyricsI wanted to live the life of a prince
Because I thought saints were born saints
So, indeed, we didn't stand a chance
Insalubrious offshoots of nature
With heart & mind of our own
All the daughters, all the sons
Taking centuries to unearth the creature
Heralding a stage
Where consciousness is higher
Taken through a costly process
Of success & failure
I thought saints were born saints
I looked in the dirt
& found wisdom is learnt
Through a costly process
Of success & failure
Oh, wisdom is learntEmbed
