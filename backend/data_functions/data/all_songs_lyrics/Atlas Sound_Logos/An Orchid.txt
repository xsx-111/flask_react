An Orchid LyricsI watched the orchids
They rot outside
In the garden
Will you provide
What they need
To survive?
Will you provide
What they need
To survive?
An orchid died
We will save the best ones
For the ending
An orchid survived
It's dry outside
But we prefer that heat
Will you provide
What I need
Will you provide
What I need
What I need
What I need
An orchid dies
Each time you hear
A child crying
And what makes you lie
To me
And think that I'll believe it
An orchid dies
Each time
A child cries
An orchid diesEmbed
