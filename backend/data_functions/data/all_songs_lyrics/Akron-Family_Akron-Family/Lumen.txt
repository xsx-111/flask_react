Lumen LyricsWash out your eyes
You've seen the dirty place
I can't disguise
All of my longings
Sometimes in the night
I feel your breathing
And I want to eat your light
For you to be inside me
Where's my head I swear I saw it
Rolling over there
I'm falling further than
I have ever been
Horizon's on fire
I'll find a hiding place
I can't deny
All of your longings
The flame is getting low
And you're in my window
If you can find me now
You can have my body
Where's your head
I swear I saw it
Rolling over there
You're burning brighter
Than I have ever seenEmbed
