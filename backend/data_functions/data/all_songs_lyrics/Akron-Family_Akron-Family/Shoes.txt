Shoes LyricsWith you feet grounded
Your thoughts turn toward the sky
And you start to float
You see your shoes are tied
And you close your eyes
Imagine that your shoes
Had those velcro straps
So you could be set loose
And you hold real still
Believe that it is true
And your shoes move forward
Leaving without you
And you laugh so hard
It hurts your sides in pain
As you approach the sun
It rains on everyone
You float away
You float away
And find yourself, laughing
Into thin airEmbed
