Suchness LyricsI wanna see the thing in itself
I don't wanna think no more
I wanna see the thing in itself
I don't wanna think no more
I wanna see the thing in itself
I don't wanna see nothing else
I wanna see the thing in itself
I don't wanna think no more
Four legs on the chair
Three flowers in the vase
Four legs on the chair
Three flowers in the vase
Two seconds until
One suchness, ten thousand things
One suchness, ten thousand things
One suchness, ten thousand things
One suchness, ten thousand things
One suchness, ten thousand things
One suchness, ten thousand things
I'll sleep and wake a-new
I'll sleep and wake a-new
I'll sleep and wake a-new
I'll sleep and wake a-newEmbed
