Italy LyricsThe day breaks, it's broken
And time comes undone
Standing still's the sun
I'm leaving this evening
But first night must come
Standing still's the sun
I am waiting under the sun
I am waiting for my time to come
I'm walking in circles that gradually grow
Still the sunlight glows
On bridges
Past churches
Through fields I have roamed
Stillness 'round me glows
I am waiting under the sun
I am waiting for my time to come
//Come away now
It's time to begin
//Come away now
I'm coming, my friend
//Come away now
We've all seen the end
//Come away now
Oh, I'm coming, my friend
When is time going to change?
I'm ready
When is time going to change?
I'm ready
I'm ready
When is time going to change?
I'm readyEmbed
