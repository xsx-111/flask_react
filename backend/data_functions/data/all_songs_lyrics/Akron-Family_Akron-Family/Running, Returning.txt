Running, Returning LyricsSooner, or later
Everyone will know
Within the shadows
In there light will grow
And love is on its way
It's more than I can see
Running, returning
On and on it goes
To a place
Where love begins to grow
And I am on my way
To where I've always been
Come walk with me in the morning light
Call the curious sun
And before I, inside heaven in our hands
And when the cold wind blows
We'll wake up on the other side
Where the sunlight sounds like moonlight in our ears
And even underground
They'll hear
Songs of our soul
Song without tearsEmbed
