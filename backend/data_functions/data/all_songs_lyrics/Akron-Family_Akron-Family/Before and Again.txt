Before and Again LyricsI have to say something if I want to sing
But it's not about the words
It's my voice writhing
To a place far from me
That my fingers can't reach
And my legs are so tired from all this standing still
Standing still
All of my dreams are memories
That I can't place to a time or a face
But my body knows
Of the ribbons and bows
That I once was tied in
In my mother's skin
Before and again
Before and again
Before and againEmbed
