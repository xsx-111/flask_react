Lost in the Paradise LyricsMy little grasshopper airplane
Cannot fly very high
I find you so far from my side
I'm lost in my own green light
Don't help me, my love
My brother, my girl
Just tell my name
Just let me say who am I
A big white plastic finger
Surrounds my dark green hair
But it's not your unknown caress
It's not from your unknown right hand
Oh don't help me, my love
My brother, my girl
Just tell my name
Just let me say who am I
I am the sun, the darkness
My name is green wave
Death, salt, South America is my name
World is my name, my size
And under my name here am I
My little grasshopper airplane cannot fly very high
Don't help me, my love
My brother, my girl
Just tell my name
Just let me say who am I1Embed
