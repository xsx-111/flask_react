Down in the Hole Lyrics
Sun comes every morning but it ain't no friend
I get dressed and I go back again
The rain it keeps on falling on twisted bones and dirt
I'm buried to my heart here in this hurt

The fire keeps on burning
You're waiting in the cold
Down in the hole

Dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart
The memory of your kiss tears me apart
The sky above is turning, the world below's gone gray
I thought that I could turn and walk away

The fire keeps on burning
I'm working in the cold
Down in the hole

Radio's crackling with the headlines
Wind in the phone lines
The sun upon your shoulder
Empty city skyline
The day rips apart
A dark and bloody arrow pierced my heart

I got nothing to hide this sky of sunshine
The things you left behind
I wake to find my city's gone to black
Days just keep on falling
Your voice it keeps on calling
I'm going to dig right here until I get you back

The fires keep on burning
I'm here with you in the cold
Down in the hole (Down in the hole)
(Down in the hole)Embed
