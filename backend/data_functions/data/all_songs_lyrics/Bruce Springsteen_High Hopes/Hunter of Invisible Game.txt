Hunter of Invisible Game Lyrics
I hauled myself up out of the ditch
And built me an ark of gopher wood and pitch
Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain
I am the hunter of invisible game

Well, I awoke last night to the heavy clicking and clack
And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks
There were empty cities and burning plains
I am the hunter of invisible game

We all come up a little short, and we go down hard
These days I spend my time skipping through the dark
Through the empires of dust, I chant your name
I am the hunter of invisible game

Through the bone yard rattle and black smoke, we rolled on
Down into the valley where the beast has his throne
There I sing my song, and I sharpen my blade
I am the hunter of invisible game

Strength is vanity, and time is illusion
I feel you breathing, the rest is confusion
Your skin touches mine, what else to explain
I am the hunter of invisible game
Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall
When the hour of deliverance comes on us all
When our hope and faith and courage and trust
Can rise or vanish like dust into dust
There's a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed
I am the hunter of invisible game

I am the hunter of invisible game
I am the hunter of invisible gameEmbed
