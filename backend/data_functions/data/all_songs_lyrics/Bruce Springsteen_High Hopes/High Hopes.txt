High Hopes Lyrics
Monday morning runs to Sunday night
Screaming slow me down before the new year dies
Well it won't take much to kill a loving smile
And every mother with a baby crying in her arms, singing

Give me help, give me strength
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything

Got high hopes
I got high hopes
Got high hopes
I got high hopes

Coming from the city, coming from the wild
I see a breathless army breaking like a cloud
They're going to smother love, they're going to shoot your hopes
Before the meek inherit they'll learn to hate themselves

Give me help, give me strength
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything
Got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes


Give me help, give me strength
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything

Got high hopes
Got high hopes
I got high hopes
Got high hopes

Tell me someone, what's the price
I want to buy some time and maybe live my life
I want to have a wife, I want to have some kids
I want to look in their eyes and know they'll stand a chance
Give me help, give me strength
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep
Give me love, give me peace
Don't you know these days you pay for everything

I got high hopes
Got high hopes
I got high hopes
Got high hopes
Got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes
I got high hopes3Embed
