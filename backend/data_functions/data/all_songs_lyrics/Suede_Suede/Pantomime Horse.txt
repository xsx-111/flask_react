Pantomime Horse Lyrics
I was born as a pantomime horse
Ugly as the sun when he falls to the floor
I was cut from the wreckage one day
This is what I get for being that way

Well, did you ever?
Did you ever go round with them?
Well, did you ever?
Did you ever go round the bend?

I was conned by a circus hand
Tragic as the son of a superman
"I would die for the stars," she said
This is what I get for my beautiful head

Well, did you ever?
Did you ever go round with them?
Well, did you ever?
Did you ever go round the bend?
Well, did you ever?
Did you ever go round with them?
Well, did you ever?
Did you ever go round the bend?
Ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?
Ever tried it that way?
Ever tried it that way?
Ever tried it that way?
Have you ever tried it that way?Embed
