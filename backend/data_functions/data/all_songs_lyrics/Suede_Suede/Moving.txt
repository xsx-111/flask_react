Moving Lyrics
Shame on me
Well I had the beast, you see
And if he can take it
I can take him home with me
Shame on her
She's a lovely little number
And when we go lassoing
You get lassoed, all of you
If you can take it
I can take it

And we're moving
So moving
So we are a boy
We are a girl
So moving
So moving

Shame on the girl
She's got a big black dog in her
And while tough kids sing about tough kids
She just skins the world
We'll never never play the harp
And we'll stick like sick on the stars
And if you can take it
I can take these stones from my heart
If you can take it
I can take it
And we're moving
So moving
So we are a boy
We are a girl
So moving
So moving

If you can take it, I can take it, all of me
If you can take it, I can take it all
If you can take it, I can take it, all of me
If you can take it, I can take it all!Embed
