So Young Lyrics
She can
Start
To walk out
When she wants

Because we're young
Because we're gone
We'll take the tide's electric mind
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

We're so young and so gone
Let's chase the dragon, oh

Because we're young
Because we're gone
We'll scare the skies with tigers' eyes
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

We're so young and so gone
Let's chase the dragon, oh
Let's chase the dragon, oh
Let's chase the dragon...
From our home
High in the city
Where the skyline stained the snow
I fell for a servant who kept me on the boil

We're so young and so gone
Let's chase the dragon from our home
From our home
From our home
From our homeEmbed
