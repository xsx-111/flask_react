Breakdown Lyrics
Back where the dogs bark
Where still life bleeds the concrete white
Try not to go too far inside your mind
Back where the cars decide
Where the lame star limps an endless mile
Have I gone too far inside my mind?

Oh, if you were the one
Would I even notice now my mind has gone?
Oh, if you were the one
Would I even notice?

Back where the car was parked
Where the canine in the A-line stole your time
You can only go so far for womankind

Oh, if you were the one
Would I even notice now my mind has gone?
Oh, if you were the one
Would I even notice?
You can only go so far
You can only go so far
You can only go so far in your mind

Does your love only come
Does your love only come
Does he only come in a Volvo?
Does he only come
Does your love only come
Does he only come in a Volvo?Embed
