Sleeping Pills Lyrics
Angel, don't take those sleeping pills
You don't need them
Though it's just time they kill
Angel, give me your sleeping pills
You don't need them
Give me the time they kill

You're a water sign
I'm an air sign
Gone, gone to Valium
Could you get me some?
You're a water sign
And I'm an air sign
Too Siamese to catch the leaves from those trees

Angel, don't take those sleeping pills
You don't need them
Though it's just time they kill

You're a water sign
I'm an air sign
Pumped up with Valium
Could you get me some?
You're a water sign
I'm an air sign
With sweet F.A. to do today
With sweet F.A. to do today
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Sweet F.A
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Sweet F.A
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Sweet F.A
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Angel, don't take those sleeping pillsEmbed
