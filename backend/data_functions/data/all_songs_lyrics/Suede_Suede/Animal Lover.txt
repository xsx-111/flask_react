Animal Lover Lyrics
I see you're moving, see you're moving
Moving in with her
You'll pierce your right ear
Pierce your heart here
This skinny boy is one of the girls

'Cause around my neck and around her neck
Hangs everything you are
I know you've been inside
But what were you in for?

Animal lover
Animal lover
Animal lover
La la la la la

I see you're moving, see you're moving
Like wildlife from the waist
But when your name's scratched in on a shiny ring
Your waist is my resting place

And around my neck and around her neck
Hangs everything you are
I know you've been inside
But what were you in for?
Animal lover
