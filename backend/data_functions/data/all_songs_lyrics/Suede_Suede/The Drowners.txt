The Drowners Lyrics
Won't someone give me a gun?
Oh, well it's for my brother
Well, he writes the line
Wrote right down my spine
It says, "Oh, do you believe in love there?"

So slow down
Slow down
You're taking me over
And so we drown
Sir, we drown
Stop taking me over

Won't someone give me some fun?
As the skin flies all around us
We kiss in his room to a popular tune
Oh, real drowners

So slow down
Slow down
You're taking me over
And so we drown
Sir, we drown
Stop taking me over
So slow down
Slow down
You're taking me over
And so we drown
Sir, we drown
Stop taking me over

You're taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over
Stop taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over
You're taking me over1Embed
