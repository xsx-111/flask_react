Animal Nitrate Lyrics
Like his dad you know that he's had
Animal nitrate in mind
Oh, in your council home, he jumped on your bones
Now you're taking it time after time

Oh, it turns you on, on
And now he has gone
Oh, what turns you on, on
Now your animal's gone

Well, he said he'd show you his bed
And the delights of the chemical smile
So in your broken home, he broke all of your bones
And now you're taking it time after time

Oh, it turns you on, on
And now he has gone
Oh, what turns you on, on
Now your animal's gone

What does it take to turn you on? On
And now he has gone
Now you're over 21, one
Now your animal's gone

Animal, he was animal
An animal, oh
Animal, he was animal
An animal, oh
Animal, animal
He's just an animal
An animal, oh
Animal, he was animal
He's just an animal, oh
Animal, he was animal
He's just an animal, oh4Embed
