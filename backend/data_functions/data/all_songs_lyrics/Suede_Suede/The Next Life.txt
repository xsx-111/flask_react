The Next Life Lyrics
See you in your next life
When we'll fly away for good
Stars in our own car
We can drive away from here

Far away
So far away
Down to Worthing
And work there
Far away
We'll go far away
And flog ice creams
'Til the company's on its knees

See you in your next life
When we'll fly away for goodEmbed
