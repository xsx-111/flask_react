Metal Mickey Lyrics
Well, she's show-showing it off, then
The glitter in her lovely eyes
Show-show-showing it off, then
And all the people shake their money in time

She sells heart
She sells meat
Oh dad, she's driving me mad, come see

We shake, shake, shake to the trumpet
And through the slippery city, we ride
Skyline swine on the circuit
Where all the people shake their money in time

She sells heart
She sells meat
Oh dad, she's driving me mad, come see
She sells heart
She sells meat
Oh dad, she's driving me mad, come see
She sells heart
She sells meat
She sells heart
She sells meat
She sells heart
(She's driving me mad)
She sells meat
(She's driving me mad)
She sells heart
(She's driving me mad)
She sells meat
(She's driving me mad)
She sells heart
(She's driving me mad)
She sells meat
(She's driving me mad)
She sells heart
(She's driving me mad)
She sells meat
(She's driving me mad)1Embed
