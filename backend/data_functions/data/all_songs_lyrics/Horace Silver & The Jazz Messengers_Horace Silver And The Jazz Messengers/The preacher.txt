The preacher LyricsParoles de la chanson The Preacher :
You'd better talk to the preacher - Tell him how you feel
And listen close to the preacher - Tell you love's for real
He'll lead you out of the darkness - Into the light
You'll find how happiness lies - In treating everyone right
The preacher preaches on Sundays - All through the day
And those who go there to listen - Cheer him when he says
He'll lead you out of the darkness - into the light
You'll find how happiness lies - In treating everyone rightEmbed
