Politicalamity LyricsWars and rumors
Of wars, no one knows what for
Toys and soldiers
Deployed, on some foreign shore
Lords and rulers
Destroy, diplomatic rapport
Communists, dictatorships
Democracies, hypocrisies
Ask not what your country can do
To a one world governmental zoo
Political,political
Politicalamity
(It's anarchy)
Political,political
Politicalamity
Rich and poor
Salute your country's colors
Less is more
When one oppresses the other
Pride and power
Decorated upon collars
Donkeys, bears 'n elephants
All paper-trained on parliament
I said ask not what your country can do
To a one world governmental zoo
Political,political
Politicalamity
(It's anarchy)
Political,political
Politicalamity
Political,political
Politicalamity
(SOLO)
Ask not what your country can do
In a one world governmental zoo
Ask not what your country can do
In a one world governmental zoo
(One world governmental zoo)
Political,political
Politicalamity
Ah, ah, ah
(It's anarchy)
Political,political
Politicalamity
Ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah
