Seven Sundays LyricsOne day
We'll find the time to spend together
Until then
My Love
If I had one wish
It wouldn't be hard to choose
Seven Sundays in a row
'cause that's the day that I spend with you
Someday soon
You and I will hold each other
Once again
My Love
If I had one wish
It wouldn't be hard to choose
Seven Sundays in a row
'cause that's the day that I spend with you
If I had one wish (If I had one wish)
It wouldn't be hard to choose (It wouldn't be hard)
Seven Sundays in a row(1-2-3-4-5-6-7)
Seven Sundays in a row(1-2-3-4-5-6-7)
Seven Sundays in a row
'cause that's the day
(that's the day, that's the day)
That I spent with you
If I had one wish
It wouldn't be hard to chooseEmbed
