Color Me Blind LyricsColor me blind
Color me blind
I had a dream that
That I was blind
And I couldn't see
See color of any kind
Picture the world, minus a rainbow
When day becomes night, then where will the sun go
Dancing alone, just me and my shadow
Color me blind, so I can see no evil
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color me blind
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color me blind
I had a dream
I was looking over the mountain
But I've, I've yet to see the
The so called Promised Land
Picture the world, without any color
You couldn't tell one face from the other
I don't understand, why we fight with our brother?
Color me blind just to love one another
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color me blind
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color me blind
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color me blind
Why do we dream in black and white?
Blind
Color me blind
Color me blind
Picture the world, minus a rainbow
When day becomes night, then where will the sun go
Dancing alone, just me and my shadow
Color me blind, so I can see no evil
Picture the world, without any color
You couldn't tell one face from the other
I don't understand, why we fight with our brother?
Color, color me blind
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color me blind
Why do we dream in black and white?
Color me blind
Why do we? Why do we? Why do we?
Color me blind
Why do we? Why do we? Why do we?
Color me blind
Color me, color you
Color me blind
Color me, color you
Color me blindEmbed
