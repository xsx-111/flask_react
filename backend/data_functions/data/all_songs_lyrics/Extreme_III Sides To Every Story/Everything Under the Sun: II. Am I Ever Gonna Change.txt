Everything Under the Sun: II. Am I Ever Gonna Change LyricsI'm tired of being me
And I don't like what I see
I'm not who I appear to be
So I start off every day
Down on my knees I will pray
For a change in any way
But as the day goes by
I live through another lie
If it's any wonder why
Am I ever gonna change
If I say one thing then I do the other
Same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change
Will I always stay the same
If I say one thing then I do the other
Same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change
Will I be only one to blame
If I think I'm right, I wind up wrong
It's a futile fight that's gone on too long
Please tell me if it's true
Am I too old to start anew
'Cause that's what I want to do
But time and time again
When I think I can, I fall short in the end
So why do I even try
Will it matter when I die
Can anyone hear my cry?
Am I ever gonna change
Will I always stay the same
If I say one thing then I do the other
Same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change
Will I be only one to blame
If I think I'm right, I wind up wrong
It's a futile fight gone on too long

Am I ever gonna change
Will I always stay the same
If I say one thing then I do the other
Same old song that goes on forever
Am I ever gonna change
Will I be only one to blame
I think I'm right, I wind up wrong
It's a fuckin' fight gone on too long
Am I ever gonna change
I take it day by day
My will is weak and my flesh too strong
Peace I seek till thy kingdom comes1Embed
