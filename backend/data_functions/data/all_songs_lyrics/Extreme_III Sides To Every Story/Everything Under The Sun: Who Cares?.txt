Everything Under The Sun: Who Cares? LyricsðŸŽ¼ ðŸŽ¹ ðŸŽ»
Tell me, Jesus, are you angry?
One more sheep has just gone astray
A hardening of hearts, turning to stone
Wandering off so far from home
So many children losing time
Walk in darkness, looking for a sign
Chasing their rainbows, the future looks so bright
Slowly we're losing sight of the light
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Tell me who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Tell me who cares?
Who cares?
All alone out in the cold
Can't look back, am I growing old?
I chose a path, is this my fate?
Am I finding out the truth too late?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Tell me who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
Tell me who cares?
Here I am, a naked man
Nothing to hide with empty hands
Remember me, I am the one
Who lost his way, your Prodigal Son
Am I ever gonna change?
Will I always stay the same?
Say one thing, then I do the other
Same old song goes on forever
(Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?
Tell me who cares? Who cares?)
Rise, rise and shine
A new day is coming, yes, it isEmbed
