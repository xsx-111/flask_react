Warheads Lyrics"Recruit, when I give you the word, I want you to exit my building to the left, and hit the deck runnin'. I want you to fall in on those yellow footprints with your body at the position of attention. No lolly-gagging around my area. Head and eyes straight forward. You understand me?"
"Yes, daddy."
"I didn't hear you!"
"Yes, daddy. Yes, daddy. Yes, daddy."
Hey Kid, wanna have some fun?
Choose a side and here's your gun
Brought up knowing right from wrong
Squash the meek, inherit the strong
Just try and cross the line
Don't even bother to waste my time
What's that look in your eyes?
It's time I cut you down to size
This world ain't big enough for two
And I've got my sights on you
(Would you like to be)
Well, I'm a warhead, you're a warhead
(A warhead just like me)
He's a warhead, she's a warhead
Watch them scream and yell
(Would you like to be a warhead too?)
When I blow them straight to hell!
Alright!
Ramboy, it's us and them
Just like your Daddy in Vietnam
Monkey see, Monkey do
Your boy's grown up Just like you, like you
This world ain't Big enough for two
And I've got my eye on you
(Would you like to be)
Well, I'm a warhead, you're a warhead
(A warhead just like me)
He's a warhead, she's a warhead
Watch them scream and yell
(Would you like to be a warhead too?)
When I blow them straight to hell
(SOLO)
I've seen black heads
White heads
Red heads
Dead heads
Big heads
Shit heads
But there's no heads
Like warheads!
This world ain't big enough for two
And I've got my sights on you
(Would you like to be)
I'm a warhead, you're a warhead
(A warhead just like me)
He's a warhead, she's a warhead
Watch them scream and yell
(Would you like to be a warhead too?)
When I blow them straight to hell!
(Would you like to be)
I'm a warhead,you're a warhead
(A warhead just like me)
He's a warhead,she's a warhead
Watch them scream and yell
(Would you like to be a warhead too?)
When I blow them straight to hell
Doooooo!
Yeah, oh, oh!Embed
