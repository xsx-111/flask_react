Tragic Comic LyricsFlowers, I sent
Were found dead on their arrival
The words, I said
Inserted foot in my mouthful
So when, we dance
My lead it ain't so graceful
Isn't so, not ain't so
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-p-poet
Just call me a 'Tragic Comic'
'Cause I'm, in, in love with you
And when, we dine
I forget to push in your seat
I wear the wine
Spillin' hearts, all over my sleeve
A stitch in time
Proposing down on my knees
Splitting between the seams
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-p-poet
Just call me a 'Tragic Comic'
'Cause I'm, in, in love with you
Nobody, can know the
Trouble I've seen
Nobody, can know the
Trouble I've seen
Nobody, can know the
Trouble I, get into
When I'm with you
Tragic comedy
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-p-poet
Just call me a 'Tragic Comic'
'Cause I'm, in love with you
I'm a hapless romantic
St-t-tuttering p-p-poet
Just call me a 'Tragic Comic'
'Cause I'm, in, in love with youEmbed
