Did I Let You Know Lyrics(Come on, come on)

I'm coming for you 'cause
'Cause I adore you and
I'd like to get inside your mass production
This indecision has
Has got me cringing, well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction

Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Unwrap the package without much persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
I want to dance to every days occasion

This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

When we envision
Lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on you
You said I grew on you
Turns out that we are all the one solution
GO!


I'm coming at you, well
Year of the cat too and
I like the sound of your articulations
Want to arouse her and
Maybe espouse her, well
She showed me love without the stipulations

This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)


I want to lean on you
Get Jan and Dean on you
It's time to sway a little mass perception
I like your cheeky, well
So Mozambiquey and
I think the world could use a clear connection
This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?4Embed
