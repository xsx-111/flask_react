Annie Wants A Baby Lyrics
Lucy Rebar
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh yeah

Drinking sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a goldmine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh yeah

Sinned along the way
Nothing stops the ache

Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosma Sheiva
Got off, made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender, why do I believe you?
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can
Missing pieces
She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them before
Before it's time to close the store
Oh yeah

Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only seed we ever plant
I want to help you but I can't
No, no

Sinned along the way
Nothing stops the ache

Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love her, leave her
Got off, made you a believer
Neon soldier
Left her now you've gotten older
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can
It's getting longer all the time
It's time to re-design the sign
Oh yeah
Sinned along the way3Embed
