Ethiopia Lyrics
E I O I E I A
When you give your love away
You get a feeling for
E I O I E I A
Live to love another day
Even when you feel unsure

More and more I want to raise
Raise my bar and raise your stay
E I O I E I A
When I lie there wide awake
For my son I'll make

Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road

E I O I E I A
Something good going to come your way
Just look out your door
E I O I E I A
Tell 'em what you wanna say
No matter what you might incur
Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road


E I O I E I A
Steal my heart to give away
Make me want to say
E I O I E I A
You and I are sewn the same
More and more and more each day

Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road3Embed
