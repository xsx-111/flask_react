Even You Brutus? Lyrics
God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell, but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for the long, long

Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs, about "In God We Trust"
Some things slide, but this is a must
Like I told you there's a time for finding out

Ah, people try to tell me what not to do
"You shouldn't make it with a younger girl"
And too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Well, like I told you be careful what you're asking for

Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude, but I just didn't care
I had to find out, these moments are rare
And Stevie says, "All is fair."
Like I told you there is something for everyone

Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really, really wanted to say
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to play?
Like I told you there's more than meets the eye

Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl, you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you, I'd do it all again
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

Come on
Hey, sister Brutus
There's a fury to the woman's wrath
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back4Embed
