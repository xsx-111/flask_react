Goodbye Hooray Lyrics
Junior pimps at the old caf√©
Got to chase those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound

Hustlers get what they deserve
But it's always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

Curb your tongue, oh scallywag
Because you've got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around


See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Goodbye and hooray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
Oh nah, nah, nah, noEmbed
