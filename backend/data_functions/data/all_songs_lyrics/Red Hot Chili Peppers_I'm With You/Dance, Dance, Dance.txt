Dance, Dance, Dance Lyrics
You got yours and I've got mine
She got his and she got shine
Under moon and overseas
She got those and we got these

Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
Let's say hello, its safe to go

Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
The light is right, let's play tonight
Let's play

Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness of play is here to stay

They got this and we got that
He got his and she got fat
You've got mine but I've got yours
I've got love but you've got more
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
Let's say hello, its safe to go
Let's play

Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness of play is here to stay
Tell your mom and dad, it's all okay
The holiness of play is here to stay

I've got another one
I've got another one
I've got another one
I've got another one
Woah
I've got a better one

You got yours and I've got mine
He got his and she got shine
We got all but she got high
Some got hot and they got by
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
Let's say hello, its safe to go

Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
The light is right, let's play tonight

Let's make the rise
The sun, the prize
Let's play
Let's playEmbed
