Meet Me at the Corner Lyrics
Please don't ask me who
Who you think I am
I could live without that
I'm just a modest man

Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you

Please don't ask me where
Where you think I've been
I've been a lot of places
But this could be my win

Meet me at the corner where I'll
Tell me what to do
'Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
Something I wanna show
I thought you ought to know

Please don't say you want
To keep in touch out there
To see you on the corner
That I just can't bear

Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait

Hey, and I turn
I turn my head when I thought
I saw a sign from the gods
A sign from the gods
That you weren't meant to be mine
And it's fine
Taking it all for a ride
'Til the day when it's gone
Mystified by where it all went wrong
When it's gone
I live and I learn
And I lose and I win
But it's better than ever whenever I'm in
I thank you girl for everywhere that weâ€™ve been4Embed
