Happiness Loves Company Lyrics
Start marching
'Cause you think you shot to number one
Counting days and
Skipping your stones into the sun
Over age and under thumb, oh
Does it weigh a ton?
I'll be yours tonight
Living the dream of a meteorite

Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah

Short stroking doesn't fly
Better to go for broke
Watch you smoking Mary Jane
And does it make you choke?
Jumping the fence, riding the rails, oh
Can you take a joke?
I'll be yours today
Living the dream with a capital K
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah

Tell me now, I'll tell you how
Just show me where to send

Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone, I guess
I guess

Half blinded
I'm reminded how to find the stairs
Nickel and dimin'
Think it's time to play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry, what a quandary
Ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more
Better than ever, like never before
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A

Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone, I guess
I guess

Sweet talking
As I'm walking through your part of town
Never again
Will Johnny C. a Love Supreme be found
Is it ever meant to be?
And is it so profound?
Is it you and me?
A billion to one, make history
A history

Said yeah, oh yeah
Said yeah, oh yeah
I said yeah, oh yeahEmbed
