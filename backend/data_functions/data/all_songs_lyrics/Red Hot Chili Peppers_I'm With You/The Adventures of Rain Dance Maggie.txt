The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie Lyrics
Lipstick junkie
Debunk the all in one
She came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial
Its just a turn-around
And we go, oh
Well and we go, oh, oh, oh, oh

Tic-toc, I want to
Rock you like the '80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd?
We better get it on the go

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud
I said hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

Rain dance Maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know
Her body was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit

Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

You got the wrong girl
But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, girl
Hey, now
We’ve got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey, now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

But not for long, girl
It's in the song, girl
'Cause I’ll be gone, bye, bye, bye, yeah
Bye bye, bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye, girl
Bye bye14Embed
