Look Around Lyrics
Stiff club, its my nature
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware

It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know, so I told you

Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This is for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you

Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City made breeze gonna stroke my skindow
Just a lot of words on an old brick wall
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care

Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!


Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!

When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around7Embed
