Dose of Thunder Lyrics
Goin' down to the pool hall
You're lookin' for the eight ball
When it comes, when it comes
Only want a little, you need a ton

Gimme one good dose of thunder
Gimme one good dose of thunder

Gimme, gimme, in a hurry
Texas added to Missouri
When it comes, when it comes
Only takes a little 'til you want a ton

One good dose of thunder
Gimme one good dose of thunder
I can feel it startin' to rumble

When it comes, when it comes
It only takes a little 'til you need a ton

Gimme one good dose of thunder
Gimme one good dose of thunder
And I can feel it
Oh, gimme one good dose of thunder
Gimme one good dose of thunder
I can feel it startin' to rumbleEmbed
