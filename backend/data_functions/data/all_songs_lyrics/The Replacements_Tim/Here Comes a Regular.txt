Here Comes a Regular Lyrics
Well, a person can work up a mean, mean thirst
After a hard day of nothin' much at all
The summer's passed, it's too late to cut the grass
There ain't much to rake anyway in the fall
And sometimes I just ain't in the mood
To take my place in back with the loudmouths
You're like a picture on the fridge that's never stocked with food
I used to live at home, now I stay at the house

And everybody wants to be special here
They call your name out, loud and clear

Here comes a regular
Call out your name
Here comes a regular
Am I the only one here today?

Well, a drinkin' buddy that's bound to another town
And once the police made you go away
And even if you're in the arms of someone's baby, now
I'll take a great big whiskey to you anyway
And everybody wants to be someone's here
Someone's gonna show up, never fear

'Cause here comes a regular
Call out your name
Yes, now here comes a regular
Am I the only one who feels ashamed?

Kneeling alongside old Sad Eyes
He says, "Opportunity knocks once, then the door slams shut."
All I know is I'm sick of everything that my money can buy
The fool who wastes his life, God rest his guts
First the lights, then the collar goes up and the wind begins to blow
Turn your back on a pay-you-back, last call
First the glass, then the leaves that last, then comes the snow
Ain't much to rake anyway in the fall2Embed
