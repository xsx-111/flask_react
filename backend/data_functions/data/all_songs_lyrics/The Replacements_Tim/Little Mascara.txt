Little Mascara Lyrics
You and I fall together
You and I sleep alone
After all, things might be better
After one, and there's one that's long gone
For the moon, you keep shootin'
Throw your rope up in the air
For the kids, you stay together
You nap 'em and you slap 'em in a highchair

All you ever wanted
Was someone to take care of ya
All you're ever losin' is
A little mascara
Little mascara
Little mascara

Afternoon, things are quiet
Settle back now if you can
Stations clip by like a rocket
Don't you worry if you wonder why he ran

All you ever wanted
Was someone to take care of ya
All you're ever losin' is
A little mascara
Little mascara
Little mascara
He let you cry
Cry
He let you cry
Your eyes out
He let you cry
He let you cry
He let you cry
Your eyes out

All you ever wanted
Was someone Ma'd be scared of
All you're ever losin' is
A little mascara
A little mascara
A little mascara

He let you cry
He let you cry
He let you cry
Your eyes...
He let you cry
He let her cry
Let her cry
Her eyes...
Cry, oh
Cry
Let her cry1Embed
