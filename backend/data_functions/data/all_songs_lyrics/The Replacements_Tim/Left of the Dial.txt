Left of the Dial Lyrics
Read about your band
In some local page
Didn't mention your name
Didn't mention your name
Sweet Georgia breezes
Safe, cool and warm
I headed up north
You headed north

On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?

Weary voice that's laughin'
On the radio once
We sounded drunk
But you never made it on
Passin' through and it's late
The station started to fade
Picked another one up
In the very next state
On and on and on and on
What side are you on?
On and on and on and on and...

Pretty girl keep growin' up
Playin' make-up, wearin' guitar
Growin' old in a bar
Ya grow old in a bar
Headed out to San Francisco
Definitely not L.A
Didn't mention your name
Didn't mention your name

And if I don't see ya in
A long, long while
I'll try to find you
Left of the dial
Left of the dial
Left of the dial
Left of the dial
Left of the dial
Left of the dial
Left of the dial
Left of the dial, honey2Embed
