Kiss Me on the Bus Lyrics
On the bus
That's where we're riding
On the bus
Okay, don't say "hi," then
Your tongue, your transfer
Your hand, your answer

On the bus
Everyone's looking forward
On the bus
I am looking forward
And it really ain't okay
I might die before Monday
They're all watching us

Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Ooh, if you knew how I felt, now
You wouldn't act so adult, now
Hurry, hurry, here comes my stop

On the bus
Watch our reflection
On the bus
I can't stand no rejection
Come on, let's make a scene
Oh baby, don't be so mean
They're all watching us
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Ooh, if you knew how I felt, now
You wouldn't act so adult, now
Hurry, hurry, here comes my stop

Ooh, if you knew how I felt, now
You wouldn't act so adult, now
They're all watching us
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the bus
Kiss me on the busEmbed
