Hold My Life Lyrics
Oh
Mm, well, well, well, I bought it
Down on all fives
Let me crawl
If I want I could die
Oh, by my hand

Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun
Lose it in the shade

Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Well, well, well
Anyone could tell
Classic awe
A lucky shot
Ooh-leh-do
Hate 'em
Someday soon
Face 'em

Time for decisions to be made
Crack up in the sun
Lose it in the shade

Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Just might, just might, just might

We might crack up in the sun
But we'll lose it in the shade

Razzle dazzle, razzle droll
Time for this one to come home
Razzle dazzle, razzle die
Time for this one to come alive

And hold my life
Until I'm ready to use it
Hold my life
Because I just might lose it
Because I just might lose it
Hold my life
Baby, hold my life

Hold my, hold my
Hold my, hold my
