Waitress in the Sky Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

She don't wear no pants and she don't wear no tie
Always on the ball, she's always on strike
Struttin' up the aisle
Big deal, you get to fly

You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky

Paid my fare, don't wanna complain
You get to me, you're always outta champagne
Treat me like a bum, don't wear no tie

'Cause you ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
Oh oh oh

And the sign says, 'Thank you very much for not smoking'
My own sign says, 'I'm sorry, I'm smoking'
Don't treat me special, oh, don't kiss my ass
Treat me like the way they treat 'em up in first class
Sanitation expert and a maintenance engineer
Garbage man, a janitor and you, my dear
A real union flight attendant, my oh my

You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the sky
You ain't nothing but a waitress in the skyEmbed
