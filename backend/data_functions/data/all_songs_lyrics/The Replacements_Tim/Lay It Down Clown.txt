Lay It Down Clown Lyrics
1, 2...

Got a big switchblade, drop drop bill a tease
There's a deal goin' down, it don't go down without me

The rumors keep on spreadin'
All over town

Lay it down, clown
Lay it down, down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down

Skinny as a rail and you think you got what it takes
The only exercise you ever get is the shakes

The rumors a-keep on spreadin'
All over town

Lay it down, clown
Lay it down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down, oh
Get back to the hills, get back to, back to where you belong
Finally found out which way the wind blows

The rumors keep on spreadin'
All over town

Lay it down, clown
Lay it down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down, down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it down, down
Lay it down, clown
Lay it downEmbed
