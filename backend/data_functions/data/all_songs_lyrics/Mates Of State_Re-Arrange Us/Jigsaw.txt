Jigsaw LyricsYou write the good songs, baby
(You write the good songs, baby)
I'll write until the end
(I'll write until the end)
And you can stand above us
(And you can stand up above us)
And we can still be friends
(And we can still be friends)
It's like a jigsaw maybe
(It's like a jigsaw maybe)
You found the corner piece first
(You found the corner piece first)
We've never asked for nothing
(We've never asked you for nothing)
You're always bearing gifts, aren't you?
(You're always bearing gifts)
You could see us through
You could see us through
Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Da da da, da da da
Your stage is calculated
(Your stage is calculated)
You're hugging stars backstage
(You're hugging stars backstage)
But I like the old songs better
(But I like the old songs better)
Their sting was made for you and me
For you and me
Ooh ooh, ooh ohh
You and me
Ooh ooh ooh
You could see us through
You could see us through
You could see us through
You could see us through
You could see us through
You could see us through
You could see us through
You could see us through
Da da, da da da da
Da da, da da da da
(I'll see you through)
You could see us
Da da, da da da da
Da da, da da da da
(I'll see you through)
You could see us
Da da, da da da da
Da da, da da da da
(I'll see you through)
You could see us
Da da, da da da da
Da da, da da da da
(I'll see you through)
You could see us
Da da, da da da da
Da da, da da da da
(I'll see you through)
You could see us
Da da, da da da da
Da da, da da da da
(I'll see you through)
You could see us throughEmbed
