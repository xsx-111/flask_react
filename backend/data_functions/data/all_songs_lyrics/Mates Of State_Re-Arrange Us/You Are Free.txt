You Are Free LyricsI had a dream last night
That we lost the fight
I had a reason to stay in the back of my head
But I still have to say goodbye
Here in this bed
Free, you are free
Free, you are free
You oughta lay down low
Covered in packs of snow
Lay down low
Covered in packs of snow
I had a dream last night
Cold sweatin' woke in a fright
Counted up all the years
And it soon became clear
Despite all the tears you can cry
We're nearing the end
Free, you are free
Free, you are free
Stop telling me the right way to go
I'm on my own
You're selling our old ways
Stop telling me the right way to go
I'm on my own
You're selling our old ways
Stop telling me the right way to go
I'm on my own
You're selling our old ways
Stop telling me the right way to go
You are free
You are free
Like living things need to be
Free, you are free
Like everything wants to beEmbed
