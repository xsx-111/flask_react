Get Better LyricsForget all your politics for a while
Let the color schemes arrive
Come onboard, it's a curious sight
Absorbing sound that's never been right
Never ahead of, never behind it
Occasionally guarded, just keeps us surrounded
It's luck
Everything's gonna get lighter, even if it never gets better
Ahhh
I propose a less serious boat
But don't mistake it for a party of jokes, who are never ahead of, never behind us
Floating in circles there's more to remind them of less
Everything's gonna get lighter, even if it never gets better
Done. I'm done. I'm doneEmbed
