Now LyricsI've been waiting for a sign
I've been waiting for a sign
To tell me where, tell me where
I belong
And you've been waiting for the night
You've been waiting for the night
To take you far, take you far
Away from me
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Ho, ho, ho, ho
I've been waiting for a sign
I've been waiting for a sign
To tell me where, tell me where
Where I belong
And you've been waiting for the night
You've been waiting for the night
To take you far, take you far
Away from here
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
And as I'm waiting on your doorstep, now
I notice patterns in the paint
I'm wondering how the glass will hit when I
As I turn and go in shame
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, nowEmbed
