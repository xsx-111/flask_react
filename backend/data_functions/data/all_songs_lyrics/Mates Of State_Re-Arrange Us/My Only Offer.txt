My Only Offer LyricsBought a home, we bartered right
Two kids, two car delight
Posed pictures on the walls
Small talk in the bedroom halls
Can't make it home tonight
Go sleep but leave the light
I pretend to make a call
Loose talk into bedroom stalls
Oh oh oh, it's my only offer
Stifled copies of myself
Oh oh oh, or someone else
My friends they all agree
(My friends they all agree)
Give in to our defeat
(Give in to our defeat)
In secret we believe
(In secret we believe)
We're nothing nothing nothing that we need
Oh oh oh, it's my only offer
Stifled copies of myself
Oh oh oh, or someone else
I always wanted to be the face in front of me
Debating a life sucked out the energy
Build up a wall made out of finer things
Piled it high so we could barely see it
Oh oh oh, it's my only offer
Stifled copies of myself
Oh oh oh, it's all I have to offerEmbed
