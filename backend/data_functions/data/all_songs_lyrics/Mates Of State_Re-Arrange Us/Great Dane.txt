Great Dane LyricsIn the center of the living room on the street
Where you gathered up your tapes and you traded me
There's a record on cassette that you left with me
An act of kindness or my own discovery
Discount meals are warm, dear
Then we'll choose our new game teams
But have you heard me
T-t-tonight, T-t-tonight, tonight
Sing in the sunshine
Sing in the sunshine
In the city with the people who never sleep
Busy looking at the pictures of you and me
Narrow driveways holding words that rescue me
You can say it
I need apologies
Discount meals are warm, dear
Old age star on your new home team
I can hear you
T-t-tonight, T-t-tonight, tonight
Sing in the sunshine
Sing in the sunshineEmbed
