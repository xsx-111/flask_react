Lullaby Haze LyricsWhy are you making it harder
Why are you driving it home
I am not the broken hearted
I am just in a lullaby haze
You can pretend you were let down
But we all know the soft seldom survive
I am not the broken hearted
I am just in a lullaby haze
You know it's just getting closer
Without a date and no name
And when you get up in the morning
It's maternal all the same
I am not the broken hearted
I am just in lullaby hazeEmbed
