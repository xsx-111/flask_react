Help Help LyricsCan't you see what's happening on the sidewalk?
Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
It's getting so old
Oh oh, we're lying down
Oh oh, so we can listen to the ground
Can't you see the seams cut in the shoreline?
I'm throwing sand into your hand
Let's paint the whole world
Oh oh, we're lying down
Oh oh, so we can listen to the ground
Help help, can you help help
Don't hesitate
That is why they say it
That is why they say it
Help help
I will meet you on the cellar floor
That is why they say it
That is why they say it at all
Help help, can you help help
Don't hesitate
That is why they say it
That is why they say it girl
Help help, can you help help
The cellar floor
That is why they say it
That is why they say it
Can't you feel the shifting of the stale air?
He doesn't care
Her vacant stare is getting so cold
Oh oh, we're lying down
Oh oh, so we can make a louder sound
I wake up, all I see is new
I witness scenes that I improve
Momentum pull us through
Help help, can you help help
Don't hesitate
That is why they say it
That is why they say it
Help help
I will meet you on the cellar floor
That is why they say it
That is why they say it at all
Help help, can you help help
Don't hesitate
That is why they say it
That is why they say it girl
Help help
And I'll meet you on the cellar floor
That is why they say it
That is why they say it at all
Help help help help help help help help
Help help help help help help help help
That is why they say it
That is why they say it
Help help help help help help help help
Help help help help help help help help
That is why they say it
That is why they say it
Help help help help help help help help
Help help help help help help help help
That is why they say it
That is why they say it
Help help help help help help help help
Help help help help help help help help
That is why they say it
That is why they say itEmbed
