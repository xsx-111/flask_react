The Re-Arranger LyricsRed colonial houses lining all the snow white streets
Working out all our problems there in the back of the house where the ghosts all sleep
I know it's impossible, but you should try to shake it off
With that shot to the chest, boy, I know you mean it (You mean it, you mean it, you mean it)
Defining the problems here, it's the threat at home of regret at home
I know it's impossible, but you should try to shake it off
And if you really wanna shake it off
You've gotta rearrange, rearrange us
Just stop and shake it off
You've gotta rearrange, rearrange
(Rearrange, rearrange, rearrange, rearrange us)
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da, da da
You were turning in anger, she's staring at the back twin trees
(You've got a fury for the smallest things)
Kicking back all that fury there to the part of your head where it can live and seethe
(You've got to bury it in your head)
I know it's impossible, but you should try to shake it off
With that shot to the chest, boy, I know you mean it (You mean it, you mean it, you mean it)
(Staring at the back twin trees)
Now I know what's inside you, I know I don't want you, I know I don't want you
(While you're spinning your anger red)
I know it's impossible, but you should try to shake it off
And if you really wanna shake it off
You've gotta rearrange, rearrange us
Just stop and shake it off
You've gotta rearrange, rearrange
(Rearrange, rearrange, rearrange, rearrange us)
Rearrange us, rearrange us
Rearrange us, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Rearrange us, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Rearrange us, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love loud, don't lose loud
Love loud, don't lose loud
Love loud, don't lose loud
Love loud, don't lose loud
Rearrange us, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Rearrange us, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love loud, don't lose loud
Love loud, don't lose loud
Rearrange us, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Rearrange us, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the rearrangerEmbed
