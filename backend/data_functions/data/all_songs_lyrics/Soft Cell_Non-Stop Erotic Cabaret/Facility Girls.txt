Facility Girls LyricsShe's a secretary in the daytime
A modern venus on the 8th floor
She's a secretary in the daytime
A bright young thing
With a promising career
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's a secretary in the daytime
A model beauty
At the typewriter
She's a secretary in the daytime
A smile for boss
And she's doing fine
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's a secretary in the daytime
She's a secretary in the daytime
She makes herself a drink and she climbs into bed
The sheets so clean and cool
It's so nice to rest her aching head
She thinks back on her working day
Her boss; the silly things he says
She smiles, she shuts her eyes
And she's dreaming of Terry, a mechanic
Sometimes working 8 'til 10
It's so rare she ever sees him
And she wants so much to see him again
He bought her a ring and the flowers on her bedside table
And she knows that she loves him, but does he love her?
She kisses the photo on the wall beside her bed
And tries to hold back a silly tear
She's a working girl now, and Mummy lives so far away
So She bites her lip
She knows that Terry will be calling soon one day
I look at the clock and I'm feeling the rhythm of love
(It's going through me)
I look at the light and it sends a lonely shiver down my spine
(It gets right to me)
I'm thinking of you in some-one else's arms
I'm thinking of you in some-one else's eyes
You're everything I like and everything I despise
(Why don't you leave me?)
Running my fingers through your hair
Running your fingers down the back of my neck
Playing your games with your innocent eyes
I try hard to smile through all of your lies
That start to hurt me, hurt me
It's like a page from true-love stories
It's like a page from true-love stories
It's like a page from true-love stories
A page from true-love stories
She's a secretary in the daytime
A modern venus on the 8th floor
She's a secretary in the daytime
A bright young thing
With a promising career
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
She's got the abilities
She's got the facilities
It's like a page from true-love stories
It's like a page from true-love stories
It's like a page from true-love stories
A page from true-love stories
She found a message on her typewriter
(Like a page from true-love stories)
It said that she was just a normal girl, (It's like a dream)
They also felt she was a human being (like a dream)
They said that she was a facility (A dream)
She found a message on her typewriter, (It's like a dream)
It said that she was just a normal girl, (Like a dream, dream dream)
They also felt she was a human being
They said that she was a facility (Like a dream)
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Shhhhhhh, GoodnightEmbed
