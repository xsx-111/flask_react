Chips on My Shoulder Lyrics
Chips on my shoulder, more
As I grow older
Feel I owe a debt
For the things I don't get
I only miss out
(Well I was there before)
I sit in a corner
Sit on the floor
(x3)
Misery
Complaints
Self pity
Injustice

Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder

There's no time for fun time
It's sit and complain time
I'll talk about famine
While cooking my dinner
Don't you feel guilty
Don't you feel pity (No)
While my head gets fatter
And the starving get thinner
(x3)
Misery
Complaints
Self pity
Injustice

Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder

1,2,3,4..
I should have told you
I've chips on my shoulder
I'm making a stand
While I sit on my arse
Fish and chip supper
While those in the gutter
Can't have a good time
Fun's just a farse
(x3)
Misery
Complaints
Self pity
Injustice
Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder

Chips on my shoulder, more
As I grow older
Feel I owe a debt
For the things I don't get
I only miss out
(Well I was there before)
I sit in a corner
Sit on the floor
(x3)
Misery
Complaints
Self pity
Injustice

Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder
Chips on my shoulder
(Chips on my shoulder)
IÂ´ve got chips on my shoulder
(Chips on my shoulder)
Chips on my shoulder
(Chips on my shoulder)
As I get o-o-oooh
Chips on my shoulder
(Chips on my shoulder)
Chips on my shoulder
(Chips on my shoulder)
Chips, on my shoulder
Chips, on my shoulder1Embed
