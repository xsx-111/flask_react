Sex Dwarf LyricsIsn't it nice? Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
I can make a film and make you my star
You'll be a natural the way you are
I would like you on a long black leash
I will parade you down the high street
You've got the attraction
You've got the pulling power
Walk my little doggie, walk my little sex dwarf
We can make a scene we'll be a team
Making the headlines sounds like a dream
When we hit the floor you just watch them move aside
We will take them for a ride of rides
They all love your miniature ways
You know what they say about small boys
Sex dwarf
I'm in my Rolls Royce, look, it's so huge!
It's big and it's gold
With my dumb chauffeur
Looking to procure, run little doggie
Lure a disco dolly
Run my little sex dwarf, I feel so lonely
Get my little camera, take a pretty picture
Sex dwarf, in a gold Rolls, making it with the dumb chauffeur
Isn't it nice? Sugar and spice
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice?
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
We can make an outfit for my little sex dwarf
To match the gold Rolls on my dumb chauffeur
We'll all look so good, we'll knock 'em cold
Knocking 'em cold in black and gold
We can have playtime in my little playroom
Disco dollies, my sex dwarf and my dumb chauffeur
I would like you on a long black lead
You can bring me all the things I need
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice?
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice?
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice?
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice
Sex dwarf
Isn't it nice?
Luring disco dollies to a life of vice1Embed
