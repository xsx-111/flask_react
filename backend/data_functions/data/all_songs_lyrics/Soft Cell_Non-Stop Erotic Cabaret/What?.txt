What? LyricsDo you want me to
Get down on my knees
Beg you baby, please
Cry a million tears
Do you want me to
Call you on the phone
Beg you to come home
Think of all the years
When I once lived in paradise
When the love light shone in your eyes
Oh baby
What can I do when I still love you
What can I say when I still want you
What can I do
What can I say
You'll never know this way
Do you want me to
Follow you around
Everywhere in town
Do you want a clown
Why do you
Treat me mean and cruel
Breaking every rule
Can I be your fool
We can make this a happy home
So come back where you belong
Oh baby
What can I do when I still love you
What can I say when I still want you
What can I do
What can I say
You'll never know this way
Please forgive me, come back, and then
We can fall in love
Over and over and over and over again
Oh baby
What can I do when I still love you
What can I say when I still want you
Won't you come back
Oh baby,what can I say
I said, what can I do
Oh baby,what can I say
I said, won't you come back
I said, won't you come back
I said, what can I do
I said, what can I say
I said, won't you come back
I said, won't you come back
Won't you come back
Oh baby, won't you come back
Oh baby,what can I say
I said, what, what, what...can I say
Won't you come back
Won't you come back
Won't you
Won't you come back...2Embed
