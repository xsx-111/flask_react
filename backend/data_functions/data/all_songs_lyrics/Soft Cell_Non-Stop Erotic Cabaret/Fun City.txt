Fun City LyricsFun City
I left my home
With a pain in my heart
Not a word of goodbye
To the ones that I loved
I'm taking a train
Away from the rain
To the lights and the smoke
I've got to find my own way now
Fun City
To the London Experience
Fun City
To the London Experience
Backward
Forwards
Wearing out the corners
Fun City
Here's my experience
Have no feelings
Have no sex
I wonder who to pick up next
Playland Scandal
Pocket weighs you down
Machine handle
Goes down
I lose all my money
Trying to make a killing
Can't even make my fare back home
So this is Fun City
Have no feelings
Have no sex
Wonder who
To pick up next
I tried to make friends
Tried to make amends
I sunk so low
That it's hard to climb out
I've nowhere to live
But I've so much to give
I found the hard way
What's life all about
Have no feelings
Have no sex
I wonder who to pick up next
I'm all alone
And I'm lost in this city
Being paraded
Feeling degraded
I wanted love
And I thought this was the way
But I'm only young
And I'm often this wrong
Have no feelings
Have no sex
Wonder who to pick up next
I have no morals
Have no innocence
I'm quite straight
Just playing for rentEmbed
