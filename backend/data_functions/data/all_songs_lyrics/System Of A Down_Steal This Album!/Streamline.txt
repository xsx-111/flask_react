Streamline Lyrics
I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you

I know weather's gonna be fine
But I can't see you 'cross the streamline
My love waits for me in daytime
But I can't see you through the snowblind

But I wasn't there for you, you are gone
And I wasn't there for you, goodbyes are long
Goodbye
And I wasn't there for you, goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye

Well, I know time reveals in hindsight
I can wrestle with the stormy night
Because your love lasts a lifetime
But I can see you through the snowblind

But I wasn't there for you, you are gone
And I wasn't there for you, goodbyes are long
You are gone
And I wasn't there for you, goodbyes are long
And I wasn't there for you, goodbye!

I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there
I wasn't there for you

I wasn't there for you, you are gone
And I wasn't there for you, goodbyes are long
Goodbye!14Embed
