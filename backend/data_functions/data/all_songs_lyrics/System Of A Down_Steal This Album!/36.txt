36 Lyrics
Television is disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race
Can you break out, can you break out
Will you live at your own pace?

Life, so, unnecessary

Television is disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race
Can you break out, can you break out
Will you live at your own pace?

Now will you live at your own pace?
Will you live at your own pace?6Embed
