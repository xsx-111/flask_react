Thetawaves Lyrics
The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
The senses collect undeniable data
Of beta-carotene and thetawaves
The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
Then the senses wanted the sky

All rise
Eyes bound

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside

The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
The people collect undeniable data
About high pulse weapons and microwaves
The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
Then the people found out the lie
All rise
Eyes bound
Now arise
Heaven bound

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside


Wanting to get you high
Wanting to touch the sky

All rise
Eyes bound
Now arise
Heaven bound

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles in-4Embed
