Ego Brain Lyrics
Life is but a dream
Drifting on a stream, a stream
Consciously it seems
All of what remains

Ego Brain, man made shame
Shame love after it rains

You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the Fall
As I turn to sand, you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

I am just a man
Fighting other men for land, for land
While I turn to sand
In Spite of the pain

Ego Brain, man made shame
Shame love after it rains
You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the Fall
As I turn to sand, you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

All of what remains...

Ego Brain, man made shame
Shame love after it rains

You see my pain is real, watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the Fall
As I turn to sand, you took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

Love after it rains8Embed
