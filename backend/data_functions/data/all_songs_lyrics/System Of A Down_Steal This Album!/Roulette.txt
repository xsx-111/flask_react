Roulette Lyrics
I have a problem that I cannot explain
I have no reason why it should have been so plain
Have no questions but I sure have excuse
I lack the reason why I should be so confused

I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
Around you

Left a message but it ain't a bit of use
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained
Playing the show when running down the plane

I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
I, I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
Around you, around you, around you

I, I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
I, I know, how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you
Around you, around you, around you, around you11Embed
