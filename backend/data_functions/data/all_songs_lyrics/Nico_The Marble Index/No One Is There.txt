No One Is There Lyrics
Across from behind my window screen
Demon is dancing down the scene
In a crucial parody
Demon is dancing down the scene

He is calling and throwing his arms up in the air
And no one is there
All of them are missing as the game comes to a start
No one is there

Some are calling, some are sad
Some are calling him mad
No one is there
Across from behind your window screen
Demon is dancing down the scene
In a crucial parody
Demon is dancing down the scene

He is calling and throwing his arms up in the air
No one is there
All of them are missing as the game comes to a start
No one is there
And no sound has them
Declared
To be missing (To be missing)
To be missing (To be missing)
To be missing (To be missing)5Embed
