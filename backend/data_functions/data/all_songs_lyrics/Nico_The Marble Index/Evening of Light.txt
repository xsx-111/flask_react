Evening of Light Lyrics
Midnight winds are landing at the end of time
Midnight winds are landing at the end of time

A true story wants to be mine
A true story wants to be mine
The story is telling a true lie
The story is telling a true lie
Mandolins are ringing to his viol singing
Mandolins are ringing to his viol singing

Midnight winds are landing at the end of time
Midnight winds are landing at the end of time

Dungeons sink in to a slumber till the end of time
Dungeons sink in to a slumber till the end of time
Petrel sings, the doorbells pound into the unlit end of time
Petrel sings, the doorbells pound into the unlit end of time

Midnight winds are landing at the end of time
Midnight winds are landing at the end of time
In the morning of my winter
When my eyes are still asleep
In the morning of my winter
When my eyes are still asleep
A dragonfly lady in a coat of snow
I'll send to kiss your heart for me
A dragonfly lady in a coat of snow
I'll send to kiss your heart for me

Midnight winds are landing at the end of time
Midnight winds are landing at the end of time

The children are jumping in the evening of light
The children are jumping in the evening of light
The peasants' hands are heavy in the evening of light
The peasants' hands are heavy in the evening of light

Midnight winds are landing at the end of time
Midnight winds are landing at the end of time2Embed
