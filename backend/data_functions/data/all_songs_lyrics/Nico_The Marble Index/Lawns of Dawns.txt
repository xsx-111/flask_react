Lawns of Dawns Lyrics
Can you follow me?
Can you follow my distresses
My caresses, fiery guesses?
Swim and sink into
Early morning messes

He blesses you, he blesses me
The day the night caresses
Caresses you, caresses me
Can you follow me?

Dawn, your guise has filled my nights with fear
At each closing of my eyes
You never see these pictures in my mind
Can you follow me?

Aside from leaving overdrawn caresses
Aside from having thrown a joke on you and me
Can you follow me?

I cannot understand the way I feel
Until I rest on lawns of dawns
Can you follow me?6Embed
