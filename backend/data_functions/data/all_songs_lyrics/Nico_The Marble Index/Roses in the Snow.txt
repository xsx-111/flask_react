Roses in the Snow LyricsHe came your way, and when he had to go
There were roses growing in the snow
Silently, you'll go through the shadow of your soul
And you know that it was like this before we had to go
You will never see these lights
Glowing in your nights
Until you feel this way
With every moon
It is as though you're getting closer to your soul
And then you'll go alone, and with no fear
Then you will know that it was like this before he had to go
And you will find that you were blind
Until you saw these lights
Glowing in your nights
He came your way, and when he had to go
There were roses growing in the snow
Silently you'll go through the shadow of your soul
But you know that it was like this before he had to go
You will never see these lights
Glowing in your nights
If you don't know
And there are roses growing in the snow1Embed
