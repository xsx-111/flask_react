Nibelungen Lyrics
Since the first of you and me, asleep
In a Nibelungen land
Titanic curses trap me in
At banishment of state
Symbols vanish from my senses
Dim and stale, the view appears

Symbols captured in a trance
Vanish from my glance
For the various defences
I enforce a strike, the alarm
For the various defences
That choose to be here and there
And lose the direction everywhere

Since the first of you and me, asleep
In a Nibelungen land, where we cannot be
Almond trees grow along the mountain trail
From their tongues, the words are spelling
They're telling numb
I cannot hear it anymore
I cannot hear it anymore
Since the first of you and me, here and there
We lose the direction everywhere
Shrieking city sun, shiver in my veins
In flames I run
In flames I run
Waiting for the sign to come

Will you spell the words for me?
Will you spell the words for me to hear?
Nibelungen, nibelungen
