Candy Lyrics
Candy told me
Nothing really matters anymore
When I ask her what she means
She says I oughta know

Candy says she's made arrangements
For me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candyland

Candy says she wonders why we try
I couldn't think of what to say
I had no ready reply
Candy says I'd like it where she is
She says it's an opportunity I don't want to miss

Candy says she's made arrangements
For me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candyland
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candyland
Candy asked me if she died
If I could go on
Of course I said I couldn't
And of course we knew that's wrong
But candy, I said, candy no you can't do that to me
Because you love me way too much
For you to ever leave

Candy says she's made arrangements
For me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candyland

Candy says she's made arrangements
For me in the sand
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candyland
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candyland
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candyland
Candy says she wants me with her
Down in candylandEmbed
