All Wrong Lyrics
She had black hair
Like ravens crawling over her shoulders
All the way down

She had a smile that swerved
She had a smile that curved
She had a smile that swerved all over the road

It's all wrong, all wrong
All wrong, all wrong

She had a way of
Making people feel good to be around her
As it should be

It's all wrong, all wrong
All wrong, all wrong
All wrong, all wrong
All wrong

And when she laughs I travel back in time
Something flips the switch
And I collapse inside

It's all wrong, all wrong
All wrong, all wrong
All wrong, all wrong
