A Head with Wings Lyrics
I've got a head with wings
I got a head with wings
I got a head with wings
And I can see so far away I can see so clear
You would not believe the view up here

I got a head with wings
A head with wings

Now I'm floating around up here way above the clouds
So high above the ground
And the only thing that holds my head to the ground
Is this one little skinny string

I got a head with wings, head with wings
I got a head with yeah oh
A head with wings

I got a head with wings
I got a head with wings
I got a head with wings
And I can see so far away yes so far away
Well I can see the shadows fall across your face
I got a head with wings
Head with wings
I got a head with yeah yeah

A head with wings
A head with wings
Yeah yeahEmbed
