Sheila Lyrics
Sheila has a cat, she pets the cat
Puts a spell on the cat, a beautiful cat
Sheila has a cat, she pets the cat
Yeah the beautiful cat says
Sheila, Sheila
Sheila has a cat, she pets the cat
Puts a spell on the cat, a beautiful cat
She takes the cat, looks him in the eyes
Makes him reply
Sheila Sheila

Oh most gracious of beings
Oh most gracious of beings my queen
I'm yours to command
Yours to command
I'm yours to command
Sheila, Sheila

Sheila has a cat, she pets the cat
Puts a spell on the cat
She runs her fingers down his back
Cause sheila has a cat, puts a spell on the cat
Looks him in the eyes, makes him reply
Sheila, Sheila
Sheila, SheilaEmbed
