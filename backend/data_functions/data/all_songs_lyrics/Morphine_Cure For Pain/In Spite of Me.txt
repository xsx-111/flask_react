In Spite of Me Lyrics
Last night I told a stranger all about you
They smiled patiently with disbelief
I' always knew you would succeed
No matter what you tried

And I know you did it all
In spite of me

Still I'm proud to have known you
For the short time that I did
Proud to have been a step up on your way
Proud to be a part of your illustrious career

And I know you did it all
In spite of me
In spite of me

Late last night
I saw you in my living room
You seemed so close but yet so cool
For a long time I thought that you'd be coming back to me
Those kind of thoughts can be so cruel
So cruel
And I know you did it all
In spite of me
In spite of me1Embed
