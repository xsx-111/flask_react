Buena Lyrics
I hear a voice
From the back of the room
I hear a voice cry out
We want something good

Well come on a little closer, let me see your face
Yeah come on a little closer by the front of the stage
I said come on a little closer, I got something to say
Yeah come on a little closer wanna see your face

You see I met a devil named buena buena
And since I met the devil I ain't been the same, oh no
And I feel alright now I have to tell you
I think it's time for me to finally introduce you to the
Buena buena buena buena good good girl

It's comin' to me
Yeah it's comin' to me
Now I think I know
What it is you need
I know some people wanna make a change
But I know how to make it go away
You see I met a devil named buena buena
And since I met the devil I ain't been the same, oh no
And I feel alright I have to tell you
I think it's time for me to finally introduce you to the
Buena buena buena buena good good girl2Embed
