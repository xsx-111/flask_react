In Hell Lyrics
With my luck, you'll be dead within the year
I've come to expect it
There's nothing left to fear, at least there's that
Face to face, and at my hands
I snowed you in with hydrocodone
Layer by layer 'til you disappear

Hell is finding someone to love
And I can't have you
Hell is finding someone to love
And I can't see you again

Wheeled you and laid on your side
I cried and cried and at my signal
They stopped your heart and then you died
And under the fluorescence, another sterile room
Where no one ever tells you just how clinical death looks
And I can't unsee it, the two shots it took

Hell is finding someone to love
And I can't have you
Hell is finding someone to love
And I can't see you again
Hell is finding someone to love
And I can't feel you
Hell is finding someone to love
And I can't, I can'tEmbed
