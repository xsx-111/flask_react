Slide Tackle Lyrics
I want to be good
I want to navigate this hate in my heart
Somewhere better
I want to feel it
But with the feel, there is an ache I meet
To desire living

Don't mind me while
I'm tackling this void
Slide tackling my mind
This weight feels like
I'm wrestling with my head
Obsessing in the dark

So be good to me, be good to me
You and me always had a good time
And what else is left, babe?
So be good to me, be good to me
The day's not a wash until you say

Don't mind me while
I'm tackling this void
Slide tackling my mind
Long nights where I'm
I'm wrestling with my head
Obsessing in the dark
Obsessing in the dark
Obsessing in the dark2Embed
