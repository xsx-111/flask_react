Sit Lyrics
Hear my name in your mouth and I'm done for
Say to sit on your face in O's and ones
It's a chase sequence on loop
It's the life that you chose and it kills me

Caught up in the idea of someone
Caught up in the idea of you
That's done too soon

It's your name in my mouth I'm repeating
It's the taste of your tongue I can't spit out
I keep watching the way he looks through you
I keep watching your ways, I miss it all

Caught up in the idea of someone
Caught up in the idea of you
That's gone too soonEmbed
