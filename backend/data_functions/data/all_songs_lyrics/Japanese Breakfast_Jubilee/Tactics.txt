Tactics Lyrics
Tried, tried to recall
Memories of peaches, the sun on my neck
And I guess without you, I would attach myself too
Without much discretion of who

So I had to
Move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from me
Move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from me

So say, say what you want
Dose up on fiction, disfigure the truth
While I walk, life beating on
Aching for others with love that stops short

A love that has to
Move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from me
Move a great distance from you
Cross a sea, keep you from meEmbed
