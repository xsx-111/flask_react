Kokomo, IN Lyrics
If I could throw my arms around you
For just another day
Maybe it'd feel like the first time
Now that you're away
I'll just spend my life not knowing
How it'd feel to

These days, I can't shake the awful feeling
I'm missing something I can't place
Is that you?
Manifesting like the fear of an oven left on
God, I felt so much back then
I was soft as a dune

If ever you come back
Wherever you find your way to
And though it may not last
Just know that I'll be here longing

I'll wait, passing time just popping wheelies
And kicking round this flyover state
Watching you show off to the world the parts I fell so hard for
God, I wish we could go back there
Left alone in my room
I know they deserve you too
And maybe I'm not that worthy
If ever you come back
Wherever you find your way to
And though it may not last
Just know that I'll be here longing
If ever you come back
Wherever you find your way to
And though it may not last
You know that I'll be here always2Embed
