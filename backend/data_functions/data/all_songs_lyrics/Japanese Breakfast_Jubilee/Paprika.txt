Paprika Lyrics
Lucidity came slowly
I awoke from dreams of untying a great knot
It unraveled like a braid into what seemed were thousands
Of separate strands of fishing line
Attached to coarse behavior, it flowed
A calm it urged, what else is here?

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found
No water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projеcting your visions to strangers
Who feel it, who listen to linger on еvery word

Oh, it's a rush
Oh, it's a rush

But alone, it feels like dying
All alone, I feel so much
I want my offering to woo, to calm, to clear, to solve
But the only offering that comes
It calls, it screams, there's nothing here

How's it feel to be at the center of magic
To linger in tones and words?
I opened the floodgates and found
No water, no current, no river, no rush
How's it feel to stand at the height of your powers
To captivate every heart?
Projecting your visions to strangers
Who feel it, who listen to linger on every word

Oh, it's a rush
Oh, It's a rush8Embed
