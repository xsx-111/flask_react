Sparklegirl LyricsA good girl always knows what's right
Don't forget your keys now
Don't be late
I'm told that if you last the night
They'll make you drown or float
Just wait
Be more like a fire than a firefly
Cuz that's the best way to be happy
Sparklegirl
It's clear there's an awful lot to fear
That so up
And I won't try to you slow down
But I gotta get there first
Or be buried
It's not like us
To say we told you so
It's no like life
To be that fair
Sparklegirl it's clear
There's an awful lot to fear
That's so up
Sparklegirl it's clear
There's an awful lot to fear
That's so up
And i won't try to slow you down
But i've gotta get there first
Or be buriedEmbed
