Alouette & Me LyricsSo you trade me in for them
When they're so mean
I wouldn't do that
If I were you
Why would you say all those love thing
When you knew you'd leave?
I wouldn't say that
If I were you
Alouette and me
I don't wanna know you lately
Alouette and me
Why'd you go and ruin everything?
In a dream I held my head up
But I'm not brave
Let them see it
What you've done
Stultifier
You're such a liar
And you should be ashamed
Let them see it
What you've done
Alouette and me
I don't wanna know you lately
Alouette and me
Why'd you go and ruin everything?
But it's alright
And I'm not mad
Even though I'm not there
For you no more
Alouette and me
Just mark off the territory
It's the strangest thing
It doesn't hurt
But I won't forget the sting
But it's alright
And I'm not mad
Even thought I'm not there
For you now moreEmbed
