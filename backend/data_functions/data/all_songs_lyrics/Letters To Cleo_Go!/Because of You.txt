Because of You LyricsI can stand here and do this again
I can say it but where to begin
I know that I'm caving in
Cause I'm heavy, I'm heavy
So the wonder of you is done
I'm tired and bloodied and good to be gone
I know that you did me wrong
Cause I'm ready, I'm ready
As for the part about having something more
Let's not pretend that it's like it was before
And I wish I could say that it's not because of you
But it's all because of you
I've a dark and snowy remembrance of this
But remind me again of what I'm gonna miss
When all you do is let me down
Your better tell me something
And tell it to me now
As for the part about having something more
Let's not pretend that it's like it was before
And I wish I could say that it's not because of you
But it's all because of you
And are you sorry?
As for the part about having something more
Let's not pretend that it's like it was before
And I wish I could say that it's not because of you
But it's all because of you
And it's all because of you
The light went black and I got scaredEmbed
