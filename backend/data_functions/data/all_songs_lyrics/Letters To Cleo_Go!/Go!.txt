Go! LyricsSay it, a good clip
Is a real good way to go real fast
Say it, I'm on track
And I'm built for speed
Pull up the back
On your mark
Ready, set
Go!
Teaser, with pretty lines
With your shiny glass and perfect timing
Ease up against my spine
Cause there's still a million miles to climb
On your mark
Go!
Would I do what it takes
If it would shut you off?
Now don't be so sure
But don't make me have to find out cause
I feel lucky, you look nice and
I'm not gonna say it twice cause
You're in my car now
Say it, a good clip
Is a real good way to go real fast
Could I do what it takes
If it would shut you off?
Now don't be so sure
But don't make me have to find out cause
I feel lucky, you look nice and
I'm not gonna say this twice cause
You're in my car
You're in my car nowEmbed
