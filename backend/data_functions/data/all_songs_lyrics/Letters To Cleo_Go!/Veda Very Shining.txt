Veda Very Shining LyricsThat was my heart when time was a seed
Tell me what it means
We made it out okay but soon it turned to dust
Tell me what it means
Cut it out and get off the floor
Because it doesn't make you matter more
Veda very shining who will you wait up for
Life love heaven death
Is that what makes you such a mess
Veda very shining
At the well and out of luck you said "I've had enough"
But still you couldn't make a man out of me
Is that such a bad disease
Cut it out and get off the floor
Because it doesn't make you matter more
Veda very shining and who will you wait up for
Life love heaven death
Is that what makes you such a mess
Veda very shining
You're not real and yet you seem familiar
Is that what you want
You're not real and yet you seem familiar
Is that... what you want
That was my heart when time was...
A seed
Tell me what it means
Cut it out get off the floor
Because it doesn't make you matter more
Veda very shining and who will you wait up for
Life love heaven death
Is that what makes you such a mess
Veda very shiningEmbed
