Disappear LyricsWhat would you do for me my sweet cherubic baby?
Ideally way up high and lovely
Well I had a thought that I'm not waiting for you any more
I'm astral, crystalline pure through
You could disappear tomorrow
Who would care?
It's not like the retribution
Would end there
You could disappear
Tell us a story
Tell us all about your heavenly lie
In detail, and don't leave out a word
I'm listening
All grown up Stepford son
Don't ever change
Don't go away
You're too quiet
Ever to be heard
But you could
Disappear tomorrow
Who would care?
It's not like the retribution
Would end there
You could disappear tomorrow
But let me make it clear so
Keep your eyes down low
And keep very still
Just keep your eyes down low
And keep very still
Just keep your eyes down low
And keep very still
