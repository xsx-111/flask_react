Anchor LyricsThe anchor is a kickstand
So you're going down with me
To the wrong side
Of the quicksand and
Our flashlight destiny
You can be the walker cuz i'm gonna be your wire
You can be the ugly truth
Cuz i'm gonna be your liar
Still the future lit up
So bright for all to see
I can't look now cuz you're all the same
You're all the same to me
Up and away
Up and away
The anchor is a kickstand
So you're going down with me
To the wrong side of the quicksand
And our flashlight destiny
It's all wrong
We tripped along
So much worse off for it and
Only god can help the one
Who put the magnets in your head
Up and away up
Up and away with you
If i could just get up
I'd be fine
If i could just get up
The anchor is a kickstand
So you're going down with me
To the wrong side
Of the quicksand and
Our flashlight destiny
The anchor is a kickstand
So i'm taking you down
To the wrong side of the quicksand
So i'm taking you downEmbed
