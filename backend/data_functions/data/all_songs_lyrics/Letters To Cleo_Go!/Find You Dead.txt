Find You Dead LyricsOnce i knew this boy
You wanted what you could get if you wanted is so bad
Why did you go and take it out in trade instead
My momma cried she shook and wandered off to a different place and
My daddy couldn't make things better then
If he couldn't say it
Chorus
Wait around and maybe i'll forget about it after awhile
But instead i like to think ahead
'til they find you dead
Skipping out on god is bad
But not worse than mitigating it
That's why i don't
Make the time to hope or pray
So i'm just gonna shine
In the brillance
Of the only one who's gotten you behind
Chorus
'til i find a bag and get my turn in effigy you'll burnEmbed
