Tessio LyricsI guess you turn me on
When you're gone
For me it didn't go wrong
We just made another song
Both getting it alone
Never asking it for long
It's just that the world ain't enough
And it never was for the two of us
Baby, it's OK
I guess you make me warm
When you do the harm
Making everybody calm
Getting creative with your charm
I'm trying to be all yours
Although i ain’t answering your calls
Don't say it's false
I'm only following my thoughts
Baby, it's OK
We'll make it better
Maybe I’ll survive
Without these women in my lifeEmbed
