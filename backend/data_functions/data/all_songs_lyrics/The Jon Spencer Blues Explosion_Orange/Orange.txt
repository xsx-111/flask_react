Orange LyricsOrange
I see a orange
See a orange
Blue
Smooth core too
I see an orange
A UFO
Got to go Star Trek style
Orange
I see a worm up on a platform
I got the blues
Can I scream?
A close crop
Nazi style
I'm full
Life gets short
Orange!
Shout!
Iâ€™m moving right
To the side of your mouth
I scream
I see a orange
I see a orange
Blue
Smooth core too
...
I love youEmbed
