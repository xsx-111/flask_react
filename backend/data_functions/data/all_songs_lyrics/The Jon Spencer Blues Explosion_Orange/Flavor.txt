Flavor LyricsAright, I’d like to dedicate this song to Mr. Gerard Cosloy
Lead singer of the rock group Envelope
Walking down Avenue B
Crazy
Man, how he
Think about a sound
Way back
Blues
Well, Ida Red
You got the taste
Explosion man
He got the flavor
No history
Don’t got to know
Well, Ida Red
It takes you there
You got to know
I tell you the blues
It start the feeling
You got the flavor
Well, Ida Red, it tastes like this
I don’t got the tongue
Nobody do
Well, Ida Red
Woman of love
The girls will tell ya
I get down, babe
You can’t be cooler
No rock ‘n’ roller
Well, Ida Red, she got the flavor
A long time ago
There was a king
Jumped over the wall
In Africa
I came on home
I play it interstate
My baby crazy
She got the taste
Sinful
You got the flavor
You got the flavor
You got the flavor
You got the flavor
It tastes of this
It tastes of that
It tastes of this
Like that
Damn
Damn
Punk ass mother humper
Everybody scared
Oh, hey
People are crazy
Try something new
Way back
Yeah
Way back
Way back
Way back

Mr Judah Bauer
Jon
The number one blues singer in the country
Blues Explosion!
Yeah, that’s right, we’re number one
Number one in Philadelphia
Number one in D.C
Number one in Chicago
Number one in Detroit
Number one in Austin
Huston, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver
We’re number one in New York City, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Cincinnati, Jackson Mississippi
I said the blues is number one
The blues is number one
Soul!
Feel so good about a piece of trash
Prefer it to drugs
Drink it from my glass
The worms are hungry
Looking for my guitar
White lightning
No fruit jar
I get juiced
From Africa to Spain
Ghetto blastin’ the diamond lane
Fix my strings in the sycamore shade
Dig my grave with the silver spade
Makin’ a list, I’m takin’ requests
Flip ’em the blues outta your vest
Strictnine, hit ’em with the thud
Strip-mine goes the flood
When you dig up the past
The bones is just toys
Beat your fists through the static and the noise
‘Cause I got the blues
And I can’t be satisfied
Get the blues
Gonna catch that train and ride
Yeah
Got it
That good?
Got it
All right
You want me to do one more?
You got the flavor
You want me to do one more?
You got the flavor
You got the flavor
You got the flavor
You got the flavor
You got the flavor
You got the flavorEmbed
