Ditch LyricsI'm looking now at a pearl
She got a shovel and a hoe
She got some new improved shit
That can get a man go
Said I mess up
Damn
Get it from her
Gonna ride you on to hell
And baby then I do
Down on by the street
Down on Ludlow street
Avenue A, B, C, D
Get it all for you
Get all the people on
Oh baby, baby please
Get all the score to go
Ill take it in
Gonna ride this fiddle-de-dee
Check it bucket
Is it a good?
Sho' 'nuff, money good enough
Take a look at this
All over
She got me standin'
You got me standin'
You got me, begging, pleading
Shot
I got the hard up early in the mornin'
Oh baby, til twelve
I'm gonna dig that ditch
I'm gonna dig that ditch
I'm gonna dig that ditch
I'm gonna dig that ditchEmbed
