Blues X Man Lyrics"Hey, don't call me after twelve
That's when I'm laying in bed home with the wife
I don't wanna be bothered nor in the morning either
You see, punk, I got to get some love. Understand?
Oh my"
Don't you wanna make it
Like a blues explosion?
Blues explosion man
Don't you?
If a Jehovah's Witness come knocking on my door
On a Saturday gimme one hand loose
I get hot, hot, hot, hot
I leave 'em low
Welcome, fool
One day I was laying down
I need a man, a man, a man, a man
A blues explosion man
And I wanna tell you right now at this time
Turn the stereo up, yeah
Hell yeah
I got to have all that fine love
Oh babyEmbed
