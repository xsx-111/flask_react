Bellbottoms Lyrics
(Hey!) Yeah, ha ha
(Hey!) Like that time, yeah, baby
(Hey!) To catch the whole
(Hey!) New York City
Blues explosion
Blues explosion!

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen
Right now I got to tell you about the fabulous
Most groovy
Bellbottoms (ugh!)
Bellbottoms (ugh!)
Yeah! (ugh!)
Bellbottoms, bellbottoms
Bellbottoms, bellbottoms
Bellbottoms truly make me wanna dance
I wanna dance
Tell 'em
Sit back, just watch 'em
Gotta have bellbottoms
Ooh, down on her hips
She's got them
She's got them
She's got them
She's got them
Blues explosion
She's got them
I wanna dance
All right
Bellbottoms, bellbottoms
Bellbottoms, bellbottoms
Im gonna break
I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break
Come on
I wanna dance
I got to do it again
Come on!
Bellbottoms

Bellbottoms, bellbottoms
