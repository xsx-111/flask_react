Full Grown LyricsBaby, baby, you sure like to fuck
Baby, baby, baby, oh yeah, fuck
Rock ‘n’ roll
I’m talkin’ about rock ‘n’ roll
Yeah!
Full grown, get down
I need a full grown woman
Ah
Full grown woman out to drive me wild
Full grown lovin’, crazy style
She said “Wake up daddy
It’s time for the mornin’ ride”
Oh, Lord have mercy, eyy
Full grown, get down
I, I need a full grown woman
I need a head full of air
Full grown
I’m gonna let you get on top
Get on top
Then I’m gonna, I
Man, I'm gonna dance
Hey
Oh, hey
Ah, shucks
Make me feel so unnecessary
Ah, incomplete
My father was Sister Ray
My father was Sister Ray
Take a whiff of my pant leg baby
Oh yeah
Yeah
Full grown, get down
I need a, I need, full grown woman
Down on this
Full grown woman like to fuck
I said
Full grown woman like to fuck
Now you girls

Man you just don’t know what’s happenin’
I said a, full grown woman
Come on
Full grown woman
Come on
I said full grown
