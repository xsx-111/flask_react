Dissect LyricsI got to remove the hide
From this warm living body, good God
Powerful message in the air
I’m gonna get that dissect!
Ooh, you’re so sweet
Pull the guts out, that’s what I need
I got to, got to, got to dissect
I’m gonna do it again
I got to dissect
Play the blues, punk
I’m gonna treat you so bad I'm gonna
Treat you so bad I'm gonna
Treat you so bad
This lover here tastes a whole lot like chicken
Damn, God damn
Fantastic
Chew
I need love
I need love
I got to remove the hide
From this warm living body
I need love
Good damn
I need love
Got the
Got the
Got the
Got theEmbed
