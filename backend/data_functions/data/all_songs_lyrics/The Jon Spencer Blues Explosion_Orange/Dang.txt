Dang LyricsStop all of it now
Get a load of this
Next thing you know
You never were the one
Somebody help me
I can’t handle myself
Just when I knew
Dang, shine on
No, baby can’t help
No, baby can’t help
No, baby can’t help
No, baby can’t help
No, baby can’t help
No, baby can’t help
Can you give me a rockin’
Action packed?
I’m gonna do it
Believe I’m
Greasy hair
Ain’t nobody care
Slacked off your ass
Dang, motherfucker
Come on baby said help
Come on baby said help
Come on baby said help
Come on baby ah!Embed
