Cowboy LyricsI opened up my mouth
What come out don’t matter
Words always find me
To love someone
I don't - do you?
Ask why I destroy
That man don’t work for me
I hold nothin’
To love someone
God only knows what you're doing
...
And I can’t even do it
Oh Lord, mercy
To love someone
I don't care, let me tell youEmbed
