Secret Side Lyrics
Without a guide, without a hand
Unwed virgins in the land
Unwed virgins in the land, tied upon the sand
When there come ships into the land
They'll be awaiting reverence
They'll be awaiting reverence at their children's hands

Are you not loyal to your pride?
Are you not on the secret side?
Is not the crime a gain to you?
Do you not understand?

Without a guide, without a hand
Unwed virgins in the land
Unwed virgins in the land, tied upon the sand
When there come ships into the land
They'll be awaiting reverence
They'll be awaiting reverence at their children's hands

Are you not loyal to your pride?
Are you not on the secret side?
Is not the crime a gain to you?
Do you not understand?Embed
