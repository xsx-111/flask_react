Innocent and Vain Lyrics
The secrets that I do not know
I cannot understand them
A wanted series printed over
Words are his defenses

The battle bracelets do not fit
My favorite gladiator
A fanatic hero piously
Has to be a faker

He is a dangerous creator
A master in his mortal cave
I am a savage violator
A valet innocent and vainEmbed
