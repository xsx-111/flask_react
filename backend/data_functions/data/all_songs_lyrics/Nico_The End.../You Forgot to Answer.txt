You Forgot to Answer LyricsWhen I remember what to say
When I remember what to say
You will know me again
And you forget to answer
When I remember what to say
When I remember what to say
You will know me again
And you forget to answer
You seem not to be listening
You seem not to be listening
The high tide is taking everything
And you forget to answer
When I remember what to say
When I remember what to say
You will know me again
And you forget to answerEmbed
