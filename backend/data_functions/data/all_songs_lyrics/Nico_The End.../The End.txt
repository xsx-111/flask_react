The End LyricsThis is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my only friend, the end
Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety, no surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes again
Can you picture what we'll be?
So limitless and free?
Desperately in need of some stranger's hand
In a desperate land?
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane
All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west
(West is the best)
(The west is the best)
Ride the snake
Ride the snake to the lake
The ancient lake
The snake is long
Seven miles
Ride the snake
He's old and his skin is cold
The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is calling us
The blue bus is calling us
"Driver, where're you taking us?"
The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went to the room where his sister lived
And then he paid a visit to his brother
And then he...
He walked on down the hall
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
"Father?" "Yes, son?"
"I want to kill you
Mother, I want to..."
Ohh
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
Come on, baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
This is the end, beautiful friend
This is the end, my only friend, the end
It hurts to set you free, but you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the endEmbed
