Valley of the Kings Lyrics
The bandits be my weaknesses
His fault shall be my knife
His weapon be
His weapon be my innocence
The killer must not die

Is there a charge against my fate?
Can't I betray my hate?
Will I regain my father's gait?
Must the killer die?

The testament lies hidden from me
Underneath my sins
A carriage
A carriage will take me to
The Valley of the Kings1Embed
