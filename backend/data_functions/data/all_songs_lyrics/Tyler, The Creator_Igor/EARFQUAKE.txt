EARFQUAKE Lyrics
For real, for real this time
For real, for real, for real this time
Bitch, I cannot fall short
For real, for real, for real this time (Uh, yeah)
For real, for real, for real this time

'Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, your love be shakin’ me up
And it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake (Earthquake, ooh)
Riding around, your love be shakin’ me up
And it's making my heart break

Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault (Girl)
’Cause when it all comes crashing down I’ll need you

'Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, you’re telling me something is bad
And it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake, oh, you make my earth quake
(Earth quake, yeah)
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up
And it’s making my heart break (You already know)
We ain't gotta ball, D. Rose, huh

Breathin' like fuck my lungs, huh
Just might call my lawyer, huh
Plug gon' set me up, huh (Yeah)
Bih', don't set me up (Okay)

Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault (Igor, ayy)
'Cause when it all comes crashing down I'll need you (Ayy, ayy)

'Cause you make my earth quake
I don't want no confrontation, no
And you don't want my conversation (I don't want no conversation)
I just need some confirmation on how you feel, for real (For real)
You don't want no complication, no
I don't want no side information (I don't want no side information)
I just need to know what's happening
'Cause I'm for real (For real)
I said don't leave, it's my fault (One)
I said don't leave, it's my fault (Two, two)
Don't leave, it's, it's my fault, girl (Three, three, three)
