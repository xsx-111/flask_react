ARE WE STILL FRIENDS? Lyrics
Dream
Just dream
Long ago, long ago, long ago
Dream
Just dream

Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? I've got to kno–
Know
If we can still see each other
Shake your hand, say hi
Long ago, long ago, long ago

I can't stop you, I can't rock too
I've been back there and I can not die too
But I've got to know

Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? Can we be– (Can we be friends?)
Are we still friends? Can we be friends? (Yeah)
Are we still friends?

(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
I said, are we still friends? (Friends, friends)
Are we still friends? (Friends, friends, friends, friends, friends)

Don't get green skin (Green skin), keep contact (Keep contact)
Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (Later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend

(Friends)
Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
Oh woah
Can't say goodbye (Yeah, ah, ah)
Can't say goodbye, goodbye (Woo)56Embed
