The British Are Coming Lyrics
"Welcome to the first level literati
Our mission is to keep the tradition alive
It's up to us
It's our responsibility
Who else is going to do it?"

This is the night
Light up the fire in the forge
We're not the coins in the coffer of old King George
One if by land
Two if they come by sea
We'll show 'em we are the true sons of liberty

Punk ass redcoats tryin' to run the show
Telling me what to do and where to go
Mount your horse 'cause it's time to tell the world
The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming

Smear on the soot
Tear up an old deer skin shirt
We know the shot will be heard all around the world
Punk ass redcoats tryin' to run the show
Telling me what to do and where to go
Mount your horse 'cause it's time to tell the world
The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming

This is the destiny of all mankind
We will shake off these chains and shackles that bind
Come on let's give them everything we have


The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming4Embed
