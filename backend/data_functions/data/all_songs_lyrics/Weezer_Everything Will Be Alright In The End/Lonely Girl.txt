Lonely Girl Lyrics
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl

So baby come on, I know how to dance
And I am the only one who ever takes a chance
Give it a try, you're not gonna die
Unless you refuse to live and hide away tonight

I'm lonely, so homely
Can't you relate?

So open your arms, and let me come in
I'd never hurt you girl 'cause that would be a sin

I'm lonely, so homely
Can't you relate?

I'm blurry, unworthy
Can't you relate?

I know you're scared, I know you're sad
But I'm here to help you realize it's not so bad

So open your arms, and let me come in
I'd never hurt you girl 'cause that would be a sin

My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl (My lonely girl)
My lonely girl (My lonely girl)
