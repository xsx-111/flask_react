Foolish Father Lyrics
Simple love songs
Drenched in blood songs
Coming out all wrong songs

Hesitate to throw your stones
When criminals are victims
Looking back into our past
There's no cause for these symptoms now

Forgive your foolish father
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter
And he'd do anything for you

Think of how destroyed he feels
Walking to his grave plot
Knowing that the one he loves
Hates him with all of her heart

Forgive your foolish father
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter
And he'd do anything for you
These nucleotides are paired up in a strand
How comical this stuff that makes a man


Forgive your foolish father (Forgive your father)
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter (You are his daughter)
And he'd do anything for you
Anything for you, anything for you
Anything, anything
Anything for you (Anything for you)

Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything, everything, everything will be alright now
Everything will be alright in the endEmbed
