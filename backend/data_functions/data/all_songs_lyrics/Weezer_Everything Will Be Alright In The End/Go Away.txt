Go Away Lyrics
Cold hearted girl
Don't hurt me like this anymore
I'm waitin' right outside your door
Sayin', "Baby, can we talk?"
Stupid boy
You keep on begging but I won't let you in
You keep on cryin' but you know what ya' did
I'll never let you back in
And you say

"Go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Don't come back here anymore
Go away"

I was wrong
I hurt your feelings when I did what I did
I learned my lesson, I'll stop actin' like a kid
Can you give me one more chance?
And so I asked
"What does she have that I don't have?"
You said you'd stay, but then you went away
That's why I'm tellin' you to go away
And you say
"Go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Don't come back here anymore
Go away"

But my life is incomplete without you, whoa
And you miss the little things that I do
You do
Won't you take me back?
That was your last chance

Go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Don't come back here anymore
Go away
Go away and don't come backEmbed
