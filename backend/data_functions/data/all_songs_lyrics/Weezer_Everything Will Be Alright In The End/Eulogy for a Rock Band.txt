Eulogy for a Rock Band Lyrics
Goodbye heroes
You had a good run
Fifteen years of
Ruling the planet
But now your light is fadin'

Adios, rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when
Time marches on
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago
Women were screaming
Guys were copying you
'Cause you moved the people
To sobbing, inspiring
You spoke for the world in your songs

Adios, rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when
Time marches on
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago
We'll never forget the jams you made
Don't let 'em fade
It's time that we laid you in your grave
Let 'em fade
Goodbye

Adios, rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when
Time marches on
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago1Embed
