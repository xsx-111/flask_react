Tangier LyricsIn Tangier down a windy street
Where beggars meet
And on old rags do sleep
The women dressed in soiled white sheet
With starving kids by their side
With staring eyes that never weep
Old Moroccans with their elephantiasis feet
Who life and death treat so cheap
Happy in their hunger
For they live longer than their fathers
In Tangier down a windy street
Where beggars meet
And on old rags do sleep
The women dressed in soiled white sheet
With starving kids by their side
With staring eyes that never weep
Old Moroccans with their elephantiasis feet
Who life and death treat so cheap
Happy in their hunger
For they live longer than their, than their, than their fathersEmbed
