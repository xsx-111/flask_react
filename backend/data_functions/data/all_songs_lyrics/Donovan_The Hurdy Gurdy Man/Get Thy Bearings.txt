Get Thy Bearings LyricsGet your bearings
Know your time
Don't you worry
Weather's fine
All the world knows
What I'm saying
All the world knows
What I'm saying
The world knows fine well
Get together
Work it out
Simplicity
Is what it's about
All the world knows
What I'm saying
All the world knows
What I'm saying
The world knows fine well1Embed
