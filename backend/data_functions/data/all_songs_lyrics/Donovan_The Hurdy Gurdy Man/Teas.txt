Teas LyricsI strolled into a deserted seaside café
All on a winter's day
I ordered up a cup of rich brown steaming tea
From an old lady
What happened to you, man, you used to be so free?
Now all you do is sit and dream of a fay girl green
By a mountain stream
I strolled into a deserted seaside café
All on a winter's day
I ordered up a cup of rich brown memories
Sat and I watched the sea
What happened to you, man, you used to be so free?
When you were as a mountain stream following a dream
Following a dream
What happened to you?
What happened to you?Embed
