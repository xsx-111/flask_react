A Sunny Day LyricsSunny day while away the afternoon
Cutting nettles that are hiding petals pink
From the river drink
Bluebells, wood dells where dwells a squirrel
Who slinks along branched patterns heightens call of coaltit small
Hover over river
Diving, writhing, gnattring, chiff chaff chattering
Woodpecker staggering, hammering
Exaggerating off his find
Do da do...
Sunny day while away the afternoon
Cutting nettles that are hiding petals pink
From the river drink
Bluebells, wood dells where dwells a squirrel
Who slinks along branched patterns heightens call of coaltit small
Hover over riverEmbed
