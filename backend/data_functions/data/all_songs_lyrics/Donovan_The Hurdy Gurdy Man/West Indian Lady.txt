West Indian Lady LyricsCan I be of assistance, my love?
Sha la la la la la la la la
I will help you out into the room
Sha la la la la la la la la
And you know what I'm thinking
Very soon we will be a-drinking
From the cup of joy you have brought
From the cup of joy the lady brought
I see you brought your bow along also
Sha la la la la la la la la
Is the arrow for me, love?
Very soon I think I'll know
If I never return from in her eyes
Sha la la la la la la la la
Even in the dark they hypnotise
Sha la la la la la la la la
West Indian lady
In the picture on my wall
But I love her printer's name and all
But he love her printer's name and all
But I love her drawing pins and all
But he love her drawing pins and all
But he love her printer's name and all
Sha la la la la la la la la
But he love her printer's name and all
Sha la la la la la la la la
She's the belle of Kilburn, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's the belle of Kilburn, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's the belle of Kilburn, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's the belle of Kilburn, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's the belle of KilburnEmbed
