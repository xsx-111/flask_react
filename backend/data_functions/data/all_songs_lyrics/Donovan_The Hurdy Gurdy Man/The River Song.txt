The River Song LyricsOh, the waters flow
Over rock and stone
O'er the waters blow
Windy wind so cold
Oh, the rivers flow so old
Oh, the rivers flow so old
O'er the rivers fly
Stately kingfishers
Through the waters swim
Stickleback fishes
Oh, the rivers flow so old
Oh, the rivers flow so old
Oh, the waters flow
Over rock and stone
Through the waters swim
Stickleback fishes
Oh, the rivers flow so old
Through the rivers swim so old
Oh, the rivers flow so old
