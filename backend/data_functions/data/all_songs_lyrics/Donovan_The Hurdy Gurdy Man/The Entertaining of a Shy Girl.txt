The Entertaining of a Shy Girl LyricsI'll sing you a song
Paint you a painting
Dance you a dance
While you're waiting
What shall it be
Chocolate or soda?
I'm having tea
Do speak louder
Are you hungry?
Brown bread and treacle
Apple maybe?
I've a tree full
What do you know?
What can you tell me?
Something to show
Or to sell me
Ah, here he's coming now
I'll say cheerio
Someone to meet
And she's waiting so I'll goEmbed
