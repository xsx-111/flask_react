The Sun Is a Very Magic Fellow LyricsThe sun is a very magic fellow
He shines down on me each day
The sun is a very magic fellow
He shines down on me each day
He shines down on me each day
The wind is a very fickle fellow
He blows all my dreams away
The wind is a very fickle fellow
Blowing all my dreams away
Blowing all my dreams away
The rain is a very sad lady
She falls down on me sometimes
The rain is a very sad lady
She falls down on me sometimes
Falling down on me sometimes
The sea is a very, very old man
Deeper than the deepest blue
The sea is a very, very old man
Deeper than the deepest blue
Deeper than the deepest blue
The moon is a typical lady
I watch her wax and wane
The moon is a typical lady
I watch her wax and wane
I watch her wax and wane
A star is so very far away, love
Just between you and me
A star is so very far away, love
Just between you and me
Just between you and me
A girl is a pillow for my sadness
She sings all my cares away
A girl is a pillow for my sadness
Sings all my cares away
Sings all my cares away
Singing all my cares away
Sing all my cares away
Loving all my cares away
She sings all my cares away
Singing all my cares away...Embed
