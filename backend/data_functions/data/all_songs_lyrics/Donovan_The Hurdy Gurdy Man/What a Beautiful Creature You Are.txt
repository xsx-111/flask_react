What a Beautiful Creature You Are LyricsI'm studying a course of ornithology
Wanting to know all about the birds and the bees
I'm studying a course of the womanology
Oh (mm) oh (mmm) ooh (ooh) oh (that's nice) (oh) ooh (ooh) oooh!
What a beautiful creature you are, you are
A beautiful creature you are!
I'm studying a course of anthropology
Trying to find out all about the birds and the bees
I'm studying a course of man typology
Oh (oh) mm (ahh) uhh (ahh) oh yes! (ohh) that's nice (ooh) mmmm
What a beautiful creature you are, you are
A beautiful creature you are!
Ooooh how's about going down roaring twenties!
Oh Slidey Fly's going to be there with all the band
Ooh ooh (oh hoho ho) (oh no no no) mmmm (ooh) (that's good!) oooh
What a beautiful creature you are, you are
What a beautiful creature you are! (that's true)

Wanting to know all about the birds and the bees
We're studying a course of our psychology
Oh (oh) ooh (oh no) ohh (don't) ohh (oh no) ooh! (ooh!) ooh! (ooh!)
