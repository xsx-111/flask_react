Poor Cow LyricsI dwell in the north in the green country
Far I'm here, far I'm here
And I take to my rest at the end of day
Whilst o'erhead pretty stars do play
And then I dream along
Then I make a song
About everything that I've known and felt
And it makes my sadness melt
Then I wake up in the funny old kind of day
The rain has gone away
Watching the children sing and play
In the garden and the roadway
Up comes a little one singing a song
About a friend she knows called Rosie
Off to the greenwood you must go
Bring-a me one fine posie
All of a sudden I'm light as air, I feel sad as a butterfly
Oh, I dwell with my pride and my songs and things
Wearily, oh so wearily
And I dream of the girl with the sunshine eye
Sundaily, whatever she may be
And then I dream along
Then I make a song
About everything that I've known and felt
And it makes my sadness melt
Then I wake up in the funny old kind of day
The rain has gone away
Watching the children sing and play
In the garden and the roadway
Up comes a little one singing a song
About a friend she knows called Rosie
Off to the greenwood you must go, bring-a me one fine posie
All of a sudden I'm light as air, I feel sad as a butterfly
Oh, I dwell in the north in the green country
Far I'm here, far I'm here
And I dream of the girl with the sunshine eye
Sundaily, whatever she may be
And then I dream along
And then I make a song
About everything that I've known and felt
And it makes my sadness meltEmbed
