Time to get away (live at madison square garden) Lyrics
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you

You brought a lot of money
And me, I'm catching tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you undermine me, uh-huh
And I start to be sensible
If you know what I mean

And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

Next time let's talk it over
And we can start again, shock

For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
What, what, what, what
What did you think would happen next?
What, what, what, what
What could it ever be?
Though it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

Next time we can talk it over
Or even start again

To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to talk to you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true

Next time we could talk it over
Or even start again
You couldn't tell me what you wanted
I knew you were low, man
But the truth is I was shocked

Fun, power, eyes
Eyes never lie
Kids ("Hey, buddy?" "What?")
Kids never lieEmbed
