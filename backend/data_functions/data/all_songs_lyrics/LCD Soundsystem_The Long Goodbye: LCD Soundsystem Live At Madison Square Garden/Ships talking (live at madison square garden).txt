Ships talking (live at madison square garden) Lyrics
-What? Ready?
-Welcome!
-People of New York, Juan Maclean and Shit Robot!
-Step through the doors
-I see the doors
-Lay claim to what is yours
-Objects claimed
-It's a mistery
-Mystery solved
-You can see everything from here
Isn't it beautiful?
-It is beautiful
-I bet you know everything you need to know by now
You can step aboard
-I must admit your technology is wonderful
I've never seen anything like this
-Will you accept our friendship?
-Without hesitation
-I can't say we can promise anything more than that
Unless you value seeing everything for the first time
In a new light
Alright
-That is everything
-Saying things always makes your, your morning, morning come slower
-Step through the doorway
-I have already stepped through the door
I'm sorry
I accept
-You're welcome
-I am filled with electricity
-Actually you'll need this
-Who is that?
-I want, I want to talk to you
-Who is that? Who's talking?
-I want to talk to you about a few things
-Is that a voice in my head?
-Help me
-Oh my god
-Understand why your friends are all afraid
-Get out of my head!
-Help me
Help me understand why your friends are all afraid
You don't have to fear us!
-Yes
Thank you very much
Oh well, so much has happened
There are some interstellar friends I would like to thank
These wonderful humans who've made this happen
The horns of plenty: Carter and Jason and Nick, Kelly and Colin
The beatiful vocal stylings of Tiffany Roth and Lizzy Yoder
The chorus with no name, all of you
Nick, Matt, Adam, Kyle, Nathan, Lindsay, Jon
Konrad, Matthew, Daniel, Josh and Tom
That inimitable star from space, Mr. Reggie Watts!
Hitting things with precision, Mr. Alberto Lopez
And the gunship, Gunnar Bjerk
And us, Juan MacLean of The Juan MacLean
And Shit Robot of Shit Robot
Straight from New York City
By way of the interstellar highway
-Thank you very much
I really appreciate itEmbed
