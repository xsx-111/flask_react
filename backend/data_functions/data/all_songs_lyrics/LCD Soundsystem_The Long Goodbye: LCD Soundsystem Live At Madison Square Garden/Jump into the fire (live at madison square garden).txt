Jump into the fire (live at madison square garden) LyricsYou can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free
You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
We can make each other happy
You can climb a mountain
You can swim the sea
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free
You can shake me up
Or I can break you down
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
But you'll never be free
But you'll never be free
Whoa-o-o-o-, whoa-o-o-o-
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fire
You can jump into the fireEmbed
