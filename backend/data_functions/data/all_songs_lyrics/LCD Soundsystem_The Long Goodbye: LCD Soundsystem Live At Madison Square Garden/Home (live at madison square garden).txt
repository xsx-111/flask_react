Take me home
Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
No everything was never the deal
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
So we can shut the door
Oh, shut the door on terrible times
Aah
Do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
That we can shut the door
Oh, shut the door
Until it gets weird
And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?
As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are pick-up things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know
Take
Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like nothing will last
You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Still you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
The things that we laughed about
And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
And you better
'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't, yeah you weren't
Then I don't know what we'd talk about
Aah, aah-ahh
Yeah no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you're already there
No one opens up when you scream and shout
But it's time to make a couple things clear
If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better
Until the nightEmbed
