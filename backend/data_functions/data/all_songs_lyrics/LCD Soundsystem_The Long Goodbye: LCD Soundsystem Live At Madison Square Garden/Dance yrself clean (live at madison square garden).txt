Dance yrself clean (live at madison square garden) Lyrics
Walking up to me, expecting, walking up to me
Expecting words, it happens every time
Present company, expect it, present company
Expect the worst, it happens every night

Ah, present company, excluded every time
Ah, present company, the best that you can find

Talking like a jerk, except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean
Present company, expect it, present company
Expect the worst, it works just like a need

Ah, present company, excluded in every way
Ah, present company, makes you wanna stay

Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company expect it
Present company just laugh it off
Works just like a need
Ah, present company, excluded in the night
Ah, present company, included in the fight

Ah-ahhhhhhh
Ah-ah-ahhhh
Ahhhhh
Ah-ahhhh

Don't you want me to wake up?
So give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made from make outs
Then give me just a bit of your time
We've got to bring the resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
You go and throw your little hands up

It's late
No, it's late

I miss the way the night comes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others
So go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
We're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show
It's your show...
Put your little feet down

Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Every fucker it's getting older
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
So we can make our bad dreams come true
And it's a go, yeah, it's a go
But if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do
Oh

We should try a little harder
In this tedious march of the few
Every fucker's getting younger
And there's a part of me hoping, it's trueEmbed
