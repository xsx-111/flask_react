Loss Lyrics
You lay in bed, the sun streams in the blinds
Sweat soaked through your shirt
Lay your hand across your eyes
Every other part of you hurt
From inside the confines
Of the story that everything would be alright

It was only so wide you could open your eyes
You could only let in so much light
But you knew the story had never been true

Loss is loss
Is loss is loss
Is loss is loss

What was it last night she said?
"At some point youâ€™d have to live as if the truth was true."
When it gets too hard to not feel what you do
Not know what you knew

Loss is loss
Is loss is loss
Is loss is loss
Is loss is loss
Is loss is loss
Is loss is loss
Is lossEmbed
