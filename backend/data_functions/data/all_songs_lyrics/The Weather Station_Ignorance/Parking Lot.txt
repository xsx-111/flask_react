Parking Lot Lyrics
Waiting outside the club in a parking lot
I watched some bird fly up and land on the rooftop
Then up again into the sky, in and out of sight
Then flying down again to land on the pavement

It felt intimate to watch it
Its small chest rising and falling
As it sang the same song
Over and over and over and over again
Over the traffic and the noise

Is it alright if I don't wanna sing tonight?
I know you are tired of seeing tears in my eyes
But are there not good reasons to cry?
I swear I'm alright
Maybe you could just let it slide?

I confess I don't wanna undress this feeling
I am not poet enough to address this peeling
Was I not yеt naked enough?
Too quick to blush
Already I am too much
Is it alright if I don't wanna sing tonight?
I know you arе tired of seeing tears in my eyes
But everywhere we go there is an outside
Over all of these ceilings hangs a sky

And it kills me when I
You know it just kills me when I
You know it just kills me when I
See some bird fly
It just kills me and I
Don't know why1Embed
