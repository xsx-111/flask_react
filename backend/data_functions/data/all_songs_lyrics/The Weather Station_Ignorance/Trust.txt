Trust Lyrics
Dim the lights and draw the curtains
This is the end of love
Ready all your arguments
This is the end of trust
Send out all the witnesses
Let nobody watch
Let there be no more words spilled at the ending of what
Was it time we had?

Bring me all the evidence
The baskets of wild roses
The crumpled petals and misshapen heads of reeds and rushes
The bodies of the common birds
Robins, crows, and thrushes
Everything that I have loved and all the light touches
While we still have time

I watch your eyes pass over me
Holding stupidly, everything I wanted you to see
In the throes of this divorce
In this court proceedings
For some reason, my mind was filled with all my softest feelings
All the hidden wounded gentle places of my body
I wanted to bear my skin to the grass
In generosity
While we still have time
Well everybody's talking
And I know its important and I
Should pay attention and I
Know its important and I

Dim the lights and draw the curtains
This is the end of love
Ready all your arguments
This is the end of trust
Send out all the witnesses
Let nobody watch
Let there be no more words spilled at the ending of whatEmbed
