Wear Lyrics
I tried to wear the world like some kinda garment
I reach my fingers down inside of all the clinging pockets
In fabric, stained and torn and scratched
Pulling at the seams
I wandered out onto the streets like that
Dressed so gracelessly

It does not matter to the world if I embody it
It could not matter less that I wanted to be a part of it
Still I fumble with my hands and tongue
To open and to part it

I tried to wear the world like some kinda jacket
It does not keep me warm, I cannot еver seem to fasten it
Bodies nеver want not to move, they wanted all of it
To be hidden, to be touched, to be known
To be undressed, to be clothed

Why can't I be the body graceful in the cloth of it?
Why can't you want me for the way I cannot handle it?
Am I ever understood?
Am I hidden by this hood?
I tried to wear each word that you had ever said to me
Even as careless as it turns out you have been with me
I still reach out to hold everything that I'm told
I still reach out to hold everything that I'm told
I still reach out to hold
To touch until we fold
I still reach out to hold
I still reach out to holdEmbed
