Tried to Tell You Lyrics
It was getting late
You were afraid of yourself
Afraid that you might call her
That you could not help yourself
And what could I say?
It lived in you all day
I watched her in your eyes
And pass across your face

Like the wind on the water
I tried to tell you
That is the way that you want her
I tried to tell you

You were so afraid to try and pull apart
The endless rain you thought of as your heart
With blood on your hands from the river inside
You try to deny it, you never felt the tide

Of the moon pulling closer
I tried to tеll you
That is the way that you want her
I tried to tеll you
Like the wind on the water
I will not help you not to feel
To tell yourself it was not real
And only fools believe
This is what the songs are for
This is the dirt beneath the floor
I cannot sell you on your own need

Some days there might be nothing you encounter
To stand behind the fragile idea that anything matters
I feel as useless as a tree in a city park
Standing as a symbol of what we have blown apart

You know you break what you treasure
I tried to tell you
But I'm not sure you remember
So I tried to tell you
And though it cannot be measured
I tried to tell you
Would it kill you to believe in your pleasure?
I tried to tell you2Embed
