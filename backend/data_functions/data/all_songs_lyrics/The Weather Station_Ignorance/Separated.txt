Separated Lyrics
Separated by all the work we had to do
Separated by all the arguments you lose
Separated by all the things you thought you knew
Separated by all the words you did not choose
Separated by the results you can’t disprove
Separated by all the answers you could not choose
Separated by all the things you thought you knew
Separated by all the dreams you drift into

You try again your arguments out on me
I try and tell you again
But if you wanted to understand me, you could
If you wanted to hold my hand, you would
But you don’t want to
You’vе committed to this wall we sleep against

If you can’t carry the silеnce of the bruise
If you can’t look at the wildness of the wound
If you won’t look out the window onto the sea
If you can’t carry your pain, you will lay it on me
To carry for you out in the open fields
I bore it by feel
In my stupid desire to heal
Every rift, every cut I feel
As though I wield some power here
I lay my hands over all your fear
This gushing running river here
That spills out over these plains
Soaking in all this rain

Separated by all the work we had to do
Separated by all the arguments you lose
Separated by all the dreams you drift into
Separated by all the things you thought you knew
You don’t really see any problem here, but I do
You don’t really have to believe me if you don’t want to
Separated by the relief you want to feel
Separated by the belief this cut can healEmbed
