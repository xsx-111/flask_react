Love In Hard Times LyricsIt's a little bit, it's a little bit late to try for something better
It's a little bit, it's a little bit late to try to cut the anchor
So if you want to go, I'll go there with you
I'll go there
It's when I think to reach across those battle lines
And still love in the hard times
Sometimes I just want to feel your hand in mine
Still love in the hard times
I'm just a little bit, just a little bit tired to fight for something better
And the worst of it is, the worst of it is I think of you more than ever
So if you want to go, I'll go there with you
I'll go there
It's when I think to reach across those battle lines
And still love in the hard times
Sometimes I just want to feel your hand in mine
Still love in the hard times
It's when I think to reach across those battle lines
And still love in the hard times
Sometimes I just want to feel your hand in mine
Still love in the hard timesEmbed
