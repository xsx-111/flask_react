Reckless Forgiver LyricsLoneliness, loneliness, it won't last forever
Happiness, happiness, wait in line
Every time I look in the mirror
I'm in a shadow of doubt
Maybe I'm as lost as the next guy
Just have to find, just have to find out
All I want is peace like a river
Long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
Hey, reckless forgiver
You know I'm talking to you
I made a mess, made a mess
Of the heart I borrowed
So get undressed, get undressed
Laugh tomorrow
Every time I look in the mirror
I'm in a shadow of doubt
Maybe I'm as lost as the next guy
Just have to find
All I want is peace like a river
Long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
Hey, reckless forgiver
You know I'm talking to you
I'd leave it all for you
All I want is peace like a river
Long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
The reckless forgiver
I'm talking to you
All I want is peace like a river
Long life of sanity, love that won't leave too soon
Someone to pull out the splinters
Hey, reckless forgiver
You know I'm talking to you
I'd leave it all for you
You know I'm talking to you
I'd leave it all for you
I'm talking to youEmbed
