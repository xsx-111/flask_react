Pennsylvania Lyrics
A picture of a child groom on the bedside
A flicker from the half-lit chandelier
Souvenirs from hell and Pennsylvania
The vows of London Tower that got us here

Look, but don't touch
Hurt, but don't cry
Break out of these cages, but never fly
Never fly

How much further up?
Be careful what you wish for
How much further out?
Be careful what you wish for

Gather from the hearts that bleed without you
Colors from the sky that frames your eyes
To break the walls keeping you inside you
Catch the parachutes that fill the sky

Look, but don't touch
Hurt, but don't cry
Break out of these cages and never fly
Never fly
How much further out?
Be careful what you wish for
How much further out?
Be careful what you wish for

Look, but don't touch
Hurt, but don't cry
Break out of these cages and never fly
Never fly

Plant another dream down by the lakeside
Leave the rest in boxes for the past
Some would say that we were young in hours
Everyone believed that this would lastEmbed
