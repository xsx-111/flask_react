Age of Immature Mistakes LyricsDark thoughts are tangled, I’m spinning into gold
Sewn in a sweater you can wear when it gets colder
I wrote a letter on the pages of your mind
With a sentimental rhyme
Made you a ringtone with a voice that sounds like mine
Saying "the boy of your dreams is calling", when I’m calling
I spent my money on the things that you can break
Love in the age of immature mistakes
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Like hearts in the hands of a child 'till they break them up
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Heartbreak’s a killer on the lose, it’s after me
Using words like oceans, crashing waves, and stormy seas
I have my umbrella as a means to protect me
From love in the age of immature mistakes
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Like hearts in the hands of a child 'till they break them up
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Make it up, make it up, it up, it up, it up, it up, it up, it up, it up
Lover I'll treat you like water from a cloud
I'll turn you to wine and drink you down
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Like hearts in the hands of a child 'till they break them up
Don't know enough about love so we make it up
Don't know enough about love so we make it upEmbed
