Human Race LyricsWorld without end, are you ending?
Labeled a friend you're unfriending
Disposable me, pose-able you
Any position we want to do
Another song you forget by the ending
Plastic we don't know we're spending
My favorite shows have all cancelled
And every patent is pending
Look in my eyes. Touch my face
We're limping along in the human race
Our jeans have become complicated
The promise of love is downgraded
Faith in available excess
Proof we were destined to care less
It's life on the wrong side of rapture
Dismiss what we can't manufacture
Compassion just sounds like complaining
Hit the keys but the notes aren't sustaining
We lost everything in the fractures
Uprootings and wanted departures
Look in my eyes. Touch my face
We're limping along in the human race
The sound of your heartbeat is out of place
Limping along in the human raceEmbed
