Inland Lyrics
There are no streets to walk on
No maps you can rely on
Faith and guts to guide you
Wander 'til you find you
Only raw desire
No match to give you fire
You'll have to trust your heart

They don't believe in oceans
You, you were a sailor
Who burned your ship and walked on
Far away you walked on
You keep turning inland
Where no man is an island
It's where you're supposed to be

Woah, woah
You keep heading inland
No man is an island
Come on home to me

Afraid of your convictions
They said the land will change you
Steady your confession
Your course make no corrections
When you are a stranger
Hold your tongue and wager
Love will set you free
Until it sets you free
 x2
Woah, woah
You keep heading inland
No man is an island
Come on home to me

Just follow your desire
Leave it all, you're leaving all
Just burn it in the fire

Everything you once knew
And everyone that knew you
Remove the shoes you came on
Feel the earth you're made from
Pack up all your questions
Just keep heading inland
And come on home to me
Yeah, come on home to me

Woah, woah
You keep heading inland
No man is an island
Come on home to me
Woah (I will always be here by your side)
Woah (I will always stand next to you)
You keep walking inland
(When the darkness hits the light)
Where no man is an island
(In the space where you stand against the tide)
Come on home to me
(I will always stand next to you)
Just come on home to me
(Woah...)
(I will always stand next to you)
Come on home to me
(Woah...)
(I will always be here by your side)
Come on home to meEmbed
