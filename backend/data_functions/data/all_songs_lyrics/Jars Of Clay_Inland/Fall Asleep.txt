Fall Asleep LyricsWe wandered off like children, in the woods
We let the searchers come and never find us
We tried to make a life among the trees
While your dreams collected planes and cars and cities
You slipped away from me while I was sleeping
To climb the tallest oak and see the lights
Your dissatisfaction gave you questions
Do you remember what the city sounded like?
Do you remember what the city sounded like?
So, stay up with me don't fall asleep
We only have this moment once in our lives
The next time we'll meet under city lights
But we're here tonight so, lets make it all it was meant to be
So, I held you but the cold was from inside
I knew I couldn't keep you if I tried
But I watched as the distance spread as the shadows grew
And the longings came like wolves to devour you
So, stay up with me don't fall asleep
'Cause we only have this moment once in our lives
The next time we'll meet under city lights
So, lets make it all it was meant to beEmbed
