Skin & Bones LyricsLove is skin and bones we don't want to be
Wasting all our breath on things that we don't think that we'll need
Love is skin and bones no one else can see
Behind the door we are unhappy that's between you and me
That's between you and me
Love is skin and bones, too many mouths to feed
We've made an art of neglecting what we don't want to see
Love is skin and bones trying to set us free
I can feel the pulse is dying in captivity
Someday, someday soon we're going to open our eyes
Break out the windows and fly, I want to see it
Love is skin and bones, screaming inside of me
Like a siren on the crest of the emergency
Love is skin and bones for the world to see
To remind us that the heart will never hold our pity
Look over my love while she sleeps tonight
Look over my love while she sleeps tonight, tonight
Someday, someday we're going to open our eyes
Break out the windows and fly, I want to see it
Someday, someday when all the words feel wrong
You'll have a heart beating strong, it will go on and on
Someday, someday when all the words feel wrong
You'll have a heart beating strong, it will go on and onEmbed
