And Your Bird Can Sing (Take 2) Lyrics(One, two, three, four)

You tell me that you've got everything you want
(You tell me that—thing you want)
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

You say you've seen seven wonders
 (Woo!)
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
 (—can't see me)
You can't see me
 (You can't see m—)
(Ha ha ha ha!)
(George!)

When your prized possessions
 (When your prized possessions)
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear m—
(Woo hoo hoo!)


When your bike is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
(You may—BE awoken)
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
(I'LL be 'round—Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!)

You tell me that you've got everything you want
(You tell me that you've g— everything you want)
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me

(Whistling)
Okay. Okay, okay, everybody
Okay, okay, okay. Okay!
Wait...
That was very well d—Embed
