Your Mother Should Know (Take 27) LyricsDo you want us to do it again, George?
Okay
With ciggy in mouth

Let's all get up and

Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know


Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Your mother should know

Da da da da da da da da dada da da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da dada da dada da
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Your mother should knowEmbed
