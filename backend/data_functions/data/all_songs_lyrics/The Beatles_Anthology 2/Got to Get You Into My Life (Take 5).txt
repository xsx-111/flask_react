Got to Get You Into My Life (Take 5) Lyrics
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you (Ah-ahh)
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Ooh, you were meant to be near me (Ah-ahh)
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life
Somehow, some way

What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Ooh, then I suddenly see you (Mhmm-mm)
Ooh, did I tell you I need you (Mhmm)
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life
Somehow, some way

I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

Into my life
Uh-somehow, some way

Got to get you into my life
Oh-oh-oh
Uh-hear me, ooh
Doo-doo (Dee-dee-dee)
Doo-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee-dee)
Uh-doo-dooEmbed
