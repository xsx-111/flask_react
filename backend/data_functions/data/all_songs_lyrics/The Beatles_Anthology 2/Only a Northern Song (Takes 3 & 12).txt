Only a Northern Song (Takes 3 & 12) Lyrics
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
I just wrote it like that

When you listen late at night
You may feel the words are not quite right
But they are
I just wrote them myself

And it doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song


It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

If you think the harmony
Is a little off and out of key
Then you're right
'Cause I sing it myself
