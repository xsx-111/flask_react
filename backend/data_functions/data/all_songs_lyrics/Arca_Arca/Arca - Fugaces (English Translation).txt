Arca - Fugaces (English Translation) Lyrics
What a disappointment
That I only have
Fleeting memories
Your eyes of mourning

You looked for me
And I found you
Your taste in my mouth

No, I don’t want to live as a prisoner of melancholy
No, I don’t want to live as a prisoner of melancholy

What a disappointment
Your tender betrayal

The world frightens me
How black this abyss is
I scare myself
I’m only seeking warmth

I don’t want to live as a prisoner of melancholy
Why did you lie to me?
Love dodges meEmbed
