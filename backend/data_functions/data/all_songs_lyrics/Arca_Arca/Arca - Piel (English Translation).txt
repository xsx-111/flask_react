Arca - Piel (English Translation) Lyrics
Take the skin from yesterday off me
You don’t know any more about distance

Take the skin from yesterday off me
I don’t know how to fall
The trees die standing

Take the skin from yesterday off me
I don’t know how to fall down

Take the glimmering skin off me
Take the mouth of honey off me

Take my skin from yesterday off me
A shadow of glimmers on your skin
And from the occasion of an instance
Maybe
Without you, I don’t know anythingEmbed
