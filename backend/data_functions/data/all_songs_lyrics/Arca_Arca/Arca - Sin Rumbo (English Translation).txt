Arca - Sin Rumbo (English Translation) Lyrics
Revolving around the sun
I lose you once again

There was no warning this time
And such pain
What bitterness
Not knowingâ€¦ not being able
To feel you
To be able to kiss you

I see you changing at a distance
I come to adore you
But from a distance
From a distance I will yearn for you
I walk aimlessly
I walk aimlessly
I walk aimlessly

But I walk
I still walkEmbed
