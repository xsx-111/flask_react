Arca - Miel (English Translation) Lyrics
You will know what to eat
You will know where there is honey
And I don’t know how to find honey without you
I am alone without you

You will know where there is honey
Look deep into my eyes
Because I don’t know anymore
Undress me

You will know where there is honey
Where there is honey
You will know, you will know where there is honey
Where there is soil
Eat me slowlyEmbed
