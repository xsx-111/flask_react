Arca - Coraje (English Translation) Lyrics
Love of my loves
It pains me to write to you like this
But there is nothing left other than silence and
How?
How to love from afar?
How to love?

There is a door
There is an open door
Orph-, orph-, or-
Orphaned

Ever since I saw you
There were no confusions
You’re not for me
You’re not for me
You are not for meEmbed
