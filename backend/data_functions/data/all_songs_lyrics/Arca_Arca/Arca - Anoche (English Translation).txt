Arca - Anoche (English Translation) Lyrics
Last night I dreamt of you
Your figure and your arms
Last night I yearned for you
Even though I hadn't met you yet

Alone I healed you
The wounds of the wars you’ve fought
Last night I loved you
And you left me shattered

Last night I dreamt
Of our simultaneous death
Last night I cried
Out of happiness, how strange it made me feel

That the love has rinsed me
That your blood warmed
The tissue of my entrails
Last night I dreamt of you
Regardless of you being real or imaginary

Last night I was smiling
Thinking that you were possible
It’s enough for me to know
It’s enough for me to knowEmbed
