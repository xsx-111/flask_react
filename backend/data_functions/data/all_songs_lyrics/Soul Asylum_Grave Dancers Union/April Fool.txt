April Fool LyricsQuitting after one more last one
Tired of playing the clown
If I want your opinion I'll ask ya
I can get myself down
Night driving without headlights
Wearing sunglasses too
Looking good but sure don't feel right
Anything to be cool
Doing hopscotch with my legs tied
Jumping rope in wet cement
Black leather in midday sunshine
All your mother's money's spent
Doing time on the metal detector
Like to drown in your pool
Covering up everything that's defective
Anything to be cool
A burning heart
Could be so cool
Won't you be my fashion victim?
Come on, I'm an April Fool for you
Holding on to what's left of real life
Anything to be cool
A burning heart
Like an April Fool
Won't you be my fashion victim?
Come on, I'm an April Fool
I'm a mid-spring snowfall, joke's on you
I'm an April Fool for you
I'm an April Fool for you
I'm an April FoolEmbed
