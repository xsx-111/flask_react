Get On Out LyricsI gotta get on…
I gotta get on out
All these worried, troubled thoughts
Gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head
Will I be on the streets tomorrow?
Will I have to beg and borrow?
Will I have to go back to the job I left behind?
Could you still make it
With a guy who never made it
Would you look into my eyes if I were to go blind?
Gotta get on…
I gotta get on out
All these worried, troubled thoughts
Gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head
Now, will you leave me for another, send me running back to mother?
Will I have the time to tell you how I really feel?
Am I just getting slower or are you just talking faster?
Do we need bad disaster to make it plain to see?
That all these worried, troubled thoughts
Gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head
Out of my head (×14)
Do I just feel like crying cause I'm sick and tried of trying
Trying to convince you this ain't how it has to be?
The ground you walk on's sacred, the sky above awaits you
So cast all your frustrations to the bottomless sea
Gotta get on…
Gotta get on out
All these worried troubled thoughts
Gotta get on out of my head
Gotta get on out of my head
Out of my headEmbed
