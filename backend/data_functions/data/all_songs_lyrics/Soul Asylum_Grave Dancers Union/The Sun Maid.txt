The Sun Maid LyricsTell me how you get that shine
You must polish all the time
Though I know your job is thankless
They will thank you up in heaven
Oh, the sun maid
Looking for the shade
Though they say she's not too bright
She takes care of all the light
Without you it's cold and stark
We would all be in the dark
Without the sun maid
She never gets paid
Searching for the shade
I owe the sun maid
You are so taken for granted
With each and every seed that's planted
And the earth is so demanding
All the young girls are out tanning
With the sun maid
She's such an old maid
She never gets laid
I owe the sun maid
Now you're tired, your day is over
Now the moon is one day olderEmbed
