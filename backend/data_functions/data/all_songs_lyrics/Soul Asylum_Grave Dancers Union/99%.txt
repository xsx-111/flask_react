99% LyricsI don't own you, but I know you're mine
Never disown you, never treat you unkind
Once in a while, you get on my nerves
Once in a while, you get what you deserve
I want you 99% of the time
99% of the time
If I asked you what's on your mind
Would you say me, would they be thoughts unkind?
Once in a while, I'm not myself
Once in a while, I think you're someone else
I want you 99% of the time
99% of the time
(Let's move in together, happily ever after
Let's move in together, happily ever after)
I can't touch you, cause you feel so fucking fine
Let's just stay like this, and waste some more time
Once in a while, you get in my way
Once in a while, you know I got to say
I love you 99% of the time
99% of the timeEmbed
