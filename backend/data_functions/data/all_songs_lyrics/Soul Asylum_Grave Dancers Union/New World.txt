New World LyricsLives in a little, lonely town
No one's around except for the drinking
Nobody ever gets around
But those who leave the township sinking
May you rot in heaven
Gotta be home by seven
And the field burns away
The sky breathes it in
So why sit and wait
For the new world to begin?
I'm coming out across your border
With new orders for you to take
I'd really like to take out your daughter
Down in the water, down by the lake
When the cold water's on her skin
I can feel how long it's been
And the neighbors will all be there
And no one will know what to wear
So why sit and wait
For the new world to begin?
I got a lot I've got to do
Just to get through the end of the day
It hardly ever even happens
But I go to sleep the same anyway
And you can't believe in yourself
You can't believe in anyone else
So why sit and wait
For the new world to begin?Embed
