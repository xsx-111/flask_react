Homesick Lyrics
I wanna live with you
In the fifth dimension
In a dream I've never had
'Cause I just can't live like this
In a world like this
I just want a kiss goodbye

We are not of this world
And there's a place for us
Stuck inside this fleeting moment
Tucked away where no one knows it
Wrapped up in a haste
And by mistake got thrown away

And, oh, I am so homesick
But it ain't that bad
'Cause I'm homesick
For the home I've never had

And though I sometimes get annoyed
I know just where I'm at
This is my song of joy
And now I know there are no secret tricks
No correct politics
Just liars and lunatics
We are not of this world
And there's a place for us
Stuck inside this fleeting moment
Tucked away where no one knows it
Wrapped up in a haste
And by mistake got thrown away

And, oh, I am so homesick
But it ain't that bad
'Cause I'm homesick
For the home I've never had

Though I would not take it personally
It's just the child in me
Never really knew how much I had

Woe is me, I am so homesick
But it ain't that bad
'Cause I'm homesick
For the home I've never hadEmbed
