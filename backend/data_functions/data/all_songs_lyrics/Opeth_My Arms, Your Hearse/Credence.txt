Credence Lyrics
Deserted again, you speak to me through the shadows
Walking in closed rooms, using cold words
Captured by the night
The yearning escapes from my embrace

Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts
Scream your sadness
And they all turned away
Unable to face more of this death

Credence in my word
Written in dust
Tainted by memories
I confess my hope
Recognize my loneliness

Your laughter weeps the truth
Push me into the corner
Confirming the epitaph of my soul
And displaying the once unknown KARMA4Embed
