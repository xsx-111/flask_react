When the Curtain Falls Lyrics(One, two, three, four)
Well, you're so pretty and I love you so
You know I'm your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it's the best
The finest in the land

Camera, lights, and action
Yeah, the words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of Hell
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no
Well, I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph?
It's so funny you have such charm
The whole thing made me laugh
Obetrol and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
Didn't they, darling?
Well, they've taken all your things
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no
Well, listen, darling
It's been real swell
What can I say?
You've got it all
You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna lie to you
You could use a little work
Well, at your age
Well
What you got, baby?
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all

Goodbye, baby
