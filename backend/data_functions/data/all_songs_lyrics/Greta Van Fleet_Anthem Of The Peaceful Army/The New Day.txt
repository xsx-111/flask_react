The New Day Lyrics
Let the new day shine its light on me
Shake the old way, nights too dark to see
Free tomorrow, it's bright with something new
Believe the righteous, and it will come true

You're a child in the garden
You're growing up, I'll watch you bloom
And your dreams are not forgotten
You'll be a woman soon

Love isn't greed, it's a need that goes unspoken
Love doesn't leave when you fade away
Pain isn't vain if it means your heart's been broken
Pain is the same as a means to heal

Let me try love, you know I'm only one
Live or die love, I tried and to me won
We're the future, it's hard to say we know
And the suture is what we have to sew

You are a child in the garden
You're growing up, I'll watch you bloom
And your dreams are not forgotten
You'll be a woman soon
Love isn't greed, it's a need that goes unspoken
Love doesn't leave when you fade away
Pain isn't vain if it means your heart's been broken
Pain is the same as a means to heal

Love doesn't fade away
Love doesn't fade away1Embed
