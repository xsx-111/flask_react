Brave New World Lyrics
As to the drifters of the high rift plains
They can see the ashes, and the acid rain
It turns to dust before my very eyes
And it chokes to death within the smog it lies

â€‹Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized

Turn back the clock within your glass of sand
To a time of love within this blackened land
A silent child climbs a mound of char
Where he plants a seed that grows beyond the stars

Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized
Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh
Take one look at your skies
And in the darkness realize
Kill fear, the power of lies
For we will not be hypnotized4Embed
