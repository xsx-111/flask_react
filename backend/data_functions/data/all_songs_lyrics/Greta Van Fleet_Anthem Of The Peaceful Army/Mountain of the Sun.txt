Mountain of the Sun Lyrics
The sun shines brighter from above
And you're the woman that I love
Climb the mountain even higher
To kiss the sun and fight the fire
Oh well

I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine

Take me with you when you go
To be with you is all I know
As we ride, we light the fire
The second sun's our love's desire
Oh well

I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
Oh well
The sun shines brighter from above
And you're the woman that I love
We climb the mountain even higher
Kiss the sun, fight the fire

I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine2Embed
