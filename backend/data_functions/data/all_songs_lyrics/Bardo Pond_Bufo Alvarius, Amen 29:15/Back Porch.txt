Back Porch LyricsSitting out on the back porch
On the second floor
She was sitting out the back porch
Wishing everyone could hear
What she was thinking
Out on the back porch
Sitting out on the back porch
She was sitting in the back seat of love
Sitting out on the back porch
All alone with your own thoughts
I must admit that I was thinking about
When you come
Looking down into the future
I was thinking about what to say
I was thinking about when you come
Sitting out on the back porch
Sitting in the back seat of love
She was sitting out on the back porchEmbed
