No Time To Waste LyricsI can hear myself breathing
Don't be late
Â€˜Cause I can't wait
I want to see a rainbow
Everything's gonna be alright
The rain's coming down
And the sun is out bright
Don't be late
Â€˜Cause I don't want to wait
I want to see a rainbow
Everything's gonna be alright
The sun is shining
And the rain is coming down bright
Before I fade away
I want to see you in the light of day
It's been such a long time
Don't be late
Â€˜Cause I can't wait
I want to see a rainbow
Everything's gonna be alright
Let's make haste
I've got no time to waitEmbed
