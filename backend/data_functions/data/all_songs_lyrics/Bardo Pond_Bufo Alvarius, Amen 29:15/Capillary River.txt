Capillary River LyricsEveryone's insane
Everyone's amazed
Well they say I'm insane
I think I'm hallucinating
Counting backwards
On this capillary river
Things seem bigger
Everyone's insane
And the need remains
Floating backwards
On this capillary river
The sky open up
Everyone's amazed
Maybe I'm insane
And the need remains
Floating backwards
On this capillary river
The sky opens up
In stares between
Everyone's insane
Everyone's amazed
They say I'm insane
Or just hallucinatingEmbed
