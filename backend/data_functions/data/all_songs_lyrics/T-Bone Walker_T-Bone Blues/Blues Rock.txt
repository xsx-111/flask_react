Blues Rock LyricsI been travellin travellin
Don't know where to go
I been everywhere baby
Don't want to go back no more
Left home when i was a kid
All i ever did was roam
Now i want to settle down baby
But i ain't got no happy home
I ride the cart from chicago
Never been inside a passenger cart
The rods are all i know
So sorry baby
That i've got to go
So sorry baby
That i've got to go
By this time tomorrow i'll be a long ways down the roadEmbed
