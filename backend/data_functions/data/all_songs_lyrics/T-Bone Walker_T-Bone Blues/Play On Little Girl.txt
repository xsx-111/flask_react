Play On Little Girl LyricsPlay on little girl, just keep on having fun
Play on little girl, just keep on having fun
You ball everyday, and you leave your work undone
Yes I love my baby, oh yes I really do
Well, I love my baby, oh yes I really do
Why not stay at home baby, and let me ball some too
Play on little girl, play until the morning sun
Play on little girl, play until the morning sun
You don't live but once, so you're playing days are doneEmbed
