T-Bone Shuffle LyricsLet your hair down baby, 'n' let's have a natural ball
Let your hair down baby, 'n' let's have a natural ball
'Cause when you're not happy, it ain't no fun at all
You can't take it with you, that's one thing for sure
You can't take it with you baby, that's one thing for sure
There's nothing wrong with you baby, that a good T-Bone shuffle can't cure
Have fun while you can, fate's an awful thing
Have fun while you can, fate's an awful thing
You can't tell what might happen, that's why I love to singEmbed
