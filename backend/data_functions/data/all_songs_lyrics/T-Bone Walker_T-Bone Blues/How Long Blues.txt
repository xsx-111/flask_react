How Long Blues LyricsHow Long? Baby how long
Has that evenin' train been gone
How long? How long?
Baby how long?
I can see the green grass
Up on the hill
But I ain't see the green back
On a dollar bill
And so long, so long
Baby so long
How long? How long?
Must I keep my clothes in pawn
How long? How long?
Baby how long?Embed
