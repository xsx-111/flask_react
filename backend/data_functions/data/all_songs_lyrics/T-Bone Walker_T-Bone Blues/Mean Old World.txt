Mean Old World LyricsThis is a mean old world
Baby to live in by yourself
This is a mean old world
Baby to live in by yourself
Can't get the woman you love
Cause you know shes lovin someone else
Well I drink to keep from worryin
Baby and I smile to keep from cryin'
Yes I drink to keep from worryin
And you know I smile to keep from cryin
Thats to keep the public from knowin
Just what I have on my mindEmbed
