T-Bone Blues LyricsI love my baby
She's so mean to me
Yes, I love my baby
She's so mean to me
I'm gonna change my way of living baby
Move across the deep blue sea
You know you didn't want me, baby
When you climbed up on my knee
You were drinkin' moonshine whiskey, mama
Tryin' to jive, poor me
Yes, I love you
Yes, I love you
Yes, I love
And I don't care what you do
Brownskin woman
Who might you're good man be/
Brownskin woman
Who might your good man be?
Say the reason, why I ask you, baby
You sure look good to meEmbed
