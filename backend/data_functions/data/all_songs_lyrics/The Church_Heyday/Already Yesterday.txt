Already Yesterday LyricsIt's already yesterday, we're off the calendar
I heard the sirens play just like an orchestra
Mechanical bird of prey, sing for your emperor
Last broken flash of love still in the camera
CHORUS
We don't feel those locks and chains
We won't listen to the lizard part of our brains
Giving the orders
Another morning, we'll be gone
I start the car for Ten Mile Beach
And maybe Avalon across the water
It's already yesterday and nobody's answering
Disconnected, drift away, nobody's questioning
Head silver, feet of clay, who is surrendering?
They fall in our heyday, I am remembering
CHORUS
We can't feel those aches and pains
We won't listen to the voices in the city rain
Giving the orders
Another morning I'll be gone
I start the car for Violet Town
And then to Babylon, over the border
Another morning, we'll be gone
I start the car for Ten Mile Beach
And maybe Avalon across the water
We don't feel those locks and chains
We won't listen to the lizard part of our brains
Giving the ordersEmbed
