Columbus LyricsThe king had something changed within him
I should have told him no
Oh, Columbus
I never should have let you go
Now, aching wires, midnight fires
Things I could not know
Oh, Columbus
I never should have let you go
You don't suppose there'd
Be room in here somewhere for me
I think I just need
Someone's words to reassure me
I don't blame any of you
And I don't blame myself
Waiting for my small reward
It's going to come somehow
Oh, Columbus
I wish that you could see us now
We don't posses a single empty tear
Or furrowed brow
Oh, Columbus
I wish that you could see us now
You don't suppose there'd
Be room in here somewhere for me
I think I just need
Someone's words to reassure me
I can't change any of you
I can't change myself
The man had something strange about him
He should have let me know
Oh, Columbus
I wish I'd never let you go
You don't suppose there'd
Be room in here somewhere for me
I think I just need
Someone's words to reassure me
I don't blame any of you
And I don't blame myself
