Roman LyricsOh, oh, what a feeling, baby, knowledge and brutality
Whose soul you stealing baby? lost your immortality
Another empty conquest, Venus set me free
Set me free
Oh, oh, what a ritual father, Father why you leaving me?
They've found another martyr, rather it was him than me
They took away his language, then his memory
CHORUS
He said, "I'm never, never coming back again
Never coming back again, never coming back again
Never coming back"
Oh, what to battle Muslim, what a noble enemy
We have to kill them bastards, then compose an elegy
I thought I saw their leader fallen on his knees
CHORUS
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Oh, what an ending, baby, promise you'll remember me
I'm not pretending, baby, your sweet and wicked treachery
Water all my orchids, save my dynasty
I said, "I'm never, never coming back again
Never coming back again, never coming back again
Never coming back
Never coming back again, never coming back again
Never coming back again, never coming back
Never coming back again, never coming back againEmbed
