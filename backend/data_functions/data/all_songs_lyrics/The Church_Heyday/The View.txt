The View LyricsVERSE 1
Someone fell across me
Regretting their honesty
Shook away their cautious care
Looked right through me like I wasn't there
River came to meet me
Relationships can be like water
Deep and shallow, the popular bed
Springs to mind my undetected closure
You'll only scratch the surface
If you bounce around like an adult ball
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, it's nice up there
Be a lighthouse, don't block out your view
Whispers in a cream cake
Sweet and quiet again tonight
Goodness on a rare stick
Sometimes, healthy living should be crushed
Now, I search for hours
Rubble kills my fingers looks
I'll only stop when it hurts a lot
My heart is slender, my wooden tambourine's drenched in blues
Redesign your answer
If you're the post, then prove you're tall
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, we slid around
Polish your window and don't block out your view
Take this daring leap
Wake, you've been asleep
Go, attack your life
The paint is peeling scrape to save what's yours
VERSE 1
Don't block out your view
Don't block out your view
Don't block out your view
Don't block out your viewEmbed
