As You Will LyricsYou wake up late day is still dawning
You get out on the road
You meet up with a man, his face is well worn in
He's carrying a load
On the way to paradise
Summer rain falls, so you head for some shelter
Close to a wall
See a lady dressed in chance, you try to help her
She heeds your call
On the way to paradise
You find a hidden door that leads to a garden
And venture through
Sunshines bright, a witness to pardon
The world that you knew
On the way to paradise
CHORUS
Ornamental or warm and gentle
On the way to paradise
Ornamental or warm and gentle
On the way to paradise as you will someday
All is well on the distant horizon
It's there in wait
Get so close, you grow so much wiser
But wake up late
On the way to paradise
CHORUS
Ornamental or warm and gentle
On the way to paradise
Ornamental or warm and gentle
Can you tell Heaven from Hell as you will someday?
Oh
On the way to paradise
Oh
On the way to paradise as you will somedayEmbed
