Tantalized LyricsGod, I've been asleep so long, I've been away
Back from software limbo the natives call today
I let their promises bind me
I let seductive logic blind me
I embraced a machine, I went through the routine
And I hid from the people who were trying to find me
CHORUS 1
'Til the day comes when you realize
Otherwise you never care
Pandora's Box reveals a new surprise
Can't wait to see your eyes, now you've been tantalized
For a hundred and one voluptuous days I broke the law
The labyrinth was closing, so we panicked up a door
I let their wanton flesh obsess me
I felt their dreams and drugs assess me
I was hired and fired yet never inspired
Flattering, chattering words to impress me
CHORUS 2
All that glittered had me mesmerized
Otherwise, I would have dared
Guess the nature of our enterprise
Can't stop to sympathize, how you've been tantalized
I turned up in some harsh doomed city on another plane
I couldn't believe the room I got or the guests I entertained
I felt the dirty streets surround me
I let the buzzing swarm confound me
I gave money to ghosts, I insulted my hosts
I could never get off the stuff that spellbound me
CHORUS 1
