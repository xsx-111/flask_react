Wounds Lyrics
Your life, would you risk that?
These kids never been bad
Sixteen, rolling round with a big strap
God, how many died from the impact?
Deepest pain, what a mishap (Mishap)
Never worth it when you think back
You idolize the rappers that are on gun talk
But their lifestyle, never lived that, never did that
He didn't want no crud
No dead bodies and no blood
When a gun man only knows self-hate
Them bullets show no love (Blaow)
Oh, you thought you was grown, huh? (Huh?)
Deal with it on your own, huh? (Huh?)
'Til you get caught for the old bill
When the judge give you life like a grown-up (Facts)
Talk about it, I'll listen when you talk about it
Don't lie when you talk about it, I know you are lost inside
And feel like no one cares about you, I do
Feels like no one loves you, I do
But it's gonna take more to break the cycle
Fuck tryna defend your title
When you cold and the rest cry
Another story here for the headlines
Love be my destiny
Destiny, I'm lost
Inside there's something deeper
With you, it keeps me warm
Love be my destiny
Destiny, I'm lost
Inside there's something deeper
With you, it keeps me warm

She fearin' the gun, man
Still never leavin' the gun man
Stays near to the gun man
Drop a likkle tear for the gun man
She live and die by the gun man (Die with the gun man)
Tell a lie for the gun man (With the gun man)
She will never give him up, no
When they ask "Where you hiding the gun man?" (Say no to gun man)
She wanna understand the gun man
Like, "Why does your gun bang?"
He say, "It's a long story
Just know these yutes wanna dun man"
So, tell me now 'cause I gotta know
Are you gonna roll with the gun man?
Drop it low for the gun man?
Get dough with the gun man?
It's the realest life choices
She could lose it all for one man
Now see, look at what your boy did
This all could have been avoided
There's no goin' back, you picked your poison
Made your choices
Well love must have been the best lie
Another story for the headlines
Go
Love be my destiny
Destiny, I'm lost
Inside there's something deeper
With you, it keeps me warm
Love be my destiny
Destiny, I'm lost
Inside there's something deeper
With you, it keeps me warm

Runnin' with a pistol on my hip
And anybody diss ah get it
Any minute now dem ah go switch, uh
'Cause nuff ah dem did switch already
I tried to live a good life, I tell ya
But when the streets rumble
A gunshot for the good guys
In this concrete jungle

Chaos these days, it's madness
If you get caught slippin', they'll do damage
They won't see you as practice
'Cause behind all these hoods and black tints
It's them boys that are ready for you on sight
Them boys go get it, won't hide
Them boys, they don't wanna hurt your pride
Them boys wanna ruin your life
Better stay wrapped on the coldest nights
Think you're bad, wanna show them, right?
Take a chance and roll the dice
But we all know how the story ends tonight
He won't make it back to ends tonight
The fuckery is that he knew this guy
Who would have thought all these years of bein' his pal
He was lookin' at his killer in the eyes?
