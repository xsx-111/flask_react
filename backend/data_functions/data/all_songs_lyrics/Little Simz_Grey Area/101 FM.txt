Mad
Mad

Back when me and Avelino used to make tracks
Live and die in the LDN, in Ends, it's mad (Shit's crazy)
Trappers and a whole family in the same damn flat (Um)
Eve tryna get a salary while Adam out here
Licking shots to the cats, don't lack
Shubz on a Friday pulling up at Jbo's gaff (Skrt-ing, ayy)
2-2 gyal getting moved by 2-2 man (2-2 man, ayy)
Come off the decks if you can't mix, it's not happening (Nah)
More time gunshots in the air like bap-bap-bap-bap (Mad)
Book smart with the bars, but I never learnt that from school (Nah)
Sixteen doing up radios sets, I was spinning up all them fools
(Spinning 'em, spinning 'em, ayy)
Times I would get home late to my mumzie's crib
"Simbi, who are you with?
What have you done?
Where have you been?"
Shit (Damn)
Tears in my eyes, real tears when Ken got nicked (Ken got nabbed)
Tore everyone apart, but the law don't give two shits
(Don't give two fucks)
Just another Black boy in the system doing time in bin (True)
But he had a heart full of gold, good intent with a smile so big
Oh, he did, ayy
We used to have dreams of getting out the flats (Getting out the flats)
Playing PS2
Crash Bandicoot, Mortal Kombat (Know them ones)
I mastered my flow like Dizzee and Busta (Legends)
And one day buy real weed from a Rasta (Real Rasta man)

Slicking down baby hairs way before Insta (Way before Insta)
Time when I had a dummy on my chain
All for one likkle pose in a picture (Snap-snap, ayy)
Year 11 when I started putting the trees in Rizla (Smoke, smoke)
And to the niggas that fell off in this ting, no, we don't miss ya
No, we don't
But sometimes you have to go missing (Missing, missing)
Need a way out, I was hoping, praying, and wishing (Praying and wishing)
Now I'm doing up some mad tings, doing up big tings
Still I'm in Ends when I pass through junior's planting, ready on sight
When I walk in Wayne shouts out "Yo, waa gwaan, sistren"
Kill 'em with flows
One by one or I kill 'em in bulk
Simz is the only one on her job
It's bait, everyone in London knows (Um)
But still, nah, they don't wanna give no props, but life's good when you make this much dough
I'm laid back, I'm good, I'm easy
Old school, it was too damn easy
Ina my Air Force one new era hat (Era hat)
Playing PS2
Crash Bandicoot, Mortal Kombat (Mortal Kombat, old school)
Used to bump train and dip the conductor
Now I can buy
Whole heapa ting from a Rasta (Bare tings)
We used to have dreams of getting out the flats (Ooh, we did, we did)
Bus rides to the studio just to make tracks (EC1 days)
I mastered my flow like Luda and Kano (True)
Ask Lou and Reece and them man, trust me, they know (Trust me they know, they know, they know)

Listening to new sounds of Little Simz
Little Slimz
This is 101 FM
We're live at ya
Top of the flats
Can't see us, but you can hear us
We're loving it, you're loving it
Sweet as a fucking nut14Embed
