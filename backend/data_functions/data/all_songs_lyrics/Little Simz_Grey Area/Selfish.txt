Selfish Lyrics
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

Got a very big ego
Embedded in me that's the heritage ego
And let 'em hate, they ain't messing with the steeze though
And now I'm here, can't entertain no bummy niggas
Need my nigga fresh in a tuxedo
Me and my new case, steady blowing weed smoke
I'm a woman who can teach you a little something about class (Class)
Diamonds will forever be a girls best friend (Friend)
Everything's imperative for the way I live
I know it's material, but not irrelevant
All this here is worked for, not inherited
Tell myself I write my niggas off but never did
Self loving
Need more self loving, that's how it goes
They wanna know you when you're buzzing
But first things first, number one and priority
Call it what you want, doesn't phase
Doesn't bother me, honestly
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

Love and hate can never be friends
Don't rush everything in this divine time
I peaked, you couldn't handle a woman in my calibre
Had to let you mature like some fine wine, yeah
No validation, no applause
You don't have to prove you got it when you know it's yours
I don't wanna feel disloyal for wanting to do me
Then you act brand new and I know the cause, wait
Call it what you like, till now I ain't ever been the selfish type
Till now I ain't ever told nobody no, don't get it twisted
This shit didn't happen overnight
Still, if your life is amazing, what you got to fear?
Can't be concerned about what they're saying over there
I make it clear, don't be in and out about what you hear
You say I always get what I want and it isn't fair
But life isn't fair, go
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish
