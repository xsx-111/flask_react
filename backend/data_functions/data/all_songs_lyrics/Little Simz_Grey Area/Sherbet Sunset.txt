Sherbet Sunset Lyrics
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la
That little grey area
Yo

It's hard to talk about somethin' that I don't believe in
L-O-V-E, can you tell me what's the meanin'? I been dreamin'
How the fuck was you that deceitful? I didn't see it
Hard for me to paint a picture, you'll just have to meet him
Gave my all to you, wanted to give more to you
Should've been honest with yourself, nobody was forcin' you
I ain't even mad at you, Chuck, I'm just mad at me
Should've known better, mummy taught me better strategies
Still it burns, guess it's a blessing and a curse
Life goes on, this another lesson learned
Mind switched on, you can hear it in a verse, right?
But you will never know how much it really hurts
Images so vivid, so clear, oh my, dear
You have no idea who I know here
Think fast, be on your A game
Silly for me to think we was on the same page
You really don't know anybody these days
She stays for his sake, a sweet face
Mind spinnin', the clock tickin', my soul missin'
Did well to convince me that you're so different
Give someone an inch and they will take a mile
It might take a while
Now I see you've approached this in a faker style
This must be the apocalypse, feels like the world's ending
Who am I? I'm a mess, more sinning, more spending
More down days tryna make it through the seventh
Can't believe I almost got rid of my independence
Type of fuckery will have you look at yourself and start second guessin'
Now I'm on crud like shit will get messy if you ever get to testin'
But really I'm a sensitive soul and I'll stress it
What happens when someone takes advantage of that?
Lost part of myself, and I can't get her back
Oh, my love, I been waiting
For you to run back home, oh
Oh, my love, I been investigating
If you went and found new love, oh

How the fuck you get twang, Simz? You smarter than that
But you don't see it when you're in it, that's the hardest of facts
I can't relax, my heart racin'
Remember when I heard the news, I just couldn't face it
If we ever talk again, it's on a last name basis
I know where to place you
I'm just tryna understand it
I don't wanna hate you
Guess you had to do what you had to do
But just know nobody rates you
Key word in all of this is you
I wonder what I did for me, I hardly remember me
What a waste of chemistry, energy and empathy
Wonder when you planned to let me know about her pregnancy
You have no integrity, emotion or respect for me
Clearly wasn't meant to be
This was temporary
This the clearest I've seen it, was bound to end eventually
Still it hurts tremendously, can't bear the intensity
Oh, my love, I been waiting
For you to run back home, oh
Oh, my love, I been investigating
If you went and found new love, oh

I kept quiet 'bout the situation
But now I'm sayin' my piece, though
Nothing lasts forever
There's me acting like I didn't know
I can't do relationships for Instagram
Posing like my life is perfect, really it's the opposite
Lately I been down a lot
I talk to no one about it
Can't even write about it, damn this writer's block
Hittin' me like never before, still I record
Been in the raw, smokin' just to take my mind all off
Everything that I should've been mindful of
Everything that I've enjoyed in life, I'm a survivor of
Making sure to understand the small print 'fore I sign it off
You was meant to be in my Grammy speech, your entire loss
I'll just keep it real, truth won't be concealed
Please don't listen to this and ask me if I'm hurtin' or if I'm okay
Allow me to be human and be in my feels
Chill, I'm good, I got it
I never lost it
Or am I just lying to myself to skip the topic?
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Oh, my love, I been waiting
For you to run back home, oh
Oh, my love, I been investigating
If you went and found new love, oh
Oh, my love, I been waiting
For you to run back home, oh
Oh, my love, I been investigating
If you went and found new love, oh

Your heart cries at night alone
Your heart cries at night alone1Embed
