Pressure Lyrics
Oh, let me apply the pressure, ayy
Start off 'fore we end up, get your march on
On your marks, get set, ready, gunshot
I put my hands in the air so you don't shoot
How in the world could you dare let a boss ruin?
Now do you care about all the eyes on you?
Now you wanna say we're tellin' lies on you
Same motherfuckers that be killin' off the planet
Are the same fuckers advising you
But true, this stuff is surprising to
See them profit just off of depriving youth
Why you wanna all dress lies as truth?
Have you ever seen what silence do?
I don't wanna see no violent troops
Puttin' out fires that haven't even been started
What the rahtid, man, I'm tired, too
But I don't lose, I refuse
Take a walk in my shoes
Or any other young Black person in this age (Peace signs)
All we ever know is pain
All we ever know is rage
That book starts on this page
Do not try to relate
It's either you do or you don't, shit (All are a—, all are around us)
It's either you will or you won't
Hope you still got to engage
Don't take offence, it's too late
I say this to those who've never been poverty stricken
Always have a silver spoon to feed off (Peace signs)
"It may not be your fault," heard that line before
Leave that privilege shit at the door
I don't care about none of that shit
Say it louder, keep playin' my shit, what
(Peace signs, peace signs)
(All are a—, all are around us)

Oh, keep applying pressure, ayy
Far from where I wanna be in this life
There's nothin' I can't be in this life
I just wanna do my ting and be free in this life
Blinded at times, can't see in this life
Just tryna pass the test like I want A-stars, don't give me no C in this life
I'm just glad that my unborn kids won't have you as a daddy in this life
Hold your L, you prick
F you, nigga really thought he was a G in this life
Fuck that, not stressing, get a next ting
I don't wanna be angry in this life
Shit really got me down, but
I'm still gonna succeed in life (All are around us)
Plant the seed, by any means
Gettin' gold, no in-between
Born to fail, never was me
They never believed
Just had a dream and holes in my jeans
Down on my luck, still on my deen
Talkin' to God, he makin' me see
My reason to be here
Understanded that this is bigger than me
Watchin' the news and feelin' so helpless, can't even help myself
I'm changin' up all this shit
Say it louder, keep playin' my shit
Man, I'm proud of how far we come
Won't stop 'til we livin' in bliss
Won't stop 'til you know we meant it
Play no games with these 'illionaires
Play no games with these niggas out here
Ain't afraid of these niggas out here
Livin' in your bed and not workin' for a check
Everybody's caught in the lifestyle
Michael Jordan steps, thinkin' you can jump the test
Everybody's caught on the lifestyle
Livin' in your bed and not workin' for a check
Everybody's caught in the lifestyle
Michael Jordan steps, thinkin' you can jump the test
Everybody's caught on the lifestyle

So you wanna be filthy rich then?
With yes men by your side
When you walk along this route
With yes, yes by, with yes men by your side
So you wanna be filthy rich then?
With yes men by your side
When you walk along this route
Go, go swimming 'gainst the tide
Go swim, swimming

Peace signs, peace signs
All are around us
All are a—, all are a—
Peace signs, peace signs
All are around us
Keep applying pressure, ayy9Embed
