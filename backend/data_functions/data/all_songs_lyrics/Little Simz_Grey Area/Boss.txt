Boss Lyrics
Stop fucking with my heart
Nigga, you was my dream, fool
Oh, now you a man, ho?
I don't need that stress, that stress
I'm a boss in a fucking dress
Nigga, stay in line

Hype shit, never hype bitch
Know now that you're dealing with a crisis
Never been nice, never been nice nigga
I'm a thrift store kid, real fly, nigga
Haven't seen a show 'til you see me live, nigga
At 23 sold dreams to my side nigga
See God when you look me in my eyes, nigga
Learnt from 'Ye then went and touched the sky nigga
15 when I wrote "Will To Survive," nigga
Fast-forward seven years, "Low Tides," nigga
Stayed in my own lane, never side tracked
I serve-serve, lemme prep it, lemme dice that
You likkle rodents went and fell into my mice trap
And you can send a diss, I will never write back
Never lack, still whippin' main road nigga
Man they shoulda never let me discover the mic
Stop fucking with my heart
Nigga, you was my dream, fool (Little bitch)
Oh, now you a man, ho?
I don't need that stress, that stress
I'm a boss in a fucking dress
Nigga, stay in line

Got in a pattern, followed the rhythm
I disregarded all opinions and continued my mission
Unapologetically I be bossin' it, getting better with age
Got it back, never lost it, my legacy remains
Rejected the dotted line but not the pen
Invested in myself, that was money well spent
Came home, mummy burning incense
'Member tryna think of ways to help contribute to the rent
Now the room's upstate, top suite penthouse
Views where there's no family or friends
What life do I want? Know I gotta choose 'fore it's too late
Well I guess it all depends, uh
I was running with Toby and them
Never looked back once I discovered the pen
Dedicated it all to the art
Who would've known it would be this from the start?
Stop fucking with my heart
Nigga, you was my dream, fool (Little bitch)
Oh, now you a man, ho?
I don't need that stress, that stress
I'm a boss in a fucking dress
Nigga, stay in line

Nigga, stay in line
Stop fucking with my heart6Embed
