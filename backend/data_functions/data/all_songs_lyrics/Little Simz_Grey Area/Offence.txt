Offence Lyrics
Me again, allow me to pick up where I left off
The biggest phenomenon and I'm Picasso with the pen
Niggas always talk shit until I hit them with the realness
Figured I should say some', but you don't wanna hear me vent
You can talk bad all day long, I will never be impressed
Dunno what I did to make you feel that you be earnin' my respect
You do not scare me, no, you are not a threat
Anyone that want it they can get it in a flash, no sweat
If you're gonna talk on my name, least say it with your chest
Got my team on deck taking out all pawns and my knight got your queen in check, mate
Don't get touchy, don't be getting in your feelings
All I do is kill shit, shit, even when I'm chillin'
I'm Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days
Never been a punk, trust you can get it in the worst way
Fuck it, lemme get a birthday cake and it ain't even my birthday
'Cause when I switch then they wanna say that I'm a bitch

You're not listening, you're not listening
I said it with my chest and I don't care who I offend, uh-huh
Haa

Came through swinging out the gate on a mad one, no fucks
Steppin' to the kid tryna bring it, I promise you'll have no luck
You sold out for a quick buzz and honey, you got no love
No less than what I know that I'm worth and I won't budge
In and out of doorways juggin'-juggin' through the broadway
Anthony, where would I be now if I went and done it your way?
I been exhausted, man, I think I need a tour break
Might take a trip to the Philippines with my Spanish boy Jorge
Holla my plug like, "I'm back in town and I need a ounce gimme more flavs"
Take Mum on a spree like, "Get anything you want, this is your day"
I followed the white rabbit, got a couple carrots I know that I got bad habits
Tryna find the balance, I'm in the store like, "I wanna have it I gotta have it"
You are not the toughest or baddest, my pen is the maddest
I've probably ended careers and it's never out of malice
Gas level ain't even on 10 and still they can't manage
They think I'm a shy one, like, "Nah Simz won't flip"
But when I switch, then they wanna say that I'm a bitch
I said it with my chest and I don't care who I offend, uh-huh
Haa
I said it with my chest and I don't care who I offend, uh-huh
