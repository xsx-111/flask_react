Rape Me Lyrics
Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again

I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one

Hate me
Do it and do it again
Waste me
Rape me, my friend

I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one

My favorite inside source
I'll kiss your open sores
I appreciate your concern
You're gonna stink and burn
Rape me
Rape me, my friend
Rape me
Rape me again

I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one, ah-ah
I'm not the only one

Rape me! (Rape me!)
Rape me! (Rape me!)
Rape me! (Rape me!)
Rape me! (Rape me!)
Rape me! (Rape me!)
Rape me! (Rape me!)
Rape me!58Embed
