I Thought About You LyricsSeems that I read, or somebody said
That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind, what did I find...
I took a trip on the train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you
Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream
At every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue
I peeked through the crack
And looked at the track
The one going back to you
And what did I do
I thought about youEmbed
