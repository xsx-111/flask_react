Nothing In the World LyricsNow if I owned the Aladdin's lamp
I'd make all your dreams come true
'Cause nothing in the world
Could make me love you more than I do
And if I owned a magic clock
Then I'd keep our love brand new
But nothing in the world
Ooh, could make me love you more than I do
Don't ever doubt my feelings
My love, yes, my love is real
My darling, I'm revealing
Exactly how I feel
And if I owned a magic wand
I'd wave it for no one but you
Daddy, 'cause nothing in the world
Could make me love you more than I do
Well, if I owned a magic wand
I'd wave it for no one but you
'Cause nothing in the world
Could make me love you more than I doEmbed
