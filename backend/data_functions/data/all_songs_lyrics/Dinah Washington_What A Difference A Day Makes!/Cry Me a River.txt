Cry Me a River LyricsNow you say you're lonely
Said you cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
'Cause I cried a river over you
Oohhh
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
So what?
Just cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me
(Bye-bye, my love)
You nearly drove me out of my head
(Bye-bye, my love)
While you never shed a tear
Remember?
I remember all you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Go on and cry me a river
I'd like to see you cry me a river
'Cause I'm tired of crying over
