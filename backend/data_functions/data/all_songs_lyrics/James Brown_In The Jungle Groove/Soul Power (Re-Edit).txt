Soul Power (Re-Edit) Lyrics
Know we need it (Soul power)
We got to have it (Soul power)
Know we want it (Soul power)
Got to have it (Soul power)
Give it to me (Soul power)
Hey, we need it (Soul power)
Huh, we want it (Soul power)
We got to have it (Soul power)
I want to get under your skin
If I get there, I've got to win
You need some soul, come on get some
And then you'll know, where I'm comin' from
Ha, I may lay in the cut and go along
And I'm still on the case, and my rap is strong
Huh huh, hey
Don't jump on my train, when I'm outta sight
Just check yourself, huh, and say, 'yeah you're right'
Huh, hit me, give me, put it there, huh
Love me tender, and love me slow
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Hey, we gotta gotta gotta, get in the bracket
You know I like it, hey
Hey...
Huh, looka here, you gotta get, ha, in the bracket
You know I like it, huh, all right, looka here, all right
Don't fall on the ground, you've got to get down
Down down down down...
Don't fall on the ground, you've got to get down
Down down down down...
Huh, huh, good God
I've got to ask you, what we need (Soul power)
What we want (Soul power)
Got to have (Soul power)
What we want (Soul power)
Hey, hey
I think we got to go to the bridge
Can we go to the bridge, Phelps?
Can we go one more time, the bridge, hit me!
Love me tender, love me slow
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Love me tender, love me slow
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Get in the bracket, you know I like it, huh
Well, I wanna get under your skin, huh
And when I get there, I got to win
I need some coal, you need some soul
Once the hot, kill the coal
You need some soul, come on, and then get some
And then you'll know where I'm comin' from
What we need (Soul power), what we want (Soul power)
What we need (Soul power), what we need (Soul power)
Don't fall on the ground, we got to get down
Down down down down...
Tell me, what we need, what we need (Soul power)
What we want (Soul power), what we need (Soul power)
What we want (Soul power), what we need (Soul power)
What we want (Soul power)
Can you feel it (Soul power)
You got to feel it (Soul power)
Got to feel it (Soul power), got to feel it (Soul power)
We gotta, gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta, oh...
You gotta feel it (Soul power), gotta feel it (Soul power)
You gotta feel it (Soul power), gotta feel it (Soul power)
Heh, uh, hey, don't fall on the ground
You've got to get down, down down down down
Feels so good, brother
I want to go to the bridge once more again (Me too)
Will you take me on, brother? (Yeah)
I need help, I can't do it alone (Me too)
They tell me, if you don't work you can't eat (Hey)
You ready Freddy, brother? (Yeah)
Can we throw it to the bridge?
Hey, hit me...
Alright, love me tender, and then love me slow
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Say it again
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Say it again
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Say it again
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Hey hey, hey, say it again

Tell me, what we need (Soul power), what we want (Soul power)
Say it again (Soul power), what we need (Soul power)

Remember you've got to get down, down down down down...
Huh, say it again, say it, hey

What we need (Soul power), what we want (Soul power)

I think I'll talk to that young girl sittin' up there (Yeah)
I wanna tell her something (Alright)
Love me tender, love me slow
(Let me tell her, if that don't get it, come back for more)
What? What you say?
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
I don't think they heard you, what you say?
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
What, ha, tell her, huh, you heard him
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Do your little thing, but you know...
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
If that don't, oh...Embed
