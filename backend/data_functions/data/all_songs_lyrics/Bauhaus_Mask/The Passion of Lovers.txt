The Passion of Lovers Lyrics
She had nut painted arms that were hers to keep
And in her fear, she sought cracked pleasures
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
Licked her lips, and turned to feather

And as I watched from underneath
I came aware of all that she keeps
The little foxes so safe and sound
They were not dead
They'd gone to ground

"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death
Oh

She breaks her heart just a little too much
And her jokes attract the lucky bad type
As she dips and wails and slips her banshee smile
She gets the better of the bigger to the letter
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death (Oh)
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death (Oh)
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death
"The passion of lovers is for death," said she
The passion of lovers is for death (Oh)6Embed
