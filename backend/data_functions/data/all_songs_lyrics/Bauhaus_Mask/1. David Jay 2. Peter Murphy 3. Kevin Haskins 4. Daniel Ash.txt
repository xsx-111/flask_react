She blamed him for stoking up controversy
In a dream world
It's a long way down from Heaven's gate
In the absence of a jury
The case continues
White lies
Seal his bitter fate
The case continues
2. Peter Murphy
Take a fish
And a potato
Hold the fish
And the potato
In your hand
In your hand
Put the potato
In the fish
Make it digest it
Smash it up
Smash it up
Smash it up
Smash it up
This is how you make fishcakes
This is how one makes fishcakes
Smash it up
Poke it up
Fishcakes
Fishcakes
Fishcakes
Fishcakes
Put it down the fish
Put it down the fish
Throw it against the wall
Stamp on the fish
Fishcakes
Fishcakes
Fishcakes
Fishcakes
Throw it on the wall
Smash it on the wall
Throw it on the wall
Smash it on the wall
Fishcakes
Fishcakes
3. Kevin Haskins
Do you always keep drumsticks on the piano?
Take it easy
Avoid risks and, if possible, stay at home
Not only is trouble very difficult
But you are advised of staying off ladders
For there may be the danger of performance
There is a lot of stress and strain
Both at work, and at home
But we know tomorrow is another day
4. Daniel Ash

Naturally enough
The others have been doing their utmost to match this performance
This is something people get when they continually drink whiskey
I can't drink
I hardly eat these days
OK, that's fineEmbed
