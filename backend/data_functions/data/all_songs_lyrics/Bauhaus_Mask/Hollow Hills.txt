Hollow Hills LyricsAncient earthwork, fort and barrow
Discreetly hide their secret abodes
The most fearful hide deep inside
And venture not there upon Yuletide
For invasion of their hollow hills
That music hold and Oberon fill
Is surely recommended not
For fear of death, in fear of rot
Hollow hills
Hollow hills
Hollow hills
Hollow hills
Baleful sound and wild voices ignored
Ill luck, disaster - the one reward
Violated sanctity of supermen's hills
So sad (hollow hills)
Love lies there still (hollow hills)
So sad (hollow hills)
So sad (hollow hills)
Hollow hills (hollow hills)
Hollow hills (hollow hills)
Hollow hills
Hollow hills
And witches too, and goblins too
The speckled silk
Lament, repent
Oh mortal you (oh mortal you)
So sad (hollow hills), so sad
So sad, so sad...1Embed
