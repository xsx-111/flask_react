The Man with the X-Ray Eyes LyricsShoes that no man would want to wear
Slice of life that's night's last cold stare
Red fist curled 'round the house
Wash away, boy, Shelly's shoes
Wash
Chocolate power is so crisp
Atomic open house is really here
And we have gone so desperate
Your power knows no bounds
And heavier with time are our shoes
That no man would want to wear
New tread wipes a wet road so dry
(It stings)
Into the borrowed course
Under the dreadful birds
Under the singing soil and all those guilty clouds
I have seen too much, wipe away my eyes too much
Wipe away my eyes, too much
Wipe away my eyes, too much
Wipe away my eyes, too much
Wipe away my eyes
Wipe away my eyes
Wipe away my eyes
Wipe away my eyes
Wipe away my eyes
Wipe away my eyes
Wipe away my eyes
Wipe away my eyes
My eyes, eyes, eyes3Embed
