Mask Lyrics
I'm lost

The man of shadows thinks in clay
Dreamed trapped thoughts of suffocation days
He's seen in iron environments
With plastic sweat out of chiselled slits for eyes
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

From the growth underneath the closed mouth
You'll catch if you listen
Rack-trapped cubist vowels
From a dummy head expression
From a dummy head expression
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The transformation is invested
With the mysterious and the shameful
While the thing I am becomes something else
Part character, part sensation

The shadow is cast1Embed
