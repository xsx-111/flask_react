Of Lillies and Remains Lyrics
In the marbled reception hall, I received a three-band gold ring from Mark, a token of esteem
Running through ghost closet locker rooms to hide from Peter, who has fallen to the old cold stone floor wheezing and emitting a seemingly endless flow of ectoplasmic white goo from ears and mouth
A wind rushes through the hall; whistles as it breezes through the narrow slits in the green locker doors
I hide in one of these: number thirteen
Barely concealed, but hopeful
Blackout
Blackout

I will climb this high wall in remembrance of Clancy
To regain or re-earn my life
As I died just a flicker of an eyelid ago
The wall has many holes
And many foot pieces to fasten to
The wall is dangerous, and this is my penance
My penance and my task
I did it once and they wondered
Yet, I needed to go one more around
Up breathtakingly
Across rigidly
Down easily and foolishly
I endeavoured again
To climb the wall in vain
And capture back my chain
Of lilies and remains
Of lilies and remains
Lilies and remainsEmbed
