Fine Fat Flies LyricsSoon I woke when I was sleeping
With a restless reaching feeling
But did not know what I was reaching for
I got up and started walking
But soon found that I was stalking
Prey that I could utilize for more
Than just an easy conversation
Or an evening's inspiration
Now the time was right for something more
As I walked I thought of flies that
Stuck to sticky pecan pies that
People put upon the window sill
And how those fine fat flies would feed
Until they satisfied their greed then
Buzzed about in panic till they died
Knowing where my feet would take me
If I kept on moving made me
See myself exactly like those flies
Drawn into a situation
That with some consideration
Never would fulfill its smiling smell
But there was no hesitation
In my step or in my making
Sure the door was quiet when it closed
And as I walked into the darkness
I could sense a wakened sharpness
Penetrating deep within the room
Then I touched her arm and throat and
Found beneath my hand a coat of
Moisture, though the night was not too warm
The other one was breathing deeply
So I thought he must be sleeping
But then again I wasn't really sure
"Hold me tight and be my master,"
Someone whispered and I fastened fingers
Of my own around her wrists
Which strangely were secure behind her
As I began to mount and bind her
To myself with force I could not hold
Then I seemed to hear a snicker
But I was so busy with her
That I did not notice him until
I felt him put his hands around
My throat and squeeze as if the sounds
I made should not escape into the air
Causing me to moan too loudly
As I gasped and jerked on out the
Fire that I no longer could control
I was first to see the flashing
Blinding light of liquid lashing
Out my arms, but my convulsions spread
To my writhing young companions
Who were lost in unabandoned
Cream that soon would crack and fade away
Afterwards, when it was quiet
And the bonds had been denied, I
Told them that we should do this again
But I said it would be wrong to
Play these games of weak and strong
Together without me around to help
Them understand the dangers in it
For there were so many and they
Simply were too young to understandEmbed
