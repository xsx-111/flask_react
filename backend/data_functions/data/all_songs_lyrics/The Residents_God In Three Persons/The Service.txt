The Service Lyrics
He really loved them
He really loved them
He really loved them
He really cared...

So I pushed and pushed and pushed them
Through the towns and through the bushes
And the word was spreading like a lie
"Come and see the holy twosome
They can heal and they can do some
Things that no one ever did before."
So they came for holy healing
Both the belching and the squealing
And the ones who maybe just were bored
Down the aisle they slowly paraded
While I smiled and masqueraded
As the kindly keeper of the touch
Kneeling them along a line
I taped a tiny piece of pine
Upon the chin of each and every one
And then from this a copper wire
Stretched across a tubeless tire
And ended in a round and reddish clamp
Then at once the fees were taken
And the apprehension shaken
For the twins would silently appear
Full of life and love and smiling
Knowing not that all the while
I too was smiling to myself inside
Silently I stood between them
Holding up the crimson gleaming
Circle with the ends now pried apart
Then I lifted up the cover
Softly like it was my lover
And I felt them shudder as they sighed
As I clamped the metal on it
Something like a liquid doughnut
Shimmered as the holy union flexed
Then the people screamed and shouted
As the doughnut grew and spouted
Little bitty dust balls made of fire
And these soon enough descended
Down the lines and finally ended
At the screams of joy and pain and fear
For soon the cripples would be walking
And the dummies would be talking
But no one knew exactly how or whyEmbed
