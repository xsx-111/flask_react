Loss of a Loved One LyricsI told them how my wife had fallen
Into sickness, and to calling
Out her name with questions on her tongue
We had always been so happy that at first I wasn't sad
Because I thought my love could keep her strong
But, but I never thought so wrongly
For the fever fought too strongly
And it seemed she never fought at all
Soon she died, and I despaired
Upon the love seat we had shared so
Many times on pleasant afternoons
I tried and tried to understand why
Love itself could not command my
True love from the comas of her mind
Now, empty, open and foreboding
Stretching out like darkened clothing
Somehow stained with silence and with fear
Death had brought its separation
Giving me an education
Of a dull and slowly drifting day
I filled my emptiness with sorrow
Taking what I could not borrow
From the friends I finally drove away

This is the sad part
Oh, it's such a sad part
Yes, my life was nearly ruined
Till I saw what you were doing
Now, now I strive to keep on serving you
Life is good, but I am better
For I feel at last I let her
Go because I finally found the truth
Sadly now, I see the answer
All her life she was a dancer
But no one ever played the song she knewEmbed
