Confused (By What I Felt Inside) LyricsI was standing at the fireplace
Thinking of my own desire which
Seemed to offer me no place to go
When I heard a little giggle
Sounding like some silly piglets
Playing in the mud so deep and warm
So I went and looked around and
From the bathroom door I found some
Sounds that had not come from here before
So I shouted, "Come on out!"
And soon I saw them both look out
Expressing fear and innocence at once

Now it started...
They said that they were having fun with
Something that they found someone had
Left behind a basket on the floor
"Let me see," and so I took it
With a snatch that left a crooked
Smile across the corner of my mouth.
It was a smooth and shiny object
With a purpose and a job I
Recognized and was familiar with
Looking up I saw one pair of
Eyes that somehow now were staring
Straight into the secrets of my mind
I knew at once it was the she thing
Not the they, and not the he thing
Looking back at me and my desire
Inflamed I reached and pulled her close, and
Then at once I had them both off
Balance and we fell upon the floor
Into a pile of awkward bodies
Arms and legs and elbows caught
Between, around and in between us all
Hastily I helped them up and
Said that we should soon discuss and
Try to understand what they had found
But it was too late to do it
Now. But if I tell the truth, I
Was confused by what I felt insideEmbed
