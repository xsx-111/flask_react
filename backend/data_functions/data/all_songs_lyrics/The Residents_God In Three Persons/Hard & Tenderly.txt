Hard & Tenderly Lyrics
Hard and tenderly
Hard and tenderly

They called me "Mr. X Indeed"
The special ones that saw so deep inside
The souls of those who were so lonely
I was down beneath the bottom
When my vacant staring caught them
Gaily parading up and down the street
Followed by some stinking masses
Freeing fumes and giving gasses
To the brown and nearly worn out air
But they had that certain presence
Like the ether or the essence
Of the cleansing upper atmosphere
Laughing, loving, and without a
Doubt, they simply strode about the
Streets that other creatures left alone
I ran across, myself compulsive
With the Feeling of a pulsing
Drum that pounded underneath my skin
A tingling in My tangled brain
Was screaming that this was insane
But it also told me "touch it, touch it too"
"Stand aside," I told the masses
And with that I made my passage
From the lonely to the only side
Openly they smiled to greet me
Like they always knew they'd meet me
Somewhere walking up and down the road
I knew I must appear as someone
Far beyond the common come-on
So I could not say my name was Ed
So I said, "I'm Mr. X, who
Wants to come and who expects to
Help and guide your efforts to succeed."
They laughed a little bit at me
And Then said, "Mr. X-Indeed,"
And hugged me somehow hard and tenderly

Hard and tenderly
Hard and tenderlyEmbed
