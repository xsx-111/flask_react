Holy Kiss of Flesh Lyrics
Now, it's almost over
Now, it's almost done
There's only a thing or two
Left, and then we are gone
I returned while they were eating
Supper at the table seated
Side by side upon her special stool
So I said when they were finished
With their whole wheat toast and spinach
We should go back to the secret room
That had only been constructed
Recently to be conductive
To the force that grew around the twins
Once inside, we all admired its
Silver gleaming pointed spire
That rose into the center of the room
Up and up toward the ceiling
Gracefully it stretched not yielding
To the confines of the smallish room
For it pierced an open circle and
Vanished deep into the murky
Night that had its crown somewhere above
The room had been an inspiration
Of the twins that I had taken
Building it of wood and tile and chrome
And they would stay inside for hours
While the rain dripped down the tower
Sitting on a bench around its base
But this time we were not there for
Inspiration but to bare our
Other sides and feel the kiss of flesh
"Take your clothes off!" I commanded
Like a bold and common bandit
Basking in a feeling of control
I was standing back behind them
With a length of line to tie them
Once their nakedness had been revealed
"Kneel!" I said, becoming heated
For the task had been completed
And I felt my goal was drawing near
"Hee hee hee," Then I heard a little snicker "Hee hee...hee hee hee."
"What was that!" I said and quickly
Giggles spread infection in the room
"Stop it! Stop it! Stop!" I said
But it seemed to spread and spread
"Stop it or I won't show you any more!"
"We can't believe that you're so dumb
To think we needed anyone
To show us what we've known about for years."
"What!?" I screamed in disbelief
So certain that I was the thief
That took away their purity, I said:
"But what about the other night when
She and I were locked so tight and..."
Laughter drowned me out so I stopped
"What makes you think that it was 'her'", the
Mocking voices said, with words that
Sliced me open, fast and quick
"But I know it must have been
Because I smelled her heated skin and..."
"Don't you see, there is no 'she' now?
Don't you see, there is no 'she' now?
Don't you see, there is no 'she' now...
Don't you see, there is no 'she'..."
So I saw there was no she
But there was only them and me
And they were laughing in my face too loud
So I reached into my pocket
And a feeling like a shock
Exuded from my fingertips and spread
Along my limbs and up my butt
And focused just below my guts
And made me hold my breath before the blade
Could finally fall at last and free me
From the anger and the screaming
Endlessly exploding in my head
So I slit the holy union
Turning it into a wound
That gaped apart and bled upon the ground
Causing me to fire my passion
As I stared into the gash
That quivered like a burned and ripped out tongue
So great upon my throbbing penis
Was the pull toward this Venus
That there was no thought of it at all
Only all consuming lust
To be inflamed in base disgust
And smile about it while I came inside
So I slipped my dick into it
Thrusting into pain and spewing
Blood around the room, I needed more
And so I fucked it that much harder
Deep and fast, I pushed apart the
Shoulders that were down below my waist
Screams were slicing up the air
As eyes rolled up and teeth were bared
By lips that stretched too tight and tried to tear
There could be but one conclusion
To this sick distorted fusion
And of course it came, and so did I
Madly with my face contorted
I convulsed and shoved apart the
Shoulders that I gripped so hard and I... I... I...
I faintly recollect a ripping
Sickly sound of fleshy splitting
As I drifted toward a big black hole
And just before I hit the floor I
Noticed one was rolling over
Showing me a smooth unblemished thigh
That ended in a red eruption
Just below her belly button
But maybe it was only in my mind...
Maybe it was only in my mind...Embed
