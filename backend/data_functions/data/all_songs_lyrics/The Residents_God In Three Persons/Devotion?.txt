Devotion? LyricsShortly after I first met them
Something that I said upset them
And perhaps we should have parted then
I was saying how important
That they were, and what a fortune
Could be made if they would let me try
But I did not understand why
They took in and had to stand by
Those who were so worthless to them both
Then they got extremely angry
Shouting that the seedy gang behind them
May not have much value in my eyes
"But they were people and were needing
What we give, and if you see them
Like you see some roaches on the floor
Well then, the sad one must be you
That sees himself as too good to do
Something for the weak or ones with warts
You disdain and criticize someone
Who has been compromised, but
You really have no values of your own
So maybe you should leave and find some
Steal or beg or maybe buy some
From a smiling banker or a store."
Something's coming
Something's coming
Something's coming
Something's coming
But not real soon
At first I was too shocked to believe
That they'd suggest that I should leave
And what was even worse was that I saw
That they preferred their gutter rutting
Friends above my smugly strutting
And I admit it stunned and humbled me
So I begged and then beseeched them
"Let me stay and you could teach some
Sense into this tired old mind of mine."
And of course we reconciled with
Hugging arms and tugging smiles that
Left me more secure, but still in doubt
I truly loved and felt devotion
For them both, but I was broken
Up and feeling powerless inside
I must become important to them
Intertwined with roots into them
Or else I'd lose my false and newfound prideEmbed
