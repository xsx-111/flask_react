The Touch LyricsAs they told me other childhood
Stories, they knew that I stood
Close but, but never close enough to touch
The holy union of their bonding
Which, which I wished to touch so fondly
With my heart, and maybe somehow more
But, but they had a way of keeping
It away, while never seeming
Less than just big open and friendly, friendly doors
On one day it finally happened
Just before they took a nap, we
Joked around the room in which they slept
They were kidding me about an
Incident when I kicked out some
Rowdy shouting something near the door
They said that I had looked afraid
And if I didn't act my age, well then
They would have to hold me back next time
I laughed and said that it would take
More than just two freaks to make me
Stop if someone interrupted us again
And with that we started shoving
Back and forth until a sudden
Move caught me completely off my guard
They reached around, surrounding me
Within a wall of flesh. I found my
Only freedom left was in my hand
Which dangled up and down between
Their sides until I jerked and seemed to
Watch it flutter down upon their joint
Fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
And suddenly a shock went through me
And a moment slipped into the
Room that wasn't there before
Looking up we all connected
In a triangle of eyes reflecting
Tension and unsaid excitement, too
Then it passed in nervous laughter
But I sensed a change soon after
We unlocked our limbs and I withdrew

Fluttered down
Fluttered down
Fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
Fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
It fluttered down
Fluttered down
It fluttered downEmbed
