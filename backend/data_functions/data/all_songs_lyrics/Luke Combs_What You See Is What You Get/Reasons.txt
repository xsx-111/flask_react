Reasons Lyrics
I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sunday
Or an ice-cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at eighteen, mama gave me a curfew
But it was, "Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules"

I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
But some of them I'll never understand

But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons
Some are good and some are bad
Some are true and some are sad
Everyone's got some but I need one
That brings you back

We all got our reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life and you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

Woah, I got my reasons
Yeah, I got my reasonsEmbed
