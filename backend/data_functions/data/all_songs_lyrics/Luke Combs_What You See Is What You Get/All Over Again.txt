All Over Again Lyrics
Feels so familiar
You walking in here
Wearing just what you know makes me weak
And I'm already ordering you a drink
Baby, and then we're
Gonna get out of here
Just like the last time and the time before
We're at your house and through the door

And we're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn "I love you"
Into "Boy, where you been?"
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again

I'll think you're out of my system
At least 'til I miss ya
I'll start going through withdrawals
That's about the time you'll call
And we'll be falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn "I love you"
Into "Boy, where you been?"
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again

Well, I know where we'll wind up
'Cause trouble loves to find us
And I guess goodbye's just too tough
'Cause last time was the last time, but

We're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn "I love you"
Into "Boy, where you been?"
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again
Oh, we're all over again
Well, I know where we'll wind up
And I guess goodbye's just too toughEmbed
