Nothing Like You Lyrics
I'm on this red-eye rolling down a runway
Window seat, nonstop one-way
2 PM, Gate B10, it can't come soon enough
I've got a mid-flight magazine and a mixed drink
I wish time would fly right with me
Damn the days that baggage claim's in another taxi town
But they always bring me back to you

I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you

I've spent every mile missing you, baby
It's enough to drive me crazy
"I love you"'s from hotel rooms
They sure do make it tough
But they always bring me back to you

I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you
In all these nothing towns
You in this whole world around
You're the only place I wanna get back to

'Cause I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like
And still ain't seen nothing like
And still ain't seen nothing like
Nothing like you
Nothing like youEmbed
