What You See Is What You Get Lyrics
I'm a puzzle
I'm a walking contradiction
In far from mint condition
'Cause there's pieces I can't find
Sometimes trouble
A can of Coke a day addiction
With set in stone convictions
And an open bottom line

I'm an easy read but I ain't no open book
Got a knack for making things harder than they look

I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
"What you see is what you get"

At least I'm honest
I don't spin it like a record
And I ain't acting like I'm better
Than you know I really am
Yeah, you're dead on it
You got me figured, I'll admit it
Set in my ways hard-headed
But hell, I do the best I can
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
"What you see is what you get"

With me ain't no tricks up these sleeves
An acquired taste, a constant work in progress

I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you getEmbed
