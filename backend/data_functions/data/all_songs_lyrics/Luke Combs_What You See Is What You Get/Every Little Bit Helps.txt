Every Little Bit Helps Lyrics
This futon I crashed on in college, well, it ain't our bed
But  at least it don't smell like you
Patron  up on the counter, well, it ain't your red
And them long stems are long gone, too
Put that record on, took your pictures off the shelf
Oh,  'cause every little bit helps

Might  not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin'  right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step, I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One  night in to your "goodbye, gone" kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps

And this fiver might only spin my tires to the other side of town
But at least I'm out of this house
And this dive's tired, the band, man, it ain’t my sound
But at least they're playin' it loud
Two beers in and I'll be long gone come 12
Oh, 'cause every little bit helps
Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step, I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One night in to your "goodbye, gone" kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps

Every sip, every drink
That girl and her wink
It ain't much but I think
That every little bit helps

Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step, I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One night in to your "goodbye, gone" kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps
Oh, yeah, every little bit helpsEmbed
