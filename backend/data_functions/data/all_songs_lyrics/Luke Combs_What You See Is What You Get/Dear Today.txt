Dear Today Lyrics
Dear Today, Tomorrow here
Man, I was just checkin' in, hope you've been well
Me? I'm doin' alright, could always be better
Seein' as you're the only one with a choice in the matter
If I know you, hell, you're too busy
To do damn near anything that you ought to
Guess what I'm sayin' is, is if you don't change
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days

So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow

Listen, I ain't tryin' to bring you down
'Cause I know damn better than pushin' you around
I guess I was just lookin' out for you and me both
'Cause we both lose if I told you so

So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow

Dear Today, Tomorrow here
Man, I was just checkin' in, hope you been well2Embed
