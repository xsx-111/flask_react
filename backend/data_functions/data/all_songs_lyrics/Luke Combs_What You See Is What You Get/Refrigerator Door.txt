Refrigerator Door Lyrics
There's daddy on his John Deere, brand new in '96
Beside me and Bandit playing fetch when I was a kid
A Save the Date, best day of my best buddies life
Anybody else could walk on by, and not blink an eye

'Cause they're just pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
Just the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door

My first day of kindergarten when I was 5 years old
A postcard that my cousin sent from Cancun, Mexico
A list of what Mama needs from the IGA today
Is just one small part of a work of art signed Kenmore in '98

With all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door
As life flies by, it spills onto the side
Until it's covered top to bottom with the best days of your life

And all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that you've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's our lives on the 'frigerator door
On the 'frigerator doorEmbed
