Moon Over Mexico Lyrics
I can still see your blue sky blue eyes hangin' on a mango kiss
Hear the waves and the breeze and the Joshua trees
Was just about as good as it gets
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind like I'm right there again

Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico

The second I left I was kickin' myself
'Cause I knew I should've stayed
Still tequila love drunk, from us wakin' up
Under the Cabo palm leaf shade
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow

Of a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind, like I'm right there again

Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
Under a moon over Mexico
Over MexicoEmbed
