New Every Day Lyrics
I always thought that whiskey was just somethin' that you sipped
I always thought a smoke was somethin’ I'd never do again
I thought I was in control
And I was on a roll

I never thought a picture was enough to break me down
I never knew a king size bed was just another place to drown
Or how lonely lonely sounds
But man, I get it now

I'm learnin’ somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I'm findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day

I thought I knew it all, but girl, I guess you're showin’ me
I’m findin' out how freedom can feel anything but free
And how hurtin’ hurts like hell
Yeah, as far as I can tell
I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I’m findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day

Soon as it's gone I find out
Your memory is still around
And here to stay

Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I'm findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new
I guess you could say
That I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
Every dayEmbed
