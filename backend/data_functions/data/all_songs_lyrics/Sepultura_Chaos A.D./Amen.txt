Amen LyricsForgive me, father
Forgive me, God
I know I've sinned
With no remorse
Apocalyptic visions
Went through my head
Here today
Gone tomorrow
It's all insane
I'm feeling sick
I'm feeling numb
The storm will come
In the name of God
I'm the chosen one
Terror raids the land
To ashes we'll be sent
In the name of God
Lives cast away
Martyrdom of myself
Armageddon comes
In the name of God
Not one more dead
Fire blasting, cutting edge
Children burn in flames
In the name of God
We're going insane
Let us die
You don't realize
This is the time
God's sacrifice
Leaving behind
Lessons in hate
In the name of God
We're all dead
Burn!Embed
