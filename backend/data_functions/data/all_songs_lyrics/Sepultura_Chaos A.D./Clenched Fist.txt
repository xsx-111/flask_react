Clenched Fist LyricsPain makes me stronger
Every day
Life is chaos
You gotta deal with it
Expressing my aggression
Through confusion
Face reality
Nothing is like it used to be
Don't tell me, I don't know
You don't live in my war
Revolt and anger
I won't take it anymore
Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I'm from
Don't get me wrong
You don't know where I've been
Don't get me wrong
It's been a painful way
Don't get me wrong
You wouldn't understand
