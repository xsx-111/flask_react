Manifest LyricsFriday, October second, 1992
Chaos has descended in "Carandiru"
The biggest penitentiary complex in South America
Over a hundred inmates dead and hundreds injured on the massacre
The police arrived with helicopters
And over two hundred armed forces
They took the jailblock called "Pavilhao Nove"
And opened fire on the inmates
In a holocaust method of annihilation
The government of the city of Sao Paulo
Cannot control the brutality of its police
Holocaust, body piles
Confrontation, mutilation
Discipline, ignorance
Conflagration, torture
Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet
The bodies were filled with bullets
And bites from the police dogs
The police try to hide the massacre
Saying there were only eight deaths
The violence of Brazilian cops
Is very well known outside Brazil
This kind of extermination is a method that they use
To get rid of the overpopulation in the jails
The violence of the cops
Left the whole pavillion destroyed after the rebellion
"Pavilhao Nove" Embed
