Territory Lyrics
Unknown man speaks to the world
Sucking your trust, a trap in every word

War for territory
War for territory

Choice control behind propaganda
Poor information to manage your anger

War for territory
War for territory

Dictator's speech blasting off your life
Rule to kill the urge, dumb asshole's speech


Years of fighting, teaching my son
To believe in that man, racist human being
Racist ground will live, shame and regret
Of the pride you've once possessed
War for territory
War for territory
