Biotech Is Godzilla Lyrics
Rio Summit, '92
Street people kidnapped
Hid from view
"To save the earth"
Our rulers met
Some had other
Secret plans

No, no, no, no

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Say what?

Strip-mine the Amazon
Of cells of life itself
Gold rush for genes is on
Natives get nothing

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Is Godzilla
(Godzilla)

Mutations cooked in labs
Money-mad experiments
New food and medicine?
New germs and accidents!
Like Cubat√£o
"World's most polluted town"
Air melts your face
Deformed children all around

Bio-technology
Ain't what's so bad
Like all technology
It's in the wrong hands
Cut-throat corporations
Don't give a damn
When lots of people die
From what they've made

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Is AIDS
