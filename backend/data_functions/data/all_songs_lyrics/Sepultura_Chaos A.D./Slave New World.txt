Slave New World LyricsFace the enemy
Stare inside you
Control your thoughts
Destroy, destroy 'em all
You censor what we breathe
Prejudice with no belief
Senseless violence all around
Who is it that keeps us down?
Once all free tribes
Chained down, led lives
Blood boils inside me
We're not slaves, we're free
Face the enemy
Stare inside you
Control your thoughts
Destroy, destroy 'em allEmbed
