Propaganda LyricsWhy don't you get a life and grow up
Why don't you realize that you're fucked up
Why criticize what you don't understand
Why change my words, you're so afraid
You think you have the right to put me down
Propaganda hides your scum
Face to face, you don't have a word to say
You got in my way, now you'll have to pay
Don't, don't believe what you see
Don't, don't believe what you read
No!
I know my way, I'm here to stay
I didn't start all this yesterday
I'll prove you wrong all the way
Life teaches me you're always alone
Don't, don't believe what you see
Don't, don't believe what read
No!
I, I, I..............Embed
