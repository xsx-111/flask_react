Jesse James LyricsJesse James, we understand
Has killed him many a man
He robbed the Union trains
He stole from the rich
He gave to the poor
He had a hand and a heart and a brain
Well it was on Saturday night
The stars were shining bright
They robbed the Glendale train
And the people they did say
For many miles away
It was those outlaws Frank and Jesse James
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
Ah, but history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
Well it was Bob and Charlie Ford
Those dirty little cowards
I wonder how they feel
For they ate of Jesse's bread
They slept in Jesse's bed
They laid poor Jesse in his grave
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
Now history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
Well the people held their breath
They heard of Jesse's death
They wondered how he come to fall
Well it was Robert Ford in fact
Who shot him in the back
While he hung a picture on the wall
Now Jesse had a wife
Lived a lady all her life
Her children they were brave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave
But history does record
That Bob and Charlie Ford
Have laid poor Jesse, laid poor Jesse
Have laid Jesse James in his graveEmbed
