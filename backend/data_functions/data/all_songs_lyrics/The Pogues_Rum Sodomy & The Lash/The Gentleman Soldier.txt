The Gentleman Soldier LyricsIt's of a gentleman soldier
As a sentry he did stand
He saluted a fair maiden
By a waving of his hand
So then he boldly kissed her
And he passed it off as a joke
He drilled her up in the sentry box
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloak
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare thee well, Polly, my dear
I must be going away
All night they tossed and tumbled
'Till the morning did appear
The soldier rose, put on his clothes
And said "Farewell, my dear
For the drums are loudly beating
And the fifes they sweetly play
If it weren't for that, Polly, my dear
With you, I'd gladly stay"
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare thee well, Polly, my dear
I must be going away
"If anyone comes a courting you
You can treat them to a glass
If anyone comes a courting you
You can say you're a country lass
You don't have to tell them
That you ever played this joke
That you got drilled in a sentry box
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloak"
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare thee well, Polly, my dear
I must be going away
"Now come you, gentleman soldier
Won't you marry me?
Oh no, my dearest Polly
This thing can never be
For I've a wife already
Children, I have three
Two wives are allowed in the army
But one's too many for me"
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare thee well, Polly, my dear
I must be going away
"Oh come, my gentleman soldier
Why didn't you tell me so? Me parents will be angry
When this they come to know"
And when nine months had been and gone
The poor girl she brought shame
She had a little militia boy
And she didn't know his name
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare thee well, Polly, my dear
I must be going away
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap
And the fifes they loudly play
Fare thee well, Polly, my dear
I must be going awayEmbed
