The Classic Remains LyricsDo Monday, Tuesday, Saturday
You've moved two days in my diary
Although the fault's been corrected
The crossings out still remain
They're left as a token, a reminder of something
Something leftover, not that I object
Just something leftover
Did it erase the scandal, that was divisive?
Just grasped out of nothing
Just out of thin air
Not that it matters
I measure the return?
I don't mean it, I just pretend
Always did
Not that it matters, my something leftover
Has got to remind me of a previous incarnation
Of previous remains
