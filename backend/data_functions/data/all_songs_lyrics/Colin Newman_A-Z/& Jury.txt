& Jury LyricsI was in no mood at all when the message was passed to me
Sprinting for the situation, I'd planned for no such emergency
And I'm not usually involved, so this was a chance to see
The workings that are more than machine, I understand
That you are the judges too
If I was somewhat involved, or even implicated
Denials always futile, they only complicate it
But for a moment I felt a need to be closer to the reasons
And what I saw I can't describe, I understand
That we are the judges tooEmbed
