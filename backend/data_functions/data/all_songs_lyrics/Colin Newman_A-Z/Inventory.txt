Inventory LyricsI'm testing the temperature, one foot in the water
A splash makes me gnash my teeth in horror
Inventory, I should be wary
My needs are slighter, I should be brighter
I'm listing some adjectives which fill me with horror
Those in bold type, like ripe, like snipe
Like inventory, I should be wary
My needs are slighter, I should be brighter
I'm reading imaginary characters with motives
Which I should question, I should point out
Like inventory, I should be wary
My needs are slighter, I should be brighter
Like inventory, I should be wary
My needs are slighter, I should be brighter
Like inventory, I should be wary
My needs are slighter, I should be brighterEmbed
