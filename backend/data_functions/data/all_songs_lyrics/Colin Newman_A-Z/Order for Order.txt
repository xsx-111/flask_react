Order for Order LyricsBeware its worth
It stops at nothing
Madame, Messieurs
Read it in book
Order in order
A combined attack
I found you out
Not big effect
Whistle tune
Becoming sprightly by degrees
Rescinded its glory
Found only manners
Order for order
A spanner in the works
Left to be seen
Long way to go
We have that problem
Solved by incompetence
Writer by nature
Always in armourEmbed
