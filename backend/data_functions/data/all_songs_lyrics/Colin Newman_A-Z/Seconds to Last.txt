Seconds to Last LyricsAt a conference of one
I present my case
Freezing takes time, arson takes lives
The meeting adjourned to examine my biology
A home on a hilltop or a hole in the ground
My teeth were wired
I could hardly swallow
Now time seems suspended
My mouth was aching, my back was breaking
The tables turned, imagine!
My parts regrouped
I await this outcome
The grinding is stopped, the filing begins
I have to consider, I cannot decide
Some find disarray, some find misery
My fate decided, my attention divided
My seat reserved in a momentary diversion
Hung over in a cliff-hanger, yet still not losing grip
I seem excited, yet rarely satisfiedEmbed
