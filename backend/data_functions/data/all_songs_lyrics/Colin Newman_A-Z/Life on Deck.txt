Life on Deck LyricsI'm living a life on deck with no hands to help me
It's getting rather fruity up here
And I rather fancy the sea is getting an upper hand
Not mind we jolly jack tars
I'm in disgrace
The cat sat on the carpet
I just lay here like a lump
You'll never guess, I had this dream
It wasn't very likely
They're not what they used to beEmbed
