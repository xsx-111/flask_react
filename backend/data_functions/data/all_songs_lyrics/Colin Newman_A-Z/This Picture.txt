This Picture LyricsNo one
This picture pertaining to such entertainment
No thought of confinement, avoiding six figures
So don't respect strangers with no affectionate dressing
An act of caressing, don't just look at me
This picture containing each course, each stare
Each thought of escaping this picture oh dear
This picture performing to such adulation
No thought of belonging, avoiding six places
So don't mistake anger with no fixed emotion
An act of deploring shall catch me to die
This picture addressing each course, each why
Each thought of describing this picture oh dearEmbed
