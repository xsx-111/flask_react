Pale Horse LyricsPale horse songs of a slow decline
Sideshow words if the songs don't mind
A few more lines, 'the oil and the wine'
I thought I'd left that all behind
Pale horse vows in the sacred signs
Traded for an infinite aloneness to find
Wooden signs, helpful signs
Like 'imagination is important'
But how to fit your thoughts in mine?
Black horse reaping of the crops we grew
Comforted by sequences of sounds we knew:
'You abide in me, and I in you.'
But what exactly should I do?
Pale horse songs of a slow decline
Sideshow words if the boys don't mind
A few more songs, a few more lines
I thought I'd left that all behind
I thought I'd left that all behind5Embed
