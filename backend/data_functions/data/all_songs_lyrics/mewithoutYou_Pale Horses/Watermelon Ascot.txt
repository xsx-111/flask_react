Watermelon Ascot LyricsHere again the chords clash
Again the half-past
Carrie Nation cut glass
Prohibition children of the have caste
Dark bar/lack of concentration camp of self harm
Feel again the Dr. Bronner sermon on the soap jar
(moral ABC's, ect.)
Open as a bank vault
Focused on a passed fault
Not-named Lot's craned neck-salt
Another clay mouse thrown into a potter's house
Bait & switch hell pitch: Dutch Blitz
Venus of a Gem State
Cleaners of a blank slate
Of metamorphic straight-laced
Latter Day Saint-faced speed it up a knot
Feed: meat? no. Milk? no!
PAPER COW: May it be so
LIVING COW: Make it so!
Low in the burst of a red dwarfstar
No one on earth will know who we are
Blue ribbon pigs in a 4-H show
No one on earth must know
Quiet as the church-top lead roof thieves:
No one on earth must know
Custer in his stone-drunk Bighorn's rolled-up
Juliet shirtsleeves
No one on earth must know
No one on earth must know!
Counter-terror prophet in a watermelon ascot
Coriander manna in the mortar of a joke C.I.A
Beneath a Coatesville farm with incorruptible charm
We leaned ephemeral bones on everlasting arms
4-behavior-frontal-lobe-a-universal-product-code-of-iridescent-Joseph-coat-hallucination-H show
Low in the hearse after Red Cloud's War
No one on earth will know who we were
Buried in beds of regrets at the eight-straight-Buffalo show
No one on earth must know
What have I to dread, what have I to fear
Leaning on the everlasting arms;
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near
Leaning on the everlasting arms
O how bright the path grows from day to day
Leaning on the everlasting arms1Embed
