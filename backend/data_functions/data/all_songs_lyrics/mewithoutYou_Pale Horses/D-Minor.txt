D-Minor LyricsA borrowed fern with a cigarette burn
And a pawn shop ring in her hand
At the Idaho courts to affirm our divorce
Before the marriage began
In a celery boat singing triangle notes
To a horn from the military band
The spectreworks care of Pepper & Dircksâ€™
Bargain Ghost and Haunted Man
We awkwardly shielded the curious eyes
Of innocent pines from the forest floor
From the frying pan of a celibate man
To the fires of the premature
Who could ask for nothing more?
We're an unshrunk patch on a tear of the edge
We're an unshrunk patch on a tear of the edge
We're a campaign badge, the short-lived match
Of an unshrunk patch in the bellow's edge
On the iron lungs of our language
A by-now acquired a fern with a cigarette burn
In a basket with a (rectangle) note on the bedroom floor:
They repaired my fence, those bastards
I can't go back home no more
Save by a roundabout way, unto each day
Is sufficient misfortune thereof
With which to spend in proportion to your modest pay
While shopping around for a word like 'love.'
--With obedient trust as a babe in the womb
And impeccably chaste as a priest in the tomb
With a Deadwood map and a dynamite hat
I'll come back to Idaho soon
Harmless as a Danish cartoon
This is not the first time
This is not the first time G-d has died
This is not the first time
This is not the first time G-d has died
This is not the first time capitalized three lettered sound has died
This is not the first time
This is not the first time
Won't you help me get by?
Will you help me get by?
Won't you help me get by?
Will you help me get by?
Won't you help me get by?
Will you help me get by?2Embed
