Dorothy LyricsThe other night I dreamt I was back in college
There were boys in robes and sandals
They were singing songs to Krishna
Burning candles they would trade for money
You agreed to buy one cause you felt guilty
One turned into Sr. Margaret
I said "If you can change your shape that easily
Can you take the form of my dead father?
Because I think he would've liked to meet my wife"
And I know for a fact he would have liked my wife
Then last night I was in Maryland
With the singing and praying band
Joining in "Satan get behind me"
With ironic faithfulness
And a man looked almost exactly like Elliot
And satan turned to me: Have you thought much about that cry?
Eloi, Eloi
Have you thought much about that cry?
Have you thought much about that cry?
Have you thought much about that cry?
Have you thought much about that cry?
Have you thought much about that cry?
Eloi, Eloi
Eloi, Eloi
Lama sabachthani
Eloi, Eloi
Eloi, Eloi
Elliot Eloi Eloi.2Embed
