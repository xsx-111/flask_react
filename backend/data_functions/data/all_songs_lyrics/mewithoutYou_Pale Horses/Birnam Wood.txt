Birnam Wood LyricsAll dark effects I'd long withstood
Upon my room advanced
The moving shade of Birnam Wood
Disguised by broken branch
I struck firm the hollow of your thigh
Withheld my name, yet from determined hold I could not fly;
Though every tendon came undone
Would you take a bound-up Isaac's place?
"Are you a God and shall your grace
Grow weary of your saints?"
Or prefer the father's dreadful fate?
Are you a God, and shall your grace
Grow weary of your saints?
(Though every tendon came undone
Safe in the arms of the kingdom come)
Floodwater filled your formless birth
A column cloud descends
'Your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth
For then it hath no end'
Yet may my heart in tune be found
In four-shape notes from underground--
And can we not call it 'a nervous breakdown,'
My nervous system breaking down?
Would you take a bound-up Isaac's place?
Are you a God, and shall your grace
Grow weary of your saints?
Steady is a knife held sure by faith
Are you a God? And shall your grace
Grow weary of your saints?
Riding in a westbound railcar
They'll dump you in the Highgate Graveyard
Poison-in-the-teacup-graveyard alpha-radiation-graveyard
Come untie your little son
Before the angel comesEmbed
