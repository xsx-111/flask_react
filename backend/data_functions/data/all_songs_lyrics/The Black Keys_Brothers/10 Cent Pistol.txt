10 Cent Pistol Lyrics
Well, he ran around late at night
Holding hands and making light
Of everything that came before
But there she was behind the door

She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

There is nothing worse in this world
Than payback from a jealous girl
The laws of man they don't apply
When blood gets in a woman's eye

She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

Stars did fall, thunder rolled
Bugs crawled back, in their holes
The couple screamed, but it was far too late
A jealous heart, did retaliate
She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same3Embed
