Everlasting Light Lyrics
Let me be your everlasting light
The sun when there is none
I'm a shepherd for you
And I'll guide you through
Let me be your everlasting light

Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
I'll hold and never scold
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
In me you can confide
When no one's by your side
Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa) Yeah

Oh baby, can't you see?
It's shining just for you
Loneliness is over
Dark days are through
They are through
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
A train going 'way from pain
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
Love is the coal
That makes this train roll
Let me be your everlasting light
Yeah
Let me be-be your everlasting light
Let me be your everlasting light
Be your everlasting light
