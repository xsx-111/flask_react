Tighten Up Lyrics

I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you
Oh, what can I do? Yeah

Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true

Sick for days in so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how to get right
Yeah, it's out of sight

When I was young and movin' fast
Nothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass, I've come around
Oh come around, 'cause I've found
Livin' just to keep goin'
Goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin'
It's such a shame
I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel
I'm tellin' you to be ready
