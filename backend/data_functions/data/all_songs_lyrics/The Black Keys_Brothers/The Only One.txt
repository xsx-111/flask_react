The Only One Lyrics
Can't explain, nor can I contain
Control, you have on my soul
'Cause all I do is, baby, dream of you
I'm fallin' down, when you're around

You're the only one, you're the only one
I'm so wrapped up in a daze
Hopin' this is just a phase
But when all is said and done
I know you are still the one
You're the only one, you're the only one
Cupid's bow, it stung
Now you're the only one

Mystery is what this is to me
I'm givin' up, I'm having no luck
Like a ghost, the one that I love most
She disappears when I get near

You're the only one, you're the only one
I'm so wrapped up in a daze
Hopin' this is just a phase
But when all is said and done
I know you are still the one
You're the only one, you're the only one
Cupid's bow, it stung
Now you're the only one
O-o-only one, o-o-only one
O-o-only one, o-o-only one
O-o-only one, o-o-only one
O-o-only one, o-o-only one10Embed
