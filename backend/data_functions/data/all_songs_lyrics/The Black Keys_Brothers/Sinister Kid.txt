Sinister Kid Lyrics
Well, the crooks are out
And the streets are gray
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way
Your mother's words
They're ringin' still
But your mother don't
Pay our bills

A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me, that's me
The devil won't let me be

I got a tortured mind
And my blade is sharp
A bad combination
In the dark
If I kill a man
In the first degree
Baby would you
Flee with me?

A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me, that's me
The devil won't let me be3Embed
