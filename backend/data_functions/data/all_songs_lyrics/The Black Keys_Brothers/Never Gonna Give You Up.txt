Never Gonna Give You Up Lyrics
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Girl, you treat me bad and I know why
I've seen you runnin' around with another guy
And you think if you hurt me that I'll go away
But, I've made up my mind, you know I'm, I'm here to stay

Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Baby, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

Do you see these tears in my eyes?
Ain't no use in lyin' 'cause I really cried
You think you gonna take me and put me on the shelf
I would rather die than see you with somebody else
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Baby, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

Well, my friends all say that I'm your fool
And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool
I know their intentions they're all very good
Some of them would help me if they could

But I'm never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

Baby, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'5Embed
