Unknown Brother Lyrics
Though I never met you and we spoke not a word
I'll never forget you through stories that I've heard
For you, unknown brother, my baby's mother's pained
'Cause your soul is in heaven, but your memory remains

Unknown, unknown brother
I'll meet you someday
Unknown, unknown brother
We'll walk through fields where children play

Your eyes shined bright when you were a kid
Your sisters loved you and all that you did
Big brother, big brother, don't worry a bit
Your flame has not faded since the day it was lit

Your life was joy
Your mama's only boy
And when the skies are blue
Big brother, they're blue for you

We'll smile like pictures of you as a boy
Before you retired to heavenly joy
Unknown, unknown brother
I'll meet you someday
Unknown, unknown brother
We will walk through fields where children play4Embed
