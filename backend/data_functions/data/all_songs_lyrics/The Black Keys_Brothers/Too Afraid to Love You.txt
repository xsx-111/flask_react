Too Afraid to Love You Lyrics
My gears they grind
More each day
And I feel like
They are going to grind away
And the city blocks
They drive me wild
They're never ending
Mile after mile

I just don't know what to do
I am too afraid to love you

It's heaven on earth
It's in her embrace
Her gentle touch
And her smilin' face
I am just one wishin'
That I was a pair
With someone
Oh somewhere
I just don't know what to do
I am too afraid to love you

All those sleepless nights
And all those wasted days
I wish loneliness would leave me
But I think it's here to stay
What more can I do
'Cause I'm wringin' myself dry
And I cannot afford to lose
One more teardrop from my eye
Whoa

I'm too afraid
I'm too afraid
I just don't know what to do
With myself
Thinkin' all the time
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Drivin' me outta my mind8Embed
