Dust on Trial Lyrics
I'll always be here
To hear your words
And give you everything
That you deserve
I'll always be here
To hold your hand
And walk you to
The promised land
Will you walk this land with me?

And what's the point of talking
If all your words have been said?
When a world can crumble
And the soil leaks red
A land of pure confusion
Known only to the wise
Where satisfaction is devoured
Dominated and despised

Just
One
Step
Closer to me
Closer to me
Closer to me
Closer to me
Closer and closer and closer
Closer and closer and closer
Closer and closer and closer
Closer and closer and closer
Closer to meEmbed
