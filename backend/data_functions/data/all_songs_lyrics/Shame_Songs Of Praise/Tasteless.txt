Tasteless Lyrics
Cut out the commodities
An internal crisis glued to an egos need
Well it's fucked
Well it's fucked
Well it's fucked
Well you're just out of luck
Distorted by distance
Indulged in gluttony by the frogs of France
That's racist
That's racist
How tasteless
How tasteless
How tasteless can you be

It's over before it began
It's over before it began

Mismanaged statistics
Help you place the safest bet, you see
Pick me
Pick me
Pick me
Pick me
Well I'm worth wasting
Try another technique
Sodomy had a place in the past
But now it's fashionable
Nothing new
Nothing new
Nothing new
Un-peel the glue
Un-peel the glue
It's over before it began
It's over before it began

I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around (not around)
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not around
I like you better when you're not aroundEmbed
