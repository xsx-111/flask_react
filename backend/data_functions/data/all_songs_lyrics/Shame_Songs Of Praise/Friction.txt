Friction Lyrics
Do you ever help the helpless?
Do you give them any time?
Do you ever bully your conscience?
And detach from your mind
Do you ever need the needy?
Do they ever tug on your heart?
Or do you determine the person in question is simply worlds apart?

Do you ever wish to the wishful?
Do you ever get what you need?
Do you detach from necessity and apply the act of greed?
Do you ever dream with the dreamers?
Do you ever weaken the weak?
Do you over use the technique of not thinking before you speak?

You say it's going forwards
But I feel it flowing backwards
In a time of such injustice
How can you not want to be heard?
And I'm trying to exist
In a momentary cyst
And I'm trying to exist
In a momentary cyst
It's only friction
It's only friction
It's only friction
It's only friction
And do you ever worry the worried?
Do you ever want to be heard?
Do you motivate the motion of achieving what you don't deserve?
Do you consume the consumer?
Do you listen to the song?
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?

You say it's going forwards
But I feel it flowing backwards
In a time of such injustice
How can you not want to be heard?
And I'm trying to exist
In a momentary cyst
And I'm trying to exist
In a momentary cyst
It's only friction
It's only friction
It's only friction
It's only friction

Do you ever get what you want dear?
Do you ever get what you need?
Do you ever get what you want dear?1Embed
