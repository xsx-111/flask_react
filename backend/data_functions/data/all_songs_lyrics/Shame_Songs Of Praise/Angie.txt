Angie Lyrics
Well there she swings
Before the banshee
Her skirt does sing
The notes of Angie
I'm not a man
But that’s ok
Cause my baby swings
From night till day

Her skirt was silk
Her skin was stained
In all my dreams
She still remains
She lies untouched
Innocent and pure
My only hope
My only cure

I’ll let my flesh wear thin
Have my hair fade and fall
Just so once more
I can feel your skin
Confined in soil walls
For this life it serves no purpose
Without your sweet embrace
And now no angels roam this land
You’ll never be replaced
I'll see you soon
Up where you lie
Under the moon
Above the sky
Scratch me away
Out of your skin
Still to this day
I hear your skirt sing

I took her down
And there she lay
Her face stained brown
No notes to play
Well there she swings
Before the banshee
Her skirt does sing
The notes of Angie
From night till day
From night till day
My baby swings
From night till day

I'll see you soon
Up where you lie
Under the moon
Above the sky
Scratch me away
Out of your skin
Still to this day
I hear your skirt sing
Well I know you could do better
And I know you could do worse
Build a latex box to drown in
And bathe in the absurd
Deep fry your feelings so they can't escape
Disappear into nothing
And find your happy place
Find your happy place

I'll cut you down
I'll hold your face
And we will stay
In your happy place
In your happy place1Embed
