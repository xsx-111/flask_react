Donk Lyrics
Two, three, four

I had a dream
Just like Mr. King
You were there too
Dressed only in blue
Go!

And I love the way you love to take
Such comfort in yourself
And I hate the way you hate to take
Notice about your health
Well I'd like to pick you up
But I would rather watch you crawl
Well I'd love to pick you up
But I would rather watch you fall
Go!Embed
