King of the Road LyricsTrailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road
Third boxcar, midnight train
Destination Bangor, Maine
Old worn out suits and shoes
I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found
Short but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road
I know every engineer on every train
All of the children and all of their names
Every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around
I sing
Trailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road
Trailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushin' broom
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means by no means king, of the road
Trailer for sale or rent
Rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no petsâ€¦Embed
