Then I Met You LyricsThought that I'd be happy
Going to be so happy
Living life alone and never sharing anything
Thought that I was finished
Thought that I was complete
Thought that I was whole instead of being half of something
Thought that I was growing
Growing older, wiser
Understanding why this world held nothing for my spirit
Thought that I was destined
Destined to be nothing
Destined to be nothing in this world and then I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
Thought that God had failed me
Thought my prayers were useless
Thought that he would never get the chance for me to praise him
Thought the book was written
Thought the game had ended
Thought the song was sung and I could never sing another
Thought my faith was misplaced
Thought my back was broken
Broken by a weight that I was never fit to carry
I thought I knew this city
Thought I knew all about it
And then one night I went to Morningside and you were waiting
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
Thought that I'd be happy
Going to be so happy
Living life alone and never sharing anything
Thought that I was finished
Thought that I was complete
Thought that I was whole instead of being half of something
Thought that I was growing
Growing older, wiser
Understanding why this world held nothing for my spirit
Thought that I was destined
Destined to be nothing
Destined to be nothing in this world and then I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met you
I met youEmbed
