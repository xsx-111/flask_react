Oh Jean LyricsI'd never been lucky with girls I confess
Don't know who to blame for my lack of success
Cause even with ones up the back of a bus
There was always the risk of a slap in the puss
But Jean, Oh Jean, You let me get lucky with you
Oh Jean, Oh Jean, You let me get lucky with you
The first time I met you it did cross my mind
The next time I saw you there wasn't the time
The third time I saw you I thought that I could
The fourth time I met you I knew that I would
Oh Jean, Oh Jean, you let me get lucky with you
Oh Jean, Oh Jean, you let me get lucky with you
Love her, I love her, I love her
Love her, I love her, I love her
Love her, I love her, I love her
Love her, I love her, I love her
I want you forever I want you for good
So I'm gonna treat you the way that I should
For your soul and body my heart's gonna pound
Even after the day that I'm laid in the ground
Cause Jean, Oh Jean, you let me get lucky with you
Oh Jean, Oh Jean, you let me get lucky with you
Love her, I love her, I love her
Love her, I love her, I love her
Love her, I love her, I love her
Love her, I love her, I love her
Love her I love her I love her I love
Love her I love her I love her I love
Love her I love her I love her I love
Love her I love her I love her I love
Oh Jean, Oh Jean, you let me get lucky with you
Oh Jean, Oh Jean, you let me get lucky with youEmbed
