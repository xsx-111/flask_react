Sugar Box Lyrics
Lips like sugar
Sugar box

Since the day you walked into my dream
I have felt an older side revealed
Taking me and standing way above
Making me dishonest with your love

'Cause I was always far too lonely to believe
You could want me back now, prey
And it was always second chances I received
Don't you want me back now, prey

Learning sometimes takes a little time
Holding out and hoping that it's mine
Falling out and falling in between
Turn myself around myself I see

'Cause I was always far too lonely to believe
You could want me back now, prey
And it was always second chances I received
Don't you want me back now
Ah, sugar box
Lips like sugar
Sugar, sugar box
Ah, lips like sugar
Sugar box

Burning with the hurting of a child
Crying out and hoping that it's mine
Sliding out and drifting on away
I'll turn myself around once in this game

'Cause I was always far too lonely to believe
You could want me back now
Prey, prey
And it was always second chances I received
Don't you want me back now
Ah, ah, ah, ah, sugar box

Ah, she's got lips like sugar
Sugar box, she says
Lips like sugar, sugar boxEmbed
