Darkest Hour LyricsSo lonely on your own
So hard to be alone
I know you were once before
Someone came and opened up the door
And then out you flew
Out you flew and all you saw
Was someone standing with their dreams
Run, run away
In your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance for you
Suddenly it?s changed
You opened up and find
Something deep inside that tells you
You were the fool to lend yourself
To such amusing games
Take yourself and make your name
And leave you there without your dreams
Run, run away
In your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance you?ll see, run away
In your darkest hour
I will be the only one who knows
Just how to scold you and to say run
In the darkness
And now it?s come to pass
And now we?re here at last
I know you sometimes think of me
I know a foolish child would scream
It?s hard to think and hold you tight
It?s hard to be unbending when there?s
Everything you?ve stripped from me
So run, run away
'Cause in your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
The only chance for you, run on
In your darkest hour
I will be the only one who knows
Just how to hold you once again, run on
In the darkness, run on
Ooh, shattered dreams, run on
In your darkest hour
I will be the only one who?s left with you
The only one for you, run on
In your darkest hour
I will be the only one to send relief
Only chance for you, run on, and on, and on
In the darkness, run on
Ooh, in the darkness, oh, noEmbed
