What Does It Take? LyricsWell, I don't know if I'm wasting my time
Everyday you're getting harder to find
Makes me wonder if it's all in my mind
But it keeps me hanging on
Ooh, yeah
Hey!
You keep saying you're doing your best
Still your east don't meet my west
So I take a look around
Compare you to the rest
But it keeps me hanging on
Hey, what does it take to break through?
To make your earth move
(If I could live)
Hey, what does it take to reach you?
What do I have to prove?
If I could live in the moment with you
What would I do?
And you with your mass serenade
Love everybody, you remember their names
To them you are a vision
A dancer in the rain
To you they're all the same
Hey, what does it take to break through?
To make your earth move
(If I could live)
Hey, what does it take to reach you?
What do I have to prove?
If I could live in the moment with you
Don't you want me?
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do?
What do I have to do
To make your earth move?
What do I have to do?
Hey, what does it take to break through?
To make your earth move
(If I could live)
Hey, what does it take to reach you?
What do I have to prove?
If I could live in the moment with you
Hey, don't you want me?
(If I could live)
Hey, what does it take to reach you?
Don't you want me?
Hey, what does it take?
What does it take?
Don't you want me?
(If I could live in the moment with you)Embed
