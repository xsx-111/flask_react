You Ought To Know Lyrics
You ought to know by now
Hey!
You ought to know by now

Someone you knew before
Was fool enough to take their chance with you
But I know
Well I could have told you so
In spite of all I've learned, I still
Found out that woman used me

Ooh it was a long time ago
I'm still in the shadow
Of your laughter
It's commonplace
In this kind of life
With all the good times
That I wasted
I'm sure to find
That it comes to light

The tears you cry alone
Are so private
I know they burn, don't they?
Yeah!
Ooh and the shadow of your love
So warm at night I still found out
That's not the answer
And though it was a long time ago
I'm still in the shadow
(You ought to know by now)
Of your laughter
(You ought to know by now)
It's commonplace
(You ought to know by now)
In this kind of life
(You ought to know by now)
All the good times
(You ought to know by now)
That I'm facing
(You ought to know by now)
I'm sure to find
(You ought to know by now)
I'm sure to find
(You ought to know by now)
Another place to hide
(You ought to know by now)

No!
Hey! Takes me so long girl
(You ought to know by now)
(You ought to know)
(You ought to know by now)
All the shadow
(You ought to know by now)
Of your past life
(You ought to know by now)
Have come today
(You ought to know by now)
And that it's come to light
(You ought to know by now)
With all the good times
(You ought to know by now)
That I've wasted
(You ought to know by now)
I'm sure to find
(You ought to know by now)
I'm sure to find
(You ought to know by now)
Another place to hide
(You ought to know by now)

Oh!
All the shadows
(You ought to know by now)
Of your laughter
(You ought to know)
Come to today
(You ought to know)
That it's come to light
(You ought to know by now)
All the shadows
You ought to know by nowEmbed
