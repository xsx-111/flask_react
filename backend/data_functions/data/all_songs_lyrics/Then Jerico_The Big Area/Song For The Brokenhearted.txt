Song For The Brokenhearted Lyrics
A thousand kisses in the night
Can't deny your heart's desire
Never reach the point of silence

She's been kissing everyone
Forgive me I'm not that strong
I dive into the arms of fury

And when your darkness comes
You still have to face tomorrow

This is a song for the brokenhearted
When all my thoughts return to you
You'll regret what you started here
Ooh, my love

Someone told me yesterday
How our lovе had gone astray
I've nevеr seen the point of silence

And there's something happened, I was told
Love so warm can run so cold
And turn into a violent fury
And when your darkness comes
You still have to face the sorrow

Now, this is a song for the brokenhearted
When all my songs belong to you
You'll regret what you started here

This one's for you
Run until your heart's afire
Oh-oh, ha-ha-ha, ooh
This one's for you
Yeah!
This is the song for you
My love

Oh, this is the song for the brokenhearted
When all my thoughts return to you
You'll regret what you started
Oh, my love

This is the song, that one for the brokenhearted
When all my songs belong to you
You'll regret what you started
Oh, my love
This is the song for you
My love
This one's for you
This one's for you
This is the song for you
My lost and lonely
This one's for you This one's for youEmbed
