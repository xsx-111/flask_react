Lethal Dosage LyricsI am the sin of man
I ..... so just let me out
I'll be back again
I see through the cracks
To pollute the soil in which you stand
I contaminate what you grow
To be inside of you again
Fertilizing your seed
I've got a riddle for you
I'f you're wise, you'll listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
