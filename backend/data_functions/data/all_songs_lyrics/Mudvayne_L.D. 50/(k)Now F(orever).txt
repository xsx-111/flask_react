(k)Now F(orever) Lyrics
Frozen moments in time, stopped hourglass
They predicate, what you will know
Dispositions lie within
And so do we
Don't want to run, don't want to hide
Renounce the prayers for inspiration
If you dictate what I will be
Then smash my face upon the concrete, I'm weary
I feel the stares piercing
So sorry to soil your precious eyes
Reflections spoon-feed you
The bitterness and disgust that is me

If you choose to reach out to lend to me
I'll chew off your hand

I'm not beggin' for your fuckin' change
I'm not beggin' for your fuckin' change
I'm in touch with myself
All alone within myself

All one, alone
All one, alone
All one, alone
All one, alone
Do what you will, make it the whole of your law
Burn down the faith that shadows life
And take a deeper look inside of what makes you
Pull down the shades, internal light can be blinding, brilliance

I'm not begging for your fuckin' change
I'm just begging for a fuckin' change
Complacence quenched of me
Lineage is ending

I am that, once was me
Rising upward, guts wrenching
Sculpted cold, blistering
Break the mold, sever me
Cut your throat, be the martyr
Bitter pills, that we swallow
Take me, chase me
Swallow with me
Know, now
Know, now
Inside of truth, coming to
Close to me, ground consumes and embraces me
Born again, I'm repositioning
Self inside to self non-dimensional
Lost to being, I've recognized the cause
Existence to come, alive now forever
Born again, I'm repositioning
Self inside to self non-dimensional
Lost to being, I've recognized the cause
Existence to come, alive now forever
I am once was, I am once was
I am once was, I am once was
That is me
I am once was, I am once was
I am once was
That is me
I'm broken altered vacillating force
Round square corners circles dance around wet figures
Prisoner of time I'm no more
Insight will guide us through the majesty of nothing
It's like I'm touched with love by angel girl
Let bastards rot in time for all their evil
Let bastards rot in time for all their evil
Let bastards rot in time

I'm not beggin' for your fuckin' change
I'm not beggin' for your fuckin' change
I found my own place
Tame within my own space
Know forever1Embed
