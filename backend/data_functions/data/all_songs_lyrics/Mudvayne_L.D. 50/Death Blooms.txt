Death Blooms Lyrics
Cold seems crippling
Lame meander through corridors
Aroma's thick with age
Mark off the day

Reflections of my life are fading
Pull me out of body
Don't want it
Don't want in
Feeble, frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in a structure
That's collapsing
Don't want it
Cast into
Maker take the body
Don't want, it wants me

Past has found its place
Salvation is no more
Will god accept my peace?
Bleach will pardon me
Reflections of my life are fading
Pull me out of body
Don't want it
Don't want in
Feeble, frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in a structure
That's collapsing
Don't want it
Cast into
Maker take the body
Don't want, it wants me

I just want to run
Fly kites, wrestle, jump and play
Swim through waves that crash to shore
Memories in me, cocooned in misery

I'm sick and tired
Of embracing reflections of past time
Receive me or cast me away
God, please take me away
Resistance futile, suicidal ideas
I will crucify my own being
Satisfy selfish needs, fuck the deities
Justify my own right to what's waiting for me
On the other side, the time has come
Lock and load
I'm coming (I'm coming)
I'm coming (I'm coming)
I'm coming (I'm coming)
I'm coming, I'm coming home
Pull me out of body
Don't want it, don't want in
Pull me out of body
Don't want it, don't want in
Pull me out of body
Don't want it, don't want in
Feeble, frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in a structure
That's collapsing
Descending, don't want it
Maker take the body
Don't want
It wants me
Pull me out of body
Don't want it, don't want in
Feeble, frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in a structure
That's collapsing
Descending, don't want it
Maker take the body
Don't want
It wants me
I just want to run
Fly kites, wrestle, jump and play
Swim through waves that crash to shore
Memories in me, cocooned in misery

The darkness overcomes
Soul soars to the other plane
Existence past the door
I sail through purgatory's bay

I asked a god for poison, cradle me
Sown to my dreams, souls searching
Death blossoms where clouds lie over me
Held in God's hands, death blooming
Dark for fear of failure
An inner gloom as wide as an eye and fermenting
Roiling hate
Death grip in my veins
Unveiling rancid petals flowering forth foul nectar
The space between a blink and a tear
Death blooms1Embed
