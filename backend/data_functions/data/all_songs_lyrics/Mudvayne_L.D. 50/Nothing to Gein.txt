Nothing to Gein Lyrics
Cold and silent, soiled face I will wash it all away
With my love, that's all she's ever needed from me
It's my time, to mother
One of my own, in my life
I am so alone, left with no one
In my life, I'm so alone

Life submissiveness
Hypnotizing the ignorant
A little boy's best friend's always his mother
At least that's what she said
Life of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
I'm just a soiled dirty boy, just a soiled dirty boy

Sheltered life, innocence
Insulated memories, spark reflections of my head
Duality in my consciousness
Caught in the war of hemispheres between the love lost in my head

Mommy, do you still live inside of me?
I'm so lost in my life without any guiding
Protected me my whole life from everything
Nailed shut the doors to the shrine
To screen your dead eyes from me and my sickness
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face
Deliver the remains from her womb of earth
Prep the rack and tie up for new love's rebirth
Covert understanding of novice surgery
I'll focus concentration and only take just what I need

For sickness I'm masticating
Dancing and masturbating
Celebrate in fields of night
With skin upon my face

Life submissiveness
Hypnotizing the ignorant
A little boy's best friend's always his mother
At least that's what she said
Life of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless

Life submissiveness
Hypnotizing the ignorant
A little boy's best friend's always his mother
At least that's what she said
Life of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
I'm so soiled
If I soak my hands in others blood, am I sick?
If I wash my hands in others blood, am I sick?
If I drench myself in others blood, am I sick?
If I bathe myself in others blood
Blame mother for the sickness
Mutilate and sew my new clothes for masquerading
Aprons of flesh corpse scalped hair with skin upon my face
Dance and masturbate in night light by myself
Nothing is left for me to gain
They're coming to take me far away
Nothing is left for me to gain
They're coming to take me far away
Nothing is left for me to gain
They're coming to take me far away
Nothing is left for me to gain
They're coming to take me far away

Life submissiveness
Hypnotizing the ignorant
A little boy's best friend's always his mother
At least that's what she said
Life of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
Life submissiveness
Hypnotizing the ignorant
A little boy's best friend's always his mother
At least that's what she said
Life of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
I'm so soiled

Life of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
I'm so soiled
Life of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
I'm so soiled
