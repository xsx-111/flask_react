Cradle Lyrics
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Push, push, push, push

I lost you, you were my god
Thought "what do I do now"
You were never there for me
Never there to carry me
26 years looking back that time is gone
It was you I believed in
Look what you've done to me
Realize what you've done to me

I can't bleed
I can't bleed
I wanna break
For the life that walked away from me
I can't see going on
In this darkness I'm blind
Beneath my cradle the bough has broke
I exorcise my loss, your lie, the punishment

It takes time
To try to mend the wounds of all the suffering
What do I do now
It's all I'm asking from you please
Send me a sign to
Guide me through the times that lie in front of me
I'll get by
Myself
Look at me now, a piece of shit like you
Look at me now, you left me so fuck you
Look at me now, a piece of shit like you
Look at me now, you left me so fuck you
Everybody leaves me
Everybody's gone
Watch my father leave me
There's nobody left (Feels like I've never been loved)
Everybody leaves me
Never gave a shit about me
Everybody's gone
I'll rot in my head alone
Everybody leaves me (I don't give a fuck about you)
(Go the fuck away)
(I don't give a fuck about you)
Never gave a shit about me (Go the fuck away)
Everybody's gone (I don't give a fuck about you)
(Go the fuck away)
(I don't give a fuck about you)
I'll rot in my head alone (Go the fuck away)
Fucking cocksucker
Fake being
Inside of my heart, you are the liar
Innocence displaced
Institutionalized in my own life, been left
Here I stand now and I'm alone
With no one to comfort me
One set of footprints in the sand
No one to take my hand, I'll
I'll walk through as long as I need
I'll drift through my life though I'm alone
Outgrown the cradle that once housed me
And I've found that all I need is

Me, me, me, me

Found I've never needed you
To push through
All the shit that stacks up inside of my life
Endless plight that circulates through my body
I'll keep stumbling, beating, pummeling
Teething on the rind and renounce my being
I can't see going on
I can't see going on
I can't see going on
I can't see going on
I can't see
I'm too tired
I can't see
I can't see going on
I'm so tired
Of trying to mend the wounds of all my suffering
What do I do now?
It's all I'm asking from you please
Send me a sign
To guide me through the times that lie in front of me
I'll get by
Myself

I can't see going on, fuck it
I can't see going on, fuck it
I can't see going on, fuck it
I can't see going on, fuck it3Embed
