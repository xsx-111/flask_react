Prod Lyrics
Emotions inside us, troubling
The hatred inside us, escalating
The sickness inside us, keeps you weak
The masses inside of us, suffering, they are bleeding
The calling inside us, sick with greed
The voices calling to us, deafening, we're not listening

Cannot receive the obvious
Line up cattle and cut the necks
Swat at the flies, omit disgust

The leaders inside us, posturing
The pollution inside of us, suffocating me
The science inside us, menacing
The will that's inside of us, it's dying, end is coming

Cannot receive the obvious
Line up cattle and cut the necks
Drain us of life and cleanse the mess

Cleanse the mess, cleanse the mess
Cleanse the mess, cleanse the mess
Wash me off inside
Wash me off inside
We're killing ourselves, we're killing ourselves
We're killing ourselves, killers
God damn, we fucked up the circumstance
Too late to save us from ourselves
Callous minds against trust and confidence
Too late to give a damn now
Too late to save us from ourselves
Too late to make it all go away
Too late to beg pardons from the mother
Too late to give a damn
It's too late to save us from ourselves
It's too late to make it all go away
It's too late to beg pardons from the mother
It's too late to give a damn now we'll sit and wait
Wait, wait, wait for the coming of the end
Wait for the coming, the killing, the ending, the plight of man
Deserving no mercy expelling by god's hand
It's okay, the ending, it's over, no more pain
No more pain, no more pain
Emotion, the hatred, the sickness, the calling

Cannot receive the obvious
Line up cattle and cut the necks
Swat at the flies, omit disgust
Drain us of life and cleanse the mess1Embed
