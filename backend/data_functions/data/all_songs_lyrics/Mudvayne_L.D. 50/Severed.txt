Severed LyricsAnd we hide behind
Lies, anger, Hate they shoo love away
Build shells of ourselves outside
It shelters body from cold reigns of reality
Come on, Step out, of your rind, assemble strength, focus
Release and run to me you can never look back to the visions from the
Past they fade and wilt in time
You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through
Then I turn and walk away
(Chorus)
Eclipse you (Cut you away)
And bleed you strip you of your states of ain soph aur
Eclipse you (Cut you away)
I spit up on my plate and I push everything away
From me
And we sever all ties
It creates disruption midst circle of friends
I become the sacrifice
Spare your life and leave me to my misery
Get off the cross, and save yourself, run away
Run now get away from me if I can get my grip I'll pull you down into
The
Hell I call my head you'll never get away
I sit down in my ugly place and build walls out of fragments from my
Past of all the people that I needed and loved that walked away
You've got to just trust me to hold your hand through then I'll turn
And walk away
I walk under the clouds of gray
Sphere of storms in my head
I'm trapped again in endless rain
I divorce the thoughts of you I love with me
I divorce your innocence and my guilt
I divorce the lying sellout confidence
I'm divorcing every mother fuckin' thing
I divorce the love bled meaningless
I divorce the makeshift harmony
I divorce the taunting acts of violence
I divorce the pastime of jealousy
I divorce control
I divorce the faith
I divorce the virtue
I divorce the rain
I divorce the excuse
I divorce the greed
I divorce the need
I divorce iniquity in this mother fuckin' bullshit life
Just want it all to go away
Just want to run away to die, take it, myself, my life
Text book fucking mental, off me and pitch me in a hole
I'll always be your shadow
And veil your eyes from states of ain soph aur
I can't be the hero anymore
I spit up on my plate and then I turn and walk away
I spit up on my plate and I disrupt the family
I spit up on my plate and I sever the entity
And I feel your warm sun on my face
Separate
(Chorus)
Eclipse you and bleed you strip you of your states of ain soph
Aur
I need you
It's always been this way, I push it all away
