Losses, losers and more
Gain of life's pleasures, cohorts listen behind the doors
To a life sheltered in, less than zero in me
All my walls falling down, pains aloft, misery
I'm sure that the lessons were learned
I'm sure that the punishments went well deserved
By the pawn in the plan, taste of shit, bitterness
Walk from me, everything systematically

Come on
You're the one, you're the one
To dredge up shit inside of me
In my pointless life of nothing
(Tell me) What I'm supposed to be
(Tell me) Who I'm supposed to be
(Tell me) What it takes to ascend
(Tell me) What it takes to live

Patience, pleasures and rewards
Come in due time, stare at the sun, I'm bored
In a life meaningless soaking up all of me
Like the cross, you worship, life is loss, look at me
I'm sure that some day we'll wake up
I'm sure that some day we'll wake from the dream
Of success and focus, tunneling to the light
Glowing deep inside of me, your taunting, I wake UP
Come on
You're the one, you're the one
To dredge up shit inside of me
In my pointless life of nothing
(Tell me) What I'm supposed to be
(Tell me) Who I'm supposed to be
(Tell me) What it takes to ascend
(Tell me) What it takes to live

Tell me now
Tell me now

Pain, misery, distress, dismal
Know where, depressed, idiot, failure
Loser in me, loser, who I am
Loser in me
Don't feel sorry
Don't feel sorry for me
Don't need your sympathy or empathy
Don't need your sympathy inside of me
Don't need your sympathy or empathy
Don't need your sympathy inside of me
Don't feel sorry
Don't feel sorry for me
Come on
I know you're the one, you're the one
Numb to feelings inside of me
Why I've seized my vision
Don't need you to tell me what to be
Don't need you to tell me who to be
Don't need you to tell me how to ascend
Don't need you to tell me how to liveEmbed
