Under My Skin Lyrics
Nailed inside my head
Fuck this, I don't need your shit
All the lies deceit and arrogance
Talk your shit like my life is some kinda game
Like you fuckin' know me
Just go far away and be small
Run far away and be small
Go lie in a hole and be small

(Thorns) So you want inside of me
(Splinters) So you want a piece of this
(Pushing) So you want to tear me down
(Under my skin) For your own selfish wants and needs
So you want inside of me (They want in)
So you want a piece of this (Sharpened tongue)
So you want to tear me down (To penetrate me)
For your own selfish wants and needs

If you really think
You got what it takes to be me (to penetrate me)
Then walk a mile in the skin
Of my head case mental being (to penetrate me)
So you want a piece
Of this life that belongs to me (to penetrate me)
Well make a cut on the line
And take a deeper look inside of the freak (to penetrate me)
That is me
Fucker, come on

(Disturb) So you want inside of me
(Searching) So you want a piece of this
(Prying) So you want to tear me down
(Upon my scales) For your own selfish wants and needs
So you want inside of me (To get in)
So you want a piece of this (Lance the core)
So you want to tear me down (To penetrate me)
For your own selfish wants and needs

If you really think
You got what it takes to be me
Then walk a mile in the skin
Of my head case mental being
So you want a piece
Of this life that belongs to me
Well make a cut on the line
And take a deeper look inside of the freak

You're under my skin, fuck
Fucking punk ass
Rip
You're under my fucking skin
You were there like a punk
Just to get in my face
Wanted in me, wanted to be
'Til I gave you a taste
Don't need your goddamn pressure
Frontin' stress, I'm Superman motherfucker
Without the "S" on my chest
Trying to step in my circle I'm leaving you purple and black
On your back, drop your ass like a heart attack
Rippin' through your life like a motherfuckin' hurricane
Fist full of Novocain for the pain
You're nothing
In my life
In my head
You're nothing
In my life
In my head
Nailed inside my head
You're under my fuckin' skin
I have cleansed my life now of the people who pry
And threaten place always in my face
I think it's time for them to
Go away always in my fuckin' space
Always in my scene always in my sight
Always in my way, you're
Dead to me
Punk ass fuck
If you really think
You got what it takes to be me
Then walk a mile in the skin
Of my head case mental being
So you want a piece
Of this life that belongs to me
Well make a cut on the line
And take a deeper look inside of the freak

If you really think
You got what it takes to be me
Then walk a mile in the skin
Of my head case mental being
So you want a piece
Of this life that belongs to me
Well make a cut on the line
And take a deeper look inside of the freakEmbed
