Internal Primates Forever LyricsCop provisions feed my addictions mistakes I made then
I opened up the holes and they crawled in
Now when it's time for the feed they won't let me forget
They ride upon my back and they'll fuck me with their need
My invisible enemies all my monkeys
They're coming, they're coming, they're coming, they're coming to take me
Away
Disgusted with my position so submissive I am the only way we get
Away is give in sharpen up the razors stab the needles into pipes to
Kill cravings so sick of this in me can't stand the want to need
Can't get free always got a grip on me
There's no use to fight this wrenching tourniquet of deprivation
Obedience subservience leads to substance
Give it to me, give it to me
Leave my motivation to chemical dependency no room for patience
Don't want it need it come on right now

Everything I've become now is everything I didn't want to be
Every time I try to run away I fall on my face they drag me back
Every time I try to run away I fall on my face
Help! They won't leave me alone
If I would have known back then what I know now I 'd take it back
If I would have known back then what I know now I 'd take it
Back
I'd take it back I'd take it all fuckin' back
Stay away stay away
Hold me I'm shaking violently
Pull me out of my covering
Mold me into a new man
Lull me into a deep sleep
There's no use to fight this wrenching tourniquet of deprivation
Obedience subservience leads to substance
Even if you want you can't stop
