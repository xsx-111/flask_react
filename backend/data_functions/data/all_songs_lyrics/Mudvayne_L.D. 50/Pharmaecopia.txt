Pharmaecopia LyricsDoes your god come in a capsule
To sedate you tear the walls down
Headless prison cannibals chew
To consume you bring the alien
Halcium and morphine
5-methoxy-n, n-dimethyltryptamine
Psilocybin, mescaline, aspirin, histomine
Brushite, darvaset, valium, caffeine, cannabis, and LSD
Ayahuasca, harmine give it all to me I want it
These are just a few of my favorite things X 2
Trisolam and xanex, serotonin, mdma, ibogaine, dopeamine
Tetra-hydro-chloride, atenolol
Amanita muscaria
Boric oxide, arrabinitol, psilocin, and flamizine
Cylotec and harmaline
Give it all to me I want it
Does your god come in a capsule to sedate you
Tear the walls down, headless prison
Cannibals chew to consume you
Bring the alien
Does your god come, want to take me to sedate you
Build the walls around mindless prison
Don't you run, chew to consume you
Kill the alien
Kill the alien
Kill your alien
Kill your alien
You can't kill me
I'm already dead
Inside my hole
Inside my head
We just beg for any way to be sedated
It's all about escaping
Numb to me
Numb body from this hell
I can feel them pushing, I can feel them pulling
I can feel them holding, I can feel them moving
I can feel them prying, I can feel them prodding
I can feel them breathing, I can feel them digging
I can feel them stabbing, I can feel them scoping
I can feel them living, I can feel it
Consume, take in, plunging, plumbing
Instruments prying, aliens inside me
Tooling the machine
Intoxicating
Feel it unfolding, riddles in me
It's all about escaping, we just beg for any way to get away
Who do you bow down to, does your god come in a capsule or on a plate
They're trying to sedate you, swallow self and bring on the alien
You tried to kill me, I'm already dead to this world
I'm already dead to this worldEmbed
