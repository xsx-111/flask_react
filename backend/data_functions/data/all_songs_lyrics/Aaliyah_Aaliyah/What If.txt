What If Lyrics
What if every guy I saw
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place
(What if) was all up in my face
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if

I hate a jealous man, one who doesn't understand
That I'm attractive, so of course men wanna take my hand
And lead me off around the corner, maybe to their place
But when they speak, you get mad, jumpin' all up in my face
But on the other hand when women come and speak to you
You kiss and hug 'em like it's somethin' that you let me do
You're only jealous 'cause you know the ish you put me through
I might turn right around and do that ish to you

What if every guy I saw
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place
(What if) was all up in my face
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if
I hate a lying dude, one who doesn't know the rules
If you're gon' cheat, burn the receipt from the hotel room
But instead you're up in my face, sayin' you were at friends
But they all call, askin' me where the hell you been

Why they keep treating us this way?
Hot grits is a new game we play
We'll burn you (Oh), we'll cut you (Oh), we'll kill you (Oh)
We don't have to take it no more

What if every guy I saw (No)
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place
(What if) was all up in my face
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if
What if every guy I saw
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place (What would you do?)
(What if) was all up in my face (What would you say, baby?)
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if
Why they keep treating us this way?
Hot grits is a new game we play
We'll burn you (Oh), we'll cut you (Oh), we'll kill you (Oh)
We don't have to take it no more

What if every guy I saw
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place
(What if) was all up in my face
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if
What if every guy I saw
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place
(What if) was all up in my face
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if

What if every guy I saw
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place
(What if) was all up in my face
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if
What if every guy I saw
(What if) sittin' down at the bar
(What if) told him, "Give me a call"
What if, what if, what if
What if every guy in the place
(What if) was all up in my face
(What if) what would you say?
What if, what if1Embed
