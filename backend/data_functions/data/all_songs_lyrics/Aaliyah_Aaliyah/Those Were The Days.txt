Those Were The Days Lyrics
We ain't lovers no more
We don't laugh no more, we don't play no more
We don't make-up no more
We don't kiss no more, we don't hug no more
You don't please me no more
You don't touch no more, give me chills no more
We don't go out no more
We don't kick it no more, we don't dance no more

I remember walkin' through the park (Walkin' through the park)
Just shootin' the breeze (Shootin' the breeze)
Kissin' in the shade (Shade), those were the days
Loungin' in the den (Loungin' in the den)
You get breakfast in bed (In bed)
You let me have my way (Woah), those were the days

If you don't love me no more
Don't come 'round no more, just don't call no more
Don't come knockin' up at my door
After ten or so, what you knockin' for?
We don't kick it no more
You ain't cute no more, you ain't fly no more
You ain't got it like that no more
See you close your door, I'll still remember you
I remember walkin' through the park (Walkin' in the park)
Just shootin' the breeze (Shootin' the breeze)
Kissin' in the shade (Shade), those were the days (Days)
Loungin' in the den (Loungin' in the den)
You get breakfast in bed (Yeah)
You let me have my way (Oh), those were the days

Those were the days (Those were the days)
I said, those were the days (I said, those were the days)
Those were the days (Those were the days)
What's up with this, baby?
'Cause you done changed on me (You done changed)
This ain't the way it used to be, baby, oh

You don't know me no more
You can't lie no more, ain't gon' try no more
Won't have to say goodbye no more
You gotta hit the door, hate to see you go
I ain't the one to mess up your flow
Don't take pictures no more, don't hold hands no more
Yo, I think this is the end of the road, but I'll still remember you

I remember walkin' through the park (Walkin' through the park)
Just shootin' the breeze (Shootin' the breeze)
Kissin' in the shade, those were the days
Loungin' in the den (Loungin' in the den)
You get breakfast in bed (Anytime you want it)
You let me have my way (Yeah), those were the days
Walkin' through the park, shootin' the breeze
Days-days-days, loungin', loungin' in the den, in bed
Days-days-days-days
Those were the days (Those were the days)
I said, those were the days (I said, those were the days)
Those were the days (Those were the days)1Embed
