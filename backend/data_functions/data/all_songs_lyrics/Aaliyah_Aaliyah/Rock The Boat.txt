Rock The Boat Lyrics
Mmm, yeah, hmm
Huh-uh, hmm
Mmm, yeah

Boy, you know you make me float
Boy, you really get me high
Ooh, I feel like I'm on dope
'Cause you, you serve me on a regular (You serve me on a regular)
Boy, you need to tie this rope
Oh, before we drift any deeper (Before we drift any deeper)
Baby, now hold me close
Let's take this overboard now

I want you to rock the boat, rock the boat (Mmm)
Rock the boat, rock the boat (Yeah)
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle
Change positions on me
New position (Oh), new position
Now stroke it, baby, stroke it for me (Yeah)
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Ooh, baby, I love your stroke
'Cause you, 'cause you get me where I'm going
'Cause you get me where I'm going, yeah
And truly you'll get my vote
'Cause I believe, I believe you know just what you're doing now
Baby, now we can coast (Let's coast, let's coast)
Let's don't get in a hurry
Oh, no, that's too slow
Hey, go 'head and put that thing in overdrive
I want you to rock the boat, rock the boat (Ooh)
Rock the boat, rock the boat (Hey)
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work it, babe, work it, baby (Work the middle, work the middle)
Change positions on me
New position (Oh), new position
Now stroke it, baby, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
I want you to rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat (Hey)
Work it in the middle, work the middle
Work the middle (Ooh), work the middle (Hey)
Change positions on me
New position (Ooh), new position
Now stroke it, baby, stroke it for me (Yeah)
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me

Stroke it for me
Mmm, stroke it, baby, stroke it, baby
Mmm, work it, baby, work it, baby
Oh, stroke it
There is something I want you to do for me
I want you to use yourself (Hey)
Like you've never, ever used to do before (Never)
To explore my body (Explore it, baby)
Until you reach the shore (Yeah)
I'll be calling, calling for more (Calling)
Rock the boat, rock the boat (Oh)
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle
Mmm, work it, baby, work it, baby (Work the middle, work the middle)
Change positions on me (Mmm, change)
New position, new position (Hey)
Now stroke it for me, stroke it for me (Baby)
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
I want you to rock the boat, rock the boat (Ooh)
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle, work the middle (Mmm, work it, yeah)
Work the middle, work the middle
Change positions on me
New position, new position (Change)
Now stroke it for me, stroke it for me (Yeah)
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle, work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle
Change positions on me
New position, new position
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Rock the boat, rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat28Embed
