Extra Smooth Lyrics
So, he got big brown eyes, so he built nice
Ooh, comin' on strong, six pack showin'
Oh, he's too cool for his own shoes
Ooh, nothin' rude, but way too sure for me

Yeah, he tryna be extra smooth, extra smooth
Oh, extra cool, extra cute
Oh-yeah, am I supposed to talk to you, be your boo?
Don't come tryna be extra smooth

So, he got line for line, wastin' my time
Ooh, frontin' in the ride, tryna catch my eye
Disturbin' my groove, tryna be smooth
Ooh, get the boot, boy you can go 'head
And work on yourself another quick romance
A little too hot for me, oh
You act like you already got my number

Oh, I wish you quit tryna be (Hey)
Extra smooth, extra smooth (Hey)
Extra cool, extra cute
Am I supposed to talk to you, be your boo?
Oh, don't come tryna be
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
(See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth)
Extra, extra, extra cool
(See he tryna be, see he tryna be cool)
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo
(Talk to you, won't be your boo)
Extra, extra, extra
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
Mmm, hmm
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Ahh-ahh-ahh

Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
(See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth)
Extra, extra, extra cool
(See he tryna be, see he tryna be cool)
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo
(Talk to you, won't be your boo)
Extra, extra, extra
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
(See he wanna be, see he wanna be smooth)
Extra, extra, extra cool
(See he tryna be, see he tryna be cool)
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo
(Talk to you, won't be your boo)
Extra, extra, extra
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth
Extra, extra, extra cool
I won't talk to you, won't be your boo
Extra, extra, extra
Tryna be extra, extra, extra smooth1Embed
