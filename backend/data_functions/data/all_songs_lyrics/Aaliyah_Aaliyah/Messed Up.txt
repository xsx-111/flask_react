Messed Up Lyrics
Digital keybeats
Digital keybeats (What?)
Digital keybeats (I'm back)
Digital keybeats

You don't say that I'm pretty
All these simple things adding up to big ones
There is where you messed up
No movies or flowers, hours not knowing
Where you are or who you're with
There is where you messed up

You keep on actin' like I really need a brother
Man, I don't need a brother
Need to get your act together
Can't keep on holding on, waiting for you
And baby, there is where you messed up
You keep on actin' like I really need a brother
Man, I don't need a brother
Need to get your act together
Can't keep on holding on, waiting for you
And baby, there is where you messed up
I don't need your money and no dinner
I got jewelry, win or to lose
And baby, there is where you messed up
You can't take me for granted
And expect me to stay right here
And wait on you while you're having fun
There is where you messed up

You keep on actin' like
You keep on actin' like I really need a brother (I really need someone)
Man, I don't need a brother
Need to get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Can't keep on holding on, waiting for you (Yeah)
And baby, there is where you messed up
You keep on actin' like I really need a brother
Man, I don't need a brother
Need to get your act together
Can't keep on holding on, waiting for you
And baby, there is where you messed up

You're heading straight for the gate
It's time to cut my dead weight, yeah, you
And baby, there is where you messed up
I heard it all a thousand times
You've tried to mess with my mind, yeah, you
And baby, there is where you messed up
That you need your dog
That's where you went wrong
Uh-uh, I don't need you, dog
See there is where you messed up
She don't need you, dog
See that's where you went wrong, wrong, wrong
She don't need you, dog
And there is where you messed up
You keep on actin' like
You keep on actin' like I really need a brother (I really need someone)
Man, I don't need a brother
Need to get your act together
Can't keep on holding on
Can't keep on holding on, waiting for you (No)
And baby, there is where you messed up
You keep on actin' like
You keep on actin' like I really need a brother (I really need someone)
Man, I don't need a brother
Need to get your act together (Got me holdin' on)
Can't keep on holding on, waiting for you
And baby, there is where you messed up

And baby, there is where you messed up
