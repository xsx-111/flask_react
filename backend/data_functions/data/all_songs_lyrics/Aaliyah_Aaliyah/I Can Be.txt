I Can Be Lyrics
Woah-no
Oh-woah
No, no
Oh-woah, oh-no

Maybe I'm just wrong, feeling the way I do
Thoughts indecent, want to propose them to you
I know you have a girl, I don't want to tie
When you're free one night, just make those hours mine

I can be the other woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side that would be alright, alright, alright

Love just ain't my thing, the half of you might be
Enough for two or more, no hurting me indeed
Fine like expensive wine, drunk off one glass of you
I think more might be too much so weekends for me are cool

I can be the other woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side that would be alright, alright, alright
I can be the other woman in your life
I can be the other reason you're out at night
I can be all the things you thought she might
I can be on the side that would be alright, alright, alright

Alright
Alright
