Try Again Lyrics
It's been a long time (Long time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to (Step)
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to (Step)
Step to, freaky-freaky-freaky
Baby girl, uh

What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in
Now would you be yourself or play a role?
Tell all the boys or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away?
Or play me off or would you stay?
Oh

And if at first you don't succeed (Oh)
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again
I'm into you, you into me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not 'til I see what this could be
Could be eternity or just a week
But, yo, our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thing
We'll see how we go

And if at first you don't succeed (Oh, yeah)
Then dust yourself off and try again (Again)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (Yeah)
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (Ooh)
You can dust it off and try again (Try again)
Dust yourself off and try again (Yeah), try again
Again, again

So, you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first date
What about the next date?
Huh (Huh), huh (Huh)
Huh (Huh), huh (Oh)
I said, you don't wanna throw it all away (Away)
I might be buggin' on the first date
What about the next date? (Date)
Huh (Huh), huh (Huh)
Huh (Huh), huh (Oh)
And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again


And if at first you don't succeed (Uh, yeah)
Then dust yourself off (Uh) and try again (You can)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (Again)
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (Ooh)
You can dust it off and try again (Again)
Dust yourself off and try again (Yeah), try again
Again, again
And if at first you don't succeed (No)
Then dust yourself off and try again (Yeah)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (Yeah)
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (Baby)
You can dust it off (Hey) and try again (Yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to (Step)
Step to, step to, step to (Freaky)
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, step to (Freaky-freaky)

And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
Again, again

It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, what?
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky (Whoa)
It's been a long time (Time)
We shouldn't have left you (Left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, what?
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky (We out)
One mo' again
The new millennium, baby
And we out, you guess who it is23Embed
