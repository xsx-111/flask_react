I Refuse Lyrics
This is where I've got to draw the line
'Cause I refuse to let you think you can play with my mind
Always seems that you think that I'm blind
'Cause there's always certain times when you're hard to find
You're on the go, I'm on the go, we're on the go
I can't catch you no more, can't see you no more
And it no longer can be ignored
'Cause that once upon a time it was you I adored
You disappeared and left me here out in the cold
And the absence of you is hurtin' my soul
I didn't know that was an end of the road
It was so easy for you just to let it all go

And I refuse, I refuse to have one more sleepless night
I refuse, I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye
I refuse, I refuse to continue to try
I felt like I would die or I could break down and cry
And I refuse, I refuse to let you walk back through that door
I refuse, I refuse to let you hurt me anymore
And I refuse, I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door

And I refuse
No way I can take it, baby
I refuse
No way I can take it, baby
And I refuse
No way, but I refuse to take it anymore
Remember when I told you I could feel the change? (Change)
You don't touch me the same (The same)
Nor hold me the same (The same)
No, I don't want you to take all the blame
'Cause I know I had those moments when I caused the pain
This back and forth, just like a war with you and me (With you and me)
See we both disagree, have we ever agreed?
This ain't nothin' like I thought it would be
Was it all just a dream, was it ever in my reach?

And I refuse, I refuse to have one more sleepless night
I refuse, I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye
And I refuse, I refuse to continue to try
I felt like I would die or I could break down and cry
And I refuse, I refuse to let you walk back through that door
I refuse, I refuse to let you hurt me anymore
And I refuse, I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door

It was your way or it was no way (Hey)
And I couldn't live that way (No, no, no, oh, no)
It was our call (Our call) and then it was your call, oh
'Cause I gave you my all and all (My all and all)
And I refuse, I refuse to have one more sleepless night (Ooh)
I refuse, I refuse to let a tear fall out my eye
And I refuse, I refuse to continue to try (Yeah)
I felt like I would die or I could break down and cry
And I refuse, I refuse to let you walk back through that door
I refuse, I refuse to let you hurt me anymore
And I refuse, I refuse to continue to ignore
The fact I fell to the floor the day you walked out my door

No way I can take it, baby (Oh, no)
No way I can take it, baby (No)
No way, but I refuse to take it anymore
No, no, no, no way I can take it, baby
Oh, no, no, no, no way I can take it, baby
No, no way, but I refuse to take it anymore

And I refuse, I refuse
I refuse, I refuse, baby
And I refuse, oh
I refuse, said I refuse, oh
And I refuse
Said I refuse to take it anymore3Embed
