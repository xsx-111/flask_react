U Got Nerve Lyrics
Uh, come on
Watch out, come on, yeah
Come on, come on

Gave you chances on top of chances
Opportunities taken for granted (Watch out)
My reality is all your infidelities
Cause insanity, why you askin' me?
Took my kindness for sign of weakness (Watch out)
My own blindness cause my sadness
No longer am I a slave over your madness (Watch out)
I am glad it's finally over (Watch out)

Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve, boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve, boy

See I'm tired of all the games
That you seem to like to play
See what you can do for me
Is forget you knew my name (Watch out)
See your qualities are less than pleasing, uh
I got more than one reason for leaving (Watch out)
It's time to close shop, open new chapters
See new beginnings is what I'm after
Get your skeletons up out my closet
Don't make me lose it (Watch out), I just might lose it (Watch out)
Who do you think you are now? (Yeah)
I can't believe (Can't believe), you've got the nerve, boy (Yeah)
Who do you think you (Yeah) are now? (Yeah)
I can't believe you've got the nerve, boy
Who do you think you are now? (Who do you think you are?)
I can't believe you've got the nerve, boy (Yeah)
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe you've got the nerve, boy

See I'm tired of all the games that you seem to like to play
See what you need to do is forget you knew my name
I'm a play ya til' you've left, 'cause you talkin' me to death
See I ain't even sad that I'm here all by myself

Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe (Yeah) you've got the nerve, boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe (Yeah) you've got the nerve, boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe (Yeah) you've got the nerve, boy
Who do you think you are now?
I can't believe (Yeah) you've got the nerve, boy
Yeah, you've got the nerve, boy
Yeah, you've got the nerve, boy
You've got the nerve, boy1Embed
