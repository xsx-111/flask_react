We Need A Resolution Lyrics
Ah, ah, I'm tired of arguin', girl
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Huh, I'm tired of arguin', girl
Huh, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired
Huh, I'm tired of arguin', girl
Freaky-freaky-freaky-freaky
Baby girl, huh

Did you sleep on the wrong side?
I'm catching a bad vibe
And it's contagious, what's the latest?
Speak your heart, don't bite your tongue
Don't get it twisted (Yeah), don't misuse it
What's your problem, let's resolve it
We can solve it, what's the causes?
It's official, you got issues
I got issues (Um, well you got issues)
But I know I miss you

Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Yeah, who should be hurt, who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt, who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt, will we remain? Oh, I
We need a resolution, we need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion
I wanna know, where were you last night?
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out
I wanna know, were your fingers broke?
If you had let me know, I wouldn't have put on my clothes
I wanna know, where'd you go instead?
It was four in the morning when you crept back in the bed
I wanna know, what was in your head?
Or what was in my head, am I supposed to change?

Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Oh, who should be hurt, who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt, who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Oh, who should be hurt and will we remain?
We need a resolution, we need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion
Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt and who should be blamed?
Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt, who should be ashamed?
Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?
Who should be hurt, will we remain?
We need a resolution, we need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion
Baby, let me know
You'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know, you'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know, you'll let me know (I will)
You'll let me know, you'll let me know

Girl, holla (Ugh)
You give me bits and pieces
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason
I think it's just the season
Maybe the month, maybe you're bleeding?
Now tell me what's the reason?
Snoop video? Looks are deceiving
So, cut the cryin', cut the coughin', cut the wheezin', girl
Quit the blamin', cut the namin', cut the sneakin', girl
I think you need some prayer, better call a deacon, girl
So get your act right or else we won't be speakin', girl
So what's it gonna be?
Freaky-freaky, me and you?
Or is it gonna be, who blames who?
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomorrow, ooh6Embed
