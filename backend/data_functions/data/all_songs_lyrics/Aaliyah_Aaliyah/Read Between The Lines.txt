Read Between The Lines Lyrics
Uh-huh
You got to read between the lines, lines
You got to read between the lines, lines, lines
You got to read between the lines, lines
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Late afternoon, the sun goin' down
A call, a call on the cell (Why's he in such a hurry?)
Leavin' the room, he's mumblin' too
Now, now lookin' for his shoes (He's leavin' out the room, room)
No explanation, no actual location
Just watchin' him pacin' (Wonder who he's stressin', stressin')
Little conversation, leavin' no debation, he left the door swingin'

You better open your mind
You got to read between the lines
You got to read between the lines, lines
You got to read between the lines
You got to read between the lines

Nine in the mornin', up, up, up way before breakfast
Homeboy gettin' restless (The room is full of questions)
Little replyin', whole lot of denyin'
You're steady collidin' (So why do he keep on trying, trying?)
I search for the median, now he's a comedian
That's all the more reason (He's changing like the seasons, seasons)
Are you still pleasin', well soon you'll be leavin'
Which one will be grievin'?
You better open your mind
You got to read between the lines, lines
You got to read between the lines, lines (Between the lines)
You got to read between the lines, lines
You got to read between the lines

Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines (Oh)
Your lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes (Look in his eyes), got to read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines
Your lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes (Look in his eyes), got to read between the lines
Hey, hope you don't think you're pullin' one over me
'Cause I, I know what's going on
I hope you ain't been plannin' on runnin' me
'Cause that, that ain't what I'm on
Hope you don't think you're pullin' one over me
'Cause you'll look up and I'll be gone
Hope you ain't makin' plans on runnin' me
'Cause I read between the lines

Who got you thinkin', ya ish ain't been stinkin'?
My temperature's peakin' (Why is he barely speakin'?)
I'm bustin' his bubble and he know he in trouble
He's talkin' in doubles (I'm listenin', but hardly believin', believin')
Changin' the story or tryna ignore me
Still reachin' out for me (But still I'm hardly reachin', reachin')
Give me a reason to put you back on line
You've wasted enough time
I had to open my mind
Got to read between the lines, lines (Yeah)
You got to read between the lines, lines (Between the lines)
You got to read between the lines, lines (Oh, yeah)
You got to read between the lines, lines (Between the lines, yeah)
You got to read between the lines, lines
You got to read between the lines, lines
You got to read between the lines

Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines (Mmm)
Your lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old (Between the lines)
It's in his eyes (It's in his eyes), got to read between the lines
Your lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old
It's in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines (Between the lines)
Your lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines
Your replies are gettin' old (Gettin' old)
It's in his eyes (In his eyes), got to read between the lines (Yeah)
Your lies are gettin' told
Look in his eyes (Look in his eyes), got to read between the linesEmbed
