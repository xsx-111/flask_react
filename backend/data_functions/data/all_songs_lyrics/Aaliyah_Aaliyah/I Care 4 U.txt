I Care 4 U Lyrics
Mmm, yeah
No-no-no-no-no
Yeah, oh

Hey, my baby, why you lookin' so down?
Seems like you need a lovin'
Baby, you need a girl like me around
Hey, my baby, tell me why you cry
Here take my hand and (Yeah, mmm)
Wipe those tears from your eyes

Can I talk to you (Can I talk to you?)
Comfort you (Oh)
Let you know (Just wanna let you know)
I care for you
Can I talk to you? (I wanna talk)
Comfort you (Gotta let you know, baby)
Let you know (I wanna let you know)
I care for you

Hey, sexy baby, why'd your girl leave you in pain?
To let a fine man like you go, she must be insane
Hey, sexy baby, there's no need to worry, no
Oh, boy, if you call on me
I'll come, I'll come in a hurry
Can I talk to you (Come on, no)
Comfort you (I love you)
Let you know (Oh, baby)
I care for you
I love you, yes, I do
Can I talk to you (I wanna talk, no)
Comfort you (Give me a chance)
Let you know (Wanna let you know, gotta let you know)
I (That I) care for you (Love you, yeah)

Hold on (Hold on)
Stay strong (Stay strong)
Press on (For me, baby)
I care (I care) for you (For you)
Hold on (Hold on)
Stay strong (Stay strong)
Press on (Press on for me)
I care for you (Baby)

Can I talk to you? (I wanna talk)
Comfort you (I wanna hold you tight, baby)
Let you know (I wanna let you know)
I care for you (That I care for you)
Can I talk to you?13Embed
