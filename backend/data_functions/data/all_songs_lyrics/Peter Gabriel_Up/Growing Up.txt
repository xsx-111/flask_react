Growing Up Lyrics
Folded in your fleshy purse
I am floating once again
While the muted sounds are pumping rhythm
All the walls close in on me
Pressure's building wave on wave
Until the water breaks and outside I go, oh

One dot, that's on or off
Defines what is and what is not, one dot
Two dot, a pair of eyes, a voice
A touch, complete surprise, two dot

Growing up, growing up
Looking for a place to live
Growing up, growing up
Looking for a place to live
Growing up, growing up
Looking for a place to live

My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space
Three dot, a trinity
A way to map the universe, three dot
Four dot, is what will make a square
A bed to build on, it's all there, four dot

My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space

All the slow clouds pass us by
Make the empire state look high
As you take me in your sea-stained sweetness
It spills, it tingles and it stings
All the pleasure that it brings
Until the door has let the outside inside here

(My ghost likes to travel)
Well on the floor there's a long wooden table
(My ghost likes to travel)
On the table there's an open book
(My ghost likes to travel)
On the page there's a detailed drawing
(My ghost likes to travel)
And on the drawing is the name I took
My ghost likes to travel so far in the unknown
My ghost likes to travel so deep into your space

Growing up, growing up
Looking for a place to live
Growing up, growing up
Looking for a place to live
Growing up, growing up
Looking for a place to live

My ghost likes to travel
My ghost likes to travel
(Moving inside of your space)
My ghost likes to travel
My ghost likes to travel
(Moving inside of your space)
My ghost likes to travel
(Moving inside)
My ghost likes to travel
(Moving inside of your space)
My ghost likes to travel
(Moving inside)
My ghost likes to travel
(Moving inside of your space)
The breathing stops, I don't know when
In transition once again
Such a struggle getting through these changes
And it all seems so absurd
To be flying like a bird
When I do not feel I've really landed here2Embed
