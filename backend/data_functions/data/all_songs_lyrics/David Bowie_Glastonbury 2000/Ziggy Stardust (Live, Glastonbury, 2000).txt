Ziggy Stardust (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
Oh yeah

Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But he made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could kill 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
Came on so loaded man
Well hung, snow white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah
Oh Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Oooh
Oh hohoo

Ziggy played guitarEmbed
