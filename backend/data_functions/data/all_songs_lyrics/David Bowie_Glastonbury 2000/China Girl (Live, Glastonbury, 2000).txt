China Girl (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
I couldn't escape this feeling with my China Girl
I'm just a wreck without my little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, it's loud as thunder
I saw her stars crashing
I'm just a mess without my little China Girl
Wake up in the morning there's my little China Girl
I hear heart beating, it's loud as thunder
I saw her stars crashing

I'm feeling tragic like Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl, uh yeah
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
She said
She said
I stumble into town just like some sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
Oh, yeah

My little china girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything that you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you a man who wants to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
"Oh baby, just you shut your mouth"
She says, "Shh"
She says, "Shh"
She says
She says

Uh, uh, uh, oh
Little China Girl
Uh, uh, uh, oh
Little China Girl
Thank you
Oh, Glastonbury
Glastonbury
You got a very very lucky faceEmbed
