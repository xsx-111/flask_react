Life on Mars? (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
This one goes back to about the same time period as a, Changes
I'm very fearful tonight as I got struck down by laryngitis earlier this week
So if I give out and if any of you know any of the words
For God's sake, join in
Counting on you

It's a god awful small affair
To the girl with the mousey hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause she's lived it ten times or more
It's about to be lived again
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
It's the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
And the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
It's the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
Thank youEmbed
