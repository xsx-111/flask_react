Stay (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
Time this one was written, 1975
Guy played the album with me on that frozen station
Was Earl Slick

This week has past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I know there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If you would stay here tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Heart wrecker, heart wrecker
See me tonight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants someone to
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
But you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Stay
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay? Hey
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stayEmbed
