Golden Years (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
This is a song we haven't done, oh for so long
Just this last week, this is the first time we've done it
For a long time
Join us

Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

Don't let me hear you say
Life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
(Come get up, my baby)

There's my baby, lost that's all
Won't somebody save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop

One of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
(Come get up, my baby)
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day
I believe, oh Lord, I believe all the way
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

Won't somebody save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up, my baby

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years
Golden years
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whopEmbed
