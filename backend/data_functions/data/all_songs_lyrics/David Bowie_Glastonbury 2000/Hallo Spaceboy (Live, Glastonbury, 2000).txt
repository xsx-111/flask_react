Hallo Spaceboy (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
Come on, girl

Hallo Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette, so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me

Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
This chaos is killing me

Spaceboy
You're sleepy now
Your silhouette
Your silhouette
Your silhouette is so stationary
You're released but your custody calls
And I want to be free
Don't you want to be free?
Do you like girls or boys?
It's confusing these days
But Moondust will cover you
Cover you
This chaos is killing me
Moondust
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Bye bye love
This chaos is killing me

Bye bye love
Bye bye love
Good time love
Sweet sweet dove
Bye bye spaceboy
Moondust
Bye bye love
Moondust
Moondust will cover you
Moondust
Moondust will cover you
Moondust
Moondust will cover you
Moondust
Moondust will cover you
Moondust
Moondust will cover youEmbed
