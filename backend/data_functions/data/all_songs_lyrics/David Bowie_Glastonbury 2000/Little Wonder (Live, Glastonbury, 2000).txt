Little Wonder (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
Thank you, it's late at night, so let me read you a nursery rhyme

Stinky weather, Fat shaky hands
Dopey morning Doc, Grumpy gnomes

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Big screen dolls, tits and explosions
Sleepy time, Bashful but nude

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Enter Galactic, see me to be you
It's all in the tablets, Sneezy Bhutan

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you
Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away

You little wonder

Sending me so far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
So far away, so far away
So far away, so so far away
You little wonder
You little wonder
You little wonder you

Mars happy nation, sit on my karma
Dame meditation, take me away

Little wonder then, little wonder
You little wonder, little wonder you

Oh thank youEmbed
