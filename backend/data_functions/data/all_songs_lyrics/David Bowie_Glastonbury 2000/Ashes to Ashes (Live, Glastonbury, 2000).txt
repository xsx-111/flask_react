Ashes to Ashes (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
This song is not like any of the ones so far
This one is called "Ashes to Ashes"

Do you remember a guy that's been in
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"
The nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
Ain't got no money, ain't got no hair
But I hope to kick but the planet it's glowing

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels keep following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I never did good things
I never did bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, no
I want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes, fun to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mother said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
Oh wonderful little drummerEmbed
