Changes (Live, Glastonbury, 2000) Lyrics
All of you
I'd just written this one the first time I played Glastonbury in 1971

I still don't know what I was waiting for
Time was running wild
A million dead end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
Then I turned myself to face me
But I never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see this faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Woohoo. changes
Do you wanna have to be a better man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Woohoo, changes
I just wanted to be a better man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Hey (Yeah)
Yeah
Oh, yeah (Oh yeah)

Ripples change their size
Never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
Still the days seem just the same
And these children that they spit on
As they try to change their worlds
They're immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Woohoo changes
Looks like you've left them up to their necks in it
Time may change me
I can't trace time
Strange fascination, fascinate me, oh
Changes are taking the pace I'm going to

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Look out all you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
I can't trace time

Hehehe
