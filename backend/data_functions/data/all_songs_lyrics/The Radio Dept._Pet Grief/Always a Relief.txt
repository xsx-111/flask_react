Always a Relief LyricsIt's always a relief to see you again
It's as if you don't change and you always complain
We hate different things
And different tastes
How people sing
What they create
Want to feel the illusion
The confusion
Some nerve to go against me now that we're ahead
You want to know how hard you'd fall if you did?
It feels like our time has gone to waste
Want to feel strong and not like a waste
Want to feel the illusion
The confusion1Embed
