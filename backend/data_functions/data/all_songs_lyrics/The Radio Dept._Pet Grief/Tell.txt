Tell LyricsBetrayal is always sad, needless to say what you could have had
Of course you have it still but based on a lie that you always will
Repeat till it clings true, I've been lied to by the likes of you
From that point of view I get the privilege to enlighten you
On what I'm doing to help her, she needs some shelter
And if you've felt her loyalty what can you do?
Will you keep this up as long as you can if I don't make it stop?
I don't have a clue of what you are about to do
Would you fool me too? I've been lied to by the likes of you
From that point of view I get the privilege to enlighten you
On what I'm doing to help her, she needs some shelter
And if you've felt her loyalty what can you do?
I'm trying to help her, she needs some shelter
And if you've felt her loyalty what can you do?1Embed
