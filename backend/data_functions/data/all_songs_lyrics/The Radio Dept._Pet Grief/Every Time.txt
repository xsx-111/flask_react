Every Time LyricsChange your mind
We'll drink some other time
One night out
You won't miss out on much
I won't be held responsible this time
It's not my fault if you don't change your mind
Change your mind
This problem's yours not mine
You always find
Someone to pin things on
Just don't make me responsible this time
It's not my fault if you don't change your mindEmbed
