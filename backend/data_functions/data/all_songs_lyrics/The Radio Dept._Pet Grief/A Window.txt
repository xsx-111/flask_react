A Window LyricsI'm proud of both my hands
I just won't get loud about it
I'm proud of both my hands
I just won't get loud about it
Don't want to shout about it
Can't brag about it, no
I'm proud of both my hands
I just won't get loud about it
I don't consider this a chance
Or a window
Still proud of it
I couldn't live without it
No doubt about it, no
Can't get into the swing
Of things
Entanglements
Embarrassments
It always ends like thisEmbed
