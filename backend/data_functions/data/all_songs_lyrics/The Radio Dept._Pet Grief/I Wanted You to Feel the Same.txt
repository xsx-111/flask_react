I Wanted You to Feel the Same LyricsI sometimes got so tired of our game
I wanted you to feel the same
And did I say I liked you on the plane?
I wanted you you to feel the same
I wanted you you to feel the same
It breaks my heart to say that when I was in pain
I wanted you to feel the same
But nothing gets you really
It's a shame
I can't believe you didn't feel a thing
I wanted you you to feel the same2Embed
