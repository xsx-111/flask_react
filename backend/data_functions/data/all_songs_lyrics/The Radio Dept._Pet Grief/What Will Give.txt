What Will Give LyricsBloody but unbowed
You turn to face the crowd
How can you bring yourself to even care?
Show me a weakness if you dare
What will give?
Be sensitive
Keep it pure, be secretive
Of this I'm sure
How I want to hide
Like Jandek before playing live
You fell on deaf ears after screaming cheers
You'd seen it all before
In your mind
You saw it all before
In your mind2Embed
