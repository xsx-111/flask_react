Sunny South Kensington Lyrics
Come take a walk in sunny South Kensington
Any day of the week
See the girl with the silk Chinese blouse on
You know she ain't no freak

Come loon soon down Cromwell Road, man
You got to spread your wings
A-flip out, skip out, trip-out, and a-make your stand, folks
To dig me as I sing

Jean-Paul Belmondo and-a Mary Quant got
Stoned to say the least
Ginsberg, he ended up-a dry and so
He a-took a trip out East

If I'm a-late waitin' down the gate, it's such a 'raz' scene
A groovy place to live
In the Portobella I met a fella with a cane umbrella
Who must've used a sieve

So come loon soon down Cromwell Road, man
You got to spread your wings
A-flip out, skip out, trip-out and a-make your stand, folks
To dig me as I sing
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Come take a walk in sunny South Kensington
Any day of the week
Come see the girl with the silk Chinese blouse on
You know she ain't no freak

If I'm a-late waitin' down the gate, it's such a 'raz' scene
A groovy place to live
In the Portobella I met a fella with a cane umbrella
Who must've used a sieve

Jean-Paul Belmondo and-a Mary Quant got
Stoned to say the least
Ginsberg, he ended up-a dry and so
He a-took a trip out East

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Come loon soon down Cromwell Road, man
You got, you got to spread your wings, yeah
See the girl with the silk Chinese blouse on, yeah
You know she ain't no freak, hmm, hmmEmbed
