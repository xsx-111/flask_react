Hampstead Incident LyricsStanding by the Everyman
Digging the rigging on my sail
Rain fell to sounds of harpsichords
To the spell of fairy tale
The Heath was hung in magic mists
Enchanted dripping glades
I'll taste a taste until my mind drifts from this scene and fades
In the night time
Crystals sparkle in the grass
I polish them with thought
On my lash there, in my eye
A star of light is caught
Fortunes told in grains of sand
Here I am is all I know
Candy stuck in children's hair
Everywhere I go
In the night time
In the night time
Gypsy is the clown of love
I paint his face a smile
Anyone we ever make we always make in style
Yeah!
Yeah, strange young girls with radar screenings
And hands as quick as hate
I won't just now
Later on, maybe
And even then
I'll wait in the night time
In the night time
Standing by the Everyman
Digging the rigging on my sail
Rain fell to sounds of harpsichords
To the spell of fairy tale
The heath was hung in magic mists
Enchanted dripping glades
I'll taste a taste until my mind drifts from this scene and fades
In the night time
In the night timeEmbed
