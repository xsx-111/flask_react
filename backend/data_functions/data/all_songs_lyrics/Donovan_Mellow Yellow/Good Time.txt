Good Time LyricsLeitch
Won't you come here, baby
Won't you hold this in your hand?
I've been talking to your sister
She just don't understand
She knows everything
But she just don't know how to make life sing
Well, I'm as cool as candy
I cannot 
Never tell the beatnik
He's bound to get your neck
They know everything
But they just don't know how to make life sing
Won't you come here, baby
Won't you hold this in your hand?
I've been talking to your sister
She just don't understand
She knows everything
But she just don't know how to make life sing
I'm as cool as candy
And I cannot 
Never to tell the beatnik
He's bound to get youre neck
They know everything
But they just don't know how to make life sing
Yeah, I gotta go
Good authority
From an old man
With a grey beard
Yeah, isn't it about time?
Isn't it about time?
You got down...
