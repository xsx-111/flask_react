The Observation LyricsOn the sidewalk the people
Are hustling and bustling
They ain't got no time
So they think on the thing that
Will fill in the space
In between birth and death
Who're they kidding?
On the TV the people
Are mumbling and grumbling
They ain't got no hope
So they give out the news
That the world's got the blues
S.O.S., S.O.S
Bless my soul
In the movies the people
Are identifying
They ain't got no season
To split for no reason
And so they get by
On the great community lie
On the sidewalk the people
Are hustling and bustling
They ain't got no time
So they think on the thing that
Will fill in the space
In between birth and death
Who're they kidding ?
Who're they kidding ?Embed
