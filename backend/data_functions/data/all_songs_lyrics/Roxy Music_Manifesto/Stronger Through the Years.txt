Stronger Through the Years LyricsThrough the undercover hour
Bad and bleak
To be brief - too much sorrow
And flesh is weak
No more feelings
No more tears
The river's wide enough
Flowing stronger through the years
Silver lips - kisses borrowed
Glances steal
To quick - how they quiver
Too late they're sealed
No more feelings
No more tears
The river's wide enough
Flowing stronger through the yearsEmbed
