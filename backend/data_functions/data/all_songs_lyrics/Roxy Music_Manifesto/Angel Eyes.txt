Angel Eyes Lyrics
Oh, Angel eyes
Am I deceived
Or did you sigh?
For all I know
You let your love light
Shine on me

Oh, Angel eyes
You never close
Who's got the time?
I can wait
Until your love light
Shine on me

Oh, Angel eyes
Seems to me
You fill the skies
I'm far below
So let your love light
Shine on me

Oh, Angel eyes
On the wing
And open wide
No matter now
How high the moon shine
Down on me
Angel
Angel eyes
Angel
Angel eyes
Angel
Angel eyes
Angel
Angel eyes
Angel
Angel eyesEmbed
