Dance Away LyricsYesterday, when it seemed so cool
When I walked you home, kiss goodnight
I said "it's love", you said "alright"
Its funny how, I could never cry
Until tonight, when you pass by
Hand-in-Hand with another guy
You're dressed to kill, and guess whos dying...
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away...
Loneliness, is a crowded room
Full of open hearts, turned to stone
All together, all alone
All at once, my whole world had changed
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall
Lit the strobe light up the wall
I close my eyes, and dance til dawn
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away...
Dance away...
Dance away...
Now I know, I must walk the line
Until i find an open door
Off the street or onto the floor
There was I, many times a fool
I hoped and prayed, but not too much
Out of reach is out of touch
All the way is far enough
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears2Embed
