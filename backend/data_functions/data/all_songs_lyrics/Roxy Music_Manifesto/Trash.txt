Trash LyricsAre you customised or ready-made?
Heavy metal trick or treat?
Only seventeen
On the level trash is neat
Teenage fever oh you've got it bad
Caught the flavour want it all
Only seventeen
Bet you know the trash I mean
Row your features into magazines
Go to Plaza - where's the trade?
Only seventeen
Slips are lower trash is in1Embed
