Kingdom Hall Lyrics
So glad to see you
So glad you're here
Come here beside me now
We can clear inhibition away
All inhibitions
Throw them away
And when we dance like this
We will dance like we've never before

Oh, they were swingin'
Down at Kingdom Hall
Oh, bells were ringin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
And a choir was singin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
They went
Hey, liley, liley, liley
Hey, liley, liley, low
Do do do do do do, do (Do do do do do do, do)
Do do do do do do (Do do do do do do)
Do do do do do do, do (Do do do do do do, do)
Do do do do do do (Do do do do do do)

Good body music
Brings you right here
Free flowin' motion now
When were shakin' it out on the floor
Good rockin' music
Down in your shoes
And when we dance like this
Like we've never been dancin' before
Oh, they were swingin'
Down at Kingdom Hall
Oh yeah, bells were ringin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
Choir was singin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
They went
Hey, liley, liley, liley
Hey, liley, liley, low
Do do do do do do, do (Do do do do do do, do)
Do do do do do do (Do do do do do do)
Do do do do do do, do (Do do do do do do, do)
Do do do do do do, alright


Oh, they were swingin'
Down at Kingdom Hall now
Oh yeah, bells were ringin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
I heard the choir, choir was singin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
They went
Hey, liley, liley, liley
Hey, liley, liley, low
Do do do do do do, do (Do do do do do do, do)
Do do do do do do (Do do do do do do)
Do do do do do do, do (Do do do do do do, do)
Do do do do do do, alright
Oh, they were swingin'
Down at Kingdom Hall now
Yeah, bells were ringin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
Yeah, a choir was singin'
Down at the Kingdom Hall
They all went
Hey, liley, liley, liley
Hey, liley, liley, low
