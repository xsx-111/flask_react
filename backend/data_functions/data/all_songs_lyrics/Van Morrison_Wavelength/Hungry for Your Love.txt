Hungry for Your Love Lyrics
I'm hungry for your love
I'm hungry for your love
I'm hungry for your love
But I can wait now

I'm on the telephone
And I am all alone
I'm on the telephone
And we're connected

I got such a lot of love
I wanna give it to you
I got such a lot of love
I wanna give it to you
I got such a lot of love
I wanna give it to you

And though we're far apart
You are here in my heart
And though we're far apart
You're part of me now
And after all the years
And after all the tears
And after all the tears
There's just the truth now

I got such a lot of love
I wanna give it to you
I got such a lot of love
I wanna give it to you
I got such a lot of love
I wanna give it to you

Well, I'm hungry for your love
Hungry for your love
Well, I'm hungry
Yeah, well, I'm hungry for your love now
I love you in buckskin, yeah, yeah
I love you in buckskin, yeah, yeah
Yeah I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you now
I'm hungry for your loveEmbed
