Natalia LyricsI'm walkin' down the street
I'm on that midnight beat
I'm on a lonely avenue
Baby, won't you walk with me
Baby, won't you talk with me
Oh that's all I want you to do, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
Call your name out
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na, Natalia
Here on a summer night
I wanna kiss and hold you tight
Just the way we used to do
Walkin' down the same old street
People that we used to meet
Such a long, long time ago, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
And I call out your name
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na, Natalia
Here on a summer night
I wanna kiss and hold you tight
Just the way we used to do
Walkin' down the same old street
People that we used to meet
Such a long, long time ago, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
And I call out your name
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na, Natalia
Here on a summer night
I wanna kiss and hold you tight
Just the way we used to do
Walkin' down the same old street
People that we used to meet
Such a long, long time ago, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
And I call out your name
On a magic night like this
I hunger for your kiss
On a magic night like this
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na
Na Na, Na Na, Na Na, Natalia
Here on a summer night
I wanna kiss and hold you tight
Just the way we used to do
Walkin' down the same old street
People that we used to meet
Such a long, long time ago, now
Walk with me
Talk to me
And I call out your name
Walk with me
Talk with me
Walk with me
Talk with me
Natalia, Natalia, Natalia
Natalia, Natalia, NataliaEmbed
