Wavelength Lyrics
This is a song about your wavelength
And my wavelength, baby
You turn me on
When you get me on your wavelength now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
With your wavelength
Oh, with your wavelength
With your wavelength
With your wavelength
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama, oh mama
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama

Wavelength, oh mama
Wavelength
You never let me down, no no
You never let me down, no no

When I'm down you always comfort me
When I'm lonely child you see about me
You are everywhere you're supposed to be
And I can get your station
When I need rejuvenation now
Wavelength, oh mama
Wavelength
Said you never let me down, no no
You never let me down, no no

I hear the Voice of America
Callin' on my wavelength, alright
Tellin' me to tune in on my radio
I heard the Voice of America
Callin' on my wavelength
A-singin' "Come back, baby
Come back
Come back, baby
Come back"

Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit do do, do do do
Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit do do, do do do
Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit do do, do do do
Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit do do, do do do
Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit do do, do do do
Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit do do, do do do
Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit do do, do do do
Do do do dou-dit do do dou-dit (Do do do do)
Won't you sing that song again for me
The one about my lover, my lover in the grass, alright
You have told me about my destiny
A-singin' "Come back, baby
Come back
Come back, baby
Come back", yeah

Wavelength, oh mama
Wavelength
I said you never let me down, no no
You never let me down, no no

When you get me on
When you get me on your wavelength
When you get me on, yeah Lord
You get me on your wavelength
You got yourself a boy now
When you get me on there
You get me on your wavelength
Ya radio, ya radio, ya radio, ya radio
Ya radio, ya radio, ya radio, ya radio
Ya radio ya
Ya radio, ya radio, ya radio, ya radio
Ya radio, ya radio
