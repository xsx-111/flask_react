Hawaii Lyrics(Come on in here)

At first I didn't like him
He came asking for a loan
I got nervous when he came into view

On and overdose of vitamins
Trying to explain
Something that I already knew

He said help me stay afloat and get back to
Hawaii
Hawaii

All the paintings and the sketches
Lay scattered on the sand
And the condominium was close at hand

Things were getting hard to follow
I was feeling pretty hollow
When the stranger came to me and put out his hand
He said I think we better talk there's something you don't understand
About Hawaii
Hawaii

With my baby and my bicycle
I up and rode away
And many nights have passed since this morning came my way

And I think about him often
With his vitamins and kids
Does he sleep with half a women on his mind?

Well the other half just got left behind
In Hawaii
