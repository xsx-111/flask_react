Campaigner Lyrics
I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal
I hardly slept the night you wept
Our secret's safe and still well kept

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

Traffic cops are all color blind
People steal from their own kind
Evening comes too early for a stroll
Down neon streets the streaker streaks
The speaker speaks but the truth still leaks

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul

The podium rocks in the crowded waves
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves
That went down long before
He played this role
For the hotel queens and the magazines
Test tube genes and slot machines
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got it, soul

Hospitals have made him cry
But there's always a freeway in his eye
Though his beach just got too crowded for a stroll
Roads stretch out like healthy veins
And wild gift horses strain the reins

Where even Richard Nixon has got soul
Even Richard Nixon has got soul

I am a lonely visitor
I came too late to cause a stir
Though I campaigned all my life
Towards that goal2Embed
