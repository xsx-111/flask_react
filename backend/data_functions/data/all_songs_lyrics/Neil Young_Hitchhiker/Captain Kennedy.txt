Captain Kennedy Lyrics
I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good

My father was a sailor named Captain Kennedy
He lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the sea
Exploded on the water for everyone to see
And humiliate that American Captain Kennedy

I saw him in Nassau in 1971
His strength was failing but he still ran a run
He worked till his fingers wore to the bone
To buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own

He was known in the islands as hundred foot iron
That steel hull freighter was passing its time
And time flew by faster with life on the sea
And the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy

I am a young mariner headed to war
I'm thinking about my family and what it was for
There's water on the wood and the sails feel good
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill goodEmbed
