Hitchhiker LyricsWhen I was a hitchhiker on the road
I had to count on you
But you needed me to ease the load
And for conversation too
Or did you just pass on through
You didn't see me in Toronto
When I first tried out some hash
Smoked through a pen and I'd do it again
But I didn't have the cash
I didn't have the cash
Then I tried amphetamines
And my head was in a glass
Taped underneath the speedometer wires
Of my 48 Buick's dash
But I knew that wouldn't last
Then came California
Where I first saw open water
In the land of opportunity
I knew I was getting hotter
I knew I was getting hotter
But the neon lights
And the endless nights
They took me by surprise
The doctor gave me Valium
But I still couldn't close my eyes
I still couldn't close my eyes
Then came paranoia
And it ran away with me
I couldn't sign my autograph
Or appear on TV
Or see or be seen
Living in the country
Looked good to me
Smoking grass while the summer passed
In a real organic scene
Where everything was green
Then we had a kid and we split apart
I was living on the road
And a little cocaine went a long, long way
To ease that different load
And my head did explode
My head did explode
I thought I was an Aztec
Or a runner in Peru
I would build such beautiful buildings
To house the chosen few
Like an Inca from Peru
Now many years have come and gone
Like friends and enemies
I tried to leave my past behind
But it's catching up with me
It's catching up with me
I don't know how I'm standing here
Living my life
I'm thankful for my children
And my faithful wifeEmbed
