Give Me Strength Lyrics
A lonely man I made myself to be
It's not as bad as some things I have seen
The picture painted here is not a dream
It's only reality the way it seems

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

I'm riding down this wet road in my old car
The moon is almost full except for star shine
The party ended long before the night
But she made me feel alive and that's all right

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all
Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's gone

The happier you fly
The sadder you fall
The laughter in your eyes
Is never all

Give me strength to move along
Give me strength to realize she's goneEmbed
