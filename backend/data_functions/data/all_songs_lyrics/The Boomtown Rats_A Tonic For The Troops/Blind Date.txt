Blind Date Lyrics
On blind dates, we meet in corners
You take a jump into the unknown
They're classified, they're top secret
An antidote to being on your own

You're standing waiting, you're hesitating
You're thinking maybe "Well, I don't know"
Your nerve is breaking, you've started praying
But still you're staying and you don't know for what

But I still say
I've been alone too long
Been alone's so wrong
I've been alone too long
Too long

A blind date's a blinkered meeting
A rendez-vous with some person unknown
A secret tryst, a shady dealing
A gambler's chance when love's dice are thrown

You're standing waiting, you're hesitating
You're thinking maybe "Well, I don't know"
Your nerve is breaking, you've started praying
But still you're staying and you don't know for what
So I still say
I've been alone too long
Been alone's so wrong
I've been alone too long
Too long

But you've checked the classifieds in all the papers
And you filled in all your forms and tried computer data
See ya later!

(Blind date!) I've been alone too long
(Blind date!) Been alone's so wrong
(Blind date!) I've been alone too long
Too long (Blind date!)



I need a
(Blind date!) I've been alone too long
(Blind date!) Been alone's so wrong
(Blind date!) I've been alone too long
(Blind date!) Been alone's so wrong
(Blind date!) I've been alone too long
(Blind date!) Been alone's so wrong
(Blind date!) I've been alone too long
(Blind date!) Been alone's so wrong
So long!Embed
