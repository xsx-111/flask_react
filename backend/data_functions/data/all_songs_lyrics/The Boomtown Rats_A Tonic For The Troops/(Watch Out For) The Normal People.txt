(Watch Out For) The Normal People Lyrics
She keeps her lover on ice
She keeps a fire in the grate
He's got a movement in his cellar
Oh, he's a danger to the state

Oh, watch out for the normal people
There's more of us than there's of you (Of us than you)
Well you're a real lucky bugger
That you haven't been discovered
Ain't it true? Ain't it true?

She has a genuine fridge (Oh oh oh)
He's got a night on the town (Oh oh oh)
Their receptions too good (Oh oh oh)
They've got 2 up and 2 down

But watch out for the normal people
There's more of us than there's of you (Of us than you)
Well you're a real lucky bugger
That you haven't been discovered
Ain't it true? Ain't it true?
Normal can and normal will
When normal Jack meets normal Jill
A normal wedding on a normal pill
They bought a normal house on your average, scenic, normal hill
They live there still


He's got a family connection (Uncle Jack)
She's got an uncle in steel (Auntie Jill)
He gets depressed in the evening (Take their pills)
She thinks she know how he feels

But watch out for the normal people
There's more of us than there's of you (Of us than you)
Well you're a real lucky bugger
That you haven't been discovered
You're a real lucky bugger
That you haven't been discovered
You're a real lucky bugger
That you haven't been discovered
Ain't it true? Ain't it true?
Well, I lied to you
Well, sometimes I do
So what to you?Embed
