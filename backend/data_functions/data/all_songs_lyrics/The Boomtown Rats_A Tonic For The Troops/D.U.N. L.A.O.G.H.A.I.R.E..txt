Hey Garry, how d'ya spell Dun Laoghaire?
That's easy, Bob! D.U.N. L.A.O.G.H.A.I.R.E.
That's how you spell Dun Laoghaire.
No, you're wrong, pal. That's not how you spell it. That's not how you spell Dun Laoghaire.
It is.
It isn't.
It is!
It is not!
It is!
I'll tell ya how to spell it
No, you won't
Now
All right
Tired N Weary
Drab N Dreary
That's how you spell it, Dun Laoghaire.
It is not
It is so
It is not
It is
Well, it's the stupidest way I've ever heard of spelling Dun Laoghaire.
Well I spell it drunk and beary
Licentious and leary
There's only one way out of Dun Laoghaire, you know what it is?
Off the mail boat piery
Off the mail boat piery, I'm glad we got out
Who cares about Dun Laoghaire?
You're talkin' about me ,home town pal.
Ah, listen to that.., do do do do......
Come on everybody, I want the world to spell Dun Laoghaire!
Are ya ready? 1, 2, 3, 4
