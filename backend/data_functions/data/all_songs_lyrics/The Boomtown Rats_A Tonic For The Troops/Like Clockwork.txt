Like Clockwork Lyrics
(Tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)

I'm not disconnected
I'm not unaware
I'm in one place at one time
I'm neither here nor there
I'm hooked to the mainstream, tuned into the world
Plugged into my surroundings, not out on a limb
I'm thinking in a straight line, I'm thinking that these thoughts are mine
My heart is beating oh-so fast, I feel the hours crashing down

My mind beats time like clockwork (I, I, I)
And I think in sync like clockwork (I, I, I)

(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
She's done away with emotion
She sees things clearly now
She says she sees it all from her room
And it looks so small from her room
It's all right (it's all right!) it's all right (it's all right!)
I'm on your side for a while
She thinks time is a concept which we measure our age (She'll say it again)
She wants to say it again, but she don't have time

Because her heart beats time like clockwork (I, I, I)
And she thinks in sync like clockwork (I, I, I)

(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)

Count the hours, count the months and minutes
You're born in tears and you'll die in pain, that's your limit
You're lookin' for some many reasons but there's none, there, why don't you admit it?
We'll make the most of what we've got, that's the ticket
My, my, my, my, my, my

I stayed in that room a long, long time
And watched the seasons gliding by
And hey, what's the matter?
We've got time, lots of time
It's all right (it's all right!) it's all right (it's all right!)
I'm on your side for a while
We wind up, we slow down
We speed up, move around, and we maybe overwind
Because our minds beat time like clockwork (I, I, I)
And we think in sync like clockwork, oh, oh, oh (I, I, I)
And our minds beat time like clockwork (I, I, I)
And we think in sync like clockwork (I, I, I)

(Tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock)
(Tick, tock)Embed
