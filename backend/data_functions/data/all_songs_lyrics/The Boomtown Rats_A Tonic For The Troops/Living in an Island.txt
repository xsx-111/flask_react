Living in an Island Lyrics
Oh, night fell fast, like it did in the past
When the phone rang twice and a voice said "I think I'm alone"
I gave my advice and the voice said "Nice
But suicide leaves such a bad aftertaste on the soul"

Oh, ain't you glad that you live on an island?
You can choose your own way of being killed
You can jump off a cliff and get drowned in the sea
Or be dashed against the rocks and get split
And it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
Yeah, it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
Oh, it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
And if it do, then you're a true blue sui-

Side by side, they walked into the tide
Till it rose to their nose and then they kissed with their eyes "Goodbye"
They were seen to smile just before they dived
Dead lovers don't have much except a certain desperate sense of style

Oh, ain't you glad that you live on an island?
You can choose your own way of being killed
You can jump off a cliff and get drowned in the sea
Or be dashed against the rocks and get split
And it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
Oh, it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
Yeah, it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
And if it do, then you're a true blue suicide
(Oh, oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh)

There were a lot of crazy problems that they couldn't resolve
A lot of tricky questions which they just couldn't solve
The main problem was of course he couldn't say "No"
On your marks, get ready, steady, here we go!

In a fifth floor lift, a man slit his wrist
His head ticked over and then it suddenly slipped away
And the girl in the mac at the back of the shack
Put her head on the track and said "I think it's better this way"

Oh, ain't you glad that we live on an island?
You can choose your own way of being killed
You can jump off a cliff and get drowned in the sea
Or be dashed against the rocks and get split
And it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
Yeah, it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
Oh, it could happen to you (No, it won't happen to me)
And if it do, then you're a true blue suicide
(Oh, oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh)
(Oh, oh oh oh oh oh-oh oh)

We are living, living in an island
We are living, living in an island
We are living, living in an island (Ay-oh, a-ay-oh!)
We are living, living in an island
We are living, living in an island
We are living, living in an island
We are living, living in an island
We are living, living in an island
We are livingEmbed
