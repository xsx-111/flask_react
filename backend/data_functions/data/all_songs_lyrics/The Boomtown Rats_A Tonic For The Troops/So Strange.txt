So Strange LyricsI was bleeding before I saw the blood
I was screaming but I soon woke up
On that night on that night with you
I realized it was gonna be me or you
Ooh and it made me feel strange
So strange, strange
So I knelt down and said my prayers that night
The fog was closing in on what remained of the light
On that night on that night with you
I heard the wild dogs howling in the distant moon
Ooh and it made me feel strange
So strange, strange
Oh yeah..
You told me you had arranged
For something special and strange
But suddenly I saw your eyes
And realized that you were quite insane
And when the dawn came I listened hard for your breath
You once told me the bottom line in life is death
On that night on that night with you
I realized it was gonna be me or you
And it made me feel strange
So strange, strangeEmbed
