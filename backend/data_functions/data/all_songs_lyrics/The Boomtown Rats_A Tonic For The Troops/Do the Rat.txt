Do the Rat Lyrics
He rodent into town, fangs were getting him down
He whiskered around the juke joint where the cool cats hang around
Down at the mouse trap, fangs were getting hot
Squealing with delight, their legs began to hop

They're doin' the rat
Keep your trap shut
Do the rat, do the rat
Be a cool cat, do the rat
Well hold on to your hat 'cause that where it's at
Wrap your tail around your partner, you're doing the rat

You get down on the floor, down on all fours
 with your  and scratch with your claws
Swish and  tail
You just can't fail
Point your ears to our
Listen to the music of that band
Your teeth are yellow, your head is gray
If you do the rat

Do the rat
Keep your trap shut
Do the rat, do the rat
Be a cool cat, do the rat
Well hold on to your hat 'cause that where it's at
Wrap your tail around your partner, you're doing the rat
Do it!
Do the rat
Keep your trap shut
Do the rat, do the rat
Be a cool cat, do the rat
Well hold on to your hat 'cause that where it's at
Wrap your tail around your partner, you're doing the ratEmbed
