Me and Howard Hughes Lyrics
Hand me down a strong panacea
One that's guaranteed to make me feel like Hercules
There's flies everywhere, buzzing in the air
Filling my body with filth and disease
He thinks he should develop a complex (Oh yeah)
He thinks that he really owes it to himself
His friends can all say he's looking sick and unhealthy
An' then he can wallow in sweet self-neglect

Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, yeah

He's gonna lock himself up in his room
Shutter the windows and bolt all the doors
Wrap himself 'round in his Wall Street cocoon
He's painting the ceiling, the wall and the floor
He's gonna lock himself up in his room
And when he emerges, have a new change of style
He keeps saying things like it's me and Howard Hughes
You'd wanna watch out for that dangerous smile
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah


He's gonna lock himself up in his room
Shutter the windows and bolt all the doors
Wrap himself 'round in his Wall Street cocoon
He's painting the ceiling, the wall and the floor
He's gonna lock himself up in his room
Shutter the windows and bolt all the doors
Wrap himself 'round in his Wall Street cocoon
He's painting the ceiling, the walls and the floor
He's gonna lock himself up in his room
And when he emerges, have a new change of style
He keeps saying things like it's me and Howard Hughes
You'd wanna watch out for that dangerous smile

Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeahEmbed
