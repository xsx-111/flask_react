Butterfly, How Long It Takes to Die Lyrics
If you've ever really seen the sunrise
You'd see how many times it tries
If you've ever really seen the sunset
You'd see how long it takes to die

You can see the butterfly has landed
Landing on your face, it licks your eye
You can feel its tongue making a teardrop
You will see how long it takes to cry

You can see the universe beginning
Making a new sun in a new sky
You can see the universe is ending
Making a new dark in a new lightEmbed
