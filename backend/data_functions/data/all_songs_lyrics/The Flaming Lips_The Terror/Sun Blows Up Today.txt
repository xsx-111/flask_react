Sun Blows Up Today Lyrics
Don't stop, tick tock
Sun blows up today
Don't stop, punk rock
Too much fun today
Run and run and too much fun today
Run to outer space
Seeing your smiling face
Everywhere it's all together
On this epic day

Run and run
And run and run
And run and run
And run and run
And run and run
And run and run
And run and run
And run and run
And run and run
And run and run
(Sun blows up)
And run and run
And run and run
(Sun blows up)
And run and run
And run and run
(Sun blows up)
And run and run
And run and run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
And run and run
And run and run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run

Run to outer space
Seeing your smiling face
Everywhere it's all together
On this epic day1Embed
