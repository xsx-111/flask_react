Be Free, a Way Lyrics
Did God make pain
So we can know
The high that nothing is
The sun shines down
But we're still cold
It's light is not a light that shines

The way, a way
But how can we be free
When all our days are empty

Is love a God
That we control
To try to trust the pain
The sun shines down
But we can't see
Its light lights everything the same

Be free, a way
But how can we
Find arms to hold the days
Be free, a way
But how can we
Find arms to hold the days

A way
A way
A way
A way
A way1Embed
