All You Need Is Love Lyrics
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung
There's nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
There's nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy


Love is all you need (Love is all you need)
Yee-hai! (Love is all you need)Embed
