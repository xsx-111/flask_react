You Are Alone Lyrics
All the time you know about is bad
All the time you told me I was bad
That I have no goodness left in me
And I'll have to live beyond reality's dream
Oh, girl...
Oh, girl...
Oh, girl...
No...

Just the sound of your ecstasy I hear
Just enough to wake me from my fear
It's enough to sacrifice me now
It's the only sound of love I hear
Oh, God...
Oh, God...
Oh, God...
No...

I'm not alone, you are alone
Youâ€™re not alone, you are alone

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ohEmbed
