The Terror Lyrics
However long they love you, we are all standing alone
The terror’s in our heads, we don't control the controls
I turn to face the sun, we are still standing alone
At last we'll sing of the terror, it helps us hold the controls

We’ll sing in the sunshine, we'll laugh every day
We’ll sing 'cause love will save us
The sunshine every day

Your voice says "yes", but I can't go on
Your voice says "yes", but I can't go more
What gives judgement the final word
When at once the sacred word can't be heardEmbed
