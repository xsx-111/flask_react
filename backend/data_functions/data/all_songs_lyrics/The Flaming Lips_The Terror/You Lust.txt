You Lust Lyrics
You've got a lot of nerve
A lot of nerve to fuck with me
Better kill your emperor
'Cause you know you're just like me
You lust, you lust, you lust

Lust to succeed
Lust to succeed
Lust to succeed
Lust to succeed
Lust to succeed
Lust to succeed
Lust to succeed

When you pull the switch on them
I don't really want to know
When you shoot the stars away
The brightest light is the first to go
You lust, you lust, you lust


Ugly and magnificent
Your selfish eye can't see itself
When it shoots across the fall
It can never be destroyed
It can never be destroyed
It can never be destroyedEmbed
