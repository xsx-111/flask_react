Try to Explain Lyrics
Is it wise, loving someone
They tell lies, make you think something
I'm not wise, I believe what you tell me
I believe you, I believe you, I believe
A love that explodes, convulsing your body
You head, ecstatically wanting
Trapped there, walking away on the bridge
To nowhere, to nowhere, to no one

Try to explain why you've changed
I don't think I understand

A love that explodes, convulsing your body
You head, ecstatically wanting
Trapped there, walking away on the bridge
To nowhere, to nowhere, to no one

Try to explain why you've changed
I don't think I understand
Try to explain why you're leaving
I don't think I understand1Embed
