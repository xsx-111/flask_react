Always There, in Our Hearts Lyrics
Always there, in our hearts
Fear of violence and of death
Always there, in our hearts
There is love and there is pain
Always there, in our hearts
There is evil that wants out
(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Always there, in our hearts
There are sorrows and sadness
(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Always there, in our hearts
Never understanding
(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Always there, in our hearts
Something pure that we can't control
(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Can't control, can't control, can't control
(1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4)

Always there, in our hearts
Destroying everything we know
Always there, in our hearts
Not forgiving those who are weak
Always there, in our hearts
Shame that we are all powerless
Always there, in our hearts
A joy of life that overwhelms
Overwhelms, overwhelms
Overwhelms, overwhelms
Overwhelms...Embed
