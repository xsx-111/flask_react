Look... The Sun Is Rising Lyrics
There's a little spaceship
Hiding in the clouds
You want it to love you
Its peaceful voice is loud
You can hear the voice
Telling you to love
It's the voice of MK-Ultra
And you're doing what it wants

Love is always something
Something you should fear
When you really listen
Fear is all you hear
I know that you will love me
Till I come down
Look, the sun is rising
What will love us nowEmbed
