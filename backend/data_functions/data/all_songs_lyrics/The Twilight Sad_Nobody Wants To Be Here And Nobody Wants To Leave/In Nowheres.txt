In Nowheres LyricsOutside they say you're alright
But you're mine and I'll hold you all night
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Street lights go out in the fight
But you're mine and i'll hold you all night
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Do you, Do you
I'll get you outside
I'll get you outside
Tell me when you're gone
You'll tell me when you're gone
They won't find me
I'm all you'll ever see
Let him go
Let him go
Outside they say you're alright
But you're mine and i'll hold you all night
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
So tell me where you go
So tell me where you go
They'll tell me when you're gone
They'll tell me when you're gone
They won't find me
I'm all you'll ever need
Let him go
Let him go
No more nightmares
No more nightmares
Let him go
Let him go
Let him go
You know you won't
Let him go
You know you won't
Let him go
Let him go
Let him go
You know you won't
Let him go
You know you won't
Let him goEmbed
