It Never Was the Same LyricsLook outside
You don't say a thing as we lose them all
Nothing is the same in this old town
So come inside
Rolling down the stairs you break her fall
No one is the same in this old town
You said, our love will never die
It never was the same in this old town
So we dance to save them all
We asked to save them all
We tried to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all
So we dance to save them all
We asked to save them all
We tried to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all
You will never tell me exactly what you want
You don't say a thing as we lose them all
You said, our love will never die
It never was the same in this old town
So we dance to save them all
We asked to save them all
We tried to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all
So we dance to save them all
We asked to save them all
We tried to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all
We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart
We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apart
So we dance to save them all
We asked to save them all
We tried to save them all
You didn't have to kill them all
We've fallen
We've fallen
We fall apartEmbed
