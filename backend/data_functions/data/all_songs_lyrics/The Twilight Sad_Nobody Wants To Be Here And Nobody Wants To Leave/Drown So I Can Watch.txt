Drown So I Can Watch LyricsI put you through hell
But you carry it oh so well
You carry it oh so well
Don't you
We've come too far
But no one knows who you are
So carry me away from here
Carry me away from here
You'll carry me away from here
I put you through hell
But you carry it oh so well
You carry it oh so well
Don't you
So tell me that you want me there now
Tell me i don't matter here now
No i can't go
She'll carry me away from here
She'll carry me away from here
She'll carry me away from here
You'll carry me away from here
You'll carry me away from here
You'll carry me away from here
There's a girl on my shoulder
Stupid girl on my shoulder
There's a girl on my shoulder
You're too slow
He killed my friend
I know
Too slow
It's not the way to go
Too slow
He killed my friend
I know
Too slow
It's not the way to go
There's a girl on my shoulder
Stupid girl on my shoulder
There's a girl on my shoulder
You're too slow
He killed my friend
I know
Too slow
It's not the way to go
There's a girl on my shoulder
Stupid girl on my shoulder
There's a girl on my shoulder
Too slow
He killed my friend
I know
Too slow
It's not the way to go3Embed
