Leave the House LyricsSo what do you care for
Cause there's no one in the right
There's no one in the right
There's no one in the right
So what do you care for
I see you
I see you
I see you
I see you
Say where, where you go away
You'll see girl
Its only in the dark
Only in the dark
When they come out
It's only in the dark
So what do you care for
Cause there's no one in the right
There's no one in the right
There's no one in the right
So what do you care for
Say where, where you go away
Where you go away
And I won't call there
You'll see girl
Its only in the dark
Only in the dark
When they come out
It's only in the dark
I've been put to bed
I've been put to bed
I've been put to bed
I've been put to bed
I don't know what you know
I don't know where you go
I don't know what you know
I don't know where you go
I don't know what you know
I don't know where you go
So what do you care for
Cause there's no one in the right
There's no one in the right
There's no one in the right
So what do you care for
Cause there's no one in the right
Say where, where you go away
Where you go away
And I won't call thereEmbed
