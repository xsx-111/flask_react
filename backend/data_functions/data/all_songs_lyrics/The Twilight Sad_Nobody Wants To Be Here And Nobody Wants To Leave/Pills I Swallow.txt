Pills I Swallow LyricsIt started on that night
I never left your side
I'll have you know
Always ends up in a fight
So callous
Its you
Its you
Its always you
You're telling me
What not to do
So callous
Oh Isla
You were only asked to find her
Oh Isla
You were only asked to find her
Will you let me finish now
Will you let me finish now
I'll keep you in my sight
I never want to fight
I'll have you know
And your eyes are water tight
So callous
Ts you
Its you
Its always you
You're telling me
What not to do
So callous
Oh Isla
You were only asked to find her
Oh Isla
You were only asked to find her
Will you let me finish now
Will you let me finish now
You were only asked to find her
You were only asked to find her
Oh Isla
Oh Isla
Oh Isla
Will you let me finish now
Will you let me finish now
You were only asked to find her
You were only asked to find herEmbed
