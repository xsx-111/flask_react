Sometimes I Wished I Could Fall Asleep LyricsSad to say
We're still awake
I'm leaving you
Just to be cruel
You don't want me anymore
You don't need me anymore
It's not the same
You're to blame
Tell me who ruined you
We've been left behind
Fallen out of time
You're all that I have
Don't you know you're all that I have
Don't you know
We've been left behind
You don't want me anymore
Throw me on the fire
You can throw me on the fire
You can throw me on the fire
Will you call me when you're there
Run your fingers through your hair
Will you call me when you're there
Run your fingers through your hair
We've been left behind
You don't want me anymore
Sad to say
That we're still awake
I'm leaving you
Just to be cruel
You don't want me anymore
You don't need me anymore
There's nothing left for us
Nothing left for us
There's nothing left for us
There's nothing left for us
We've been left behind
You don't want me anymore
There's nothing left for us
Nothing left for us
Nothing left for us
Nothing left for us
We've been left behindEmbed
