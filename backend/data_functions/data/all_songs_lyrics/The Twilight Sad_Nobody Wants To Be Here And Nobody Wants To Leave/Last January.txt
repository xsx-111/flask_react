Last January LyricsI see you at night and I stare at you
You don't care for me
Move out of the light
I still glare at you
Move away from me
So don't lie
It's taken you all night
We're feeling the same
With me
So don't die
It's taken you all night
We're feeling the same
You are too old to fare on your own
You are too old to fare on your own
They say it can't be won
When it's your eyes touching my eyes
To the past we know
They say it can't be done
They say it's all just fun
When it's your eyes touching my eyes
Don't like what you find staring back at you
You don't care for me
So don't lie
It's taken you all night
We're feeling the same
You know that I won't
You know that I won't
You are too old to fare on your own
You are too old to fare on your own
They say it can't be won
When its your eyes touching my eyes
To the past we know
They say it can't be done
They say it's all just fun
When its your eyes touching my eyes
Won't you come for me
You'll come for me
This isn't the you that I came here for
This isn't the you that I waited for
This isn't the you that I came here for
This isn't the you that I waited for2Embed
