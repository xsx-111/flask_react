Nobody Wants to Be Here and Nobody Wants to Leave LyricsCan we go back
Can we go back
Can we go back
I won't keep you here
I won't keep you long
I won't keep you here
Can you stay tomorrow
You won't leave tomorrow
I don't know where it all went wrong
I won't keep you here
I won't keep you long
I won't keep you here
You always say you won't
You always say you won't
You always say you won't
Can you stay tomorrow
You won't leave tomorrow
I don't know where it all went wrong
So lay with me alone
Stay with me you won't
So lay with me alone
Stay with me you won't
Can we go back
Can we go back
Can we go back
Can you stay tomorrow
You won't leave tomorrow
I don't know where it all went wrong
I don't know where it all went wrong
I don't know where it all went wrongEmbed
