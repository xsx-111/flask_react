Winter Sound Lyrics
Stop
You're cold against the skin
Take me in your arms
When walls are closing in, ooh ooh-ooh
And I run, I run, I run
Awakening my heart
But you overwhelm my lungs
And it's tearing me apart

You and I will not be shaken
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Whoa oh oh, whoa
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh

Stop
I will take control
Bend the metal
Into shapes that I know, ooh ooh-ooh
And I run, I run, I run
Further than before
I shake away the skin
To saturate my soul

You and I will not be shaken
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound

You and I will not be shaken
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound

And you scream, you scratch, you bite
You prey on my heart
And I know that you and I
Can never be apart

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Whoa oh oh, whoa
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Whoa oh oh, whoa
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh

You and I will not be shaken
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter

You and I will not be shaken
By the winter sound
But my voice is suffocating
In the winter sound1Embed
