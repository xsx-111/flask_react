Black Water Lyrics
I need nothing
To travel the sea
I need nothing
I need nothing
But there's something
Eating at me
Black water
Take over

Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea
Oh, oh-oh oh
Darker days are raining over me
Oh, oh-oh oh
In the deepest depths I lost myself
Oh, oh-oh oh
I see myself through someone else

The strange silence
Surrounding me
Grows closer
Feels colder
But I'm ready
To suffer the sea
Black water
Take over

Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea
Oh, oh-oh oh
Darker days are raining over me
Oh, oh-oh oh
In the deepest depths I lost myself
Oh, oh-oh oh
I see myself through someone else


Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea
Oh, oh-oh oh
Darker days are raining over me
Oh, oh-oh oh
In the deepest depths I lost myself
Oh, oh-oh oh
I see myself through someone else

Swallowed by a vicious, vengeful sea
Oh, oh-oh oh
Darker days are raining over me
In the deepest depths I lost myself
Oh, oh-oh oh
I see myself through someone else10Embed
