Organs Lyrics
I am sorry this is always how it goes
The wind blows loudest when you've got your eyes closed
But I never changed a single colour that I breathe
So you could have tried to take a closer look at me

I am tired of punching in the wind
I am tired of letting it all in
And I should eat you up and spit you right out
I should not care, but I don't know how

So I take off my face
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong

I am sorry for the trouble, I suppose
My blood runs red, but my body feels so cold
I guess I could swim for days in the salty sea
But in the end, the waves will discolour me

So I take off my face
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I cough up my lungs
'Cause they remind me of how it all went wrong
But I leave in my heart
'Cause I don't want to stay in the dark

So I take off my face
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I pull out my tongue
'Cause it reminds me of how it all went wrong
And I cough up my lungs
'Cause they remind me of how it all went wrong
But I leave in my heart
'Cause I don't want to stay in the dark11Embed
