Human Lyrics
When the words
Weigh heavy on the heart
I am lost
And led only by the stars

Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

Breathe in, breathe out; let the human in
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
Breathe in, breathe out and let it in
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
Plants awoke, and they slowly grow beneath the skin
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
So breathe in, breathe out; let the human in

The air is silk
Shadows form a grin
If I lose control
I feed the beast within
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

Breathe in, breathe out; let the human in
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
Breathe in, breathe out and let it in
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
Plants awoke, and they slowly grow beneath the skin
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
So breathe in, breathe out; let the human in

Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

If I could only let go12Embed
