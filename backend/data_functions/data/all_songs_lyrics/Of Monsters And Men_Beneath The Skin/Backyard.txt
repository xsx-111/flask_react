Backyard Lyrics

I live a life of love
Hold me down, hold me down
I live a life of letting go
(Ooh)
Under a starlit night
I wrap myself in thin sheet of ice
Out there, the stars are crystallized

(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard in the dark
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard

'Cause you colour me clear
Now what are you, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, you colour me clear
Now what are you waiting for?

See how my mountains turn
From blue to black, from white to gray
I'm a bird, and a broken one
(Ooh)
The drops illuminate
And evaporate into a neon lake
I'm a beast, and a vicious one

(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard in the dark
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Find me in the backyard

'Cause you colour me clear
Now what are you, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, you colour me clear
Now what are you waiting for?

'Cause you colour me clear
Now what are you, what are you waiting for?
Yeah, you colour me clear
Now what are you waiting for?8Embed
