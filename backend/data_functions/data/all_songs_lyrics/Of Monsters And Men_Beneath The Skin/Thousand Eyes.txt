Thousand Eyes Lyrics
Undo this storm
Undo this storm
Undo this storm
And wait
I can't control
Withering wonders
Flowers that lose
Their shape

I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes

I'll be the calm
I will be quiet
Stripped to the bone
I wait
No, I'll be a stone
I'll be the hunter
A tower that casts
A shade
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes
I lie awake and watch it all
It feels like thousand eyes


I am the storm
I am the storm
I am the storm
So wait5Embed
