Your Head Got Misplaced Lyrics
You keep quiet, looking over your shoulder
You're careless at best, you're here because you don't learn

You've got a place to hide
Somewhere safe you found
So I locked you in
And I burned it down

I heard all about you, your plans and how they fell through
Your head got misplaced from everything that you do

You've got a place to hide
Somewhere safe you found
So I locked you in

And I want to take you up
Want to see you through
And I'll keep you there like I always do
And I want to take you up
Find a perfect fit
And I'll lay out your bed just like you never did
Somewhere safe you found1Embed
