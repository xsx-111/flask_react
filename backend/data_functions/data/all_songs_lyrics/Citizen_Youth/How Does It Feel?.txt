How Does It Feel? Lyrics
How does it feel to be all that you are
All that you want to be, is that what you want to be?
And how does it feel to be what you've become
What you said you would never be 'cause I don't feel anything
Anymore, so take me away

And how does it feel to fit into a mold
To let go of what you know and not have to hold your own
And how does it feel to be just like your friends
To catch up on what you missed as simple as you can get
And you still walk out alone

And you still walk out alone
And you still walk out alone
And you still walk out alone
And you still walk out alone
And you still walk out alone (How's it feel to let go)
And you still walk out alone (Of everything that you know)
And you still walk out alone (And how's it feel to let go)
And you still walk out alone (Of everything that you know)
And you still walk out alone (And how's it feel to let go)
And you still walk out alone (Of everything that you know)3Embed
