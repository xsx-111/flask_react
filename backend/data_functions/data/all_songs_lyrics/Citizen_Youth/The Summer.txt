The Summer Lyrics
I watched you burn, and I felt it
And you're spitting words like you're someone else
And I watched you run, I was screaming
And following you down, it seems I'm stuck
In the promise you made I'm counting out

And I don't want to know
And I don't want to know
And if I could catch you once, I'd see you right through

You said you'd stay, and you promised I finally see you out
Why'd you wait for the summer, to chew and spit me out?
I sit awake and wait impatiently
The same mistakes are waiting to be made, to be made
And I felt something that is in me, change
When I, I followed you down (Followed you down)

And I don't want to know
And I don't want to know
I wish I could write you off, I see you right through
And I don't want to know
And I don't want to know
How you could just set me off, I see you right through10Embed
