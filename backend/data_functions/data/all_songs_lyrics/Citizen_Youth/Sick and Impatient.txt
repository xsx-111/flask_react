Sick and Impatient Lyrics
I've wasted days, but they don't mind
There's something in my room
And it's telling me what I should do
And it's been in there for quite a while
And it taught me all I know
Where I should be and where I'll go
Will you save my life tonight?
I can see it in my mother's eyes
And the way she talks about me
Some things are better left to rot
I'm quick to push, I'm quick to shove
And the first to point the finger
No company could ever be enough
I'll stay outside tonight
I'll stay outside tonight

I got, I got sick
I got sick and impatient
I got, I got sick
I got sick and impatient

I spoke too soon, you made your move
You're walking with a smile
I'm wide awake, it's late, I'm driving
While the neighbors sleep, I'm cutting ties
Lose myself in my head
Convince myself to forget what is real
Will you save my life tonight?
Will you save my life tonight?
I got, I got sick
I got sick and impatient
I got, I got sick
I got sick and impatient

Will you save my life tonight?
Will you save my life tonight?2Embed
