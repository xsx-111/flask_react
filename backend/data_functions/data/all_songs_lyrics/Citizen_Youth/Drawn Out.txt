Drawn Out Lyrics
Slow down, I want to watch you on your own now
I've been keeping quiet for a while now that you're fine

Catch your breath before I get home in the morning
You walk outside in a hurry
Before I get home in the morning
You'll walk outside tonight
You'll walk outside tonight

Drawn out, I was empty, you were alright
I found all the pieces you left outside now that you're fine

Catch your breath before I get home in the morning
You walk outside in a hurry
Before I get home in the morning
You'll walk outside tonight
You'll walk outside tonight
(Before I get home in the morning)
You'll walk outside tonight1Embed
