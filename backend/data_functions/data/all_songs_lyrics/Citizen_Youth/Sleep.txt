Sleep Lyrics
We both fell asleep on the floor, then I left you there
You spent so many days alone, so I'll kill myself to make things fair
See, I just hated being tired 'cause I can't seem to sleep anymore
And you and all your friends were all right about me all along

Do you sleep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?

And I would love to be patient, but I just won't wait
I'm getting sick and tired of the smile that I fake every day
And I would love to speak my mind, but I can't think straight
And I would love to feel alive again, but I'm not used to change

Do you sleep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?

And if it makes you feel better, I'll be on my way
And all this time I sit around and think, but there's nothing to say
And if you want to feel better, I'll stay out of your way
And I would love to feel alive again, but I guess that can wait
Do you sleep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?
Do you sleep anymore?13Embed
