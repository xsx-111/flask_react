Figure You Out Lyrics
There's a silence in the room
I don't speak quite like you do
You got my fingers crossed
But I'll catch myself and I'll wish you off

And I never thought the words you'd cast
Would hurt so much for that (Well I won't look back)
And I never thought the one you trust
Would stab your back, I guess it's not so bad

There's a window in my room
I can't see clear like you do
I won't move my mouth and I'll stand up straight
Just to push you out
So I can see your insides out and figure you out

And I never thought the words you'd cast
Would hurt so much for that (Well I won't look back)
And I never thought the one you trust
Would stab your back, I guess it's not so bad
And I never thought I'd kill you off
When you're all I know for that (Well I won't look back)
And I never thought I'd lose it all
Then I heard your plans, I guess it's not so bad
It's not so bad
It's not so bad
So I cut you open so I could see you inside out
And figure you out2Embed
