Roam the Room Lyrics
Did the weight and all the pressure weed you out?
You got away but I still carry you around
I carry you around
I want to know what I've been fighting for
I want to know what I've become
And is there something else I'm waiting for?
Or is the damage finally done?
'Cause I'm done, I'm done

And it's hard to watch you roam the room
To watch you from the wall
And it's all I got to think about
It's hard to watch you roam the room
To watch you from the wall
And every day gets old

Did you speak the words or say nothing at all?
And how did you find a way to speak up when I'd call?
And when your friends say I'm a waste of time
Then you can find out on your own
And if it's coming down to pick a side
Then you can decide where to go
It's hard to watch you roam the room
To watch you from the wall
And it's all I've got to think about
It's hard to watch you roam the room
To watch you from the wall
And every day gets old

'Cause I'm done8Embed
