The Night I Drove Alone Lyrics
I ran away from you, now look how far I've got
I shared some secrets that I hope you'd keep
They're words that don't come out

And I should've crashed the car the night I drove alone
Escape from August cold, whoa

And you talk like someone else

I ran away from you, and now something's killing me
You hang me up as a souvenir of what I couldn't be

And I should've crashed the car when I was all alone
Escape from all I know, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

And you talk like someone else9Embed
