Speaking with a Ghost Lyrics
Overnight it's getting cold
When every day is different in Michigan
You never know
It's been a while since you've called
I'm speaking with a ghost and I'm wondering
How you're making out

And I went and spent that week trying to find you out
Every night, every night it feels the same
And I went and spent those nights driving by myself
Every night, every night it feels the same

Overnight I fell apart
I use to wonder where you've been, or where you were
I threw my face against the wall
So I won't wonder where you've been
Or where you are, and how you're making out

And I went and spent that week trying to find you out
Every night, every night it feels the same
And I went and spent those nights driving by myself
Every night, every night it feels the same
How're you making out, tonight?

And I went and spent that week trying to find you out
Every night, every night it feels the same
And I went and spent those nights driving by myself
Every night, every night it feels the same3Embed
