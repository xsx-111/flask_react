Ghost Story Lyrics
Maybe I’m just a ghost
Disappear when anybody’s close
Go through you when you try to hold
Try to hold me near

Maybe I’m just a ghost
Emptier than anybody knows
Maybe I’m on the ropes
Or I’m not even here
Yeah

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in trying to raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear
Oh, maybe I'm a ghost
Specter of the wrong curse
A thorn without a rose
Something people fear
Yeah

And every time I thought I walked through walls
It’s all becoming clear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in saying "Rescue me!"
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And every time I thought I walked through walls
It’s all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear...6Embed
