All Your Friends LyricsOn and on
You're told which side you're on
You're forced you're thrown
To become the scythe to cut the corn
And all your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they go
All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're thrown
Into the fire
Ten below
Call comes in on the radio
Over you go
And red now, all the rivers flow
The poppies grow
All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're blown
All your friends they
Ride into the sunset
Ride into the sunset
And they're taken home
Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Just ride and fire3Embed
