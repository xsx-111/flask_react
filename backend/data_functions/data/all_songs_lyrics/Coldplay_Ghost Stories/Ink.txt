Ink Lyrics
Got a tattoo that said "together thru life"
Carved in your name with my pocket knife
And you wonder when you wake up, will it be alright? Ooooh ooh
Feels like there's something broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a tattoo and the pain's alright, oooh oooh
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside (Ooooh ooh)

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colors
And I'm dying of thirst
All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts (Oh yeah yeah yeah)
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts39Embed
