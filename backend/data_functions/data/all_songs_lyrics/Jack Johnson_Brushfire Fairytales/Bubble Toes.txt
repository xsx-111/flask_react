Bubble Toes Lyrics
It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house in the woods
Would she love me forever, I know she could

I remember when you and me, mmm, how we used to be
Just good friends
Wouldn't give me none
But all I wanted was some

She's got a whole lot of reasons
She can't think of a single one
That can justify leaving
And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
Man he got too much time to waste
His dreams are like commercials
But her dreams are picture perfect and
Our dreams are so related though they're often underestimated
It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and

Well I was eating lunch at the DLG
When this little girl came and she sat next to me
I've never seen nobody move the way she did
Well she did and she does and she'll do it again
When you move like a jellyfish rhythm doesn't mean nothing
You go with the flow, you don't stop
Move like a jellyfish, rhythm is nothing
You go with the flow, you don't stop

It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house in the woods
Would she love me forever, I know
She la da da da da da

If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me
If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of the queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and
