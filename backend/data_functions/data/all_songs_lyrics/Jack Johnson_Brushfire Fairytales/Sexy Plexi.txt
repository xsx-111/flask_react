Sexy Plexi Lyrics
Sexy, sexy made up of plexi disasters
Pushing and pulling conservative rolling
Unlike plastic, easier to see through
Just like glass with no ring
Softer and sadder you sing
Sexy, sexy do your thing
Learn to be shy and then you can sting
Plexi, plexi bend don't shatter
Once you're broken, shape won't matter

You're breaking your mind
By killing the time that kills you
But you can't blame the time
'Cause it's only in your mind

Quickly, quickly grow and then you'll know
It is such an awkward show to see
And everyone you wanted to know
And everyone you wanted to meet
Have all
Gone away
Well they've all
Gone away and
You're breaking your mind
By killing the time that kills you
But you can't blame the time
'Cause it's only in your mind

You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
Mind, mindEmbed
