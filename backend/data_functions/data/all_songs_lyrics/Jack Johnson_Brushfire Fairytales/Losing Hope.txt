Losing Hope Lyrics
I got a faulty parachute, I got a stranger's friend
An exciting change in my butcher's blend
A symbol on the ceiling with the flick of a switch
Yeah, my newfound hero in the enemy's ditching

Well somebody's something was left in the room
And man, now that its gone, well, of course we assume
That somebody else needed something so bad
That they took everything that somebody had

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

The mark was left, man, it's never the same
Next time that you shoot, make sure that you aim
Open windows with passing cars
A brand new night with the same old stars

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change
Feed the fool
A piece of the pie
Make a fool of his system
Make a fool of his mind
Give him bottles of lies
And maybe he'll find
His place in heaven
Because he might just die

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

But hanging on is easy
When you've got a friend to call
When nothing's making sense at all
You're not the only one that's afraid of changeEmbed
