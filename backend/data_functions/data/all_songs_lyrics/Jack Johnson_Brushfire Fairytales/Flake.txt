Flake Lyrics
I know she said it's alright
But you can make it up next time
I know she knows it's not right
There ain't no use in lying
Maybe she thinks I know something
Maybe, maybe she thinks it's fine
Or maybe she knows something I don't
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying

It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, nah, no one likes to be let down

I know she loves the sunrise
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
And I know that when she said she's going to try
Well it might not work because of other ties and
I know she usually has some other ties and
I wouldn't want to break 'em, nah, I wouldn't want to break 'em
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
Until then, well, I'm going to have to lie too
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, nah, no one likes to be let down
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go

The harder that you try baby, the further you'll fall
Even with all the money in the whole wide world
Please, please, please don't pass me
Please, please, please don't pass me
Please, please, please don't pass me by
Everything you know about me now baby, you're going to have to change
You're going to have to call it by a brand new name, ooh
Please, please, please don't drag me
Please, please, please don't drag me
Please, please, please don't drag me down
And just like a tree down by the water baby I shall not move
Even after all the silly things you do
Please, please, please don't drag me
Please, please, please don't drag me
Please, please, please don't drag me down6Embed
