Posters Lyrics
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall, they don't look like him at all
So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all

He gets his courage from the can
It makes him feel like a man
Because he's loving all the ladies
But the ladies don't love him at all
Because when he's not drunk
He's only stuck on himself
And then he has the nerve
To say he needs a decent girl

Looking at herself but wishing she was someone else
Because the body of the doll don't look like hers at all
So she straps it up, she sets it in, she throws it up, it gets a grin
Laughing at herself because she knows she ain't born at all

All caught up in the trends
Well the truth began to bend
And the next thing you know man
There's just no truth left at all
Because when the pretty girl walks
She walks so proud
And when the pretty girl laughs
Oh man, she laughs so loud
And if it ain't this, then it's that
As a matter of fact
She hasn't had a day to relax
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly

Well I'm an energetic, hypothetic version of another person
Check out my outsides, there ain't nothing in here
Well I'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict
Check out my outsides, there ain't nothing in here

Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall, they don't look like him
So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all
Knows he ain't loved at all1Embed
