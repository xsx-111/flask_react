Dream Letter LyricsLady time, fly away
I've been thinkin'
'Bout my yesterdays
Oh please, listen darlin'
To my empty prayer:
Sleep inside my dreams tonight
All I need to know tonight
How're you and my child?
Oh is he a soldier or is he a dreamer?
Is he mama's little man?
Does he help you when he can?
Oh does he ask about me?
Ah just like a soldier boy, Ah but I fight in wars
The world never knows about
Oh but I never win them loud
Oh there's no crowds around me
When I get to thinkin' about the old days
When love was here to stay
I wonder if we'd ever tried
Oh what I'd give to hold you1Embed
