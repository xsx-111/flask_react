Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway) LyricsI was lost without a song, without a melody
You came into my hotel life
You made my room a home
Ah now, mama, don't you know what you done
Ah, you made the sunshine in the city
Oh, you warmed my heart
You changed an old man filled with pity
Back to a child again
Ah now, mama, can't you see what you done
So tell me darlin' if the feeling's wrong
Don't waste another day
Lord, the saddest thing I've ever known
Was to watch it die away
Ah now, mama, don't you lie don't you lie
Oh, how can my giving find the rhythm and the time of you
Unless you sing your songs to me
The smell of your sweet skin does entangle my dream
Oh may I stand here awhile living your smile
Oh, how could you ever know what you've done
You warmed my heart when I was so all alone
But all I have to give
Are my dreams of coming and going forever
Inside the rivers of time you'll find me waiting
For you to find peace in your mind
So we can love again
I feel what you feel
If you feel what you feel
And I see what you see
If you see what you see
So it goes on and on
On it goes, on and on
It's my heart and your heart
It's our hearts together
You sing and I'll bring
We'll both love together
And all I know is let it grow
All you'll find is peace of mind1Embed
