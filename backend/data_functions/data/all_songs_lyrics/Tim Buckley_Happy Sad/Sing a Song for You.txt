Sing a Song for You LyricsIn my heart is where I long for you
In my smile I search for you
Each time you turn and run away
I cry inside, my silly way
Just too young to know anymore
In my world the devil dances and dares
To leave my soul just anywhere
Until I find peace in this world
I'll sing a song everywhere I can
Just too young to know anymore
The wind covers me cold
The starry skies all around my eyes
Far behind the city moans
Well worthy of the people there
Oh, the psalms they love to hear
So let me sing a song for you
Just to help your day along
Let me sing a song for you
One I've known so very long
Oh please, would you find the time...2Embed
