Washing of the Water Lyrics
River, river, carry me on
Living river, carry me on
River, river, carry me on
To the place where I come from

So deep, so wide
Will you take me on your back for a ride?
If I should fall
Would you swallow me deep inside?
River, show me how to float
I feel like I'm sinking down
Thought that I could get along
But here in this water
My feet won't touch the ground
I need something to turn myself around

Going away, away toward the sea
River deep
Can you lift up and carry me?

Oh, roll on through the heartland
Until the sun has left the sky
River, river, carry me high
'Til the washing of the water
Make it all alright
Let your waters reach me
Like she reached me tonight
Letting go, it's so hard
The way it's hurting now
To get this love untied
So tough to stay with this thing
'Cause if I follow through
I face what I deny
I get those hooks out of me
And I take out the hooks that I sunk deep in your side
Kill that fear of emptiness, loneliness I hide

River, oh, river
River running deep
Bring me something
That will let me get to sleep

In the washing of the water
Will you take it all away?
Bring me something
To take this pain awayEmbed
