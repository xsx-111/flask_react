Kiss That Frog Lyrics
Jump in the water

Sweet little princess, let me introduce his frogness
You alone can get him singing
He's all puffed up, want to be your king
Oh you can do it

Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Lady kiss that frog

Splash, dash, heard your call
Bring you back your golden ball
He's going to dive down in the deep end
He's going to be just like your best friend
So what's one little kiss, one tiny little touch?
Aah, he's wanting it so much
I swear that this is royal blood
Running through my skin
Oh, can you see the state I'm in
Kiss it better, kiss it better
Kiss that frog
Get it into your head
He's living with you he sleeps in your bed
Can't you hear beyond the croaking
Don't you know that I'm not joking
Aah, you think you won't, I think you will
Don't you know that this tongue can kill

Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Lady kiss that frog

Let him sit beside you
Eat right off your plate
You don't have to be afraid
There's nothing here to hate
Princess, you might like it
If you lowered your defense
Kiss that frog and you will get your prince
Jump in the water, come on baby jump in with me
Jump in the water, come on baby get wet, get wet, get wet
Kiss that frog, lady kiss that frog
Get wet, get wetEmbed
