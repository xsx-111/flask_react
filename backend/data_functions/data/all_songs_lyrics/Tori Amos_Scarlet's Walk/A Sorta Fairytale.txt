A Sorta Fairytale Lyrics
On my way up north, up on the Ventura
I pulled back the hood and I was talking to you
And I knew then it would be a lifelong thing
But I didn't know that we, we could break a silver lining

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
A sorta fairytale with you

Things you said that day, up on the 101
The girl had come undone, I tried to downplay it
With a bet about us, you said that you'd take it
As long as I could, I could not erase it

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
A sorta fairytale with you

And I ride alongside
And I rode alongside you then
And I rode alongside till you lost me there in the open road
And I rode alongside till the honey spread itself so thin
For me to break your bread, for me to take your word
I had to steal it
And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
I could pick back up whenever I feel

Down New Mexico way, something about the open road
I knew that he was looking for some Indian blood
And find a little in you find a little in me
We may be on this road but
We're just impostors in this country, you know
So we go along and we said we'd fake it
Feel better with Oliver Stone
Till I almost smacked him, seemed right that night and
I don't know what takes hold out there in the desert cold
These guys think they must try and just get over on us

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
A sorta fairytale with you

And I was riding by, riding alongside
For a while till you lost me
And I was riding by, riding along till you lost me
Till you lost me in the rearview
You lost me, I said. yeah
Way up north I took my day
All in all, was a pretty nice day
And I, I put the hood right back where
You could taste heaven perfectly
Feel out the summer breeze
Didn't know when we'd be back
And I, I don't, didn't think we'd end up like
