Amber Waves Lyrics
Well, he lit you up like Amber Waves in his movie show
He fixed you up real good till I don't know you anymore
From ballet class to a lap dance straight to video
And the poolside news was that he would be launching you

Into every young man's bedroom you gave it up
On DVD and magazine you gave it up
A private rite of passage you gave it up
To every boy's sweet dream with their paper cuts

You said, "He's got a healing machine
It glows in the dark, glows in the dark"
You say, "There's not a lot of me
Left anymore, just leave it alone
But if you're by and you have the time
Tell the Northern lights to keep shining
Oh, lately it seems like they're drowning"

He could light you up and summon every swan to the lakeside
Off to Cabo San Lucas for some optical stimulus
Then you started to guess there was someone else through his flint glass
Seeing all of you immersed in his sepia
Into every young man's bedroom you gave it up
On DVD and magazine you gave it up
A private rite of passage you gave it up
To every boy's sweet dream with their paper cuts

You said, "He's got a healing machine
It glows in the dark, glows in the dark"
You say, "There's not a lot of me
Left anymore, just leave it alone
But if you're by and you have the time
Tell the Northern lights to keep shining
Oh, lately it seems like they're drowning"

So I went by, 'cause I had the time
Told the Northern Lights to keep shining
They told me to tell you they're wavingEmbed
