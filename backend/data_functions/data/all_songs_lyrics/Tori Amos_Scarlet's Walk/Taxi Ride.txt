Taxi Ride Lyrics
Lily is dancing on the table
We've all been pushed too far
I guess on days like this
You know who your friends are
Just another dead fag to you
That's all
Just another light missing
On a long taxi ride, taxi ride

And I'm down to your last cigarette and
This "We are one" crap as you're invading
This thing you call love, she smiles way too much

But I'm glad you're on my side
Sure I'm glad you're on my side still

You think you deserve a trust fund
Just because you want one
Sure you talk the talk when you need to, I fear
The whole world is starting to believe you
Just another dead fag to you
That's all
Just another light missing
In a long taxi line, taxi line
I'm down to your last cigarette and
This "We are one" crap as you're invading
This thing you call love, she smiles way too much

But I'm glad you're on my side
Sure I'm glad you're on my side still

Lily is dancing on the table (Lily is dancing on the air)
We've all been pushed too far today
Even a glamorous bitch can be in need
This is where you know the honey from the killer bees

I'm glad you're on my side
Sure I'm glad you're on my side
Sure I'm glad you're on my side still

Got a long taxi ride
Got a long taxi rideEmbed
