Strange Lyrics
Strange, thought I knew you well
Thought I had read the sky
Thought I had read a change in your eyes
So strange, woke up to a world
That I am not a part
Except when I can play it’s stranger

After all, what were you really looking for?
And I wonder when will I learn
Blue isn’t red, everybody knows this
And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn

Guess I was in deeper than I thought I was
If I have enough love for the both of us

“Just stay,” you said, “We’ll build a nest”
So I left my life
Tried on your friends, tried on your opinions
So when the bridges froze and you
Did not come home
I put our snowflake under a microscope
After all, what was I really looking for?
And I wonder when will I learn
Maybe my wish knew better than I did
And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn

Guess I was in deeper than I thought I was
If I have enough love for the both of us

So strange, now I’m finally in
The party has begun
It’s not like I can’t feel you still
But strange, what I will leave behind
You call me one more time
But now I must be leavingEmbed
