Gold Dust Lyrics
Sights and sounds
Pull me back down another year
I was here
I was here

Whipping past the reflecting pool
Me and you skipping school
And we make it up as we go along
We make it up as we go along

You said you raced from Langley
Pulling me underneath a cherry blossom canopy
Do I have? Of course I have beneath my raincoat
I have your photographs

And the sun on your face
I'm freezing that frame

And somewhere Alfie cries
And says, "Enjoy his every smile
You can see in the dark
Through the eyes of Laura Mars"
"How did it go so fast?"
You'll say as we are looking back
And then we'll understand
We held gold dust in our hands
Sights and sounds
Pull me back down another year
I was here
I was here

Gaslights glow in the street
Flickering past
Twilight held us in her palm
As we walked along
And we make it up as we go along
We make it up as we go along

Letting names hang in the air
What colour hair?
Autumn knowingly stared
Auburn crimson

And the day that she came
I'm freezing that frame
I'm freezing that frame

And somewhere Alfie smiles
And says, "Enjoy her every cry
You can see in the dark
Through the eyes of Laura Mars"
"How did it go so fast?"
You'll say as we are looking back
And then we'll understand
We held gold dust in our hands
In our handsEmbed
