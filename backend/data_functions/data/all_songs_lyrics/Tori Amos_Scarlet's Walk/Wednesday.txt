Wednesday Lyrics
Nothing here to fear
I'm just sitting around, being foolish
When there is work to be done
Just a hang-up call
And the quiet breathing of our Persian
We call Cajun on a Wednesday

So we go from year to year
With secrets we've been keeping
Though you say you're not a Templar man
Seems as if we're circling
For very different reasons
But one day the eagle has to land

Out past the fountain, I left by the station
I start the day in the usual way
Then think, "Well why not?" and stop for a coffee
Then begin to recall things that you say

No one's at the door
You suggest a ghost, perhaps a phantom
I agree with this in part
Something is with us
I can't put my finger on... is Thumbelina size 10
On a Wednesday?
So we go from year to year
With secrets we've been keeping
Though you say you're not a Templar man
You tell me to cheer up
You suspect we're oddly even
Even, still the eagle has to land

Out past the fountain, I left by the station
I start the day in the usual way
Then think, "Well why not?" and stop for a coffee
Then begin to recall things that you say
Pluck up the courage and snap, it's gone again
I start humming "When Doves Cry"
Can someone help me I think that I'm lost here
Lost in a place called AmericaEmbed
