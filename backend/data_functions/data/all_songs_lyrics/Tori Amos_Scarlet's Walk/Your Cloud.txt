Your Cloud Lyrics
Where the river cross, crosses the lake
Where the words jump off my pen and into your pages
Do you think, just like that, you can divide this?
You as yours, me as mine, to before we were us

If the rain has to separate
From itself, does it say
"Pick out your cloud?"
Pick out your cloud

If there is a horizontal line
Stay right here
That runs from the map of your body
I'm gonna stay with you
Straight through the land, shooting up
Stay right here
Right through my heart
Will this horizontal line
I'm gonna stay with you
When asked, know how to find
I'm gonna stay right here
Where you end, where I begin
Pick out your cloud
How light can play and form a ring
I found, I found, I found a thrill
Of rain that can change bows into arrows?
I found, I found, I found a thrill
Who we were, isn't lost before we were us
Indigo is his own, blue always knew this

If the rain has to separate
From itself, does it say
"Pick out your cloud?"
Pick out your cloud

If there is a horizontal line
Stay right here
That runs from the map of your body
I'm gonna stay with you
Straight through the land, shooting up
Stay right here
Right through my heart
Will this horizontal line
I'm gonna stay with you
When asked, know how to find
I'm gonna stay right here
Where you end, where I begin
Pick out your cloud
If the rain has to separate
From itself, does it say
"Pick out your cloud?"1Embed
