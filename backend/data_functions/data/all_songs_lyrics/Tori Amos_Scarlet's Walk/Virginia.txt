Virginia Lyrics
In the lush Virginia hills
They kept her as long as they could
'Cause they knew when the white brother found
White shell beads wrapped around her
Skin - a life-giving river
Her body open, as will his hand
With a "goodbye" there she goes

She may betray all she loves
And even wait for their savior to come
And in some things, maybe he'll be right
But, as always, the thing that he loves
He will change from her
Sunwise to clockwise to soul trading
Still she'll lay down her body
Covering him all the same

So hundreds of years go by
The red road carved up by sharp knife
She's a girl out working her trade
And she loses a little each day
To ghetto pimps and presidents
Who try and arouse her turquoise serpents
She can't recall what they represent
And when you ask, she won't know
She will betray all she loves
And even wait for their Savior to come
And in some things, maybe he'll be right
But, as always, the thing that he loves
He will change from her
Sunwise to clockwise to soul trading
Still she'll lay down her body
Covering him all the same

Oh, Virginia
Do you remember?
You won't, even you, Virginia
When the land held your hand
You won't, even you
When the land held your hand
Oh, Virginia, you won't
She will let you back in
Even you
Do you remember?
Oh, Virginia
You can't remember your name1Embed
