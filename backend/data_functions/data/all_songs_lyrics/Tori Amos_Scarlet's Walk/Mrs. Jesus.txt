Mrs. Jesus Lyrics
Life lines and suicide crimes
He found me in a state
Grabbed my purse and hitched a ride with a Mrs. Jesus
"How you been?"
I've been cruising a good invention
But in some ways I don't think it, it gets any easier

Your walking on the water bit
By far my favourite one
But now it seems we're drowning
In a drop of water, love

And even as I'm climbing up
The stairs I know there's heaven there
And then empty arms
That comes with the morning star

Well, made my bed of cut roses by understanding
That the cause, it just comes first with my Mrs. Jesus
The Gospel changes meaning if you follow John or Paul
And could you ever let it be the Mary of it all?
And even as I'm climbing up
The stairs I know there's heaven there
And then empty arms
That comes with the morning star

Well, lifelines and suicide crimes
There's something every day
And there's someone
Always paging my Mrs. Jesus

Your walking on the water bit
By far my favourite one
But now it seems we're drowning
In a drop of water, love

And even as I'm climbing up
The stairs I know there's heaven there
And then empty arms
That comes with the morning star

So if you get the Jones at the crossroad
The personals are great
If you're my way, let me love you, Mrs. JesusEmbed
