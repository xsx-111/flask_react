Dance And Boogie LyricsI see you every day
Our eyes locked into an exchange
Seems to me that we can never say
Why do we feel this way?
You know I think I'm hooked on you
It's about time we had a rendezvous
What can we do when it's so hard to say?
Let's take our chance while everyone's away
Dance through the night
We're dancing and boogie
Dance through the night
We're moving and boogie all night long
Dance through the night
We're dancing and boogie
All night long
Don't need to tell you that our friends don't approve
And though we're lovers in line
It's not so easy to move (say it again now)
All other judgement from the heartache and tears
When we're together it's joy
When we're apart it's just fear
Dance through the night
We're dancing and boogie
Dance through the night
We're moving and boogie all night long
Dance through the night
We're dancing and boogie
All night long
What do you do when there's silence in the air?
And you can feel the stare
And it cuts right through you
Just turn around to the people that you know
Just go, just go
Go!
Dance through the night
We're dancing and boogie
Dance through the night
We're moving and boogie all night long
Dance through the night
We're dancing and boogie
All night longEmbed
