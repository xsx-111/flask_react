I Love You LyricsThere used to be a lot of things
That I didn't know
And although they still exist
I try not to let them show
But I think that now you've seen me
For my true colours
I'm sure you recognise I'm more stupid than the others
But I love you
Oh I love you
And I will love you
'Til the day I die
There will never be a time when we have to say good-bye
I've seen you try to laugh at all of my bad jokes
And I've cooked you seven meals six of them of which you've choked
But it has taken me a while
To get used to this new feeling
When I woke up with a smile
Oh, I nearly started screaming
That I love you
Oh I love you
And I will love you
'Til the day I die
There will never be a time when we have to say good-bye
Because I love you
Oh I love you
And I will love you
'Till the day I die
There will never be a time when we have to say good-bye
Never be a time when we have to say good-bye
There will never be a time when we have to say good-byeEmbed
