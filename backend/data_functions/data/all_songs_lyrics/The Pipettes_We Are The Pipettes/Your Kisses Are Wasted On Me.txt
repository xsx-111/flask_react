Your Kisses Are Wasted On Me LyricsYour kisses are wasted on me
Your kisses are wasted on me
Your kisses are wasted on me
Your kisses are wasted on me
Boy, can't you see we're through?
Boy, I don't love you
Don't make me smile
For a while
Boy, get out of my face
Boy, I'm going back out to chase
Some other guy
Who I might like
And you might cry
For some time
(But you don't know it)
(No you don't know it)
And you might try
To hold my hand again
(But you don't know it)
Your kisses are wasted on me
Your kisses are wasted on me
Your kisses are wasted on me
Your kisses are wasted on me
Boy, you've gotta hear me clear
Boy, I want you outta here
Don't send me wild
You're just a child
And you might cry
For sometime
(But you don't know it)
(No you don't know it)
And you might try
To hold my hand again
(But you don't know it)
(No you don't know it)
And you might cry
For sometime
(You still don't know it)
Your kisses are wasted on meEmbed
