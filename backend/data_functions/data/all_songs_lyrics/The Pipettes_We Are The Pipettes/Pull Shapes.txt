Pull Shapes Lyrics
Dance with me, pretty boy, tonight (Tonight)
Dance with me and we'll be all right (Be all right)
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me
So follow my lead and we'll one, two, three
Pull shapes

I like to disco
I like to rock 'n' roll
Well, I like to hip hop
We can do it all, just don't let the music stop (Pull shapes)
I lead with my left hand
I stomp with my right foot
Well, I just wanna freak out
I just wanna move, I don't care what the song's about

Dance with me, pretty boy, tonight (Tonight)
Dance with me and we'll be all right (Be all right)
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me
So follow my lead and we'll one, two, three
Pull shapes
Is there a drum beat? (Pull shapes)
And is the bass sweet? (Pull shapes)
Well, then the rhythm is complete
So get up on the floor, it's time for you to move your feet

Dance with me, pretty boy, tonight (Tonight)
Dance with me and we'll be all right (Be all right)
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me
So follow my lead and we'll one, two, three
Pull shapes

What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops? (Pull shapes)
What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops? (Pull shapes)
Clap your hands if you want some more (Pull shapes)
Clap your hands if you want some more (Pull shapes)
Clap your hands if you want some more (Pull shapes)
Clap your hands if you want some more
Clap your hands if you want some more
Clap your hands if you want some more
Dance with me, pretty boy, tonight (Tonight)
Dance with me and we'll be all right (Be all right)
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me
So follow my lead and we'll one, two, three (Pull shapes)
Dance with me, pretty boy, tonight (Pull shapes)
Dance with me and we'll be all right (Pull shapes)
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me (Pull shapes)
So follow my lead and we'll one, two, three
