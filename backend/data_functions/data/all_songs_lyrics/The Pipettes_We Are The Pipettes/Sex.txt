Sex LyricsHe said we could talk about gossip
We could talk about lies
He said we could talk about rumours
We could do whatever I like
Then he said, Let's stop with all the talking
Why not try something new?
Because there's no need for any talking
In what we're about to do
Rest your pretty head, your pretty head
(Just rest, just rest, just rest your pretty head)
Don't trouble your pretty head, your pretty head
You know I'm all for conversation
I'm really quite romantic you know
But why not get right to the point
It's not that often we're left alone
No offence, but when you get going
You really can be quite a bore
Now, please don't take this the wrong way
But my ears are getting sore
Rest your pretty head, your pretty head
(Just rest, just rest, just rest your pretty head)
Don't trouble your pretty head, your pretty head
We spent a winter and a spring
Just listening not talking
Come weather rain or shine
But no-one ever told you then
The conversations in my head
Helped me to pass the time
Rest your pretty head, your pretty head
(Just rest, just rest, just rest your pretty head)
Don't trouble your pretty head, your pretty head
Rest your pretty head, your pretty head
(Just rest, just rest, just rest your pretty head)
Don't trouble your pretty head, your pretty headEmbed
