Your Love For Me LyricsOh, your love for me
Oh, your love for me is so true
Your love for me, oh, your love for me
Is so true
Your love for me, it's so true
Why can't I be
Oh, why can't I be
As good to you?
You said don't mistake
Pleasure for happiness
It's not the same
Oh, I'd give up all of that
For the chance that I might retain
Your love (your love, your love)
Your love (your love, your love)
Your love (your love, your love, your love)
Your love (your love, your love)
Your love (your love, your love)
Your love (your love, your love)
Everyone knows, everybody knows
That we're young
But it's not every day, it's not every day
You fall in love with someone
So please don't mistake
Pleasure for happiness
It's not the same
Won't you give up all of that
For the chance that you might retain
My love (my love, my love)
My love (my love, my love)
My love (my love, my love, my love)
My love (my love, my love)
My love (my love, my love)
My love (my love, my love)
Baby, I know
It's not always easy
But please don't leave me
I want to try
I don't care if you've got your secrets
Oh, you can keep them
As far away from
Our love (our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love)
Oh, our love (our love, our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love)
Oh, our love (our love, our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love)
Our love (our love, our love)
Oh, our love (our love, our love)Embed
