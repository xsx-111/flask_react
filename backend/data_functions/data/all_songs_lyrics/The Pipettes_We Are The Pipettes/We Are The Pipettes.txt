We Are The Pipettes LyricsGwenno!
Riotbecki!
Rosay!
1, 2, 3, lets go!

Take us, take us to your planet
We've got enough, we can't stand it
Give us your soul and we'll can it, can it, can't it, can it
We've taken all we can manage
Just say a word and we'll ban it
Make us a deal and we'll land it
And we'll brand it

We are The Pipettes
And we've got no regrets
If you haven't noticed yet
We're the prettiest girls you've ever met
We are The Pipettes
We will drop you in our nets
When you're crying in your bed
You'll hope we haven't finished with you yet

Take us, take us to your planet (planet)
Give us your mind and we'll scan it (scan it)
Send us a ship and we'll man it, 'cos we mean it (uh huh)
Throw us the line we've been handed
Lend us some film we'll be candid
Give us some wheels, and make us some meals, do you know how I feel?
We are The Pipettes
And we've got no regrets
If you haven't noticed yet
We're the prettiest girls you've ever met
We are The Pipettes
We will drop you in our nets
When you're crying in your bed
You'll hope we haven't finished with you
We are The Pipettes
And we've got no regrets
If you haven't noticed yet
We're the prettiest girls you've ever met
We are The Pipettes
We will drop you in our nets
When you're crying in your bed
You'll hope we haven't finished with you yet
We haven't finished with you yet
We haven't finished with you yetEmbed
