Why Did You Stay? LyricsYou used to tell me that you loved me everyday
I didn't know what to say
But there was never any doubt I always knew
That to me you'd stay true
But my heart never could be so committed
For all those transgressions you permitted
Why did you stay?
Why did you stay?
Why did you stay when I treated you that way?
I was so cruel
(But he was so kind)
Why did I feel I had to leave you behind?
(But he was so sweet)
Oh yeah
Well, I've had just about enough of sweet
Why did you stay?
Why did you stay?
Why did you stay when I treated you that way?
Why did you stay?
Why did you stay?
Why did you stay?
Why did you stay?
What did you say?
Why did you stay with me?Embed
