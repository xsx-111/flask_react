Tell Me What You Want LyricsOur eyes meet all the time
Your eyes permanent on mine
Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
You've been looking at me for days
I don't go for secretive games
Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
I need a kind, and honest man. (honest man)
So come and talk to me. (If that's your plan?)
You could be mine
If you want me, baby, that's fine
But don't keep up this old line
Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
I need a kind, and honest man. (honest man)
So come and talk to me. (If that's your plan?)
You could be mine
Oh, a kind, and honest man. (honest man)
So come and talk to me. (If that's your plan?)
You could be mine
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
You could be mine
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
Tell me what, tell me what you want
You could be mineEmbed
