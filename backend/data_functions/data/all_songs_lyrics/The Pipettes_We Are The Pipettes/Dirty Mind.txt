Dirty Mind LyricsHe's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
On her way from the school
She saw him, she saw him
In a second she knew
She wanted him, oh she wanted him
There was no trace on him
Of filth, grime or dirt
An overwhelming urge
To smile, laugh and flirt
There she goes with a twinkle in her eye
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why
There she goes with a twinkle in her eye
Don't take a genius to understand the reason why
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
This girl he thought she was
Living in a dream
It's just that he was
Exceptionally clean
All the boys that she, that she had known before
Avoided hygiene
Around at his house
You could eat off the floor
Which was slightly unnerving
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do?
I feel positively filthy standing next to you
Hygiene boy, oh what am I to do?
I feel positively filthy standing next to you
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
She got to know his mind intimately
She was surprised to find
Something of an anomaly
You see this perfect boy
Wasn't quite so pristine
He had ideas that would (He had ideas that could)
Make the Devil scream
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna find
Dirty mind, don't know what you're gonna find
He's got a dirty mind, just don't know what you're gonna findEmbed
