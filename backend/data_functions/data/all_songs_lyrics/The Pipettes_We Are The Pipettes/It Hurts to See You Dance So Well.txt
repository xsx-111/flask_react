It Hurts to See You Dance So Well LyricsHalf past one on the dancefloor
And my thoughts have turned to murder (thoughts have turned to murder)
Total strangers feel my eyes
Burning into them
They know that I wanna kill them
'Cos I can't get over you
And I can see them looking at you
And I just can't, can't get over you
It hurts to see you dance so well
Quarter to two on the dancefloor
But my feet won't dance no more (feet won't dance no more)
I've got no spirit for dancing
Since you walked right out the door
Now all my moves are flawed
Cos I can't get over you
And I can see them dancing up to you
And I just can't, can't get over you
It hurts to see you looking so fine
It hurts to see you dance so well
I remember the times that we kissed
And the beats my heart missed
But our feet never missed a beat
When we were dancing cheek to cheek
And you knew all the best moves
And the funkiest grooves
But you never knew
How much I was in love with you
And now it's two o'clock on the dancefloor
And I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home aloneEmbed
