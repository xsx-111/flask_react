Judy LyricsI knew a girl and her name was Judy
She used to do things I thought were rude
But I never said anything to her face
'Cos my friends all said she'd kick my arse all over the place
Used to think she was kinda cool (kinda cool)
Saw her walking all around the school (around the school)
But all the boys would stop and turn their heads
Oh but all the girls wished she was dead
Judy what you gonna do
When you're older and no-one wants to know you?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you
Now me and Judy we're the best of pals (best of pals)
Took me dancing till the early hours (the early hours)
And she showed me things I've never seen
Mum always asked me where I'd been when I'm with
Judy what you gonna do
When you're older and no-one wants to know you?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you
When you go, home at night
Are you still looking for a fight?
You know your mum is not that mean
But still you want to, rip out her spleen
Judy what you gonna do
When you're older and no-one wants to know you?
I will look out for you if you will look out for me
I know I'm not as hard as you
But I think I can see right through you
What's in your head?Embed
