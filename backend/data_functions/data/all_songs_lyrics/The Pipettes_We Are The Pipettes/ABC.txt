ABC LyricsHe knows all about the movements of the planets
But he don't know how to move me
He knows about the sonic spectrum dammit
But he don't know if it's groovy
He knows about A-B-C, 1-2-3, X-Y-Z
But he don't know about X-T-C
A-B-C, 1-2-D even I
Ain't in any of his categories
He's kinda tall and kinda shy
He's always asking me why
He's always got his head in a book
He doesn't care how I look
He cares about
A-B-C, 1-2-3, X-Y-Z
But he don't know about X-T-C
A-B-C, 1-2-D even I
Ain't in any of his categories
He's the kinda guy who knows just what he knows
He's the kinda guy who oh oh woah oh oh oh
A-B-C, 1-2-3, X-Y-Z
But he don't know about X-T-C
A-B-C, 1-2-D even I
Ain't in any of his categories
A-B-C, 1-2-3, X-Y-Z
But he don't know about X-T-C
A-B-C, 1-2-D even I
Ain't in any of his categoriesEmbed
