Baby, Just Be Yourself LyricsOoh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah
I know you've had good times
And you thought what you love would last forever
But I can see that you're unhappy
And it's getting you down
And that pretty face of yours looks bad wearing a frown
Look him in the face and tell him that you're leaving
It'll be too late if you leave it until tomorrow
Oh, I know it's hard and he tore your soul apart
But forgive him now and you'll forgive your heart for wasting any time
Baby, just be yourself
Baby, just be yourself
We've had this conversation too many times
I see it every day, how much you compromise
It's so clear to everyone that he makes you blue
Look inside yourself, I know you know just what to do
Look him in the face and tell him that you're leaving
It'll be too late if you leave it until tomorrow
Oh, I know it's hard and he tore your soul apart
But forgive him now and you'll forgive your heart for wasting any time
Baby, just be yourself
Baby, just be yourself
Baby, just be yourself
Baby, just be yourself
Baby, just be yourselfEmbed
