Only You Know and I Know Lyrics
You know, we really only wanna hear the things we like to say
But if I said to you "Please, don't do it", you do it anyway
Sometimes, I know we gotta be cruel, be cruel to be kind
When I ask you "What you see in me?", you say "Our love is blind"

'Cause only you know and I know the things we mean to say
Only you know and I know the things we mean to say, oh

Whenever I think I know you better, better than I know myself
I open up and give you everything, then you say "Okay, what else?"
And when I run away, you always cry, you always overreact
But I don't know if you know how you really feel, but you better know before I get back

'Cause only you know and I know the things we mean to say
Only you know and I know the things we mean to say

Just try to remember, now, I'm the one you love
You told me, ooh, try to remember, I'm the one you're always thinking of
You told me, please, try to remember before I walk away
Remember, it's not good enough telling me the way it was yesterday

'Cause only you know and I know the things we mean to say
Only you know and I know the things we mean to say
Yes, only you know and I know the things we mean to say
Only you know and I know the things we mean to say

Only you know and I know
Only you know and I knowEmbed
