Rehab Lyrics
Long day lay me low
Lay low

Head burning drunk
I don't need none, that's right, man, I'm fine
But what I've got to know
Is have I wasted time? My eyes
Are blind to almost everything

And I'm drowning
Through sorrow
You recognize me
Be me, yeah

Under the silk
In a box of pine and that's dying
Not a single other life
Ever will have felt my price
Is it worth the risk to be revived?

And I'm dying
I'm hollow
It won't deny me
Be me, yeah
How long will I stay?
They'll take the pain away
On and outta my mind
Gimme some medicine

And I'm drowning
Through sorrow
It won't deny me
Be me, yeah
Yeah, one more time

Long day kill me longEmbed
