Swan Song Lyrics
My time, all my life
Some way, I saved
The memory, the pending
The family, surround me

A god-given time (God-given time)
A god-given gift of life (God-given gift of life)
A time to take away, to kill the pain
To give me to the ground

The pills, the windowsill
Razor blade, great escape
So lonely, the feeling
The slipping, the bleeding

Good lord, where are you found?
Carry judgement way underground
I hear you laughing out loud
Should've changed my way by now

Hero
Hero
Hero
Hero
A god-given time (God-given time)
A god-given gift of life (God-given gift of life)
A time to take away, to kill the pain
To give me to the ground

Thanks
No, thank youEmbed
