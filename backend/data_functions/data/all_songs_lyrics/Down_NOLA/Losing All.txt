Losing All LyricsThis is one called "Losing All"
Oh yeah
My brain distorts the pleasure
No facts behind my eyes
This pain I've come to treasure
Being down has become my life
Don't know which one is real
Been kicked in the groin
I drown the way I feel
Though I will to go
Losing all
I'm lord of misery
I'm king of wrath
I'm a broken man of the world
In a state of
My wrists are slit
I'm losing all
Gun at my head
I'm losing all
My bones are broken
I'm losing all
Lost all I had
I'm losing all
Losing all, fuck
Losing all
Losing all
Losing all
Losing allEmbed
