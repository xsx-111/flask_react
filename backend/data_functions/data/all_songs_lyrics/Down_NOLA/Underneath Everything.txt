Underneath Everything Lyrics
Woe to me, battered man
Raise the monolith
Demonize, my spirit rise
Like days the world forgets
Down the drain, laid to lame
A fool-ass hearty bliss
Borderline suicide
Celebrate before my death

Promised land divide (Promised land doesn't exist)
That's why the world lies
I give up, that's enough
I give up
I'm underneath my life

Dog in heat, beware the street
It's there you'll meet your end
Poverty is not for me
But I'll take her back again
To prove a point, to laugh it off
To cross you from my path
Grip the life, pull the cord
A much inspired wrath (A much inspired wrath)
Your promised land divide (Promised land doesn't exist)
That's where the world lies
Promised land divide
That's where the world lies
I give up, that's enough
I give up
I'm underneath my life, yeah
I give up, that's enough
I give up
Give up

I give up, that's enough
I give up (Give up)
I'm underneath my life, yeah
I give up, that's enough
I fucking give up
I'm underneath my life, yeah
I'm underneath my life, yeah, yeah
I'm underneath my life

Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
Carry meâ€”Embed
