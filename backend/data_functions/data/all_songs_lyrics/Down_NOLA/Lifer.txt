Lifer Lyrics
Free at last, I'm the past
Undone in unknown prison, I'm holding on
Peace and need, a mouth to feed
I'm standing way on the other side

I'm staring right back at my cell
And through its frozen image
I'm laughing right back at my hell
Lifelong

Arms in knots, liver spot
My blood is paving your woes
Stealing keys sold to me
It kills the brotherhood writhes with pain

I'm staring right back at my cell
And through its frozen image
I'm laughing right back at my hell
Lifelong

Oh
Lifer, lifer, lifer
Lifer, lifer, lifer
I'm staring right back at my cell
And through its frozen image
I'm laughing right back at my cell
Oh
I'm staring right back at my cell
And through its frozen image
I'm laughing right back at my hell
Life
