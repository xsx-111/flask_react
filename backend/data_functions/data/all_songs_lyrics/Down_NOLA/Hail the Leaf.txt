Hail the Leaf Lyrics
Brave river
I can't sail
Lone feeling
That I might fail

So I just smoke
Let me tread, stoned

Sixth hour
Fail to rise
And I cower
In reality's eyes

So I just smoke
Let me tread, stoned
(Smoke)
(Stoned)

I have fallen
Scattered away
Alone I'll cry
Broken shame
So I just smoke
Let me tread, stoned

I can't feel you, you can't breathe
No more sadness, no more pain
Not what feeds your broken ways
No more sadness, no more woeEmbed
