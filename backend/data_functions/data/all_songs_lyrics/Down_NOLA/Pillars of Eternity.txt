Pillars of Eternity Lyrics
Crumbling world falls through my hand
In my mouth taste bitter sand
Grass is burning, pulse is slow
Drip by drip, I backwards grow
Crawl

Fade, fade, I hate
I'll die within my fade

Wine, song, women, birth
This deflowered Mother Earth
Planting, plowing, how she grieves
Seeds that grow these dying trees
Crawl

Fade, fade, I hate
I'll die within my fade
True
Crawl

Fade, fade, I hate
I'll die within my fadeEmbed
