Eyes of the South Lyrics
Goddamn

This time it's real
It's a love that I feel
I may be tainted but God knows it's good to me
'Cause you see

I leave my woes
At stranger's road dispose
And let the sun back on my face
It's a soul sense of pride
Good lord, the south is blind
But she gives me so much suffrage with my pain

I feel the strain
When I get behind a big slow day
I've fucked it all
Was that down? Was that family?

I leave my woes
At stranger's road dispose
And let the blood back in my veins
It's a soul sense of pride
Good lord, the south is blind
But she will never bury her head in shame
Please let me die there
Cold world leaves me there
Let me dieEmbed
