Speed Your Love To Me Lyrics
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
I'd love to hold on
Love to see the fires in motion
Love to feel a free world turn tonight


Run till we come, until we be
Speed your love to me
She would like to make a wish
Twenty fourth cannot be this
He moved at the speed of light
Through the day and through the night
Fire from the flame of youth
Fire


Just my imagination, just my imagination
You go to my head, you go to my head
With the flames that go higher and higher
And higher and higher and higher and higher
Over and over to me, speeds your love
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
I'd love to hold on
Love to see the fires in motion
I'd love to feel a free world turn tonight

Just my imagination, just my imagination
You go to my head, you go to my head
With the flames that go higher and higher
And higher and higher and higher and higher
Over and over to me, speeds your love


You go to my head, you go to my head
You go to my head, over me
Higher and higher, higher and higher
All across to meEmbed
