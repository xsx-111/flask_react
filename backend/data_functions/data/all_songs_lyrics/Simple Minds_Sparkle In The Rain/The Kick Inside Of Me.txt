The Kick Inside Of Me LyricsYou put the storm out, that's up in my head
You put the call out
Beside of me, kick up inside of me
And you steal the world and live to survive
And shake out the ghosts and then you turn around
In spite of me, kick up inside of me
One for the first time
Two for the last time
Three for the thrill and
Four for the last time
As far as I can see, you're gonna
Move deep deeper deep inside of me
Kick away my life kick away
You put the fear in me, kick away, kick away
As far as I can see you move deep deep inside of me
Take me away, take me away, up to another day
Open up the way, lead me away in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
You put the storm out, that's up in my head
You put the call out
Beside of me, kick up inside of me
And we steal the world and live to survive
Shake out the ghosts and turn around
In spite of me, shake up the ghosts inside of me
One for the first time, two for the last time
Three for the thrill, and four for the last time
As far as I can see, you're gonna
Move deep deeper deep inside of me
Take me away, ah ah ah until another day
Take me away, kick away
As far as I can see you put the fear inside of me
Kick awayEmbed
