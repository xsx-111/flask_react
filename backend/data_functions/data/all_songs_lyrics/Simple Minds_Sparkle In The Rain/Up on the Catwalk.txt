Up on the Catwalk LyricsUp on the catwalk, a big wheel is spinning
And dollars to Deutchmarks and pennies from heaven
And up on the catwalk there's one hundred million
With letters from thousands that say "Just who are you?''
There's one thousand names that can spring up in my mind
But you'd call it blackmail and that's just not my kind
And up on the catwalk and up on the catwalk
And I don't know why
I will be there, I will be there, I will be there
I will be there, I will be there
Up on the catwalk there's street politicians
That crawl in from Broadway, say "Then who are you?"
And up on the catwalk there's one thousand postcards
From Montevideo, say that I'll be home soon
And get out of Bombay and go up to Brixton
And look around to see just what is missing
And up on the catwalk and girls call for mother
And dream of their boyfriends
And I don't know why

I will be there, I will be there, I will be there
I will be there, I will be there
Tonight, under the crystal light
I'll tell you everything I need
Tonight, under the crystal light
Surrender everything to me
Up on the catwalk and you dress in waistcoats
And got brilliantino and friends of Kim Philby
And float through the nighttime like manna from heaven
But what do I know, and just what do I know?
And up on the catwalk and in sweat that glistens
And I don't know why and I don't know why
I don't know why

Angel
Angel
Angel
Angel
One thousand names that spring up in my mind
One thousand names that spring up in my mind
Like Deodato
Michaelangelo
Robert de Niro
So many others
Nastassja Kinski
And Martin Luther
There's room for others
Away from me, oh
Up on the catwalk
Up on the catwalk
Up on the catwalk
I don't know why
Up on the catwalkEmbed
