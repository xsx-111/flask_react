1 of the 2 LyricsOh yeah you're all cracked up fury
Won't get the jury to defend you
You tried but you couldn't cry
When they see you
You want me to hang around
With you always
But you lie and die when
All you ever give me is disgrace
That's the way down
That's the way down
That's sedation
That's sedation
One of the two
One of the two
With our saturation eyes
You think you can disguise all those mean things
But can you grovel in the dust
Masochistic lust make the song sing
Oh yeah you're all cracked up fury
Won't get the jury to defend you
You tried but you couldn't cry
When they see you
That's the way down
That's the way down
That's sedation
That's sedation
One of the two
One of the two
Oh yeah you're all cracked up fury
Won't get the jury to defend you
You tried but you couldn't cry
When they see you
You want me to hang around
With you always
But you lie and die well
All you ever give me is disgrace
That's the way down
That's the way down
That's sedation
That's sedation
One of the two
One of the two
One of the two
One of the two
One of the twoEmbed
