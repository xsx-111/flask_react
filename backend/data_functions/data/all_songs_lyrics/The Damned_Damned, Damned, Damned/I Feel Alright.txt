I Feel Alright LyricsHey Keith...
Outa my mind on a Saturday night
Nineteen seventy seven baby is rollin' in sight
Radio burning up above
Beautiful baby be my love
Alright feel cool always
Alright feel cool always
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
Where's your baby burn my heart
Take your baby burn my heart
Fall apart now baby fall apart
Where's your baby burn my heart
Alright feel cool always
Alright feel cool always
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
(Instrumental Break)
Outa my mind on a Saturday night
Nineteen seventy seven baby is rollin' in sight
Radio burning up above
Beautiful baby be my love
Alright feel cool always
Alright feel cool always
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
Feel alright1Embed
