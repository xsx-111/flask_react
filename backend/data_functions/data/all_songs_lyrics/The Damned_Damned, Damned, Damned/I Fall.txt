I Fall LyricsI gotta full moon
A smaller room than I need
A candy store a sexy whore
Yes I bleed
A sifting sand and an electronic hand
Yes I'm fine
I've got a pissed of god a government shock
Yes I'm blind
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fall
My mind's a raging blame
A crying shame and I'm sad
A city of sin a bottle of gin
So dog-gone bad
A cool reaction for the big attraction
That's fine
A pissed off god a government shock
Well I'm blind
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fall
I'm a falling angel
Falling down
Be a falling angel
Won't you come around?
Don't be scared to follow
It's no crime
You're a falling angel
Before your time
(Instrumental Break)
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fallEmbed
