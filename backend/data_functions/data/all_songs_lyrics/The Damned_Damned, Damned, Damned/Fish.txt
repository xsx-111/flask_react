Fish LyricsWell I've seen you hanging round and round
On the streets with something that's on your mind
Don't you think that I'm being fresh?
Only want to lay with you
I promise you won't smell no fish
I said fish
Well I don't want you to think I'm being obscene
When I say say say I wanna hold your hand
Feeling kind of cold need something hot to hold
Only wanna lay with you
I promise you won't smell no fish
I said fish
(Instrumental Break)
Fish
Fish
Well I've seen you hanging round and round
On the streets with something that's on your mind
Don't you think that I'm being fresh
Only wanna lay with you
I promise you won't smell no fish
I said fish
I said fish
I said fishEmbed
