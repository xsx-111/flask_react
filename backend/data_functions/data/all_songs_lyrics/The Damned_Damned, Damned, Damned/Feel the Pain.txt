Feel the Pain LyricsI know you're cold but I've seen it before
I'll take a chance on the wine
Your starched white lips introvenous she drips
In fear of turning blind
Hair to grey and some guys say
Shows you're shows you're growing old
Do it again I can't explain
The light sure seems so cold
Feel the pain it leaves no stain
Feel the pain the name of the game
Drop some blues time to choose
Why your heart is just a stabbing
Bloody eyes can't describe
The nature of your hacking
Back to front the blade tastes blunt
In the safety of your bedroom
No desire to touch the fire
It's just a just a sad obsession
Feel the pain
It leaves no stain (leaves no stain)
Feel the pain
The name of the game
Feel the pain
It leaves no stain (leaves no stain)
Feel the pain
The name of the game Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the painEmbed
