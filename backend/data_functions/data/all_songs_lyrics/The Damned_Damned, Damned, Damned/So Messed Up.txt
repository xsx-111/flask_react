So Messed Up LyricsOne, two, three oh she's so
Messed up she don't even ball
Well she's so messed up she has no fun at all
She's a sad case of hit and run
I think that I would rather fuck her mum
Oh yeah her face is such a mess
The best thing she can do is die
Oh well I'd save her the trouble
But I bet you'd still call it a crime
Oh would you now
So messed up well she's so messed up
Oh yeah she's so messed up so messed up
So messed up
So messed up
So messed up
So messed up
Lying in the gutter
So messed up
Flat on her face
So messed up
So messed up
So messed up
So messed up
Oh she's so messed up she don't feel the pain
Oh she's so messed up she's always been the same
Oh she's so messed up she don't feel the pain
I think know what I think she ain't even got a brainEmbed
