See Her Tonite Lyrics1 2 3 go
Well it's not so clear she's got nothing to say
It don't happen at all it's not her day
She don't like god and plastic's a con
She can't stand fools who think it's right to be wrong
Oh she's so cool see her tonite
Yeah she's no fool I wanna see her tonite
She don't fit in any so called scene
She don't like going where she's already been
Afraid rock'n'roll's gonna end up like art
She can't like ending what she can't even start
Oh she's so cool see her tonite
Oh she's no fool I wanna see her tonite
Oh she's so cool I wanna see her tonite
Yeah she's no fool I wanna see her tonite
(Instrumental Break)
It's not so clear she's got nothing to say
It don't happen at all it's not her day
She don't like god and plastic's a con
She can't stand fools who think it's right to be wrong
Oh she's so cool see her tonite
Oh she's no fool I wanna see her tonite
Oh she's so cool I wanna see her tonite
Oh she's no fool I wanna see her tonite
I wanna see her tonite
I wanna see her tonite
I wanna see her tonite
I wanna see her tonite
I wanna see her tonite
I wanna see her tonite
I wanna see her toniteEmbed
