Love Kills Lyrics
If you're looking for love
Get a heart made of steel 'cause you know that love kills
Don't go messing with love
It'll hurt you for real, don't you know that love kills?
If you're looking for love
Get a heart made of steel 'cause you know that love kills
Don't go messing with love
It'll hurt you for real, don't you know that love kills?

Protect yourself 'cause you'll wreck yourself
In this cold hard world, so check yourself
You conceal your dreams and you shield yourself
'Til that one kind soul reveals itself
Protect yourself 'cause you'll wreck yourself
In this cold hard world, so check yourself
You conceal your dreams and you shield yourself
'Til that one kind soul reveals itself

If you're looking for love
Get a heart made of steel 'cause you know that love kills
Don't go messing with love
It'll hurt you for real, don't you know that love kills?
If you're looking for love
Get a heart made of steel 'cause you know that love kills
Don't go messing with love
It'll hurt you for real, don't you know that love kills?
And I know when you're in too deep
Used to think of me sometimes
Stockholm syndrome in misery
There's a penalty for love crimes

Protect yourself 'cause you'll wreck yourself
In this cold hard world, so check yourself
You conceal your dreams and you shield yourself
'Til that one kind soul reveals itself
Protect yourself 'cause you'll wreck yourself
In this cold hard world, so check yourself
You conceal your dreams and you shield yourself
'Til that one kind soul reveals itself

And I know when you're in too deep
Used to think of me sometimes
Stockholm syndrome in misery
There's a penalty for love crimes

Protect yourself 'cause you'll wreck yourself
(If you're looking for love)
In this cold hard world, 'cause you know that love kills
You conceal your dreams and you shield yourself
(Don't go messing with love)
In this cold hard world, don't you know that love kills?1Embed
