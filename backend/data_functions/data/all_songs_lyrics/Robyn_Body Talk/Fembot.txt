Fembot Lyrics
I've got some news for you
Fembots have feelings too
You split my heart in two
Now what you gonna do?

(Once you've gone tech, you ain't never goin' back, uh
I'm high tech, baby)

Fresh out the box, the latest model
Generator running on full throttle
Can I get a fuel up? Hit the bottle (Reboot)
I've got a lotta automatic booty applications
Got a CPU maxed out sensation
Looking for a droid to man my station (Reboot)
Rock the nation (Rock it, baby)

I've got some news for you
Fembots have feelings too
You split my heart in two
Now what you gonna do?
(Ã„lskar dig)
My system's in mint condition
The power's up on my transistors
Working fine, no glitches
Plug me in and flip some switches
Pull up in docking position
Pop the hatch and hit ignition
B-b-burn out, baby
Ready for demolition

(Once you gone tech, you ain't never goin' back, uh)

My super brain is all binary
Circuitry mainframe tinfoil hair
I'm sipping propane topped with a cherry (Reboot)
In fact, I'm a very scientifically advanced hot mama
Artificially discreet, no drama
Digitally chic titanium armor (What?) (Reboot)
Ring the alarm-a

I've got some news for you
Fembots have feelings too (You know)
You split my heart in two
Now what you gonna do? (Here we go)
My system's in mint condition
The power's up on my transistors
Working fine, no glitches
Plug me in and flip some switches
Pull up in docking position
Pop the hatch and hit ignition
B-b-burn out, baby
Ready for demolition

(Once you gone tech, you ain't never goin' back, uh)
(Once you gone tech, you ain't never goin' back, uh)
(Once you gone tech, you ain't never goin' back, uh)
(Once you gone tech, you ain't never goin' back, uh)

Once you've gone tech, you never, ever goin' back
You gotta enter access code upon my back, my neck
Initiating slut mode; all space cadets on deck
There's a calculator in my pocket, got you all in check

My system's in mint condition
The power's up on my transistors
Working fine, no glitches
Plug me in and flip some switches (Baby)
Pull up in docking position
Pop the hatch and hit ignition
B-b-burn out, baby
Ready for demolition
My system's in mint condition
The power's up on my transistors
Working fine, no glitches
Plug me in and flip some switches
Pull up in docking position
Pop the hatch and hit ignition
B-b-burn out, baby
Ready for demolition1Embed
