Amargi ve Moo LyricsOne and a-two and a-three
Tumors seem like something you would collect
And poison seems like something you would take
In the offensive ways of all flesh
I am not ready
And cannot accept
That it is spread like a cancer
Goodnight, goodnight
Don't look, sweet old friend
Don't look, little sister
Don't answer, knock, knock, knock
Don't answer
Only answer for your fear of God
Don't answer for the nothings else
Ye, o night, o night, o night
Get away, ye, o night
Get off, get back, get off, o night
It is in fact maybe magnificent
In the bosoms of Abraham
I will behead all the saints
I will behead all the stars
Let lightning strike where it will
Coco-nuts, ba-nay-nays
Flowering vines in revolt
Let there be peace
And let it begin with thee
I am not ready and I cannot accept
I am not ready and I cannot accept
I am not ready and I cannot accept

Bl-bl-bl, bl-bl-bl, bl-bl-bl
Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl, bl-bl, bl-bl, bl-bl
Maybe you can revolt
If you can't revolt
Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl
Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl
Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl-bl

Chunks of your forearm
Chunks of your scalp
Chunks of your hunch
Now in a dumpster or in a sandwich
Your hairpiece perched upon your head
As if dropped from the ceiling by accident
Never not at worry
And now, never not blonde
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Let her be reborn as something unruinable
A meteor, a mushroom, a kakapo
A sparkling out of controlEmbed
