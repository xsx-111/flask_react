The Wrong Thing LyricsCharismatic, a trapped rabbit
Carpet beetle, huhu grub
Rice weevil, flatworm
Mealy bug, field cricket
Grass grub, caterpillar
Head louse, utopia
I can't bear what they say about you
Baptize a goat, sacrifice a goat
Let's shove in our wrong as deep, as deep as it will go
Soft in the head
And a moth besieged
A life alarmed
With you
Sheaf of wheat for flicking away
Sheaf of rye for flicks to come
No boat back to where we came from
Days spent eating and only eating
Without ease and without reflection
Apples, artichokes
Almonds, acorns
Asparagus, avocados
Apricots
Pulled through the sand
And yet not dulled
A life alarmed
With you
Cynthia, upon the throne
All the cubes and squares go home
Sit by me and do the wrongest thing
Boom are like we
And bunnies and pink are we
Boom go that cars thee
Cars are like weEmbed
