Girl with Basket of Fruit Lyrics
Take a break
The pressure rips her apart
The baby duck in you has died
Push it out and F-word a duck
It's a bad time to be a duck

Girl with basket of fruit

She sits on a bicycle and floats in space
She is in love with The Angel of Stop Laughing
When The Life Promiser makes her say any word
It comes out as a joke
He is not a good guest
The cutlass is a more excellent guest
Cutlass
Cutlass, cutlass, cutlass

Girl with basket of fruit
Girl with basket of fruit
Girl with basket of fruit

Look at her try to walk away, I get bored
Photos of her jerking it to mush, I get bored
It’s a vagina strained without end
And her lungs fill with tears
Or the lungs turn to gills
Life inland has become impossible
No path straight through Og's Magog Bog
The jackfruit (Ding)
The dragonfruit (Ding)
The passionfruit (Ding)
The cinnamon's bun (Ding)
She sits on a bicycle and floats in space
She is in love with The Angel of No Taxi Anywhere
When of Hell’s Electorate: The Grocer
Makes her dance with a nobody
It comes out as a joke
Eating gherkins by the fistful
From the jar in his front pants pocket
Brine and peppers building up
On the rings around his fingers
Her boob gets so floppy
She uses it as a fan to wave away his sickening B.O.​
Now rubbing it off with a brick
Dust for his panettone
Every frog hops right up into her butthole
Every frog eats a single butthole flea on its way in
She brown box squeezes them all into froghost
A flock of erect dicks on bat wings
Pee-pees into her sleeping face
And pointlessly tries to fuck a blue sky
At the witch execution, they all hope to be called up
They've had enough
They've had enough
