Scisssssssors LyricsFade cream, all erased
I can't remember who you are
Hear and taste all erased
I can't remember who you are
The Simone Hotel
The Simone Hotel
(Guard, guard
Guard, guard
Guard, guard
Guard, guard)
Light a candle, pull the handle
You are erased
Light a candle, pull the handle
You are erased
(And now sow bugs the size of real sows)
Dear Dr. Duck
What's the solution for people like us?
Long Gone Harmonica, Boogie Woogie Clair
Sleepy Pee Wee, Junior Little Buddy
Jelly Roll Cacao, Geeshee Purple
Champion Kitty
Light a candle, pull the handle
You are erased
Light a candle
You are erased
It would be twice as good
If you lay down on the track
Half for the trash and half for the hornets
It could be four times as good
If you lie down there again
A quarter for the gooseberry bush
A quarter for the gooseberry bug
It was the clarinet that made you deaf
Not the coming train, ConnieEmbed
