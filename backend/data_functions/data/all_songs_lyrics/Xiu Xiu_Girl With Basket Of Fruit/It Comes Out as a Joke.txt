It Comes Out as a Joke LyricsKnuckle a short life in the ribs
It comes out as a joke
The God Burner as the unembrace
It too, a joke
The Great Fish Head deforms the unborn
It comes out a great and deformed joke
A pig wearing a maid's apron and cap
Riding a tomato on rubber wheels
It looks at its pocket watch and points a hoof
"You go to The World of Unborn"
Jerking to it in mush
Mush deducted from heaven
That's is the funny part
Jerking it to mush
My life, hot with sorrows
Hot with sorrows
But this a joke as well
Bedroom filling with true black
Bedroom filling with smoke, smoke
Bedroom filling with clack, clack
Bedroom filling with smoke
Bedroom filling with true black
Bedroom filling with smoke, smoke
Bedroom filling with clack, clack
Bedroom filling with smoke2Embed
