Normal Love LyricsUh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
What have you become?
I can't say so
Yet run full-on to
Run towards nothing
No, yes, yeah, no, yes, no, what? No
Normal love, normal love
Normal love, normal love
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Sprinkle gopher dust
Spill Chum-Churum
Secrets of the Psalms
Might uncross anything
No, yes, yeah, no, yes, no, what? No
Normal love, normal love
Normal love, normal love
I want to pretend
But I cannot pretend
Want me to speak nor to blink
You don't want to feel attractive nor feel pride
I think, in the end, I don't need to feel pride
Normal love, normal love, normal love
Normal love, normal love, normal love
Normal love, normal love, normal love
I think I have shown
I don't need it to be fair
I think I have shown you
I don't need you to be kind
Just let me pretend
I have something to lose
