Ice Cream Truck LyricsMescal in a bottle and a baby on a boob
Hair dyed blonde for nobody, nobody move
I wasn't gonna hurt you
I’ve heard that one before
I wasn't gonna hurt you
I've said that one before
Flip-flops turned gray
And foot twisted ’round the wrong way
Puff, puff
She is and was passed out
And will always be passed about
As it was in the beginning, she is still passed out
You paid half already
A bar named Smirk Smirk Smirk
A jerk shack named The Gut
And again, no clothes
A square of foam to pad her back
Again, no clothes
A carpet sampled to pad her back
Dunk, dunk
Dunk, dunk
Who is it?
Smile, donut
For lip liner, pee-pee, and rubber tubes
Smile, donut
Smile, donut
Smile, and then don't
Smile, and then don'tEmbed
