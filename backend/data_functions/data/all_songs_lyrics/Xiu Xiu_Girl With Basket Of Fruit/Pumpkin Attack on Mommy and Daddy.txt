Pumpkin Attack on Mommy and Daddy LyricsLoner, loner
Right, right
Loner, loner
Right, right
So I was just standing there
And standing there and standing there and waiting
There and waiting
There and waiting
There and waiting
There and waiting
Keep me company
But like, as a mother
Daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy-o, daddy-o
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy-o, daddy-o
Daddy-o, daddy-o
Is that you, my prize pig?
I am sorry I left you out at pasture to die
He was such a fuckin' asshole baby
Who terror, who terrorizes all the kids in the neighborhood
How does a pig even walk back into the house
With only one not broken leg?
Pigs are gross
Well, not you
You're my pig
Um, but yeah, no mom
Um, but yeah, no dad
Um, but yeah, no sister
Um, but yeah, no
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, no-no-nothing
No-no-nothing
Glue in a bag
Glue in a bag
Glue in a bag
It was so sweet and so disgusting
You're gonna fuck your favorite sweater
If you wanted to be a human being
If you wanted to be a human being
If you wanted to be a human being
Then you just have to eat garlic?
You're not my mom
(Smut) Smut, keep me company
(Smut) Smut, keep me company
(Smut) Smut, keep me company
(Smut-smut-smut
Smut, smut, smut
Smut-smut-smut)
Jump in, motherfucker
Jump in, motherfucker
Jump in, motherfucker
Jump in, motherfucker
Jump in, motherfucker
Jump in, motherfucker
What, what, what, what, what, what, what
What if the bear was just a dumbass?
My three-legged pig, my three-legged pig
My three-legged pig, my three-legged pig
Now you really can't get anywhere
Where, where, where-where-where
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where-where-where
Where, where, where-where-where
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where-where-where
And I am kind of a dopey-ass goofball weirdo
So I can get why some people don't like me3Embed
