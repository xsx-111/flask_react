Doomed User Lyrics
There went your time, say goodbye, now leave here
My fuse has expired, fucking die, just leave here
Powerless, stuck in your web of shit
Open your eyes, you only play yourself
Whoever's watching, I hope they catch the drift
Collect your crown, you're now the queen of filth
There, that's your life, go and die more, I mean it
Loose and defiled, you define the meaning

They're delusions, don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you

I've been scarred, fucking repulsed by this
My only tale is one that I can't stand
Now I've become this core of rotted will
My heart is black, and I will now bounce back
There, say goodbye, just retire from the earth
You've been exiled, take your body elsewhere

They're delusions, don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breath somewhere to someone new
Your castles burning down on you
Your kingdom is burning down

They're delusions, don't deny it
Don't make this out to be a thing about you
They're delusions, don't deny it
Don't make this out to be a thing about you
Go waste your breath somewhere to someone new1Embed
