Xenon Lyrics
You're floating out astray
This cold and lifeless body
At this moment what you taste
Is the key to your evolving

We're the lions at the gates
We're the diamonds in your brain
The desire in your veins for the violence
And the writers of your fate

Keep riding on this wave
The desire sweeps your body
Oh, we're watching, now we wait
For another sweet departing

We're the lions at the gates
We're the diamond in your brain
The desire in your veins for the violence
We're the sirens to your raid
The desire to remain in the violence
The deciders of your fate
The desire in your veins for the violence
The diamond in your brain
The desire to partake in the violence
We're the sirens to your raid

The desire to remain, remain, remain
The writer of your fate2Embed
