Hearts / Wires Lyrics

Nothing can save me now, it's what I believe
The slit in the sky when you left is all I see
Nothing to sing about, I've bared all my leaves
No vision or dreams about you came true for me

Cut through this razor wire
And dine on your heart, mine 'til the end

Stuck with illusion now, I drown in your sea
I hope that you'll first save yourself and then come for me

Cut through this razor wire
And dine on your heart, mine 'til the end
Break through, clip the wires
And writhe in your heart, mine 'til the end

A way, a way out, a way
Down deep into your veins
All the way, all the way
Down deep in your heart
All the way, all the way
Cut through this razor wire
Mine 'til the end
Break through, clip the wire
Dine on your heart, mine 'til the end3Embed
