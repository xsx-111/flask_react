Gore Lyrics
Deep in this dream, we are locked in
I've pulled you in
Now our bodies are wet
There is blood on the beaches
I brought you into this, don't deny yourself

Smile, you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running the game

We lay in the gore of our vices
Oh, we writhe in them
At night we assemble the hunt for our prizes
I hooked you in this way, you should try yourself

Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running the world

We'll slip right through these gates together someday
Lost in these dreams, we arrive in
I know you will
Develop the taste that will tie us together
I put you in this game, just remind yourself

Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running the game
Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running wild

We'll slip right through these gates together someday
We'll trip right through you slave forever someday

Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Take what you want to take
Surprise, you're now running the game
Smile, now you're all set
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
Just take what you want to take
Surprise, you're homeEmbed
