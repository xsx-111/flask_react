(L)MIRL Lyrics
I don't miss you
I don't care where you are now
You're a ghost to me
Left with my taste in your mouth
Taken away somewhere new
I'm used to it
This body is here, but I'm gone
When I reawake
I'll reawake in the waves

In a new realm
Catch this dream on film
You might just get used to it
And you'll smile, smile, and dive deep

I sail on these waves, hey
Slip into the calming waves, hey

You're an old hex
That just drained my will
So I put this gun to my head
And I smile, smile, and dive deep
I sail on these waves, hey
Slip into the calming waves, hey
Deep into the calming waves, hey

We have created
Now we're gone
And now a reawakening
Another form of myself
I come right out of my skin

Slip into the calming waves
Deep into the calming waves
Slip into the calming waves
Deep into, hey

Right now
Bear witness
This rebirth
Right nowEmbed
