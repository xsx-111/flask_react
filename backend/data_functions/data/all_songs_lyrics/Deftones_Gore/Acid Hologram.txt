Acid Hologram Lyrics
In the haze of your light, we bathe and wane
You've surrounded our hearts again
You smother me in shapes, in a secret praxis
You've shown me your charms, revealed your name
Blow the clouds from your mouth again
And smother me in shapes, you'll reveal your secret side

Your light will fade and our hearts will sync in time
Your disguise will shift and reverse

In the wake of your plume, we bathe and drink
You remind me of her again
Smother me in shapes and reveal your secret side

Your light will fade and our hearts will sync in time
Your disguise will shift and reverse

In time your light will fade and our hearts will sync in time
Your disguise will shift and reverse
In time your light will fade and our hearts will sync in time
Your disguise will shift and reverseEmbed
