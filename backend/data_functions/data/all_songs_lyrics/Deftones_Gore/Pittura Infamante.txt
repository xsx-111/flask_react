Pittura Infamante Lyrics
I kneel at the altar
Carve your name and hail to the gods
I've climbed your tree, I peeled your fruit
When I tasted your kiss
How amazing that you were sent
Like you were molded out of thin air
Now I don't want you to disappear
But I want you to carry us out of here
We sail through the arc light
Attach the wings and wait for the gods
We've found your grail, we drank your juice
And we tasted your gift
I will wait here one-thousand years
I will choose to immerse in your eyes
I've seen the truth, and I know your strength
I have watched your great ascent

Now we sing
Now we sing your praises
And now we face the sky
The sky, sky, the sky

On top of the crux, I've climbed every rung
To bathe in your sunlight
I kneel at the altar
I promised you, I would stay to the end
I will hold and praise and feel your truth
Let us drink to the gods

I will sing, I will sing your praises
I will scream, I will scream your praises1Embed
