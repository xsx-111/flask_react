Prayers / Triangles Lyrics
There's a new strange, godless demon awake inside me
There's a forced divine, terrorizing the angels I keep
While we dream

Prayers laid on the line
You will never be free
You will never be free

I'm a true slave to the fire and the air around you
While this cursed divine is slowly rotting away inside me
While we dream

Prayers laid on the line
You will never be free
You will never be free
Triangles placed in your mind
You will never be free
You will never be free

I'd be aware, I'd be aware
Be aware, be aware
I will never walk this street again
The only time I feel I'm not alone
I pull my heart out, wave it in the air
Prayers laid on the line
You will never be free
You will never be free
Triangles placed in your mind
You will never be free
You will never be free
Prayers
Triangles
Prayers
You will never be free
You will never be free

I will never walk this street again
The only time I feel I'm not alone
I pull my heart out, wave it in the air
I pull my heart out, beware1Embed
