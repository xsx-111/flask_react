Rubicon Lyrics
You cannot face the crowd all by yourself
Embrace the power we have
Raise your eyes slowly
Place your faith into me
Your body aches to be
Draped in our delight slowly

Take me in
Face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them

Sound asleep hunting
Wide awake moaning
This body aches to be
Draped in you tonight slowly

Take me in
Face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them
Take me in
Face the crowd
Let yourself just writhe in them
You cannot face the crowd all by yourself
Embrace the power we have
The record's ours to break
The more we build, and the crowd goes wild
Goes wild

Take me in
Face the lights
Free yourself and writhe in them
Take me in
Face the crowd
Let yourself just writhe in them
Writhe in them

You cannot face the crowd all by yourself
Embrace the power we have
The record's ours to break
And the more we build, the crowd goes wild

Goes wild
Goes wild
Goes wild1Embed
