Geometric Headdress Lyrics
Hey, princess, lay back in your chair
Show us your geometry, see if I stare
Pink cigarette, white see-through dress
And a black and gold veil
Ornate headdress, my temptress
Wield your staff and your veil
Vows, secrets, wake me when
It's my turn to walk through

Caught deep in your every curve
Primed and ready for battle
Lift your veil now, formulate
With the sound by yourself

As her words draw you in
Our faith reconnects
And our hearts, they collapse
At the words

Now come to me in your glitz and your glam
Place your heart down, step back and watch this
Blank featured, vile creatures
Collapse at your ankles
Firebreather, snake eater
Relax as we hail her
Vows, secrets, wake me when
It's my turn to walk through
Don't turn around
Look back to see it
Just hang on, formulate
And believe it by yourself

As her words draw you in
Our faith reconnects
And our hearts, they collapse
From the words we intake

Now relate like I relate
'Til your faith reconnects
And now relate like I relate
To the words

We are enlightened, we stare and behold
We commit to your being, we belong, we belong
Deep in your circle, trapped in your grace
Wrapped here in your prism walls, we will stayEmbed
