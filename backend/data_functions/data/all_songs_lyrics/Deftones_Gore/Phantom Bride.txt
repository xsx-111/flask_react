Phantom Bride Lyrics
Inside of this hole you create
You hide from yourself
You separate every belief that is true that...
You spent your life
Attached to this poison
You don't feel anything out of the rain,
And it's true that...

You spend your life
Trapped in this void
Where you will stay always

Can't rid of this thought of you rotting in
This same cold space
You don't want to feel anything new
You've decided to spend your life safe from emotion
This way you'll never be harmed again or confused now

You spend your life
Trapped in this void
Where you will stay always
You waste your life
Relaxed in your void
Where you will drain all of you
You spend your life
Trapped in your void
Where you will stay always
You waste your life
Relaxed in your void
Where you will stay always
You spend your life
Trapped in your void
Where you will stay always

Waste your life
Attached to this poison
You will drain all of you6Embed
