Dear Friends LyricsDear friends
You are angels and drunks
You are Magi
Old friends
You stuck a pin in the map I was in
And this is a note from the roadside
Cuttin' the breeze of this Tennessee sundown
Came the sounds of the voices I know
I've been pondering trees
On the steeliest comedown
And now the moment I'm home
I've got bluster enough
For the sails of a clipper
And the truth never frays a good yarn
But it struck me to say while so far away
You are with me today
You are here are in my head, in my heart
Dear friends
You are angels and drunks
You are Magi
Old friends
You stuck a pin in the map I was in
And you are the stars I navigate home byEmbed
