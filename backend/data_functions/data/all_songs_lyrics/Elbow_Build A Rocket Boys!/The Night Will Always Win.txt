The Night Will Always Win LyricsI throw this to the wind
But what if I was right?
Well, did you trust your noble dreams
And gentle expectations to the mercy of the night?
The night will always win
The night has darkness on its side
I'll throw this to the wind
I miss your stupid face
I miss your bad advice
I tried to clothe your bones with scratches
Super 8s, exaggerated stories and old tunes
But never by the moon
But not the state I'm in
The night will always win
I throw this to the wind
But what if i was right
Well, did you trust your noble dreams
And gentle expectations to the mercy of the night
The night will always win
The night has darkness on its side
I've thrown this to the wind
I miss your stupid face
I miss your bad advice
I tried to clothe your bones with scratches
Super 8s, exaggerated stories and old tunes
But never by the moon
But never the state that I'm in
The night will always win1Embed
