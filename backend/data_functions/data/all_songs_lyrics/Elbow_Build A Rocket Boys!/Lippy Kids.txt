Lippy Kids LyricsLippy kids on the corner again
Lippy kids on the corner begin
Settling like crows
Though I never perfected that simian stroll
The cigarettes senate was everything then
Do they know those days are golden?
Build a rocket boys
Build a rocket boys!
One long June
I came down from the trees
And kerbstone cool
You were a freshly painted angel Walking on walls
Stealing booze and hour-long hungry kisses
And nobody knew me at home anymore
Build a rocket boys!
Build a rocket boys
Build a rocket boys!
Lippy kids on the corner again
Lippy kids on the corner begin
Settling like crows
And I never effected that simian stroll
No
Do they know those days are golden?
Build a rocket boys
Build a rocket boys!
One long June
I came down from the trees
And kerbstone cool
You were freshly painted angel
Walking on walls
Stealing booze and hour-long hungry kisses
And nobody knows me at home anymore
Build a rocket boys!
Build a rocket boys!
Build a rocket boys!Embed
