High Ideals LyricsThere's a laddered tear in my high ideals
Like I took a chair on the battlefield
And any noble fire that was burning in my chest
Is acid in my belly at the very best
There's a bayonet in my family things
It was made in the USA to defend the King
And though the sinew, that thrust
And all the bones it splintered are dust
It's passed from hand to hand
With the wedding rings
Oh, settle down little heart of mine
Oh, settle down, youâ€™re doing double time
You're so far away and she's right here by your side
Oh, settle down little heart of mine, oohEmbed
