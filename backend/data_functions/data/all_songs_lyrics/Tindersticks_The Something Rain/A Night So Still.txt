A Night So Still LyricsHear this song
On a night so still
The call of the sea
On this night so still
And cold
The call of the sea
And you walk in your sleep
For the tide you hold
And wait so still
In the arms of the night
Breathe this song
And find some peace
And walk to the sea
And cry for mistakes
And cry
Hear what they sing
Not live in fear
To love is to take
And give, there's never enough
You can take
And give yourself to the arms of this nightEmbed
