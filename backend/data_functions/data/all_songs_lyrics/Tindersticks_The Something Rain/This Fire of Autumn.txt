This Fire of Autumn LyricsEverything we cannot keep
Arranged to be left behind
Leaves that crackle
As dead as stones
We don't want nothing that don't belong to us
We don't want nothing we can live without
In this fire of autumn
This fire of autumn...
All the words we never said
Couldn't make any difference now
Leave them to the flames
With everything you can't forget
In this fire of autumn
This fire of autumn...
The fire, the fire
Oh this love grows selfishly
Have I succumbed to reason?
What is there left to give?
A clenched fist and a gentle love
In this fire of autumn?
This fire of autumn...
We don't want nothing we can live without
We don't want nothing that don't belong to us
Just hold me as I'm burning
Hold me as I scream
In this fire of autumn
This fire of autumn...Embed
