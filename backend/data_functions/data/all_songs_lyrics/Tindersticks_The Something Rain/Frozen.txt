Frozen LyricsThis lunacy could save us
When all reason has betrayed us
We built these walls up again
Worked until we couldn’t find escaping
Built these walls up again
Worked until we couldn’t find our way back in
We stand at windows and salivate
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you
If I could just hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you

Lovers come, lovers fade
Lovers throw themselves under oncoming trains
Lovers come, lovers fade
Lovers cling on by their fingernails
They borrow life in stages
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
Just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
Just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you
Just hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
Just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could just hold you, hold you
If I could justEmbed
