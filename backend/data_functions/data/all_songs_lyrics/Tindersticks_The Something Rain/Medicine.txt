Medicine LyricsThere's medicine you want
Medicine you need
Medicine to get you on your feet
Off your knees
Cause every single day
And every single hour too
That medicine it works inside of you
In your head
In your dreams
In your dreams
You worked it so hard
You tried to make it shine
Medicine it keeps you down that mine
In your head
Cause every single day
And every single hour too
That medicine it works inside of you
In your head
In your dreams
In your dreamsEmbed
