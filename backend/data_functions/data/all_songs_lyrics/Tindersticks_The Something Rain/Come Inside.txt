Come Inside LyricsCome inside
We've been expecting you
Been such a long time
Thought you might never show
Been living my life
From day to day
Been hoping that you
Would never come my way
Come inside
I've been expecting you
Been such a long time
Thought you might never show
I've been living my life
From day to day
Hoping that you
Would never come my way
Come inside
Come inside
Come inside
Come
Come inside
We've been expecting you
Been such a long time
Thought you might never show
Been living my life
From day to day
Been hoping that you
Would never come my wayEmbed
