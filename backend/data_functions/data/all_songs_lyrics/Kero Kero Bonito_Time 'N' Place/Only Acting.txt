Only Acting Lyrics
When I step onto the stage, see the curtain raise
I’m apparent, I’ve got someone to play
All the crowd are in the seats looking straight at me
For an answer, they just get what they see
They applaud and the usher’s locking the door
'Til the matinee

So I get to know the cast, though it doesn’t last
I’m a pro, but I won’t take it too far
Now I know I shouldn’t get comfy on the set
Every time it all comes down in the end
That’s a truth that the stage school doesn’t teach you
But it’s good to know

It takes much more than just learning a script
You see, you gotta take the part and believe it
Oh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot
But I will always give what I got

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactly like it was all for real
I sure didn’t know it hurt so
But then no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside
What you gotta hide, where to put your pride
When to realise you’ve had your time
Find another role, carry on the show
You should be able to feel a performance
With your whole body and soul
Now I’m gonna teach you everything I got
And you, and you, and you, and YOU!!!!

Oh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot
But I will always give what I got

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactly like it was all for real
I sure didn’t know it hurt so
But then no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside
What you gotta hide
Where to put your pride
When to realise you’ve had your time
Find another role
Carry on the show

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exac—exac—exac—exac—exa—
What you gotta hi—
How to feel inside
What you gotta hide—
