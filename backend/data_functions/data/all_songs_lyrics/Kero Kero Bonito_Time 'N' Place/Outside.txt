Outside LyricsI think I smell the rain again
I see the leaves getting dewy
They’re breathing
Fresh air awakens everything
While the winds are barging through
They greet you
Outside here
Like any other morning
Landing on cue
I hear the drizzle drumming down
And then I realise in all of my life
I don’t think that I remember it
Being so vivid
One, two, three, four
Five, six miles away
I wonder if they notice over there?
Until the light throws colors across the vista
Piling so high they reach out of sight
To heaven5Embed
