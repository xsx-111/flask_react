Rest Stop Lyrics
Over the sunset
At the edge of the atlas
I'm driving alone
When I see in the distance
A light in the dark
And when I approach it
A note on the glass
We're serving
Inside it's quiet
But the tables are shining
In blue chrome and white
With a fan on above
But no service in sight
I pick out a booth
Sliding in from the side
And then I start feeling quite tired

So I know
That I'll be here a little while
When I go
I'll get right back on the road

Let everybody come together
The world at peace as one
We could live a dream forever
It's really up to us
And if you're not sure how to start
Then open up your heart
Let the feeling grow
And soon you're sure to know
Light up, light up
The whole night sky with all your love
Just say the prayer
We'll make it there
If we work hard enough
Keep on keep on
And give it everything you've got
'Cos only then
We'll reach the end
The land where we belong
So when we walk among the clouds
Hold your neighbour close
As the trumpets echo 'round
You don't wanna be aâ€”8Embed
