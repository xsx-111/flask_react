Flyway Lyrics
A flock across my window
Gone when I look around
Until the sun gets longer
They're getting out of town
Where on earth in the world
Do they go?
Do their feathers freeze stiff
In the snow?
How should I know?

But I can bet you they'll come
Back to the same old tree
Since I was crawling they've been
Watching over me
In the gardens
That ripple in the water
Climbing higher up
Where nobody sees
Look at the sky and spot the green

And I heard that they weren't
Meant to stay
Anywhere the air chokes
Or they get
On the flyway
So ride the rising currents
I trust that I will see you again
When I pick up the courage
I hope that I can join you someday4Embed
