Dear Future Self Lyrics
Dear future self, it's me again
The girl you buried way back when
I see you gave in to curiosity
My life right now is going well
I’ve time to spare as one can tell
But you might just sense some trepidation too

No one knows where they really want to go
Why we always stay inside
And now it snows
But I bet you miss it all
So

Do cars ever fly?
Have you travelled time?
Or is it just the same old thing for you and I?
I used to be fine because you always seemed so far away
But now I feel our paths getting closer each day

You'll find enclosed, a passport photograph
The headlines and a railcard
It's funny how physical us humans are
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
But I heard all the years’ll leave you hurt
Everyone you love disappears and nothing works
Please don't say you hate the world
I hope that I won't

Do cars ever fly?
Have you travelled time?
Or is it just the same old thing for you and I?
I used to be fine because you always seemed so far away
But now I feel our paths getting closer each day
It's rather strange5Embed
