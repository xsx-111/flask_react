Dump Lyrics
Show the man a pass and everything you've got
Go to where he points and throw it all on top
Hear the crunching beneath of junk let go
A parrot cage and dial phones
Blue for small electrics, microwaves in here
Television pieces in a rusty skip
But be careful if you brought chemicals
They've got a place especially for those

And there's always a busy crowd around
People come from all over town (Over town)
Dropping off the things that they no longer need to keep

Everybody's collage stacking up the wall
When the sun is out the scent gets pretty tall
But the site operators don't care much
They're looking forward to their lunch
And when we fill it up
A lorry comes and drags it on the tarmac
Somewhere far from here
So when they let us in at 6 A.M
The spaces are empty again
And there's always a busy crowd around
People come from all over town (Over town)
Dropping off the things that they no longer need to keep6Embed
