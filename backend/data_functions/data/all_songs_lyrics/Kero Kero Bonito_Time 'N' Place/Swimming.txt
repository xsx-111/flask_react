Swimming Lyrics
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I was treading on the beach
Summer underneath my feet
Somewhere I'd never seen
Mama led me by the hand
'Til the grit stuck with the damp
And the foam fizzed adrift
When we both strode in

I could feel the detritus lifting
And I moved like I knew that I was free again
Then before thinking I ventured out

Swimming across the sea
The current battles way down below me
Drifting, but holding on
I keep my head up to watch the shore

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
After many years had passed
Hoping I would find the path
I arrived at the start
In the shadow of a cliff
Memories floating in the wind
I squared up to the tide
On my own this time

I could feel the detritus lifting
While a teardrop tickled as it ran away
But it got lost in the wash, I tossed

Swimming across the sea
I get the feeling
I always have been
Swimming across the sea
The current battles way down below me
Drifting, but holding on
I keep my head up to watch the shore

Swimming
