Make Believe Lyrics
I set a watch for 5 o'clock
I think of trees and rivers as I'm drifting off
I pinch my wrist (Just to tell where I am)
I get a twinge (Seems as real as it can)
But I remain and so I know the rest is up to me

At night, the sunlight beats upon my skin
In here, I see everything
And until the morning comes
I feel it

All my life I tried
To find the time to make believe
But now as certain as the seasons
I know real life will get in between
If I never get to decide my reality
At least I see how it could be
When I get round to sleeping (Sleeping)
Dreaming (Dreaming)
Works for me

And though my soul (Lets me do what I want)
Is pretty bold (In a place I belong)
From time to time, my grip'll slip
And I just lose control
Then awake I freeze
But nothing in my head can hurt me
However real it seems
All my life I tried
To find the time to make believe
But now as certain as the seasons
I know real life will get in between
If I never get to decide my reality
At least I see how it could be
When I get round to sleeping (Sleeping)
Dreaming (Dreaming)
When I get round to sleeping (Sleeping)
Dreaming (Dreaming)
Oh
