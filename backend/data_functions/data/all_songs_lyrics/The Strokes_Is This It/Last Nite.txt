Last Nite Lyrics
Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

And say, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down
Oh, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, baby, gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah

Oh, people, they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night, she said
"Oh, baby, I feel so down
See, it turns me off
When I feel left out"
So I, I turned 'round
Oh, little girl, I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah36Embed
