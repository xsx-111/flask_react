Soma Lyrics
Soma is what they would take when
Hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way
High stakes for a few names
Racing against sunbeams
Losing against fig trees
In your eyes

And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
See, I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes

Let's go

When I saw her for the first time
Lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
"And I'll be there," he says
Then he walks out
Somehow he was trying
Too hard to be like them
And I am
Stop
And go
In your eyes
And I am
Stop
Oh, darling let me go

Tried it once and they liked it
And tried to hide it
Says, "I've been doing this twenty-five years"
Well, I'm not listening no more
And these friends, they keep asking for more
Oh, yeah, oh, but that's it10Embed
