Open Up Your Heart LyricsOpen up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
When you're sad and lonely
And your mind sees you only
Take a chance you can fight it
Open up your heart
When your sick incomplete
Watch the stars not your feet
Feel the wind blow on your mind
Now your seeing blind
Fight the urge to say no
Bring your friends then you'll know
Come inside step away
Kill your fears today
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Open up your heart
Kick the habit you have learned
You can do it you've been burned
When your sick eyes need a turn
Let the future learn
Open up your heartEmbed
