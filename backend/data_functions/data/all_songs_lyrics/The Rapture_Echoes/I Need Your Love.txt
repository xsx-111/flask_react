I Need Your Love LyricsVisions of you or pictures in tabloids
I've seen no way out since I was a boy
Hold on to something that I know is near
Feeling much closer to holding my tears
Banter that shoots me through cannons and spillways
Forests and nights as I walk through these hallways
Kaleidoscopes eyes of killers come near
Feeling less desperate to hold in my fear
I need your love
Visions of you or pictures in tabloids
I've seen no way out since I was a boy
Hold on to something that I know is near
Missing the point as I fall through these years
I need your love
All I want, All I needEmbed
