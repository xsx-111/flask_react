Infatuation LyricsYou don't know by now
To take me down
Take me down
You don't know by now
To take me down
Take me down
Infatuation
You don't know by now
To take me down
Take me down
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation
Infatuation with the girl
In the coat in the park
Infatuation with the girl
In the coat in the park
Infatuation with the girl
In the coat in the park
Infatuation with the girl
In the coat in the parkEmbed
