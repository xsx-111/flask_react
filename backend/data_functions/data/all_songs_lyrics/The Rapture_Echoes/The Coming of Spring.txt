The Coming of Spring LyricsGet yourself together!
Get out of your head
Without outer persuasions
You're better off dead
Learn how to breathe
You'd better learn how to shine
These obser-ma-vations
Are mah-ma-ma, mah-ma-ma
Muh-ma-ma-ma-mine
Down on your knees
Pleading for life
Shards of a mirror
And twist of a knife
So get yourself together
Unwrapped ball of twine
These obser-ma-vations
Are mah-ma-ma, mah-ma-ma
Muh-ma-ma-ma-mine
No
(One heart) no, nah-no
(One heart) no, nah-no
(One heart) no, nah-no
(One heart) no, nah-noEmbed
