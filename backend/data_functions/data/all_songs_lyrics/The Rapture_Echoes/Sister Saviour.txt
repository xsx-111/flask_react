Sister Saviour LyricsCan you feel it
Sister Savior
Drawing you into the club?
Sister Savior's
Past behavior
Has me falling in love
Hey-ey-ey-ey
Sister Savior
Hey-ey-ey-ey
Catholic lover
Why'd you leave me
For the good life?
At least our bad times were ours
Last night i had a dream
A warm field strawberries and cream
A poor man wearing rusty mail
With contentment plastered on his face
He was sipping from a bottle
On his forehead read the motto
"If I drink myself to death
At least I'll know i had a good time"
One last late night
Sister Savior
Before its too late
Hey-ey-ey-ey
Sister Savior
Hey-ey-ey-ey
You know i love her
Please belive me
This is the good life
And no more bad times could be oursEmbed
