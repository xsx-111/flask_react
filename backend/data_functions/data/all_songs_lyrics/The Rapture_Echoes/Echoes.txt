Echoes LyricsThe city breathing
The people churning
The conversating
The price is what?
The conversating
This place is heaven
And if you see them
They saying what?
Life makes echoes
If you see them
Life makes echoes
The conversating
This place is heaven
I put on lipstick
The price is what?
Life makes echoes
If you see them
Life makes echoes
Life makes echoes
If you see them
Life makes echoes
Come together, come together
Come together, come together
Come together, come together
Come together, come together
I'm insane, I'm insane
I'm insane, I'm insane
I'm insane, I'm insane
I'm insane, I'm insane
Come together, come together
Come together, come together
Come together, come together
Come together, come together
