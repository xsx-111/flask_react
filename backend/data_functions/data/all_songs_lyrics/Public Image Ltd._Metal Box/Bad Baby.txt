Bad Baby LyricsNearly ten thirty, I'm rising early
I've got an eye to buy the best
Before the rush
Someone left a baby in the car park
Never any reason
Don't you listen
One more sob story
Someone is calling
Seen through the window
Calling through mirrors
Don't you listen, don't interfere
Ignore it and it will go away
Someone is calling
Don't you listen, don't you listen
Someone is calling
Don't you listen, don't you listenEmbed
