Albatross LyricsSlow motion
Slow motion
Getting rid of the albatross
Sowing seeds of discontent
I know you very well
You are unbearable
I've seen you up far too close
Getting rid of the albatross
Frying rear blinds
If I wanted
Should I really
If I run away?
Run away
Riding along on the crest of the wave
Getting rid of the albatross
Another will not forget
I know you very well
Run away
Run away
Should I
I run away
Getting rid of the albatross
I know you very well
You are unbearable
I've seen you far too close
If I wanted to
If
Run away
Run away
I ran away
I ran away
Hiding on carpet
Another
Soul
Sowing the seeds of discontent
Running away from the albatross
Still the spirit of '68
I ran away
I ran away
Far
Far too personal
Should I really stay
Getting rid of the albatross
All stuck
Always
Lie
Getting rid of
Of the
If I wanted to
Only the lonely
Only the lonely2Embed
