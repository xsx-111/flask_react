Careering LyricsA face is raining
Across the border
The pride of history
The same as murder
Is this living
He's been careering
The steady hand as planned
Behind the reasoning
No claim for property
Both sides of the river
There is bacteria
Is this living
He's been careering
Trigger machinery
Mangle the military
No one should be there
Is this living
Blown into breeze
Scatter concrete
The jagged metal bad life
Manufactured
He's been careering
Is this living
A face is raining
Across the border
The pride of history
The same as murder
Is this living careering
There must be meaning
Behind the moaning
Spreading tales
Like coffin nails
Is this living
He's been careering
It's raining
I need to hide
Trigger machinery
I've been careering
Across the border
Is this living
Both sides of the river
There is bacteria
Armoured machinery mangled1Embed
