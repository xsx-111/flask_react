Memories LyricsYou make me feel ashamed
At acting attitudes
Remember ridicule
It should be clear by now
Clear by now
Your words are useless
Full of excuses
False confidence
Someone has used you well (Oh, used you)
Used you well
I could be wrong
It could be hate
As far as I can see clinging desperately
Imagining pretending
No personality
Dragging on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
I think you're slightly late
Slightly late
This person's had enough of useless memories
Always remember
Twisted amenities
Could be wrong
This person's had enough of useless memories
Always remember me
Twisted amenities (Twisted amenities)
Out of order
Out of order
It could be worse
You're losing all the time
I let you stay too long
I could be wrong
Could be worse
It could be worse
You're losing all the time
I let you stay too long
I could be wrong
Could be wrong
Whatever pass could never last
All in your mind
Where it all began
You're doing wrong
It's not the movies
And you're old1Embed
