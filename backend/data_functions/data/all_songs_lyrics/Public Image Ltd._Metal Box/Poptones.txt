Poptones LyricsDrive to the forest in a Japanese car
The smell of rubber on country tar
Hindsight done me no good
Standing naked in this back of the woods
The cassette played poptones
Drive to the forest in a Japanese car
The smell of rubber on country tar
Hindsight done me no good
Standing naked in this back of the woods
The cassette played poptones
I can't forget the impression you made
You left a hole in the back of my head
I don't like hiding in this foliage and peat
It's wet and I'm losing my body heat
The cassette played poptones
This bleeding heart
Looking for bodies
Nearly injured my pride
Praise picnicking in the British countryside
Poptones
