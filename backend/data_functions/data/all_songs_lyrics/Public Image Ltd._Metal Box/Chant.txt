Chant LyricsVoice moaning in a speaker
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
Never really get too close
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
Only a gimmick, pointed fingers
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
Never a more serious sight
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
Wouldn't waste the effort on entertainment
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
Out of control, mob running wild
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
All you ever get is all you steal
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
Side of London that the tourists never see
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
(Mob! War! Kill! Hate!)
Anglo ambience
Chant
Don't know why I bother
There's nothing in it for me
The more I see the less I get
The likes of you and me are an embarrassment
Chant
It's not important
It's not worth a mention in the Guardian
Every librarian has its theory
Chant chant
Anglo ambience
Chant
Voice moaning in a speaker
