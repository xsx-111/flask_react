Plumb Line LyricsYou can go out and destroy
What's already spent
You can blame on your hat
The faults in your head
The more you pass through my pores
The worse it gets
At or in
What place did you think
Your mind would fit?
When did you realize
That you couldn't follow this out
Through to the end
Clearly this is your loss
Clearly it's not my loss
Clearly it's just bad luck
Clearly it doesn't mean a thing
Cause she's an indie rocker
And nothing's gonna stop her
Her fashion fits
Cause she's an indie rocker
And nothing's gonna stop her
Plumb line says she's a bitch
And that's a lot to reject
If that's the best you can do
And that's a lot to accept
If that's the best you can do
You've got a great collection of things
Cause that's the best you can do
Clearly this is your loss
Clearly it's not my, my loss
Clearly it's just bad luck
Clearly it doesn't mean a thing, mean a thing, mean a thing
She's an indie rocker
And nothing's gonna stop her
(Mean a thing)
