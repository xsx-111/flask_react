You and Me LyricsI've been so down lately
You've been so low lately
Nothing seems to work out for you and me
For you and me
I've been so down lately
You've been so low lately
Nothing seems to work out for you and me
Sister says we can buy it all back at the grocery store
Baby brother really fucked it up this time
This isn't fun anymore, it's not as fun as it was
It's just the girl in her says it doesn't matter anyway. (?)
I've been so down lately
You've been so low lately
Nothing seems to work out for you and meEmbed
