Fat LyricsWhat do you fucking care for me?
I'm black and blue and bruised all the fucking time
Why should I fucking care for you?
I've been with you in the morning for the last time
I'm not as happy as I once was to see you
You're fatter around the side
No, no, no, no, you're not as thin as you used to be
You've gotten fatter around the thighsEmbed
