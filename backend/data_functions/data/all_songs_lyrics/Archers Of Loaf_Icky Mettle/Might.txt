Might LyricsWith all of my might
With all of my might I do this
It's a waste of my time to pursue this
I'm so full of self-indulgence to think that you'd like this song
Jot it down and I stuck it in the basement
Underneath the living room floor
For some reason I don't think I'm gonna make it
For some reason I don't think about it anymore
Get so bored with the radio, bored with the video
You've got to make a _______, just to let'em know
______________________________________________
With all of my might
With all of my might I do this
It's a waste of my time to pursue this
I'm so fucked self-indulgent to think you'd like this songEmbed
