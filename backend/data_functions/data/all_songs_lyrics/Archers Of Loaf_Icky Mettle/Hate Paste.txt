Hate Paste LyricsBit my lip
And it's the same thing
Now I'm reduced to a pulp
Your undisturbed and decorated
Decorations lie
You're hounded by pulse
Stabbed by spit
And your brain fits
Despite your ears
Another one has run in
Rotten and gossiped
You're all used up
With a burst up shell
Why're you gonna try it
If you know you don't like it
How're you gonna give it up
If you ain't got it
Why're you gonna use it
If you think that it's broke
What are you gonna swell to show
The things that you're breaking down, down, down
Down cold thresh flesh paste
Deliver hate paste
Voices sick and swelling
You say you don't like it
You say you don't like it
But you just don't get it
You just don't get it
You're hounded by pulse
Stabbed by spit
And your brain shits
To clog your ears
A casual mark
Made by a bird
Look what you lost
With your fair hands
Why're you gonna try it
If you know you don't like it
How're you gonna give it up
If you ain't got it
Why're you gonna use it
If you think that it's broke
Why're you gonna swell the show
The things that you're breaking down, down, downEmbed
