Backwash LyricsKilling
You choked on it
You broke it
Now fix it
And scrape the trade-off
To sink into uncertain
Sarcasm, something
To stain you the color of
Failure, in method
It crushes by grinding
And washing to will something
Worse for another is custom for you
And you can stamp that on my foreheard
Not gonna turn on, your information
Not gonna turn it on, turn it on
Choking
You coughed it up
You took it, now give it back
Don't be held back
On the shit from a bad conversation
Thats leaving to coat you the color
Of boredom in method
It crushes by grinding
And washing to will something
Worse for another is custom for you
And you can stamp that on my foreheard
Not gonna turn on, your information
Not gonna turn it on, turn it on1Embed
