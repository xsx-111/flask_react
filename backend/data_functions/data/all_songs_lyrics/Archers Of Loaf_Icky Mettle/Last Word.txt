Last Word LyricsSwallowed bubble
I lost my chewing gum
It's my mistake
And I'm not gonna talk about it
This is the last word I'm gonna find
This is the first line, first line baby
We're gonna shoot and shatter your big sound
Where's the post, where's the post
Take it up with social service
There was a ____________________________
There was a letter from your relatives, relatives
There was a letter from the corporation
There was a line saying production, production
Swallowed bubble
I lost my chewing gum
It's my mistake
And now my blister's left, blister's left, blister's left
This is the last word I'm gonna find
This is the first line, first line baby
I'm gonna shoot and shatter your big sound
Where's the post, where's the post
Take it up with social service
There was a _____________________________
There was a letter from your relatives, relatives
There was a offer from the corporation
There was a map saying redemption, redemption
She spends it off on everything, everything
It must have been funny one
