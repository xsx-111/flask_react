Leah Lyrics
I wanna build me a house on higher ground
I wanna find me a world where love's the only sound
High above this road filled with shadow and doubt
I want to shoulder my load and figure it all out

With Leah

I walk this road with a hammer and a fiery lantern
With this hand, I've built and with this, I've burned
I want to live in the same house, beneath the same roof
Sleep in the same bed, search for the same proof

As Leah

I got something in my heart I been waiting to give
I got a life I wanna start, one I been waiting to live
No more waiting, tonight I feel the light, I say the prayer
I open the door, I climb the stairsEmbed
