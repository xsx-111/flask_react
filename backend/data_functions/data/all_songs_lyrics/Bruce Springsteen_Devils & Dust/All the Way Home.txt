All the Way Home Lyrics
I know what it's like to have failed, baby
With the whole world looking on
I know what it's like to have soared
And come crashin' like a drunk on a barroom floor

Now you've got no reason to trust me
My confidence is a little rusty
But if you don't feel like being alone
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

Well now our old fears and failures, oh baby, they do linger
Like the shadow of that ring that was on your finger
Those days, they've come and gone
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

Love leaves nothin' but shadows and vapor
We go on, as is our sad nature, baby
Now it's some old Stones' song the band is trashin'
But if you feel like dancin', baby, I'm askin'

It's coming on closing time
Bartender, he's ringin' last call
These days I don't stand on pride
I ain't afraid to take a fall
So if you're seein' what you like
Maybe your first choice, he's gone, well, that's all right
Baby, I could walk you all the way home
Baby, I could walk you all the way homeEmbed
