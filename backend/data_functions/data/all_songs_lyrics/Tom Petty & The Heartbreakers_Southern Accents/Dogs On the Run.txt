Dogs On the Run LyricsWell we come with what was on our backs
Yeah, when the leaves had died and all turned black
Back when the wind was cold and blew them around
When we laid our blankets on the ground
Yeah and I woke up feeling hungry
Looking straight into the sun
And left a cold night on the ground
Like a dog on the run
I fell overboard and washed up on a beach
Let waves and sand roll over me
I was helped to the home of a young bleached blonde
Who said "Honey, I discovered early in life
There's ways of getting anything I want"
Some of us are different
It's just something in our blood
There's no need for explanations
We're just dogs on the run
It's just dogs on the run
Yes, the room was painted blue and grey
All my meals came to me on a silver tray
Yeah she would laugh and light my cigarettes
She said "honey ain't it funny how a crowd gathers around
Anyone living life without a net?"
Yea how they'll beg you for the answer
But it won't ever be enough
There's no way you could ever tell 'em
It's just dogs on the run
It's just dogs on the run
It's just dogs on the run, babe
Like a dog on the run
Like a dog on the run
Like a dog
Like a dog
Like a dog on the run
YeahEmbed
