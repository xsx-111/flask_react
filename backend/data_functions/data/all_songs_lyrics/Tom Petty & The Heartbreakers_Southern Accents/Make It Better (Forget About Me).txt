Make It Better (Forget About Me) LyricsHoney, I want to make it better, baby
Honey, I want to make it good again
Baby, I want to make it better, girl
Yeah better for you and me
Honey, wait and see
I know its been a long, long time
But it's going to be alright
Honey, you mustn't let it drag you down
When there's a lot a fools around
And anything I can do, honey
I'm going to do it for you
I want to make it better, baby
Listen, I want to make it good again
Baby, good for you and me
Baby, please believe
That anything I can do
You know I'm going to do it for you
(Forget about me, forget about these eyes)
(Forget about me, say good-bye)
There was too much rain, too much humidity
Tell me why you did what you did to me?
Honey, you're the judge, there ain't no jury
And I'm just an innocent boy, used to being guilty
(Forget about me, forget about these eyes)
(Forget about love, say good-bye good-bye)
(Forget about me, forget about these eyes)
(Forget about love, say good-bye good-bye)
(Forget about me, forget about these eyes)
(Forget about love, say good-bye good-bye)
I'm gonna make it better, babe
'Cause tonight gonna make it good again
Yea I wanna make it alright
Wanna make it alrightEmbed
