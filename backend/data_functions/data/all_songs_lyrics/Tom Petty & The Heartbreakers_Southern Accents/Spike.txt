Spike LyricsLook out, another one, just like the other ones
Another bad-ass, another troublemaker
I'm scared, ain't you boys scared?
I wonder if he's going to show us what bad is?
Boys, we got a man with a dog collar on
Maybe we ought to throw old Spike a bone?
Here's another misfit, another Jimmy Dean
Bet he's got a motorbike, what do y'all think?
That it would be good if we get a ride on it
If he ain't too mad about the future
Maybe we ought to help him see
The future ain't what it used to be
Listen
Hey Spike, what do you like?
Hey Spike, what do you like?
Hey Spike, what do you like?
Hey Spike, you're scaring my wife
Hey Spike, tell us about life
Could you tell me about life?
I might need need a dog collar too, boy
He might make me say say
I might say, might sayEmbed
