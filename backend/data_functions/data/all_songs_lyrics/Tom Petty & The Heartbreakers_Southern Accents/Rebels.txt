Rebels LyricsHoney, don't walk out, I'm too drunk to follow
You know you won't feel this way tomorrow
Well, maybe a little rough around the edges
Or inside a little hollow
I get faced with some things sometimes
That are so hard to swallow, hey!
I was born a rebel, down in Dixie
On a Sunday mornin'
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel, born a rebel
She picked me up in the mornin'
And she paid all my tickets
Then she screamed in the car
Left me out in the thicket
Well I never would've dreamed
That her heart was so wicked
Yeah but I keep coming back
'Cause it's so hard to kick it, hey, hey, hey
I was born a rebel, down in Dixie
On a Sunday mornin'
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel, born a rebel
Even before my father's father
They called us all rebels
As they burned our cornfields
And left our cities leveled
I can still feel the eyes of those blue-bellied devils
Yeah, when I'm walking round at night
Through the concrete and metal, hey, hey, hey
I was born a rebel, down in Dixie
On a Sunday mornin'
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel, born a rebel
I was born a rebel, down in Dixie
On a Sunday mornin'
Yeah with one foot in the grave
And one foot on the pedal
I was born a rebel, born a rebel
Hey hey hey1Embed
