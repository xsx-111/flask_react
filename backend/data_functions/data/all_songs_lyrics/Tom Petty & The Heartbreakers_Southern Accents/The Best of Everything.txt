The Best of Everything Lyrics
She probably works in a restaurant
That's what her mama did
But I don't know if she ever really could've put up with it
Or maybe she sings in a nightclub
'Cause sometimes she used to sing
But I don't know if it ever amounted to anything
So listen honey

Wherever you are tonight
I wish you the best of everything, in the world
And honey I hope you found
Whatever you were looking for

Yeah and it's over before you know it
It all goes by so fast
Yeah, the bad nights last forever
And the good nights don't ever seem to last
And man, we never had the real thing
But sometimes we used to kiss
Back then we didn't understand
What we were caught up in
So listen honey
Wherever you are tonight
I wish you the best of everything, in the world
And honey I hope you found
Whatever you were looking for, yeah baby
Wherever you are tonight
I wish you the best of everything, in the world
And honey I hope you found
Whatever you were looking for1Embed
