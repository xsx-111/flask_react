Southern Accents Lyrics
There's a southern accent, where I come from
The young 'uns call it country
The Yankees call it dumb

I got my own way of talkin'
But everything is done, with a southern accent
Where I come from

Now that drunk tank in Atlanta's
Just a motel room to me
Think I might go work Orlando
If them orange groves don't freeze

I got my own way of workin'
But everything is run, with a southern accent
Where I come from

For just a minute there I was dreaming
For just a minute it was all so real
For just a minute she was standing there, with me
There's a dream I keep having
Where my mama comes to me
Then kneels down over by the window
And says a prayer for me

I got my own way of prayin'
But every one's begun
With a southern accent
Where I come from


I got my own way of livin'
But everything gets done
With a southern accent
Where I come fromEmbed
