Girls Can Be Cruel LyricsYour honey smell makes me sick
Your lies are spreading so thick
Pins in your photo I stick
Your lovers all gather round
They clap and cheer at your sound
Im all but lost in the crowd
You dont need me to survive
Too busy ruling your hive
You barely know im alive
You're a stranger when we kiss
And if I cease to exist
Just cross me off your list
Just one sip of your behaviour and my senses tell me danger
Im getting sick of your shitEmbed
