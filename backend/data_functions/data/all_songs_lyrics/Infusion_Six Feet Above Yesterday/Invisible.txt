Invisible LyricsThe days will crash by and they'll trample your roses
But the path where you walked will soon blossom again
On the day when we find we've become our own jailers
And we reach for the key that has always been sleeping within
So tomorrow's child, come and tell me
You've never seen this before
Tomorrow's child, come and show me
How I could be so much more than what I am now
I don't wanna belong in this landscape of fences
In this world that's rejected the gifts that the future can bring
A world where wings are clipped by the language on billboards
And car alarms teach all the newborn birds to sing
So tomorrow's child, come and tell me
You've never seen this before
Tomorrow's child, come and show me
How this could be more
And I will take off my skin and go flying
But I'm afraid if I fall I could fall
So give me the courage to be an invisible
But I'm frightened of losing it allEmbed
