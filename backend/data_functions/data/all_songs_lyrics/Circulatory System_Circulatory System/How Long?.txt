How Long? LyricsHow long?
Will we ride in the sky
If we take our advice from the sun?
How long? just to find once inside
That the universe is so small
Look back, on the things in your lives
And take some advice
From the stars...
You never knew, you didn't know it was coming
All we are is fingers on a reaching hand
Towards the sky, below the seaEmbed
