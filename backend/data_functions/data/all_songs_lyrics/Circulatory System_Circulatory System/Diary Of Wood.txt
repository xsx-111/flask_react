Diary Of Wood LyricsPeople made of paper
Come and go
But shadows grow
Green behind
In a diary of wood
We found the things
That make us grow
These worlds
An umbrella made of stone
And the focus that will turn
To sand
You get the general idea
To call in all the troops
That are close
At hand
Pretend you're a soup of sky past earth tonight
Let's send them photographs from satellites
If you're made of paper
Come and go
But shadows grow
Green behind
In a diary of wood
We found the things
That make us grow
These worlds
An umbrella made of stone
And the focus that will turn
To sand
You get the general idea
To call in all the troops
That are close
At hand
It should come as no surprise tonight
We're sending photographs from things inside
Way outside
Way inside
Way outside
Way inside
Way outside
Way inside
Way outside
Way insideEmbed
