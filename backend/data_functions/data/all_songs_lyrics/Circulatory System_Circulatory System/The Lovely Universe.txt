The Lovely Universe LyricsHere comes the perfect day
We're inside the Milky Way
To revolve around the Sun and believe
That it's a lovely Universe
In us all, it's a lovely Universe
In us all, you'll be fine
You've got your planets and stars
And the planets and stars, they're inside you
The meaning came today
All your questions slipped away
Just revolve around the Sun and believe
That it's a lovely Universe
In us all, it's a lovely Universe
In us all, you'll be fine
You've got your planets and stars
And the planets and stars, they're inside you
We're in a lovely Universe
We use more than five senses
We're in a lovely Universe
We use more than five senses
The feeling came today
We finally slipped away
And found a little cloud
And found a little cloud, floating free
Lovely Universe
In us all, it's a lovely Universe
In us all, you'll be fine
You've got your planets and stars
And the planets and stars, they're inside you
What a lovely Universe
We use more than five senses
What a lovely Universe
We use more than five sensesEmbed
