Should A Cloud Replace A Compass? LyricsRain makes shapes fall on the lights
And the lampposts, door to door
Should a cloud replace a compass?
How long can we think of the world
As simply up or down (black and white)
When inside out has come (and gone)
Telephone wires, they may never reach
You, they climb up so high, but still
They never reach you (that's a good thing)Embed
