Illusion LyricsShall we dust off the maps?
Or has illusion transformed us?
Ceilings aren't high, top floor
Breathe carefully begin to climb
Did you never think you'd open your eyes up
To find the pieces in place?
Don't you know when you look hard enough
You will find, the pieces in place
Shall we dust off the maps?
Describe the performance?
Or shall we move on?Embed
