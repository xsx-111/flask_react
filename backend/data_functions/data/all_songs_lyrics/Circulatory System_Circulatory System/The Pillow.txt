The Pillow LyricsIncomprehensiblee flights of the fruit
(twisted around) looping, lifting
New dimensions, we construct
A new model, but we never reach the way
We're stuck in this world they built
There's a way out (some way)
Just say goodbye to the world that we've known
Beyond your shoulders, above the flags
Across the mountains, a new clock is here
Beyond the railings, below the towns
Above the highways, beyond the clouds
Above the houses, beyond control
Below the oceans, above the blanksEmbed
