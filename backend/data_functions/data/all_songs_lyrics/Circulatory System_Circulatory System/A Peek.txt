A Peek LyricsDo you think you believe what we've seen
Let's open the door, have a peek
You'll see time is flowing out
It's something so big you can't see
But of all the things, you can believe
Do you think time is running out?
It's something so big you concede
Let's open the door that has reached
What is now known as inside out
It's never too late to see
The clearest things come to be
If you seek time that's flowing outEmbed
