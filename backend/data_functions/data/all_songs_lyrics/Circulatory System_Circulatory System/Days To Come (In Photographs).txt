Days To Come (In Photographs) LyricsWe're sending photographs of days to come (next century)
Wait until you're certain everything is all right
And we've taken all the things from brain to stem
Here are some pictures we found inside
Lately, we're moving closer, wait until you're
Certain everything is all right why defeat
Yourself with every word you say?
Here are some pictures from a new
Calendar, we found inside, outside
Above, below, beyond... here we go
We're moving closer and closerEmbed
