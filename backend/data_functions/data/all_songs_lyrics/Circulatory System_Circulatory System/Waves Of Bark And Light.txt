Waves Of Bark And Light LyricsDid we never say hi?
We never say hi or say goodbye
But here we go into the sun
To ride the waves of bark and light
When we've made it up to the sun
Unpack your things, you'll see why we've come
You need your frequencies of intuition
The now dead eternal clock has ceased its ticking
I read between the lines
And saw the faces
We saw the difference in every corner
We now know, everything
Is just beyond us, above us, below us, etcEmbed
