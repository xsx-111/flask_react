Outside Blasts LyricsOver the leaves
Past the church and bells
You'll hear ancient voices singing
Walk past the leaves
Nevertheless, here we go
If you want to talk about symbols
You want to talk about symbols
We are often symbols
Definitions, tables
Hardware in a circular time
We are often symbols
Definitions, tables
Hardware in a circular time
We just want to fly, away...
We just want to...
If you're given the chance
Would you walk up and down the things inside
Of you?
We just want to fly, away...
We just want to...
Hear the message we send
There's no more waiting 'cause everything's always been
And will be
And will be
We just want to fly, away...
We don't have much time...
There's no time
For coming apart at the seams...
Like an ornament blue air raid
Are you sad about your mountain?
Was this a continent you liked?
There's no sound
Circular beaches, accepting your part of it
Seems... like a clock
The poor old clock
The country clock is invisible
We are often symbols
Definitions, tables
Hardware in a circular time
We are often symbols
Definitions, tables
Hardware in a circular timeEmbed
