Joy LyricsWe're only made of water, sand and stone
We're made of joy and make believe
We're only made of sky, and it's true
If you still believe in joy
Even if the world is full of hate
We can blast away inside (way inside)
You can still believe in joy
Even when the world is loss and pain
You can blast away inside (way outside)
Its no secret we have this little blue world inside
Do you still believe in joy
And blast away at confusion and pain?
No matter what you look like (or feel like)
It's no secret we have this little blue world insideEmbed
