Symbols And Maps LyricsSuch a long way, a long way
Let's take off in the sky
Painting symbols and maps
Keeps us occupied
The sound in the forest
You heard the whisper
I know you've come a long way
Let's take off in the sky
And revel all the worlds that we've locked
Inside, the sound in the forest
You heard the whisper
I know you've come a long wayEmbed
