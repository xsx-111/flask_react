Inside Blasts LyricsLooping scenes over geometry
Midnight window
To foggy entrance
Small clutch on planes
Wire, wood, or spacing
Grains and sauces
Come from another city
Entirely different than the present time
From the present time let's go
To different worlds than you thought possible
There's new tastes, wire, wood or planes
Looping, looping, looping, looping...
You
Thought you'd never live to find
All the thing inside
What about truth?
It's something you don't often find
Well, don't forget the sky
Fools, if you're waiting on some paradise
Don't forget your lives
Because, we observe the myths tonight
Who wants to rise above these buildings?
Who wants to rise above their chemistry?
Tonight? Climb a tree and follow the stars1Embed
