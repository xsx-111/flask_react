Midget Submarines LyricsSolid in those waters
You were shattered and you lost your name
Cutting lines you shot the channel
Pushing out the galleons
In a midget submarine
Midget submarine
So much like escape
Sleeping in a moving train
With ammunition and the other guns
Diving out of games
With all those stens and always so amazed
In a midget submarine
Midget submarine
It's all escape
Sitting there in fashion
Just so pretty, so real, amazed
Cases of the cargo
All in canvas with galleons and tanks
In a midget submarine
Midget submarine
It's all escape
In a midget submarine
Midget submarine
It's all escapeEmbed
