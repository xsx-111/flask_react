Blam!! LyricsCrawl cross the shelf from your hiding place
Try to look at me in the face
I tried to poison you, but you poisoned me
Oh, why did you do it,you said you loved me
Out in the garden you're swinging from trees
Trying to hide from reality
Your slavish little conscience gone underground
Oh, why did you do it, you said you loved me
I don't care, I guess I'm nearly dead
I don't care, I guess I'm nearly dead
A sterling noise inside the room
A sullen statue playing balloons
The phenomenon of the age
Oh, why did you do it, you said you loved me
Playing games is all you can do
I've played out my role for you
I tried to love you, you loved me too
Oh, why did you do it, you said you loved me
I don't care, I guess I'm nearly dead
I don't care, I guess I'm nearly dead
Swing round the trees inside my brain
Keep on playing your little games
Your permit's expired, you lost your nerve
Oh, why did you do it, you said you loved me
Playing games is all you can do
I've played out my role for you
Your slavish little conscience gone underground
Oh, why did you do it, you said you loved me
I don't care, I guess I'm nearly dead
I don't care, I guess I'm nearly deadEmbed
