Another Song LyricsI wanna spend some time with you
Not now, but just another day
It's much more fun just playing games
With someone else's face
No one waiting for my show
It's still the second game
No commitment, token drifting
Round and round, still E-T-C
I wanna live my life with you
Not really, just sounds good
A word to say to pass the time
'Til all the trains have gone
Just to spend some time with you
Not now, but just another day
No more waiting, you can't control it
But everything is really great
This is just another song
I guess, it's rather long
This is just another song
And now it's gonna stopEmbed
