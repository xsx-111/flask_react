Harmony In Your Bathroom LyricsWhy's our little one taking so long
In the shower tonight?
It might just have been something to do
With turning off the light
She said something about
Wanting to jump and shout
She gets a real charge
From the radio
Why's our little one taking so long
On the stairs tonight?
She told me it was far too late
To put things right
She said something about
Wanting to jump and shout
She gets a real charge
From the radio
Why's our little one taking so long
In the bath tonight?
It might just have been something to do
With turning off the light
I always understood
That we knew where we stood
You get no leeway
You get no time to change your waysEmbed
