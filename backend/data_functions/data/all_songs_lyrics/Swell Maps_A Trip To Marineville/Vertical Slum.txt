Vertical Slum LyricsGot a Rolls Royce
It's driving me wild
I never thought about it
Got a space
Between my eyes
And I never knew about it
No more ways
To excavate you
There's no two ways about it
I think that's all
There is to say
Nothing more, oh, oh no
Go away and play
Little boys today, go
(The weather, the leather)
