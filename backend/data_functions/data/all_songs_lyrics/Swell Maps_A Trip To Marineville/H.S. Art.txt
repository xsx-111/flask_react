H.S. Art LyricsSay, that's a swell map
Are you intent on making it?
Maybe even faking it?
Then you'll see the real me
Then you'll see what we can do
Maybe someday we'll get it down
And make the talking linger on
Hoping it'll lead us there
Then you'll see what we can do
Do you believe in art?
Do you believe in art?
Do you believe in art?
If you can see right through the chance
And never take the fun away
Hoping it will lead us there
Then you'll see what we can do
Do you believe in art?
Do you believe in art?
Do you believe in art?Embed
