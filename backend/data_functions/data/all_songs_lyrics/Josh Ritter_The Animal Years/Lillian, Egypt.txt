Lillian, Egypt Lyrics
I remember back in Illinois, I found her
The lily of the valley, the lily of the West was a rose
The daughter of the biggest big town banker
He kept her like a princess, I stole her like the Fort Knox gold
She used to pour Four Roses like it's goin' down the chimney
Like the bottle was on fire, the boiler was about to blow
She's up on the table when we hit Missouri
Dancin' with a movie man, he's holding her a little too close

La di-di da da da da da da da
La di-di da da da da da da da

He made her the star of the silent movies
But all she did was mouth the words, all she did was mouth the words, "Oh no!"
And cast me as the villain, as the sheriffâ€™s worst enemy
I practiced falling off of buildings and out windows


The last time I saw she was tied to the train tracks
I was up there with the extras, riding on a tiger roan
The villain on the left with the studio mustache
Winkin' at Lillian, blowing kisses from the second row
