One More Mouth (acoustic) LyricsHoney how you gonna make it on your own?
Honey how you gonna make it on your own?
When you wake up in the night and see the stars just city lights
You can't find home
You act like you don't need nobody else
And you dance like you don't need nobody else
And all the other moths need light to circle round you just fly
Around yourself
Oh I stir my sugar with a spoon
And watch your white dress float around the room , and I
I try to see what you're about
But even my candles are down and out
Honey why you gotta hide your face from me?
Honey why you gotta hide your face from me?
Will I starve in this eclipse while you treat every hungry kiss
Like one more mouth to feedEmbed
