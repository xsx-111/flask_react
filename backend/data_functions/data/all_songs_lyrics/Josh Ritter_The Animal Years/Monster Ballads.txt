Monster Ballads Lyrics
Radio waves are coming miles and miles
Bringing only empty boats
Whatever feeling they had when they sailed
Somehow slipped out between the notes

Out on the desert now and feeling lost
The bonnet wears a wire albatross
Monster ballads and the stations of the cross
Sighin' just a little bit
Sighin' just a little bit

And I was thinking ’bout what Katy done
Thinking ’bout what Katy did
The fairest daughter of the pharaoh’s son
Dressed in gold 'neath pyramids


Ones and zeroes bleeding mesa noise
And when you’re empty there’s so much space for them
You turn it off, oh, then a still small voice
Comes in blazing from some vast horizon
And I was thinking ’bout my river days
I was thinking ’bout me and Jim
Passing Cairo on a getaway
With every steamboat like a hymn
