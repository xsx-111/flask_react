One More Mouth LyricsHoney, how you gonna make it on your own?
Honey, how you gonna make it on your own?
When you look up in the night
And see the stars, just city lights
You can’t find home?
And you act like you don’t need nobody else
You dance like you don’t need nobody else
And all the other moths need light
To circle round while you just fly
Around yourself
Oh, I stir my sugar with a spoon
I watch your white dress float around the room
I try to see what you’re about
But even my candles are down and out
Honey, why you gotta hide your face from me?
Honey, why you gotta hide your face from me?
Will I starve in this eclipse
While you treat every hungry kiss
Like one more mouth to feed?Embed
