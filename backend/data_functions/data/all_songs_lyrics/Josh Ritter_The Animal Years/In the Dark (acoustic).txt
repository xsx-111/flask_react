In the Dark (acoustic) LyricsWe started looking for you
In the darker caves
We had a lot of love
We thought would light the way
We saw the wrecks of buildings
And ships that sank in starlight
We saw the ghosts of angels
That spoke of falls from tremendous heights
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the dark
We saw your old flames
And some were burning yet
It made us smile to see just how well tended each was kept
But other fires were burning too
And I saw the battlefields
The dying Light Brigade stretched out upon the wheel
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the dark
Every heart is much the same
We tell ourselves down here
The same chambers fed by veins
The same maze of love and fear
We thought you were a saint
But the halo is a lie
It's hard to see how there could be so much dark inside the light
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the dark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ark
Don't you leave us in the da-ah-ar-ar-arkEmbed
