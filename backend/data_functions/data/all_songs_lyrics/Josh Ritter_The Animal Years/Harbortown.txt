Harbortown LyricsBrings me back to a harbortown
Where me and my true love once lay
We watched the lights go up and the sun go down
We let the moon rise where it may
There I stood, and the river flowed
There she stood, my black-haired Jill
The wind addressed her tresses black
Her long love letters to the hills
Li-del-li, li-del-lee, how the shoreline meets thе sea
Li-del-li, li-del-lay, how thе closing meets the day

I'm a poor boy, the night is cold
A meager treasure though it be
I would turn my restless youth to gold
That I might spend it all on thee
Which brings me back to a harbortown
Where me and my true love once lay
We watched the lights go up and the sun go down
We let the moon rise where it may
Li-del-li, li-del-lee, how the shoreline meets the sea
Li-del-li, li-del-lay, how the closing meets the dayEmbed
