Wolves Lyrics
I still remember that time when we were dancing
We were dancing to a song that I’d heard
Your face was simple and your hands were naked
I was singing without knowing the words

But I started listening to the wolves in the timber
Wolves in the timber at night
I heard their songs when I looked in the mirror
In the howls and the moons round my eyes

So long, so high
So long, so high
So long, so high
So long

Then winter came and there was little left between us
Skin and bones of love won’t make a meal
I felt my eyes lifting over your shoulder
There were wolves at the edge of the field


So high
And one day I just woke up
And the wolves were all there
Wolves in the piano
Wolves underneath the stairs
Wolves inside the hinges
Circling round my door
At night inside the bedsprings
Clicking cross the floor
I still don’t know how they found me
I’ll never know quite how
I still can’t believe they heard me
I was howling out that loud


At times in the frozen nights I go roaming
In the bed she used to share with me
I wake in the fields with the cold and the lonesome
The moon’s the only face that I see
