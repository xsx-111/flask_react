Idaho LyricsAll that love all those mistakes
What else can a poor man make?
So, I gave up a life of crime
I gave it to a friend of mine
Something else was on my mind
The only ghost I’m haunted by
I hear her howling down below
Idaho, oh, Idaho
Wolves, oh, wolves, oh, can’t you see?
Ain’t no wolf can sing like me
And if it could then I suppose
He belongs in Idaho
Packs of dogs and cigarettes
For those who ain’t done packing yet
My clothes are packed and I want to go
Idaho, oh, Idaho
Well, out at sea for seven years
I got your letter in Tangier
Thought that I’d been on a boat
'Til that single word you wrote
The single word, it landlocked me
Turned the masts to cedar trees
And the wind to gravel roads
Idaho, oh, Idaho
Turned the wind to gravel roads
Idaho, oh, IdahoEmbed
