Good Man Lyrics
These chords are old, but we shake hands
Cause I believe that they’re the good guys
We can use all the help we can
So many minor chords outside
I fell in love with the sound
Oh, I love to sing along with you
We got tunes we kicked around some
We got a bucket that the tunes go through

Babe, we both had dry spells, hard times
In bad lands, I’m a good man for you
I’m a good man

Last night there was a horse in the road
I was twisting in the hairpin
My hands held on, my mind let go
And back to you my heart went skipping
I found the inside of the road
Thought about the first time that I met you
All those glances that we stole
Sometimes if you want them, then you’ve got to
Babe, we both had dry spells, hard times
In bad lands, I’m a good man for you
I’m a good man

They shot a Western south of here
They had him cornered in a canyon
And even his horse had disappeared
They said it got run down by a bad, bad man
You’re not a good shot, but I’m worse
And there’s so much where we ain’t been yet
So swing up on this little horse
The only thing we’ll hit is sunset

Babe, we both had dry spells, hard times
In bad lands, I’m a good man for you
I’m a good man
Babe, we both had
Babe, we both had
Baby, we both had
Babe, we both had
You and I both had
Babe, we both had
Baby, we both had
Babe, we both had dry spells, hard times
In bad lands, I’m a good man for you
I’m a good man3Embed
