Here at the Right Time Lyrics
Under wide blue skies
There’s a place to lie
For me and Evelyn to hide tonight
I’ll try my best to make a go
But I’m not sure what I don’t know
Chariots, if you’re out there, please swing low

Tell me I got here at the right time
And if I did, it’s probably the first time
No second guesses or secret signs
Tell me I got here at the right time

You’re so red in the eyes
Either too low or too high
When I met you, you were sick but you did not know why
I was a pretty poor cure
But my love for you was always sure
The bucket was broken, but the water was pure

Tell me I got
Tell me I got here at the right time
Tell me I got
Tell me I got here at the right timeEmbed
