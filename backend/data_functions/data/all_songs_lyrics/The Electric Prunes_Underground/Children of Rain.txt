Children of Rain LyricsWilliams-Williams
Heard your voice on the radio
What do you want from me ?
I dropped out of your horror show
But you won't let me be
Everyone does just what you say
'Cause you're the drama queen
I don't like being on display
I ain't no circus freak
All the clowns they just hang around
Meet your every need
Fame's a drug I can live without
I ain't no circus freak
Get the hell out of my head
This relationship's dead
Center ring as the lions roar
You just sit and grin
You know just what the show is for
No one dares to win
All your clowns they do what you say
You're such a drama queen
I ain't here on your weird display
I ain't no circus freak
Get the hell out of my head
This relationship's deadEmbed
