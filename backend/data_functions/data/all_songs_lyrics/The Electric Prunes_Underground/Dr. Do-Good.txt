Dr. Do-Good LyricsDR. DO GOOD
(Annette Tucker /Nancie Mantz)
You say you get your jolly goods by trottin o'er the globe
Ridin on a camels back in a crimson robe
Your birth reads like a novel as for how you came to be
You say your mummy found you in a laughing willow tree
Your twisted form of madness
In relation to your sadness
Is cause you have been ladless this year
But..... Dr. Do Good is Here
If you will but rest your head upon the pillow there
We'll delve into the sickedness that brought you to my care
Just close your eyes and we'll regress
What did your Daddy do
Oh yes my dear it's quite alright I hear the music too
Your twisted form of madness
In relation to your sadness
Is cause you have been ladless this year
But Dr. Do Good is here
Are lechers lurkin to annoy ya
Whole world plottin to destroy ya
Ah but have no fear
It's only basic paranoia
I hear the tinkling of a bell my Doctor's callin me
Your Doctor said to tell you that he'll be back at three
But I've so enjoyed our little chat what did you Daddy do
Oh Yes my Dear it's quite alright I hear the music too
Are lechers lurkin to annoy ya
Whole world plottin to destry ya
Ah but have no fear
Cause Dr. Do Good Is here
Yeah Dr. Do Good is HereEmbed
