You Never Had It Better LyricsYou Never Had It Better
(Lowe/Tulin)
Why do people's passions complicate the best laid plans
Can you stop the hourglass if you hold it in your hands
You know you feel like runnin' every time you see a cop
Is it more than you can bear, you know you gotta stop
You better stop
Get yourself together you never had it better
Get yourself together you never had it better
You're runnin' down the street and you see everybody walkin'
The bomb's the scare on tuesday next, you heard your friends
All talking
China's gonna blow us up, they've got the means you know
You know you'd like to run away there's no place left to go
You better stop
Get yourself together you never had it better
Get yourself together you never had it better
Who writes up the laws that all the people seem to keep
Would I get arrested if I said he was a creep
Children walk the icy streets alone without no shoes
Do you think you'll overcome 10 million bar-b-ques?
You better stop
Get yourself together you never had it better
Get yourself together you never had it betterEmbed
