The Great Banana Hoax LyricsLeave me
I know you'll never leave me
I know because you please me
The way no one can do the things you put me through
Believe me
Trust me
You know you've got to trust me
'cause if you don't, you'll bust me
To the shame of calling your name
That's how it must be
I think of you, soft amber lights
The city's nights shining through my eyes
The colours change, they rearrange
To form a mask for your disguise
I despise all your lies
I despise all your lies
Find me
Just look inside and find me
Don't try to hide or bind me
From the world that turns all around
Behind me
We love to put you onEmbed
