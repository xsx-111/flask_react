Big City LyricsA parade of tiny lights moving in a row
And the sound of voices far off in the night
From the rooftop I can look down and see them all below
Headin for the brightest spot in sight
Big city
Everybody I know can be found there
Big city
Go and get my women and go down there
People crowdin, laughin, shoutin, having a good time
All the girls are dressed in the latest styles
There's dancin all night long
And there's parties you can find
Everything you need to liven up your mind
Big city
Everybody I know is down here
Big city
Got my woman and I'm glad I'm down here
People cowdin, laughin, shoutin, having a good time
Gettin what they need to liven up their minds
Big city
Get your woman and come on down here
Big city
Everything you need is down here
Do do do....Embed
