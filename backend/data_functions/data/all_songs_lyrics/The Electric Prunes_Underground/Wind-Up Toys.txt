Wind-Up Toys LyricsLowe-Tulin
See them walking
Keys are turning 'round in a circle
Feet don't touch the ground
They are coming from tomorrow
Bringing gladness and some sorrow home
Plastic faces cannot hide their tears
Though they're ageless, moments are their years
Walking faster to disaster
Children follow, beat the hollow drum;
We're just the wind-up toys
For wind-up girls and wind-up boys
In a wind-up world that knows we are not real
In a box now you are put away
You won't wind up till another day
Walking faster, you're the master
Children follow, beat the hollow drum;
We're just the wind-up toys
For wind-up girls and wind-up boys
In a wind-up world that knows we are not real, we are not realEmbed
