Antique Doll LyricsYou have not changed your calendar for a hundred years
You've chosen to swim backwards through an ancient sea of tears
Today is not tomorrow but for you it's yesterday
Your future is your past where you can hide yourself away
Sitting on a lily pad of loneliness
Placing lipstick kisses on the wall
Sharing secret idols with your only-ness
Ooh antique doll antique doll
Painting paper doilies through cold and bitter nights
You think you're really turning on when you turn on the lights
Your lover is a pillow from a sailor lost at sea
Who wrote his ship went down with him in 1963
Sitting on a lily pad of loneliness
Placing lipstick kisses on the wall
Sharing secret idols with your only-ness
Ooh antique doll antique doll
Your mother seems to wonder if you're living
Each night she makes you breathe upon a mirror
But there is no living without giving as you
Sit and watch your shadow disappear
Sitting on a lily pad of loneliness
Placing lipstick kisses on the wall
Sharing secret idols with your only-ness
Ooh antique doll antique dollEmbed
