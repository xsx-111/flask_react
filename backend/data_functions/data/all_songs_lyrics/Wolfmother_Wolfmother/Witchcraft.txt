Witchcraft Lyrics
Wrote a letter to you and threw it away
Spirit tried to call me, I had no words to say
Oh sister, can you tell me if it's gonna be okay?

The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

And she had witchcraft
And she drank from the craft

Her eyes are the opening to a soul
Spirits lie where secrets can be told
Yeah, make her an offer, your fortune can be sold

The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

And she had witchcraft
And she drank from the craft
The chains and bangles were ringing aloud
Calling out without a sound

And she had witchcraft
And she drank from the craftEmbed
