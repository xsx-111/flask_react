Tales From The Forest Of Gnomes LyricsOh, my friend
Don't get caught in yesterday
All the things we've heard
Have left and made their way
Lower your guns even if love has turned to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfold
If you listen to the sound
Within your mind
You may find your answer
Flowing in the tide
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well I hear the fiddlers call
Say that love is here for all
So I wrote her a letter
And I tried to forget her
Well, I don't know I'd I'll go
Can you hear the river flow?
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddlers call
Say that love is here for all
Lower your guns even if love turns to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfold
Oh, my friend
I hope you're done with yesterday
All the things we've heard
Have left and made their way
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well I hear the fiddlers call
Say that love is here for all
So I wrote her a letter
And I tried to forget her
Well I don't know if I'll go
Can you hear the river flow?
Say goodbye to your sorrow
And hello to tomorrow
Well, I hear the fiddlers call
Say that love is here for all
Lower your guns even if love turns to spite
We may find the enemy waiting inside
Light the candle to see what may unfoldEmbed
