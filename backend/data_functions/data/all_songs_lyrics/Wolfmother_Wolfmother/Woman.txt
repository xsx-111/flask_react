Woman Lyrics
Woman
You know you're woman
You got to be a woman
I got the feeling of love
When you're
You're talkin' to me
You see right through me
I got the feeling of love

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free
Yeah-ah, yeah

You're kinda looking at me
Like I've got to set you free
I can't be nobody
Well, you're kinda looking at me
Like I've got to set you free
I can't be nobody
She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free
Yeah-ah, yeah


Woman
You know you're woman
You got to be a woman
I got the feeling of love
When you're
You're talkin' to me
You see right through me
I got the feeling of love

She's a woman
You know what I mean
You better listen
Listen to me, yeah
She's gonna set you free
Yeah-ah, yeah6Embed
