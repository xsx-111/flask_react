Pyramid Lyrics
Can you see it's full of lightning?
All the futures that I see are whitening
I see the time of yesterday
Become the time that we have today, ow

I'm looking for a hidden meaning
Can you tell me if it's just a feeling?
I see the light shining in your eyes
Is it love just in disguise?

I saw the light shine out today
I saw the light shine out today
And it told me that, that you're not the one for me
That you're not the one for me

Can you hear the ancient calling?
I see the empires we built are falling
All we have is a human touch, ah
The clock is ticking even as we rush, ahEmbed
