Apple Tree Lyrics
Dear Sir, can you remember me
I'm the one that picked the apple tree
Dear Sir, can you remember me
I'm the one that picked the apple tree
Dear Sir, can you remember me
Have a look inside the family tree
Dear Sir, can you remember me
Have a look inside the family tree

Your daughter is so fine to see
Unraveled some mystery in me
When I see the apple in disguise
Ohh my love I can recognize

Dear Sir, can you remember me
I'm the one that picked the apple tree
Dear Sir, can you remember me
I'm the one that picked the apple tree
Dear Sir, can you remember me
I seen the forest for the tree
Dear Sir, can you remember me
I seen the forest for the tree
Your daughter is so fine to see
Unraveled some mystery in me
When I see the apple in disguise
Ohh my love I can recognize

Dear Sir, can you remember me
I'm the one that picked the apple tree
Dear Sir, can you remember me
I'm the one that picked the apple tree1Embed
