Joker & the Thief Lyrics
I said the joker is a wanted man
He makes his way all across the land
I see him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night
He's always laughing in the midst of power
Always living in the final hour
There is always sweet in sour
So we are not goin' home

Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away

What you see well you might not know
You get the feelin' comin' after the glow
The vagabond is moving slow
So I'll tell you all the story
'Bout the joker and the thief in the night
All the people that he see in the night
Hold their dreams up to the light
The wilder beast is searching for sight
And we are not going home
Can you see the joker flying over
As she's standing in the field of clover
Watching out everyday?
I wonder what would happen if he took her away

I said the joker is a wanted man
Makes his way all across the land
See him sifting through the sand
So I'll tell you all the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, I'll tell you the story 'bout the joker and the thief
I said, tell the story 'bout the joker and the thief in the night12Embed
