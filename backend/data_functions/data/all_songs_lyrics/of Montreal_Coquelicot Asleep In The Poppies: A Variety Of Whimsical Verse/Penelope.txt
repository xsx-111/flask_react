Penelope LyricsPenelope, shoot the apple off my head
I need to go to the store
To get some sleep
Because I've run out of sleep

And waved his arms like wheat
But when he tried to speak

"Sir, you were given this envelope by mistake, please disregard it."
Nicolynn, shoot the candle off my head
I need to go to the store
To get some beets
To rub all over my feet

That his sloth balloon was owned by Turkish moths
Gerard's Lebanese boss had sent him out on business

Does she tire of mechanical hands?
Or is she pining for the fair Prince of Plum?
Lulubird, shoot the doorbell off my head
I need to go to the store
To get some treats
For Gothe, Becket, and Keates
