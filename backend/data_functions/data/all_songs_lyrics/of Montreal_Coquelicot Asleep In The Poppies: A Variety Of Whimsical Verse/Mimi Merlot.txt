Mimi Merlot LyricsManuel's mouth filled with foam
Upon discovering the properties of Mimi Merlot
Just imagine his chagrin when he found she'd drugged him, tied him up, and locked him inside her wardrobe
On top of all of this, the boas hung above him made him sneeze Achoo!

Now she's covering the wardrobe in aluminum foil
(Oh! No! No!)

"Suck on it and maybe I'll let you go"
To which Manuel replies
"Oh... you want me to suck? Like this?"
Mimi Merlot, you're the most convincingly non-fictitious character that I know
Mimi Merlot, you're the most convincingly non-fictitious character that I know
Mimi Merlot, you are the most convincingly non-fictitious character that I know, ohEmbed
