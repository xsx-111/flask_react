Peacock Parasols LyricsOh, I woke up in Divarrje
Pledging P.P. Icycles and Lamar
I don't even know
Heard about my love for fairy Coquelicot
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, I made crepes for P.P. sleep
He's in the astronomer naming a few beds that aren't far
Persuading him to sleep his dreams in jars
Oh oh oh oh oh
Plumy plum drops of pear-shaped rain
And teardrops dripping pastly from peacock parasols
That obscure the mad procession
Oh oh oh
I modeled hoops of glass to console P.P. who buried his hands
But can't remember when
Even if he wears his hair like then
Oh oh oh
Is that Coquelicot?
Peering through the poppies
Peeping through the poppies
Oh oh oh oh
Coquelicot, CoquelicotEmbed
