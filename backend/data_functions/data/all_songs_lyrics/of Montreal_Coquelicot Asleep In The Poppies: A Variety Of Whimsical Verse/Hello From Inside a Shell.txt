Hello From Inside a Shell LyricsHello from inside a shell
You can see me cause my shell is invisible
It was made especially for me by the brilliant inventor Lecithin E
I ride my unicycle down stairs to his laboratory when I know he's there
Working on robotic aquatic bees, perfecting his mechanical donkeys... or running from exploding test tubes
Hello from inside a shell
You can see me cause my shell is invisible
It was made especially for me by the infamous inventor Lecithin E
I ride my boat car through the rays of his reverse megnetitizer when I'm feeling brave
Then everything I touch shoots into space, and astronauts shake their fists at us saying be careful
He's promised to build us a world of our own far away from this one
In uncharted regions where no one will go
He's promised to build us a world of our own
We'll find an island somewhere
Near the North Pole
And he'll invent lots of strange new animals to inhabit it so we won't feel alone
And we'll be happy there
All covered in snow
He's promised to build us a world of our own
And here we goEmbed
