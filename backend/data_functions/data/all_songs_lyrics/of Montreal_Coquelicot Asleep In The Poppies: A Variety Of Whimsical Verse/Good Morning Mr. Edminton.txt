Good Morning Mr. Edminton LyricsGood morning Mr. Edminton
Mr. Edminton, how are you feeling today?
I trust that life is treating you
The way that you want it to
Of course, I'm joking with you
Hello Mr. Lendingworth
Mr. Lendingworth, hope you're feeling okay
I've brought some books and a finance magazine
Because I feel bad for you
I'll tell you another thing too
Remember how they vowed to let that go
If your families paid the ransom
Well I think you both should know
That that's not their intention, but I
Will help to set you free if you'll do something for me
I want an honest job in one of your factories, please
Mr. Edminton
Mr. Edminton, tell me that you'll agree
And I'll untie you from that chair presently
And get you away from here
I'm judging by your tears
That you, Mr. Lendingworth
Dear Mr. Lendingworth, desire a part in our scheme
Well sir, I certainly would never even dream
Now of excluding you
I'll tell you both what to do
Tiptoe down the spiral stairs
Then just before the cellar door, you'll see a painting of a juggler
Touch his nose and that will open up a secret corridor
Take the ladder at the end up to the street and run as fast as you can
Then in a week or two, I'll start my job with you, you
Mr. Edminton, Mr. Lendingworth
Hurry before it's too late for us to escapeEmbed
