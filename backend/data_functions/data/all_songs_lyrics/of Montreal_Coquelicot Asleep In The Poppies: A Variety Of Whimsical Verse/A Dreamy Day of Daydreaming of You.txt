A Dreamy Day of Daydreaming of You LyricsYou're my muse, you're my silly goose
And every day is a dreamy day of daydreaming of you
You're my one, you're my honey bun
And every day is a dreamy day of daydreaming of you
I can dream of you without snoring and I'm lucky that that's true
Because everyone would know that I found them boring simply because they're not you
All I want to do is lay in the daisies and daydream of, you know who I'm referring to, you
You're my love, you're my star above
And every day is a dreamy day of daydreaming of youEmbed
