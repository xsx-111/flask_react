The Frozen Island LyricsOn a charming and frozen magical island far out at sea
I will take you there with me
No more ridicule no more grief, they can't reach as out at sea
Think how happy we will be
We loved their waxy faces but there wasn't any life below
There wasn't any life, there wasn't any life, there wasn't any life under their wax exteriors
Would you like another coconut?
I think there's one defrosting in our hut
Though the weather's quite inclement and when there's snow storms I can't see my shoes
I'm still glad I'm here with you
There's funny animals with beards and all of the fishes are see-through
The skunks have noses like kazoos
I like it here, I like it here, I like it here, I like it here
I like it here, I like it here, I like it here, I like it here
I like it here, I like it here, I like it here, I like it here
I like it here, I like it here, I like it here, I like it here, I like it
We climbed for hours and days and years and centuries
The island's sole lonely mountain
Until we were high enough to see the otters wearing
Monogrammed feces by a large and noisy donkey mole regimeEmbed
