Rose Robert LyricsRose Robert
I'd like to welcome you to our affair
We'll write a lovely little story just
You and I, as time goes by
Me and my Rose Robert
People stare
When we walk arm in arm along the thoroughfare
The gentlemen don't know whether to
Bow their heads or tip their hats instead
At me and Rose Robert
Rose Robert
All of our days move so slow
Since we stopped and let the world go on without us
We haven't got a care
Me and Rose Robert
(Yes! No! Yes!)
You're delightful mon chere
It's so lovely when we wear each other's clothes
You draw on your mustache while I powder my nose
Josephine and Fanny don't compare
To my Rose Robert
Rose Robert
Together we make quite a remarkable pair
It doesn't seem strange somehow that
We never speak, we just gurgle and squeak
Me and my Rose Robert
Few will dare
To offer any pleasantries or see how we fare
I guess they assume that we have
Lost our wits but we're just a couple of misfits
Me and my Rose Robert
