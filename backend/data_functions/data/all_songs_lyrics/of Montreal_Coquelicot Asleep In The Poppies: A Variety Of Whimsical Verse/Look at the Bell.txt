Look at the Bell LyricsDo you know you're being followed
By the shadow of a cat
Walking upright?
I was hoping that I could
Crack my eyes open and be greeted by a friend who loves me
Who would take me to Cap Corte's tower
With the bell at the top
We'd climb the rickety steps up to the bell
And look at the bell1Embed
