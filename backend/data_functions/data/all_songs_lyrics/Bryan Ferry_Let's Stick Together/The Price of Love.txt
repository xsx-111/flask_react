The Price of Love LyricsThe wine is sweet, the gin is bitter
Drink all you can but you won't forget her
You talk too much, you laugh too loud
You see her face in ev'ry crowd
And that's the price of love, the price of love
A debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blame
Kiss one girl, kiss another
Kiss them all, but you won't recover
You're dancing slow, you're dancing fast
You're happy now, but that won't last
And that's the price of love, the price of love
A debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blame
Kiss one
Kiss one
Kiss one
Kiss one girl, kiss another
Kiss them all, but you won't recover
You're dancing slow, you're dancing fast
You're happy now, but that won't last
And that's the price of love, the price of love
A debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blameEmbed
