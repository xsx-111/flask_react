Shame, Shame, Shame LyricsWell I tried to tell you, baby, but it made no sense
Now you got me, baby, up against the fence
Ain't that a shame, shame, shame, shame, the way you do
Well, it's a shame, shame, shame, shame
Oh it's a shame on you
Well, you walk out in the evening, don't say where you going
Six o'clock in the morning, you come walking home
And ain't that a shame, shame, shame, shame the way you do
Oh, it's a shame, shame, shame, shame
Yeah it's a shame on you
Well, I've been sitting here waitin', cryin' for you to come home
When I wake up, baby, sitting here all alone
Ain't that a shame, shame, shame, shame the way you do
Well, it's a shame, shame, shame
Oh it's a shame, shame on youEmbed
