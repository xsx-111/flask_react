Heart on My Sleeve LyricsI wear my heart on my sleeve
I'm not afraid
Say what I mean
Mean what I say
Set myself up
Let myself down
I may be a fool
Spread it around
And I, just want to let you know
Sometimes I, find it so hard not to show
So I sigh
And I let my feelings show
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Don't count the cost
If I can't live enough
Though you tend to get burned
You tend to get bruised
But it's my life
The way that I choose
And I, just want to let you know
Sometimes I, find it so hard not to show
Ooh don't sigh
Baby you're not alone
I'll wear my heart on my sleeve
Wear my heart on my sleeve
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Ooh and I, just want to let you know
Sometimes I, find it so hard not to show
Don't you sigh
Maybe you're not alone
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Wear my heart on my sleeve
(to fade)
