Tom Thum Lyrics
Get it Rugged Man
Get it, he stay fresh
R.A
Get it, with the style and finesse

Yo, I got a big head and a fat ego, I got the starving
And hungry poverty superiority flow
My pistol is old school class, I'm peeling your ass fast
Yo, I'm uncontrollably gifted, I totally ripped it
I'm vocally vicious, naming the best ever - I'm supposed to be listed
Even if I'm emotionally and overly twisted and socially timid
And every chick had left with a broken ovary when I hit it
The fans follow me like disciples, I'm Charlton Heston
Not the Moses version, I'm the gun toting version with the rifles
Don't let them crabs gash you when I'm jacking a rapper and ripping the jacket
Detaching your ass and using a machete to smash you
I'll rob anyone, anywhere, under the jacket, get the flame up
Pull the gun out at your wedding while your grandma do the Macarena
All these feminine rappers wanna see me dead and buried
Too many rappers is drag-queened out; Tyler Perry
Sick of the similar imitating, I did it already, the pitiful paid them
The bigger the better to bait them, you biting what I spitted, already, verbatim
I don't need to breathe when I rap, I got gills, fuck lungs
I'm like a superhero out of the toilet of the slums
Come on

Every verse like a firearm blasting ya
I'm number one, number one, number one
Verse like a smoking gun
I'm the greatest
I'm the greatest!
You ain't shit
Compared to me

Shacking up for the night at the crib with a B-movie actress
Shotgun next to the bed and the wad of cash under the mattress
As a kid I wasn't into theatrics, after school
My daddy used to teach me combatative Green Beret tactics
My flow natural, you artificial, beefed up Barry Bonds at BALCO
Dope or dog food? I spit heroin, your rhymes are alpo
I ain't into the tight jeans
I'm into bar brawls, brass knuckles, and bloody fight scenes
The mainstream pussies ever give me props? No, nada
That's like the Fox News giving props to Obama
Wait! I teach the children in the world the word hate
I eat pussy till every dyke on the Earth turn straight
I'm disturbing with the grammar. I'm more disturbing than
The bombing of the Baptist church in Birmingham, Alabama
I've been repping, I'll put a hit on any paper that my pen blessing
I'm nice with the hands, each fist is a registered weapon
I'll leave you forever resting, I don't care if you're beefed up steroids
Or what you bench pressing, I'm at the Best Western, tossing your girl salad
With some French dressing, hit you with a bat or a hatchet
Or the back of a ratchet, my flow, ain't a rapper that match it
Too much lyricism to digest, I do it on purpose
Two of my bars is more lyrical than two of your verses, come on

Every verse like a firearm blasting ya
I'm number one, number one, number one
Verse like a smoking gun
I'm the greatest!
You ain't shit
Compared to me
Get it, Rugged Man
Get it, he stay fresh
R.A

I tour the world
You're at home with your momma
I get ass
Every night you get no ass
Suck my balls
And choke on my dick you bitch
You ain't shit
