Bang Boogie Lyrics
Hand on the Bible, gotta hide though from the five-o
Shut your piehole, get your eyes stole
Ain't no industry devil ever getting my soul
I be the belligerent militant until I die, yo
Be like '88 Bobby smash tender Roni's
I'm a master at mastering ceremonies
Hit the bitch with the bad weave till she can't breathe
In the garden of Eden I'm Adam, pimp slap Eve
You should win an award for real when you’re rapping
Get a gold statue an Oscar for acting
Your ignorance limitless when you live in abyss
You looking like Cool J when he licking his lips
Lay in a bloody bath water when you're slitting your wrists
If it isn't a diss, bitch, then you get in ya ditch
I'm like put a bullet in the cop, bigot
White boy slam, dance mosh pit-ed
Rob your mama house, the lock – pick it
Lucked out if her throat not slitted
I'm the underdog Cinderella Man James Braddock
A pain addict, it ain't matter till your brain shattered
I'll be kicking your dick until your dick piss pus
I was given a gift like Kringle on Christmas
I'mma live my life, no consequences
Grab the barbed wire, hop the fences
Indie rap fans, a lot are pretentious
Talk hip-hop, but never got in the trenches
Bitch, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha (sing it)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (wha?)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (huh?)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (sing it)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (bitch)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (wha?)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (wha?)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (bitch)
Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat (sing it)3Embed
