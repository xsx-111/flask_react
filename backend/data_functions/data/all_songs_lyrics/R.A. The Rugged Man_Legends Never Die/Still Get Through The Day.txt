Still Get Through The Day Lyrics
Little ones listen, learn from me, see, you could be the best
But sit in your room depressed and you'll never progress
My sister Dee-Dee was born mentally retarded, she was a beautiful woman
At 26, but now she's dearly departed
This May Tenth, she suffered from a heart attack
The depletion of oxygen in the head left her in a coma brain-dead
Her internal organs was failing, her body no longer releasing excretions
My parents wouldn't pull the plug cause she was still breathing
Black, white, let's unite us, never divide us
X-Clan, Professor X died from spinal meningitis, so many like us
Are in Rikers suffering, struggling, slumming
A few years ago you was sucking your thumb
And now you're busting your gun
And dumbing, an innocent man is done
And enough of your bluffing, your thugging
And enough of the ruckus running, the roughest is coming
It's a miracle just being born, learn to enjoy life
It ain't that long, sing the words to my song, come on

Wake up, don't cry
So sad inside
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wanna give up, feel like hiding
Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Away
Away
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Living ain’t a breeze, please, life’s full of tragedies
We see our friends die, some get murdered, some die by disease
Got your finger on the trigger, don't do it
Contemplating suicide, just put the gun down, we've all been through it
An infant in his crib sprayed by stray bullets and dies
He was a future genius, he would have won a Pulitzer prize
The racist cop shot an innocent Black
An 8-year old prostitute hoeing, getting mommy money for crack
A little boy molested by his step-father, hopeless
The little boy grew up now, he's molesting his own kids
The government watching you from a satellite like you ain't had it right
Your best friend snitching on you; that's animal-like
It's horrible watching your loved ones die and having to bury em
This year, my cousin found dead, she overdosed shooting heroin
My family dying from sickening disorders, we found my brother Maxx
He was blue and purple and he was stiff with rigor mortis
My father got spots on his lungs, they think it's cancer
I'm praying every night, even if God don't ever answer
We can do it together, women hold your mans
Men hold your women, everybody let's hold hands and sing

Wake up, don't cry
So sad inside
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wanna give up, feel like hiding
Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Away
Away
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wake up, don't cry
So sad inside
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wanna give up, feel like hiding
Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway14Embed
