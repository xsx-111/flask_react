Make You Famous Lyrics
I just want to be famous
I just want the world to love me

"And this just in
Tom Cruise and Will Smith are butt-buddies
Back to you gentlemen!"

Top celebrity, top celebrity
Top celebrity, top celebrity
I'll make you famous

Hmm, so you wanna get your ugly face on TV
Wanna be a superstar, wanna be a top celebrity
Too short to be a ball player, too ugly to be an actor
Too dumb to sell drugs and now you're trying to be a rapper
Now all you gotta do is shake hands with the devil
Maybe lick a little, uh, penis, I'm for real, on the level
If you take a dick you could make a hit, you could jack the styles
Of underground rappers and claim you've created it
You could get cash and be massive, you could be worshipped and be a tool
For the corporations and help them gain control of the masses
Make sure you make more hits, product placement, packaging products
So poor people could make corporations more rich

I'll make you famous
I'll take your kids, your rhymes
Your blood, your life, your soul
Top celebrity, top celebrity
Top celebrity, top celebrity

Society, celebrity obsessed
Shock value, Janet pulling out a breast
Gaga wearing a meat maggot-infested dress
You don't need talent to be worshipped when you walk in a building
They'll praise you if you ain't shit but you rich and your parents own the Hilton
More and more people are becoming non-believers
In a world where your children know more about Snooki than they know about Jesus
And in the hood there's more pressure cause if you're a black actor in Hollywood
They try to make sure you become a cross-dresser
We like Martin running through traffic, butt-naked with a gat
Or little Britney shaving her head, beating up cars with a bat
Don't forget during your journey of dream-chasing you should promote
Illuminati images, pretend to be a Freemason
Worshipping witchcraft and satanic scriptures
R&B divas posing as Baphomet, goats and pagans in pictures
Don't try to help the neighborhood, they're broke, they don't feed you
And who cares if the babies are dying? They don't really need you
The ladies love you now, you're large till a lying-ass gold digger
Show up at your hotel and you catching a rape charge
So black people, don't be stupid, stop letting white lawyers
Business execs and white accountants dictate your music
 x2
I'll make you famous
I'll take your kids, your rhymes
Your blood, your life, your soul
Top celebrity, top celebrity
Top celebrity, top celebrity

Now BET got bought out, let me explain briefly
Now it's WET, white entertainment TV
Viacom, Time Warner and Disney, those the true
Dictators of black music, hip-hop and R&B
They're politicking your careers they could set you up and you could get
Murdered and your murderer just mysteriously disappears
Try to get murdered, take note, rappers
Cause getting killed can turn an average artist
With above average talent to GOAT status
Female entertainers, you losing the race, God forbid you get a
Wrinkle, go see the surgeon, hurry and mutilate your face
Sometimes you gotta come from the struggle and suffer
Other cases your dad can be OJ's lawyer
And you can fuck Brandy's little brother
 x2
I'll make you famous
I'll take your kids, your rhymes
Your blood, your life, your soul
Top celebrity, top celebrity
Top celebrity, top celebrity1Embed
