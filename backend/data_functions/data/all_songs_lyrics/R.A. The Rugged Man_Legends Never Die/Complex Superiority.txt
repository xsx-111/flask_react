Complex Superiority Lyrics
I do
I think about you

This track I'ma keep it simple no complex flow
And the most lyrical beast living you ain't even know
And it's a million years later and the fan base keep growing
Bringin' that murder mayhem like Joel and Ethan Coen
My undefeated record can't be broken, I'm the chosen
Jesus Christ the Lord, you can see me walking on the ocean
Let me do some exposing while you trying to be a thug, posing
You a faggot rapper in the gay club voguing
Forget Soulja boy, I'm bumpin' GZA Liquid Swords
I'll piss on the Grammys, I'll piss on the MTV Awards
Young rappers please make this shit last
Quit the minstrel show, black face tap dancing for the quick cash
I put a beating on your new schoolers, late bloomers
I'm the big daddy, You just Camachos and Chavez juniors
Thinking I might flip, the chance is slim
You praying on my downfall, those the prayers cause the lord ain't answering
Bring it

I'm on my own dick
(Braggadocios, flow so ferocious)
I got a superiority complex (say what)
(or is it just complex superiority)
My life is too hot for the T.V
It contains graphic violence, language and gratuitous nudity
Yo Paul let's make it happen, Eminem vs. me
It'll be an epic battle like Mike Tyson vs. Bruce Lee
Let's bring it back to the Rooftop with Brucie B
I done spit brutally before I hit puberty
And let's not just compare me to the other rappers
Cause I'm better than the Jim Morrisons and Mick Jaggers
Bob Dylan battle me, I'll rip you
They shot John Lennon but I'm a better lyricist than him, too
NYPD looking like the Keystone cops
It's your poppa's pop, even Justin Timberlake beatbox
Been a b-boy before Diddy freed the Lox
You receiving a beating, bleeding, beefing, you rather be vegan
Lyrically I put it on
I'm the nicest any religion I swear it on the bible and the Quran


Battle the pro, you will sadly lose
Yeah you just an amateur, Golden Gloves in the daily news
Mm-hmm whatever you can try to ignore my past
I'ma reign forever check your local weather forecast
Some People think because you sold more you more hot
My last album was a smash hit and yours was a flop
Spent two mil they ain't recouped, they still counting
We spent a couple grand and made it a few hundred thousand
Too many rappers fake in the booth, I state the truth
Without steroids I hit it out the park like Babe Ruth
Your bling bling glitter ain't cute
Challenge me that's a suicide mission that's worse than Beirut1Embed
