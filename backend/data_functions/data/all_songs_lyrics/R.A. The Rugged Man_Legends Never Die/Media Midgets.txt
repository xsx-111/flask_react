Media Midgets Lyrics
You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep me down

See, you ain't rocking for instance
You popping, but you robbing hip hop of traditions
You ain't rappers, you more like crooked politicians
Part of who's creation, new nation
Trying to fuck us with no lubrication
Raping, never losing to Lucifer Satan
Calling me Canaan the caveman in the cave, came close but never caved in
The false image of a prophet you praising
You living in a nation living in intimidation
Due to primitive media manipulation
Terror tactics and intimidation, we lack innovation
Looking for more fame they control your brain
The gullible puppets of the public get played like a board game
Get your jaw reconstructed, I ain't no puppet
Ain't throwing up no diamonds, here's the middle finger, go shove it

Fuck the media posing as experts
Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks
I'm not apologizing, I don't care what the cost is
Go ahead corporations, you can take back your endorsements
Fuck the media posing as experts
Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks
You can murder me before I let you take control
(My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul)
Telling you their lies and you believe in it
The mob minded media mentality speaking to the
Insecure sheep looking for leadership
Television producers looking for losers
Looking for stupider viewers
The advertisers dumb it down to consumers
You lost your integrity, you sold your soul for fame and fortune
You the fetus, I'm the rusty hanger in the back alley abortion
You ain't stopping the progression
My musical expression always got them guessing
When I'm dropping a lesson let it rot in your intestines
And why so many folks is jealous that I was co-signed by Biggie?
Internet nerds rewriting history lying saying he dissed me
I know in your small brains it might hurt
But I was there, the closest you ever got was wearing Biggie on your t-shirt
Whatever hype they supplying in advertising you buying
Let me guide and enlighten their lying
I ain't frightened of fighting
If you get offended by me and my honesty
Tell my publicist, she'll never find me making no public apology

Fuck the media posing as experts
Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks
I'm not apologizing, I don't care what the cost is
Go ahead corporations, you can take back your endorsements
Fuck the media posing as experts
Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks
You can murder me before I let you take control
(My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul)
Yo, from murdering children to dead soldiers to dead civilians
To the killings and the bombings of the buildings to borrowing trillions
Who's to blame when the brain of the next insane psycho flips?
Brain cells are programmed like they're membrane micro chips
I'm guns and Bible, I'm pro-life and pro-war, pro-fighting
Profanity writing, reciting
Gambling, tossing the dice and trifling
Riot inciting, no low lighting, no hiding
You wanna see the true racist? Just take look at Joe Biden

Fuck the media posing as experts
Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks
I'm not apologizing, I don't care what the cost is
Go ahead corporations, you can take back your endorsements
Fuck the media posing as experts
Fuck the radio, fuck the television networks
You can murder me before I let you take control
(My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul)

You can't keep me down, you can't keep down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep down
(My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul)
You can't keep me down, you can't keep down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep down
You can't keep me down, you can't keep down
(My mind is my own and I'm trusting my soul)1Embed
