Shuko Outro LyricsAll right y'all
To all my fans that are stuck with me through
All my career trials and tribulations
I love you motherfuckers for that
Legends Never Die
I mean, I had a long-ass career
But honestly this album is only the beginning
I got so much more in store for you motherfuckers
I just wanna thank everybody for letting me be part of their lives through music
The album is officially over
Except, I got this one little personal joint
I'mma leave you with one more...1Embed
