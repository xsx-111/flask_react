Learn Truth Lyrics

Take a piece of America back
It's called truth

We the last of the vintage flow-ers, we carry it on our shoulders
I keep my friends close and the devils a lot closer
When the Freedom Riders approach 'em, their appetite is vulturous
Soldiers of fortune are never no match for soldiers of culture
My flow is so fuckin' honest, you said you wanted to hear it
You lyin' 'cause all you wanted was for me to lift up your spirits
The truth is too fuckin' ugly and trust me, the shit got layers
You touch me, you think you tough, leave us toothless as rugby players
From sufis to soothsayers discussin' the true saviors
We move with the gangstas, you niggas sweeter than fruit flavors
The booth slayer provin' it's futile to hide from us
You misguided as missiles, so are suicide bombers
Takin' orders from the mullah, waitin' for karma to pull up
Their stones is no match for bullets, Israeli rachets are fuller
Gotta race to meet Allah like they chasin' 'em with a cop car
Like there's honor in being a martyr and the terrorists is the rockstars
Dodging the Abu Dhabi or dodging the paparazzi
Still probably as popular as Swastikas for Nazis
The cops protect the property properly when they crackin' heads
Murderers get as cocky as Perseus when the Kraken dead
I wonder what be runnin' through these crackers' heads
And why niggas is spillin' more blood than Cincinnati caps, black and red
I'll take an Actifed, go back to bed, allergic to the fumes
Havin' a funeral for the news 'cause the facts is dead
The trust is gone from the neocons to Barack Obam'
America eats its young from Casey Anthony to the Octomom (Wow)
Fix it and mix it up like martial arts in the Octagon
I spit the fire 'til we burn down Babylon
Take a piece of America back
You will only learn
It's called truth, it's called - it's called
It's called truth, you will only learn

Death by suicide bomb, Protestants, Bibles, a Quran, or Islam
From Genghis Khan to Vietnam, I can smell the napalm
Rape victims, ripped stockings, redneck Klan members doin' church bombings
Innocent fetuses being aborted with no options
Humans government ruinin'
Worryin' what weapons could be used to be nukin' 'em
Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem
Slaves treated like property, to Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima to Nagasaki
Adolf Hitler to every murderous Nazi
To the Gambinos, to the Gottis, to every Mafia atrocity
Child pornography, babies starvin' and dyin' in poverty
Serbians fightin' Croatians in Yugoslavia
Muslim women bein' raped, up to 40,000 in the war in Bosnia
The 50 million killed in the Second World War
The government poisonin' the minds and the bodies
Of the babies that are born poor
Airplanes blown up by Islamic extremists
In religion there's always drama
Whether worshippin' the Prophet Mohammed or Jesus
Smallpox to Napoleon' troops dyin' from typhus
From the Spanish Flu to the Black Plague, today it's the AIDS virus
Bodies in coffins, political extortions
Racist mobs murderin', Willie Turks, Michael Griffith and Yusef Hawkins
Check the murder rate, is it human nature to murder and hate?
The Catholic Church claimed women were witches and burned 'em at the stake
Pedophile predators attackin'
.38 Beretta used by Ghandi's assassin
16 bullets in Malcolm, it happened uptown Manhattan
And the homicide, Reagan '80s epidemic of crack
And soldiers in action dyin' in Iraq and never comin' back
And now let's
Take a piece of America back
You will only learn
It's called truth
It's called truth
You will only learn
It's called truth
It's called truth7Embed
