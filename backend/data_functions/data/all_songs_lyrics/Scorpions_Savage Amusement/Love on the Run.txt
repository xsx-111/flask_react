Love on the Run Lyrics
I love you once, rock you twice
My love's a gun that wants to talk tonight
I kiss the lust right from your lips
The way it feels will hit you like a blitz
Day after day
Day after day, I rock the speed
Night after night
Night after night
Love on the run
Always loaded like a gun
For love
Turn outside in and inside out
With me you'll find the kicks you've never found
I kiss the pearl right from the shell
Until you feel what all these words can't tell
Day after day
Day after day, I'm burning free
Night after night
Night after night
Love on the run
Always loaded like a gun
For love on the run
Love on the run
Always loaded like a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Love on the run
Always loaded like a gun
For love
Love on the run (yeah)
Always loaded like a gun
For love on the run1Embed
