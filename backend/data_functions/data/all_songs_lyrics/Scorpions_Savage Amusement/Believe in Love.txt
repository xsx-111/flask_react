Believe in Love Lyrics
How does it feel, babe, to taste sweet revenge?
Do you want me on my knees?
How does it feel, babe, to let me feel your strength?
Don't be cruel, can't you see?
If you don't catch me now, I can't stop falling down
Just one more night and the devil got my soul
I need your love, babe, don't treat me this way
Oh, I'll miss you so much more than words can say

How does it feel, babe, to kill our destiny?
I swear I'm not gonna crawl, oh no
How does it feel, babe, to make a fool out of me?
How can you be so cold? Be so cold?
If you don't catch me now, I can't stop falling down
Just one more night and the devil got my soul
I need your love, babe, don't treat me this way
Oh, I'll miss you, I'll miss you

Baby, our love's got what it takes
To give us one more chance to start, once again
Baby, our love will find a way
As long as we believe in love
If you don't catch me now, I can't stop falling down
Just one more night and the devil got my soul
I need your love babe, don't leave me this way
Ooh, I'll miss you, I'll miss you

Baby, our love's got what it takes
To give us one more chance to start, once again
Baby, our love will find a way
As long as we believe in love
As long as we believe, we believe
Baby, our love's got what it takes
To give us one more chance to start, once again
Baby, our love will find a way
As long as we believe in love
Baby, our love's got what it takes
To give us one more chance to start, once again
Baby, our love will find a way
As long as we believe in love
Baby, our love's got what it takes
To give us one more chance to start1Embed
