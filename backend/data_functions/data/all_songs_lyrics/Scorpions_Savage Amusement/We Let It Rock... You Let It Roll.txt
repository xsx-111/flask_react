We Let It Rock... You Let It Roll Lyrics
We come to you through a storm of lightning
To drive this place totally insane
Another show that really keeps us fighting
For what it takes to blow your mind away
Hey you, are you ready for tonight?
Can you hear me now? Let me hear you too
We come to you through a wall of thunder
Electrified by the sound of the guitars
Hey you, are you ready for tonight?
Can you see me now? I want to see you out there

(We let it rock) To free your energy
(You let it roll) Come on, get on your feet
(We let it rock) To feed your hungry dreams
(You let it roll) Live to the ecstasy

We come to you through a burst of fire
Energized by the feedback of the crowd
Hey you, are you ready for tonight?
Can you feel me now? Can you feel the groove?
(We let it rock) To free your energy
(You let it roll) Come on, get on your feet
(We let it rock) To feed your hungry dreams
(You let it roll) Live to the ecstasy

Come on and rock
Yeah

(We let it rock) Hey, you people out there
(You let it roll) You can bet your ass that we won't stop today
(We let it rock) Till everybody else gets crazy
(You let it roll)

(We let it rock) Yeah, c'mon
(You let it roll) Ow, get on your feet
(We let it rock) I feed your hungry dreams
(You let it roll) Live to the ecstasy
(We let it rock)
(You let it roll) C'mon, get on your feet
(We let it rock) Free your energy
(You let it roll) Live to the ecstasy1Embed
