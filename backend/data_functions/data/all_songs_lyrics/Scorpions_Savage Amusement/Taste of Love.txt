Taste of Love LyricsIn her life not much loving
From the early years she felt that she was falling
Even I, have never seen her laughing
Asked her why and she would say
That she's still hoping for love
Taste of love
Taste of love
Taste of love
In her time so much growling
Why on earth can’t no one hear that she's still calling?
On and on, that demon you're still loving
Asked her why and she would say
That she’s still hoping for love
Taste of love
Taste of love
Taste of lovе
All the time
He says to hеr "My loving is true"
Expressing his wishes is breaking her heart
He even said the words "I love you"
She's getting a taste of love
In her life so much crying
From the early years she felt that love was dying
Even I, have never seen her laughing
Asked her why and she would lie
That she's still hoping for love
Taste of love
Taste of love
Taste of love
All the time
He says to her "My loving is true"
Expressing his wishes is breaking her heart
He even said the words "I love you"
She's getting a taste of love
One more time no more fooling
Why on earth can't no one see that she's still running
On and on, no more loving
Asked her why and she would lie
That she's still hoping for love
Taste of love
Taste of love
Taste of love
All the time
He says to her "My loving is true"
Expressing his wishes is breaking her heart
He even said the words "I love you"
She's getting a taste of love
All the time
He says to her "My loving is true"
Expressing his wishes is breaking her heart
He even said the words "I love you"
All the time
He says to her "My loving is true"
Expressing his wishes is breaking her heart
He even said the words "I love you"
She’s getting a taste of love
Taste of love...Embed
