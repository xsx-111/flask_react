Every Minute Every Day Lyrics
Well it seems that I was lost in intoxicated nights
Following the trace of ecstasy
With no future and no past, just the present was alive
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream
I was drowning in a feeling that obsession rules
Till the morning kills the creatures of the night
And I read your lipstick message on the mirror of the truth
Now that you're gone, I realize
Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same

I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay

Well I know that I was lost in a nightmare of my life
Following the flash of fantasy
In a feeling that exploded I'd left reality behind
Addicted to the power of the dream
Without you
Life's like that road that leads nowhere
Without you
The world won't feel the same

I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay
Without you
Life's like a song without music
Without you
This world won't be the same

I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay
I need your love every minute
I need your love every day
I need your love every minute
I need your love, come back and stay1Embed
