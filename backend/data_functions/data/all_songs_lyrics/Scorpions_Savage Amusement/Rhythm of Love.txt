Rhythm of Love Lyrics
Let's spend the night together
I know you want it too
The magic of the moment
Is what I've got for you
The heartbeat of this night is made to lose control
And there is something in your eyes that's longing for some more
Let us find together the beat we're looking for

The rhythm of love keeps me dancing on the road
The rhythm of love, I've got the groove that hits the bone
The rhythm of love is the game I'm looking for
The rhythm of love is the heartbeat of my soul

Let's reach the top together
One night will never do
An exploding shot of pleasure
Is what I've got for you
Why don't you close your eyes, let your feeling grow?
I make you feel the taste of life until your love will flow
Let us find together the beat we're longing for

The rhythm of love keeps me dancing on the road
The rhythm of love, I've got the groove that hits the bone
The rhythm of love is the game I'm looking for
The rhythm of love is the heartbeat of my soul
The rhythm of love keeps me dancing on the road
The rhythm of love, I've got the groove that hits the bone
The rhythm of love is the game I'm looking for
The rhythm of love is the heartbeat of my soul
The rhythm of love keeps me dancing on the road
The rhythm of love, I've got the groove that hits the bone
The rhythm of love is the game I'm looking for
The rhythm of love is the heartbeat of my soul

Let us find together the beat we're looking for3Embed
