Someone To Watch Over Me LyricsThere's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd for this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although he may not be the man
Some girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over meEmbed
