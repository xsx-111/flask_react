Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be?) LyricsI on't know why
But I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I've never had
Never had no kissin'
Ooh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh where can you be
The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But there's no one to love me
Lover man, oh where can you be?
I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance can be
Like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
And whisper sweet little things in my ears
Hugging and a-kissing
Ooh
What I've been missing
Lover man, oh where can you be?
I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance can be
Like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
And whisper sweet little things in my ears
Hugging and a-kissing
Ooh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh where can you be?Embed
