Distraction LyricsThere's a simple escape, it covers any mistake
Always have a good distraction
If you can keep the debate, he said she said rage
They'll forget whatever happened
We devide, we take aside, spinning on forever
Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting
Waiting, in the same line
Use your head to prepare, a real fight's not declared
A symbol doesn't cause your problem
Take a walk see who cares, it only works if you're scared
Try the fear and you have lost
Pick someone, anyone, no one ever questions
Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting
Waiting, in the same line
Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting
Waiting, in the same line
Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting
Waiting, in the same line
Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting
Waiting, in the same line
Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting
Waiting, in the same line
Run, slow down, run, we're all waiting
Waiting, in the same line
(Waiting, waiting...)Embed
