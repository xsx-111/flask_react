Chase This Light Lyrics
I'm a suspect, I'm a traitor
I'm only here in body visiting
Yellow faces in the distance screams
"The beauty is in what isn't said,"
I'm rising to my feet

Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know, it's alive and somewhere for us to find
Tonight, oh chase this light with me

My just so, my last call
My life is yours in your gifted hands
Confetti rainfall in a quiet street
These things I've found are special now
The knot is in my reach

Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know, it's alive and somewhere for us to find
Tonight, oh chase this light with me
A movie, still photograph
Through a martyr's eyes can I see
I've seen the best of love, the best of hate, the best reward is earned
And I've paid for every single word I ever said

Confetti rainfall in a quiet streets
The beauty is in what you make it
So get up on your feet

Because tonight, the world turned in me
Because right now, I don't dare to breathe
Oh, babe, I know, it's alive and somewhere for us to find
Tonight, oh chase this light with meEmbed
