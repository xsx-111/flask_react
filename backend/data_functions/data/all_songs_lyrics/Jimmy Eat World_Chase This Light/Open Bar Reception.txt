Open Bar Reception LyricsThis should be a night to be remembered
We'll remember you can be sure of that
On and on we walk out to the crowd
I'm expected you're expected
No one else will know that you've been crying
Think of where we are and who will care
I should've hired someone who could sing just a little better
Prince controversy
I should feel we're going somewhere better
But I don't
Why should we be anything but strangers
In clothes that we don't own
I just realized that this has been the first time
We've seen each others vulnerability
Somewhere between hello and goodbye
There is something serious that we always missed
I should feel we're going somewhere better
But I don't
Why should we be anything but strangers
In clothes that we don't own
Drifting in and out a priest is talking
Something 'bout a body from a bone
A thinking man said I could never be
Half as close to you as you are to me
I should feel it all leads somewhere better
But I don't
Why should we be anything but strangers
In clothes that we don't own
I should feel we'll get to someplace better
But I don't
Why should we be anything but strangers
In clothes that we don't ownEmbed
