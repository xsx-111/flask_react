Feeling Lucky Lyrics
There's a chance, one of us will give in soon
I could ask, but what's an answer gonna prove?
I try to get mad, but the fever drops
My heart can't break 'cause the beating stops
Yeah, suck that lucky feeling right outta me

Wanna laugh? Take a look around the room
It's a dance, tired steps in brand new shoes
I can only take a guess what the morning brings
If it feels too good, then it probably is
Yeah, suck that lucky feeling right outta me

I follow your sign, where it leads I go
But you turned your back so easily
It tells me everything I need, yeah
Waiting for the line to move a foot, yeah
Wasting my life on nothing good
Suck that lucky feeling right outta me

I should act; tie it down or cut you loose
It's a trap, any direction I move
When I try to sing along, the needle skips
I huff and then I puff but my house is bricks, yeah
Suck that lucky feeling right outta me
Yeah you sucked that lucky feeling right outta me
Yeah you sucked that lucky feeling right outta me, yeahEmbed
