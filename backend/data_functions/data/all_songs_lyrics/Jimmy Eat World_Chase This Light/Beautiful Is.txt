Beautiful Is LyricsSome say beautiful
Is only ones and zeros
In the light
The skin that wraps around
And keeps you here
Only hold you here in life
Don't love the soul
It's only dots and crosses in your eyes
Everything we do is just a thing
And it's only here but just this little while
But it's my life my own
Lot of people trust this but I don't
No one hears the things that I believe through the shouts
The truth is something, baby, no one really knows
I'll say beautiful
Is the way your eyes stands with me in this light
The body wraps around and keeps me here
Is one to give to you in full tonightEmbed
