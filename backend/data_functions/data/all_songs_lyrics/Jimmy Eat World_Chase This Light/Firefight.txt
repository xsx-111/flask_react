Firefight Lyrics
This is where our diligence has lead
The waves roll in to claim our patient steps
Can we become more than just ourselves?
And leave the sand, our want, our will, our doubt

It's firefight, I won't run
They're spitting spite all through my blood
For you and me, there's nowhere left to hide
Except you and me, there's no one else alive

This is now the moment after next
Are these still the eyes of a temptress?
Why open the door if you won't go?
Don't ask twice if you don't wanna know


Is there an answer?
If it's an honest one, honestly worth its question
There's no question
The city as my witness
I am who I wanna be, but you could be anything
Just be anything here with me
Endless quotes and with the second hand
If you let go then that's where time will stand
