Big Casino Lyrics
Steady

Before this world starts up again
It's me and night
We wait for the sun
The kids and drunks head back inside
Well, there's lots of smart ideas in books I've never read
When the girls come talk to me, I wish to hell I had

(Get up, get up) Turn the ignition
(Get up, get up) Fire up the system
Play my little part in something big

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice."
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand."
(They'll say)

Back when I was younger, I was someone you'd've liked
Got an old guitar I've had for years I'd let you buy
And I'll tell you something else that you ain't dying enough to know
There's still some living left when your prime comes and goes
(Get up, get up) Dance on the ceiling
(Get up, get up) Boy, you must be dreaming
Rock on young saviour, don't give up your hopes

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice."
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand."

I have one last wish
And it's from my heart
Just let me down
Just let me down, easy

I'll accept with poise, with grace
When they draw my name from the lottery
And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice."
I'm the one who gets away
I'm a New Jersey success story
And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake his hand."
(They'll say)1Embed
