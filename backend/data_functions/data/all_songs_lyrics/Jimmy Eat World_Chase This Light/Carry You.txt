Carry You Lyrics
When I know I'm all alone
I say your name slowly
And I know that I'm alone
But I'll carry you

Does it feel good like a memory
When you try some history?
It's a dream to come around
The rule doesn't bend
Because the taste doesn't taste the same again

It's easy feeling righteous when removed
All you'll get is what you wanna hear
It hurts because it should
How else am I to make it clear?

I could never be the one that you want, don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed

Maybe a lie is what I need sometimes
You told the most and best of anyone
You said to "keep me in your pocket"
So I carried you
You better choose your words carefully
Because I'm not your anything
Gonna stay here in my place
And you'll stay in yours because
You're only good as what you're good for

I pace around the room to spend the time
Waiting while the burning pictures fade
One thing to make your mind
And another to say its name

I could never be the one that you want, don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed

I'm still carrying a little hope
That maybe things could be different now
Is that so wrong, is that so wrong, is that so wrong?

Would I see you tonight
At a place we go?
Could going through the motions, lead to real emotion?
I wanna make things right
Before time runs out
It was like you said, the taste don't taste like it should
Roll down the windows
Let the cold air come in
Slap my face just feel you somehow again, again
I could never be the one that you want, don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passed
I could never be the one that you want, don't ask
Well, here's to living in the moment
'Cause it passedEmbed
