Be Sensible LyricsLet me have the keys and you can take a rest
From one lifeless main street until the next
Who knows what there was to see
Before the light turned green
There's so much here to learn
The static or the silence don't know which is worse
The dial isn't broken that's the way it works
To the new professionals
Irregular is normal
It'll all in how you pray
Not what needs to change
Don't get comfortable
Don't be sensible
Swing with all you have
Stop me if you can
Imagine we had canvas with our midnight cold
We'd dig our fingers in and then we'd watch the snow
Maybe i need stronger meds
Don't let those feelings in
I can't get closer now
Matter's straight across and just for me to use
But theres always another choice, another way through
The notes of progress float along
Over your candle song
The game is how you play
Not who wears a ring
Don't get comfortable
Don't be sensible
Swing with all you have
Stop me if you can
I'm on the losing side
Not everytime
I'm gonna lose this love of mine
Here are the words to find
Not one is mine
Why are we still so afraid?
The things we do deserve their rightful names
Don't get comfortable
Don't be sensible
Swing with all you have
Stop me if you can
Don't get comfortable
Don't be sensible
Swing with all you have
Stop me if you can
I'm on the losing side
Not everytime
I'm gonna lose this love of mine
Here are the words to find
Not one is mine
Why are we still so afraid?
The things we do deserve their rightful namesEmbed
