Let It Happen Lyrics
I have a ringing in my head
And no one to help me answer it
Even with you close enough to kiss
Every minute is arranged
Every moment lasts a day
But thinking about it can't help me let go, I know

Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah

I must look like I'm running away
To you at your faster pace
Wonder what it is you could have seen, in me
Yeah, I'm the evil one who said
Gonna let everything just happen
And like my chest, my ears are proud
Collision is such an ugly sound
I can hear ya now

Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
I can laugh it off
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah

Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
Ha, ha, ha-ah, ha, ha-ah-ah
I can hear ya now

Talk, talking a lot, but it's still talk
Gotta love how it's somehow all on me
All the petty scenes
And all the pretty things
Say whatever you want, cause I can laugh it offEmbed
