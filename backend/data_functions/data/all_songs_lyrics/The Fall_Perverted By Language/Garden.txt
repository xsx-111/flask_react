Garden LyricsThe first God had in his garden
From the back, looked like a household pet
But when it was twirled 'round
Was revealed to be a 3 legged black grey hog
See what flows from his mushy pen
Garden, garden
That person is films on TV
5 years back at least
He's the "Young Generation" dancing troupe
Trying to perform country and western
Do a dance here
Never since birth not eaten in a day
Never since courtship stayed up some nights
He had the 'Kingdom of Evil' book
Under a German history book
He was contrived like that
See what flows from his slushy pen
Garden, garden
Small, small location on huge continet
Sodomized by presumption
Contrieved a past revealed at last
Godzone, godzone
Godzone, godzone
(...his ferry stopped at 'Pool port. revealed to be spolit
Slate with largesse resource
Wild Bill hick, shaves and charts at last, made the second God sad -
He's coming up...)
Shotgun, shotgun
Shotgun, shotgun
The best firms advertise the least
The second God lives by fountains
That flowed  by the blue shiny lit roads
Had forgot what others still try to grasp
He knew the evil of the phone
He knew the evil of the phone
The bells stopped on Sunday when he rose
The bells stopped on Sunday when he rose
He's here, he's here, at last
I saw him! I swear!
On the second floor
Up on the brown baize lift shaft
He's here! He's here at last!
I saw him! I swear!
