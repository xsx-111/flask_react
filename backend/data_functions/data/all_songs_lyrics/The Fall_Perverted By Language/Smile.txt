Smile LyricsTight faded male arse
Decadence and anarchy
He said, he smiled
Something to dance to
A certain style
Smile! (x4)
Meat animals
Smiled! (x2)
Patchwork jacket from the top of his ears
Shaved
Relation with fellow age group and opposite birds
Smiles!
Wants anarchy
Smiled!
The club nerve and poses physical awareness
Smiles!
Take the chicken run, take the chicken run
To the toilet
In the above, designed from above club
Makes ginger
"Go on, you can do it!"
Smile! Smiles!
Wants anarchy
Smiled!
Is the fungus damp in the cellar?
Positive G.B.H
Smiles!
With his friends, ask for cigarettes
Smiles!
Sparks off
Repeal gun laws in my brain
Sparks off
Give us a gun if I got one
Damn! Grin!
Damn! Grin!
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Smile! Smiled!
Would ask for a lager in the town of Auschwitz
Smiles!
Desires travel
Well fed in a welfare way
Smiles! Smiled! Smiles!
Lousy celebrity makes joke record
Lick-spittle southerner
Waiting for next holiday by gas miser
Smiles! Smiles!
Positive G.B.H.!
Roar, encore, special vexation process
Tight faded male arse
Decadence and anarchy
He said, he smiles
Smile! Smiled!
Well fed in a roman Nero way
Like the way you imagined
In the roman and Nero filmsEmbed
