Hexen Definitive / Strife Knot LyricsTied up to posts
Blindfold so can't feel maintenance
Kickback art thou that thick?
Death of the dimwits
Businessman hits train
Businessman hits train
His veiled sex seeps through his management sloth
The journey takes one hour
And it's a hexen hour
Hexen school, hexen cursed
Hexen bowl boils, hexen rule
Explain the mood harm
The DDR scene
Alpine pullovers
Alpine give over
You can clutch at my toes
You will drive me insane
You know nothing about it
It's not your domain
Don't confuse yourself
With someone who has something to say
Cause it's a hexen rain
Hexen fodder, hexen cursed
Hexen bowl boils, hexen rule
Explain the mood harm
While greenpeace looked like saffron on the realm
Brown, shrivelled
A Kellog's peace
The opposition was down
Red church on a hill
Red church on a hill
Styrofoam insides
Aluminium tiers
Louis Armstrong tapes waft down the aisles
And it's a hexen hour
Hexen file, hexen rule
Hexen bowl boils
Hexen rule in the hour of the fall
It takes grace to play the second fiddle well
His cap emblazoned a crusty knife
Live only one, was these you ate
Goes with you down, and pats your head
That's strife knot, strife k-not
Strife is life and don't forget it
Strife is life, you don't wanna hear it
Could be thirteen or thirty one of this mob
Could be thirteen or thirty one of this mob
Strife knot, strife k-not
Life is strife but you don't wanna hear it
Strife is life and that's it
And that's it, and that's it
And that's itEmbed
