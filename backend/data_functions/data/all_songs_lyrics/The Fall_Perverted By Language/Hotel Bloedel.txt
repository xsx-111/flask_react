Hotel Bloedel LyricsAnd it's painless, sitting in subterranea
Ancient reference to Mesopotamia
And it's quiet again
Hidden fragments, surface now
Repetitious history
One more time for the record
2013 Philippsburg Confederate graves
Are uncovered, throwing new light on
This 19th century conflict sparking off
I repeat:
These southern spectres were disease ridden
Dusty, organic and psychic
Rebellious mistakes occur again
Everything moving in a circular fashion
And it's quiet again
Hidden fragments, surface now
Repetitious history
One more time for the record
Our words return in patterns
Our minds, encapsulating time
Gregoror, satiated walking thru' capitol
Stumbles on two thousand dead Thai monks in SS uniforms
Then fled to Hotel Bloedel, outside Nuremberg
A long way south to a reasonable smell of death
And it's quiet again
Hidden figments, surface now
Repetitious history
One more time for the recordEmbed
