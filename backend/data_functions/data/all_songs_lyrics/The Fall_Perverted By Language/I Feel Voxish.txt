I Feel Voxish LyricsA pillbox crisp
Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer
A pillbox crisp, that French git
The spikes he left in the bathroom
And I never heard from him again
Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer
But it made me hungry
For victuals could not raise nor buy
I feel voxish, stack-heeled Hari Krish
Those disgusting vegan new/youth punks
Caught my life mould, give me silenced lectures
Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer
But it made me hungry
For victuals could not raise nor buy
I've been sharpening a knife in the bathroom
On a brick I got from the garden
No one will fuck with me again
Offer, offer, it was not an unreasonable offer
But it made me hungry
For victuals could not raise nor buy
Feel vox crisp
And voxishEmbed
