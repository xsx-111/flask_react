When Lights Are Low LyricsListen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low
Dear, we're so close together I love you so
Why think about the weather
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms
Our lips meeting soft and tender
Love's all aglow
Why shouldn't we surrender
When lights are low
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low
Dear, we're so close together I love you so
Why think about the weather
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms
Our lips meeting soft and tender
Love's all aglow
Why shouldn't we surrender
When lights are lowEmbed
