Rewrite Lyrics
I've been working on a rewrite, that's right
Going to change the ending
Going to throw away the title
And toss it in the trash
Every minute after midnight
All the time I'm spending
Is just for working on the rewrite, that's right
I'm going to turn it into cash

I been working at the car wash
I consider it my day job
'Cause it's really not a pay job
But that's where I am
Everybody says "The old guy
Working at the car wash
Hasn't got a brain cell left
Since Vietnam"

But I say help me, help me
Help me, help me, Thank you!
I'd no idea that you were there
When I said
"Help me, help me
Help me, help me, whoa Thank you!
For listening to my prayer
I've been working on a rewrite, that's right
Going to change the ending
Throw away the title
Toss it in the trash
Every minute after midnight
All the time I'm spending
Is just for working on the rewrite
Going to turn it into cash

I'll eliminate the pages
Where the father has a breakdown
And he has to leave the family
But he really meant no harm
Gonna substitute a car chase
And a race across the rooftops
Where the father saves the children
And he holds them in his arms

But I say help me, help me
Help me, help me, Thank you!
I'd no idea that you were there
When I said help me, help me
Help me, help me, whoa Thank you!
For listening to my prayer2Embed
