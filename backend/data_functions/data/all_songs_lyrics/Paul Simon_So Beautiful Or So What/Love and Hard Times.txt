Love and Hard Times Lyrics
God and his only son
Paid a courtesy call on Earth
One Sunday morning
Orange blossoms opened their fragrant lips
Songbirds sang from the tips of cottonwoods
Old folks wept
For his love in these hard times

"Well, we gotta get goin'"
Said the restless lord to the son
"There are galaxies yet to be born
Creation is never done
Anyway, these people are slobs here
If we stay, it's bound to be a mob scene
But disappear
And it's love and hard times"

I loved her the first time I saw her
I know that's an old songwriting clich√©
Loved you the first time I saw you
Can't describe it any other way
Any other way
The light of her beauty
Was warm as a summer day
Clouds of antelope roll by
No hint of rain to come
In the prairie sky
It's just love, love, love, love, love

When the rains came, the tears burned
Windows rattled, locks turned
It's easy to be generous
When you're on a roll
It's hard to be grateful
When you're out of control
And love is gone
The light at the edge of the curtain
Is the quiet dawn

The bedroom breathes in clicks and clacks
Uneasy heartbeat, can't relax
But then your hand takes mine
Thank god I found you in time
Thank god I found you
Thank god I found youEmbed
