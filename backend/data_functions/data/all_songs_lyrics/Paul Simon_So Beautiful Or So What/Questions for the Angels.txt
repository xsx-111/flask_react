Questions for the Angels Lyrics
A pilgrim on a pilgrimage
Walked across the Brooklyn Bridge
His sneakers torn
In the hour when the homeless
Move their cardboard blankets
And the new day is born
Folded in his backpack pocket
The questions that he copied from his heart
Who am I in this lonely world
And where will I make my bed tonight
When twilight turns to dark?

Questions for the angels
Who believes in angels?
Fools do, fools and pilgrims
All over the world

If you shop for love in a bargain store
And you don't get what you bargain for
Can you get your money back?
If an empty train in a railway station
Calls you to its destination
Can you choose another track?
Will I wake up from these violent dreams
With my hair as white as the morning moon?
Questions for the angels
Who believes in angels?
I do, fools and pilgrims
All over the world

Downtown Brooklyn, the pilgrim is passing
A billboard that catches his eye
It's Jay-Z, he's got a kid on each knee
He's wearing clothes that he wants us to try

If every human on the planet
And all the buildings on it
Should disappear
Would a zebra grazing
In the African savanna
Care enough to shed one zebra tear?
