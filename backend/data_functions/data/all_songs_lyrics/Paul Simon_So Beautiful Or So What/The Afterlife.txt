The Afterlife Lyrics
After I died and the makeup had dried
I went back to my place
No moon that night, but a heavenly light
Shone on my face
Still I thought it was odd, there was no sign of God
Just to usher me in
Then a voice from above, sugar coated with love
Said, "Let us begin"

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

OK, a new kid in school, got to follow the rule
You got to learn the routine
Whoa, there's a girl over there with the sunshiny hair
Like a homecoming queen
I said, "Hey, what you say? It's a glorious day
By the way, how long you been dead?
Maybe you, maybe me, maybe baby makes three"
But she just shook her head
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

Buddha and Moses and all the noses
From narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line just to glimpse the divine'
What you think about that?
Well it seems like our fate to suffer and wait
For the knowledge we seek
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line
No one here likes a sneak

You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line

After you climb up the ladder of time
The Lord God is near
Face to face in the vastness of space
Your words disappear
And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love
And the current is strong
But all that remains when you try to explain
Is a fragment of song
Lord is it, Be Bop A Lu La or Ooh Poppa Do
Lord, Be Bop A Lu La or Ooh Poppa Do
Be Bop A Lu La1Embed
