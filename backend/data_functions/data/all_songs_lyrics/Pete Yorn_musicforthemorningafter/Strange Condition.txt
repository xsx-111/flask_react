Strange Condition LyricsRead me the letter, baby
Do not leave out the words
Stories and cigarettes ruined lives of lesser girls
And I wanna know
‘Cause I want you to know
And it’s a strange condition
A day in prison
It’s got me out of my head
And I don’t know what I came for
Send me the money, baby
Do not leave out the wage
You know you’re the best thing ever
To come out of this place
Hey I want you to know
‘Cause I wanna know
And it’s a strange condition
A day in prison
It’s got me out of my head
And I don’t know what I came for
I want you to know...
It’s a strange condition
A day in prison
It’s got me out of my head
And I don’t know what I came for
I want you to know
I want you to know...
So leave out the others, baby
Say I’m the only one
Cut out the uniforms
And settle with the sun
Hey I want you to know
‘Cause I wanna know
And it’s a strange condition
And life in prison
It’s got me outta my head
And I don’t know what I came for
I want you to know...
I want you to know...
I want you to know...
Yeah, I want you to know...
I want you to know...
Yeah, I want you to know...
I want you to know...
‘Cause I wanna know
Yeah I gotta know
Yeah I gotta know
Yeah I gotta know
