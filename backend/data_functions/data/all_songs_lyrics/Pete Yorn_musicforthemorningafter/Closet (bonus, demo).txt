Closet (bonus, demo) LyricsOh Billie I want you so
I'm trying to meet you
Too many things they don't know
Too many repeatings
Of beatings
And I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again
So Billie I lost control
I'm trying to meet you
Too many things they don't know
Too many repeatings
Of beatings
So I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again
So don't stop don't stop don't turn around
So Billie I lost control
I'm trying to meet you
Too many things they don't know
Too many repeatings of beatings
Of beatings'
So I'm walking around your closet
I want you to say my name again
Oh Billie I lost control
Don't stop don't turn aroundEmbed
