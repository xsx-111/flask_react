June LyricsPots and pans are indestructible
How do you respect your room?
If you hadn't gone tomorrow
You could have stayed on 'til June
It's alright if I was older
It's ok to lose your age
And I, want to follow you
I do, I do
It's another I could trust you
It's another thing to swear
I'm ok with all the others
It's just her I cannot stand
I'm old enough to feel the way I do
And I know that you are true
It's just a part of my genes
And I want you to know
It's hard to wait on
I'll swallow you whole
Wait kindly in the next room
And you have stayed
A mile away from me
And you will stay a mile away from me
If you know what's good for you
You could have stayed until JuneEmbed
