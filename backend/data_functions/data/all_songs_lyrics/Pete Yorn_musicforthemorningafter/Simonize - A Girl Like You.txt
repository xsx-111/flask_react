Simonize / A Girl Like You LyricsSimonize
Hey
Don't take your life away
I think you'd rather stay
Then follow me into the alleyway
We were passers on the street
I never thought we'd meet until I said
"How do you do, my love?"
You'll fall
You'll fall
Hey don't stop and turn away
I'm sure you'd rather stay
Than follow me into the alleyway
We were passers on the street
Don't turn it into grief
Just follow me into disaster
You'll fall
You'll fall
Fall'
Hey don't look and turn away
Lose your life today and follow me into the alleyway
You should turn and walk with me
I'll even follow Him
In search of wretched grand disaster

A girl Like You
Someday
I'll look into her green eyes
And know that she'll come with me
A girl like you
Too many
Things I do not care for
But one thing that I adore
Is a girl like you
I'll always try
To look you in the eye
It's okay
With a girl like you
Tomorrow
I think I'll tell you something
The thing that I haven't said
To a girl like you
And even if
I don't know what the day will bring
Still I can tell most anything
To a girl like you
I'll always try
To look you in the eye
It's okay
With a girl like you
It's okay
With a girl like you
A girl like youEmbed
