Sense LyricsTime flew away
But something won't forgive it all
Days and weeks
Let's start from the beginning of a life
She called today
Pretending not to care at all
For days and weeks
Now he's hanging from the ceiling
What a life
Oh what a life
Was it a life?
Is something wrong with me?
I show you things you've never seen
Is something wrong with me?
I show you things that you've only dreamed of
I'm wide awake
I'll drop you off for saying that
For days and two weeks
It was you who was defending such a lie
Oh what a lie
Was it a lie?
Is something wrong with me?
I show you things you've never seen
Is something wrong with me?
I show you things that you've only dreamed of
You never change, you never change
Is something wrong with me?
I've shown you things you've never seen
Is something wrong with me?
I've shown you things you've never seen
Is something wrong with me?
I've shown you things you've never seen
Is something wrong with me?
I've shown you things that you've only dreamed up
You never change
Something won't forgive it allEmbed
