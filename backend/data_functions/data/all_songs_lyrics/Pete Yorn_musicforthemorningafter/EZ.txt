EZ Lyrics
Only save
Try to find another way
I’m taking what I gave to you again
Some new day
I could understand your face
You could even hold my hand if you would like to

It came up unexpected
I had to follow through
And it’s hard when you were working like you do

It was easy when you were younger
You can put it back together
It was there if you ever wanted it
But you closed the door
And said goodbye for good

So this is a mistake
Try to find a better way
You were never fond of anything I said
Can we begin again?
Save it for another friend
I was happy in my life I won’t pretend

Every time you were expecting
To reach out and forgive this
I was hardened by the look upon your face

It was easy when you were younger
You can put it back together
It was there if you ever wanted it
But you closed the door and said goodbye for good
For good
It was easy when you were younger
You can put it back together
It was there if you ever wanted it
But you closed the door and said goodbye
It was easy when you were younger
You can put it back together
It was there if you ever wanted it
But you closed the door and said goodbye for good
You said goodbye for good
You said goodbye for good
You were easy
You were easy
You were easy
You were easy
You were easyEmbed
