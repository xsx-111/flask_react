A Girl Like You LyricsSomeday
I'll look into her green eyes
And know that she'll come with me
A girl like you
Too many
Things I do not care for
But one thing that I adore
Is a girl like you
I'll always try
To look you in the eye
It's okay
With a girl like you
Tomorrow
I think I'll tell you something
The thing that I haven't said
To a girl like you
And even if
I don't know what the day will bring
Still I can tell most anything
To a girl like you
I'll always try
To look you in the eye
It's okay
With a girl like you
It's okay
With a girl like you
A girl like youEmbed
