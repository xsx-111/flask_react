Life on a Chain LyricsI live on a chain and you share the same last name, as a joke
I sent a bottle of whiskey, as you choked
I knew it made you feel dirty
And I was waiting over here for life to begin
I was looking for the new thing
And you were THE sunshine heading my front-line
I was alone, you were just around the corner from me
Time alone is good, I spend my days in the city
Dirty neighborhood, you know you'll never convince me
So I sold the town away, I couldn't wait to forget you
I was killed in half a day, I hadn't time to regret you
And I was waiting over here for life to begin
I was looking for the new thing
And you were the sunshine heading my front line
I was alone you were just around the corner from me
I, I'm still on the chain, and you, had the same last name
As a joke I sent a bottle of whiskey
As you choked you said it made you feel dirty...
Waiting over here, for life to begin
Still looking for the new thing
And you were the sunshine heading my front-line
I was alone, you were just around the corner from meEmbed
