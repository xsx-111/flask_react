Just Another Lyrics
You and I, we’re two of a kind
I hate to say it but you’ll never relate
What makes you tick
And makes me smile
You said that I should get away from it all
And bury my head in the sand if I want to
I think you…
Should thank me now

You were lying wide awake in the garden
Trying to get over your stardom
And I could never see you depart us
And you’re my baby
You’re just another girl
Just another girl...

I never mind the way I had to see ya'
My working on a day show never explains why I see you
And I feel your pain
I love to wear my work inside of my head
I can’t complain but you should never react the way you did
I feel your time
You were lying wide awake in the garden
Trying to get over your stardom
And I could never see you depart us
And you’re my baby…
And you were lying wide awake in the garden
Trying to get over your stardom
And I could never see you depart us
And you’re my baby
You’re just another girl
You're just another girl
You're just another girlEmbed
