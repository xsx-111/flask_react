Black LyricsBlack is a cast
And two is a crowd
And gold rim is an answer
Black is a crowd
I am just for you
As you are not for me
So even if you stop
You're sitting here by yourself
You can never try to answer anymore
You can never start
And see what you're doing to me
Kiss, they were the ones
They dressed like something so special
And death is to begin
Caress, I think it's a sin
I was alone
Only 'til you took me away
And you can never stop
You're sitting all by yourself
You can never try to argue anyone
You will never stop and see
What you're doing to me
I'm alone
While he was standing next to you
And days prolong
Yeah there was time
Just you wait and see
Waiting for a bottle of truth
I'm just a lonely guy in my youth
Waiting for you is all I wanna do
So if you couldn't stop
You're sitting all by yourself
You can never try to argue anyone
You will never stop and see what you're doing to me
You can never stop
You're sitting all by yourself
You can never try to answer anything
You will never stop and see
What you're doing to me
What you're doing to me
What you're doing to me
What are you doing with me?Embed
