New York City Serenade LyricsBilly, he's down by the railroad tracks
Sittin' low in the back seat of his Cadillac
And Diamond Jackie, oh, she's so intact
As she falls so softly beneath him
Jackie's heels are static
Billy's got cleats on his boots
Together they're gonna boogaloo down Broadway and come back home with the news
Yeah, it's midnight in Manhattan, this ain't no time to get cute
It's a mad dog's promenade, so walk tall
Or, baby, don't walk at all
Fish lady, fish lady, fish lady, she breaks down them tenement walls
Won't take corner boys, ain't got no money and they're so easy
I say, "Hey there, baby, won't you take my hand, move with me down Broadway
I say, "Mama, won't you take my arm and move with me, move with me down Broadway"
I'm a young man, I talk it real loud
I say a young man, I'm gonna walk it really proud for ya
So shake it away
Shake away the city life
Shake away the street life
And hook up to the train
Hook up to the night train
Ah, hook up to the train
But I know that she won't take the train, no, she won't take the train
She won't take the train, no, she won't take the train
She won't take the train, no, she won't take the train
She won't take the train, no, she won't take the train
She's afraid them tracks are gonna slow her down
And when she turns, this boy'll be gone
So long
Sometimes, you gotta walk on
Hey, jazz man
Hey, vibes man
Won't you sing me a serenade
In the deeper blue, you'll be playin' in your parade
So save your notes, don't y'spend 'em on the blues, boys
Yeah, save your notes, don't spend 'em on the darlin' so long
Straight for the church note ringin'
Vibes man, sting a trash can
Listen to your junk man
Ah, listen to your junk man
Ah, listen to your junk man
Ah, listen to your junk man
He's singin'
He's singin'
He's singin'
He's singin'
He's singin'
Singin'
He's singin'
He's singin'
