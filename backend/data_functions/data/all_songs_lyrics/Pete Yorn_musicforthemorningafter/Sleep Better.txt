Sleep Better Lyrics...Calls him every day
He took a kind of vacation
Was heading for something
Won't leave her alone
Twice in every way
They lead a life you could forget now
It wouldn't be the last time
It better be the first time
So she won't sleep better alone
And he won't sleep better alone
No they won't feel better alone
They took the time to reflect
Even as the competition
Is breathing every day
On top of a jealous home
She feels she could connect it
He was an opinionated fool
He couldn't just pretend that
She was there in the next room
So they won't sleep better alone
And she won't sleep better alone
And he won't feel better alone
So she won't sleep better alone
And he won't sleep better alone
No they won't feel better alone...
Every tie is gonna break
So they said you were a fake
Don't try, don't try
Don't try you'll never win
And you can never be him
So you won't sleep better alone
No they won't sleep better alone
And they won't feel better alone
So she won't sleep better alone
And they won't sleep better alone
No they won't feel better alone...
Calls him every dayEmbed
