On Your Side LyricsI'm outside your house
2 am it's dark
So many mistakes
Come back home from bars
I am on your side
I just want to tell you off
So many lies
Are taking hold
It's not your fault
There's many scars
I am on your side
It's taken me a long time
I am on your side
I'm on your side
And I listen
Yeah I listen
Can you listen?
Now I'm listening
I am on your side
It's taken me a long time
I am on your side
I'm on your side
(And I listen) I am on your side
(Yeah I listen) It's taken me a long time
(Can you listen?) I am on your side
(Now I'm listening) I'm heading out tonight
(And I listen) I'm heading out tonight
(And I listen) I'm heading out tonigh
(Now I'm listening)
(Now I'm listening)
(Now I'm listening)
(Can you listen?)
(Now I'm listening)
(Now I'm listening)
(Now I'm listening)1Embed
