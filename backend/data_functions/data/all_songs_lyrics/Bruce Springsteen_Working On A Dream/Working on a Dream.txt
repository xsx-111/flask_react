Working on a Dream Lyrics
Out here the nights are long, the days are lonely
I think of you and I'm working on a dream
I'm working on a dream
Now the cards I've drawn's a rough hand, darling
I straighten the back and I'm working on a dream
I'm working on a dream
Come on!

I'm working on a dream
Though sometimes it feels so far away
I'm working on a dream
And I know it will be mine someday

Rain pouring down, I swing my hammer
My hands are rough from working on a dream
I'm working on a dream
Let's go!

I'm working on a dream
Though sometimes it feels so far away
I'm working on a dream
And I know it will be mine someday
I'm working on a dream
Though sometimes it feels so far away
I'm working on a dream
And I know it will be mine someday
The sun rise come, I climb the ladder
The new day breaks and I'm working on a dream
I'm working on a dream
I'm working on a dream
I'm working on a dream
Hey!

I'm working on a dream
Though sometimes it feels so far away
I'm working on a dream
And I know it will be mine someday
I'm working on a dream
Though sometimes it feels so far away
I'm working on a dream
And I know it will be mine somedayEmbed
