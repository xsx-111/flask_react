The Last Carnival Lyrics
Sundown, sundown
They're taking all the tents down
Where have you gone my handsome Billy?

Sundown, sundown
The carnival train's leaving town
Where are you now my darling Billy?

We won't be dancing together on the high wire
Facing the lions with you at my side anymore
We won't be breathing the smoke in the fire
On a midway
Hanging from the trapeze, my wrists waiting for your wrists
Two daredevils high upon the wall of death
You throwing the knife that lands inches from my heart
Sundown
Moon rise, moon rise, the light that was in your eyes is gone away
Daybreak, daybreak, the thing in you that made me ache has gone to stay
We'll be riding the train without you tonight
The train that keeps on moving
Its black smoke scorching the evening sky
A million stars shining above us like every soul living and dead
Has been gathered together by God to sing a hymn
Over your bones
Sundown, sundown
They're taking all the tents down
Where have you gone my handsome Billy?Embed
