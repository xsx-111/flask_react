Tomorrow Never Knows Lyrics
Where the cold wind blows
Tomorrow never knows
Where your sweet smile goes
Tomorrow never knows
You and me we've been standing in my den
Waiting for that time to come
Where the green grass grows
Tomorrow never knows
In the field your long hair flows
Down by the tail end of the tracks
Beneath the water tower
I carried you on my back
Over the rusted spikes of that highway of steel
When no more thunder sounds
Where the time goes
Tomorrow never knows
Where he who waits for the day's riches will be lost
In the whispering tide
Where the river flows
Tomorrow never knowsEmbed
