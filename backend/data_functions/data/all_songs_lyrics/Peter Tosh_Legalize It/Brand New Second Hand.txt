Brand New Second Hand Lyrics
You're only acting like, you are somebody
But I don't no say, you know nobody
You're only a show off, your painted face, yeah
But underneath that face, you're just a disgrace

But you're just a brand new second hand gal
No man no wan' no brand new second hand gal
You better go back around so
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're just a brand new second hand gal

You think it's the dress you wear that make you a lady
Get that out of your mind gal, you must be crazy
Mama used to tell me long time ago, yeah
Not everything you see glitter is gold

But you're just a brand new second hand gal
No man no wan' no brand new second hand gal
You better go back around so
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're just a brand new second hand gal
See you watch them pass I well hidy-tidy
But them no no say, you very nasty
Look 'pon you foot back, look how them tough, yeah
And your jaw bone favor Spanish town handcuff

But you're just a brand new second hand gal
No man no wan' no brand new second hand gal
You better go back around so
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're just a brand new second hand gal

Dick know 'bout you and Tom do
And Harry just 'round the corner know 'bout you too
He got a police buk and take it for fun
He must see no no say you judge to gun

But you're just a brand new second hand gal
No man no wan' no brand new second hand gal
You better go back around so
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're wicked
You're just a brand new second hand gal
You're just a brand new second hand gal
Fool ya, you fool ya
You're just a brand new second hand galEmbed
