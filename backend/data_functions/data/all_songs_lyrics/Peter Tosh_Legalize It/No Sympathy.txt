No Sympathy Lyrics
I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They´ve got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

When I'm in troubles, yeah
Only me, only me feel the pain
Not one good word of advice
From any of my so-called friends

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind, what kind of love they've got for me
I'm on my way, yes, to happiness
Where I can find, where I can find
Some peace and rest

Might as well, might as well, yeah
I get out, I get out of hell
Hell could never be made for me
So I'm gonna search, search 'til I'm free
No love, no love
No sympathy
What kind, what kind of love they've got for me
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on my way to happiness
Where I can find, where I can find some peace and rest


I can't find no love
No, no sympathy
What kind, what kind, what kind of love
They got, they got, they got for me
On my way to happiness
Where I can find, can find some peace and rest

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind, what kind they've got for me
They don't love themself so they can't love no one else
They don't love themselves
So they can´t love no one else
I just can't find, find, find no love
I can't find, find, find no sympathy
I can't find, can't find, I can't find no love at all
What kind of love, love, love people got for me
I'm searchin'...Embed
