Ketchy Shuby Lyrics
Come make we play some
Ketchy shuby
And when me shuby
You feel ketchy

And when you're ketchy
Don't make it drop
'cause if it drop
It will pop

And if it pop
No one can mend it
'cause if them mend it
You can easily bend it

So we ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
All night long we ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Tell me if you like it
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
All night long we ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
It don't take too long to learn
Just you do as I say
It may only take one hours or two
And by the next time you will know what to do

We ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Me and you ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
All night long we ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Mhmhm
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight

Come make we play some
Ketchy shuby
And when me shuby
You feel ketchy

And when you're ketchy
Don't make it drop
'cause if it drop
It will pop
And if it pop
No one can mend it
'cause if them mend it
You can easily bend it

So we ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
All night long we ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Your mama don't like it
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Your papa don't like it
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Long time I'm waitin'
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Get you right where you're
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
All night long we ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Me and you ah go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Tell me if you like it
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
All night long, all night long
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Mhm, mhm
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
I know you sweet you
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
I know you like it

Come back fi go
Ketchy, ketchy – shuby, shuby tonight
