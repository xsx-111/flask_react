Igziabeher (Let Jah Be Praised) Lyrics
Igziabeher, let Jah be praised
Negusa negast, let Jah be praised
Medanialam, let Jah be praised
Let Him be praised
Let Him be praised
You better let Him be praised

He watereth the hills from his chambers
And the Earth is satisfied, so satisfied
He maketh the grass to grow for animals
Jah made the herb for man
He made the herb for man
Jah made the herb for man

Fret not thyself because of evildoers
Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity
For they shall soon be cut down, cut down like grass
And they shall wither like corn

Let Jah arise and let all His enemies be scattered
Let them that hate Jah, now scatter, shatter, batter and flatter
As the smoke is driven away, Jah, drive them away
As the wax melted, let them be melted Jah, Jah
Igziabeher, let Jah be praised
Medanialam, let Jah be praised
Negusa neghast, let Jah be praised
You better let Him be praised
Let Him be praised
You better let Him be praised
I said, let Him be praised

Lightning
Earthquake
Brimstone
Ball of fire
Me say lightning, brimstone and fire
Igziabeher
Weak heart scatter, shatter, flatter and batter
I feel it
Weak heart feel it
Kill them dead before them spread
Kill them dead before them spread
Kill them dead before them spread, kill them dead
Kill them dead before them spread, kill them dead
Kill them dead before them spread, kill them dead
Kill them dead before them spread, kill them deadEmbed
