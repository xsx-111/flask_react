Burial LyricsThem want I, them want I
Become a them funeral
Them claim say, them claim say
Them are the general
Them want I, them want I
Com'a them funeral
Them claim say, them claim say
Them are the general
What a big disgrace
Way you rob up the place
Rob everything you can find
Yes, you did and you'll even rob the blind
You must see want I if com'a, com'a funeral
And I no go, no one burial
Yet you want I, com'a, com'a funeral
Make your friend come claim say,"You are the geni?"
Now we know the truth, yes, we do
The find you wearing the boot
Of taking peoples' business on your head, yeah
So might as well you be dead
Them want I, them want I
Com'a them funeral
Them claim say, them claim say
Them are the general
Them want I, them want I
Com'a them funeral
Them claim say, them claim say
Them are the general
Let the dead bury the dead now
And who is to be fed, be fed
I ain't got no time to waste on you, no, no
I am a livin' man, I've got work to do, right now
This man and that man
Yes, they are the same man
You taught us this just as well
That the rich man heaven is the poor man's hell
You must see want I if com'a, com'a funeral
Natty, no go, no one burial
Yet you want I, com'a, com'a funeral
Make your friend come, claim, say, "You are the geni?"
Them want I, them want I
Com'a them funeralEmbed
