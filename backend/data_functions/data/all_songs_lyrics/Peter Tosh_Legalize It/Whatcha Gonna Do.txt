Whatcha Gonna Do LyricsMama, mama, dem hold papa
Say they charge him fe' smoke ganja
If me never jump the fence dem hold me too
So tell me mama, what we gonna do?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?

Next week, next week is the case
Him have a dread judge to face
Him ha' fe' either see in space
Or make the doctor man work on him face
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?
Next door neighbor, dem hold your son
They say they find him with one gun
An' there's no need to mention
Him going to get an indefinite detention
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?

So him ha' fe' remain in custody
Him see Babylon, him stand up an' screw
Say, him never knew it was a curfew
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
