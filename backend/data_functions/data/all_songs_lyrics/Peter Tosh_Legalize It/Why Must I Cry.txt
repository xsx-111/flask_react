Why Must I Cry LyricsWhy must I cry
These tears from mine eyes
(2×)
Making believe you love me only
Was my great sin whoa (3×)
But I will never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain
Why must I trod
This lonely lonely road
Why must I carry
This heavy heavy load
Making believe you love me only
Was my great sin (3×)
Mmm my great sin
I'll never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain
Feels the pain
Sad pain
I will never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain
Feels the pain
Why must I cry these tears from mine eyes (2×)..Embed
