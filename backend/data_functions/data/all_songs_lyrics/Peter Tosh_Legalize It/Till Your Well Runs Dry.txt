Till Your Well Runs Dry Lyrics
You said you loved me
And then you left
You broke every promise, oh yes you did
You win every bet

You never miss your water till your well runs dry
Tell me, tell me...

Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do...when your well runs dry?
I'd like to know
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?

Listen to me darlin'
You cheat and you lie
Now you come a runnin'
Runnin', wanting second try

You never miss your water till your well runs dry
Tell me, tell me...
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do...when your well runs dry?
I'd like to know
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?

Sat down and sighed
And I heard you packin'
I watched you pass by me...
But you said nothin', not one single word
But I know you're gonna miss me
And you're gonna be blue

But, tell me, tell me...

What you gonna do when you're feeling blue?
What you gonna do, woman, when you're feeling blue?
What you gonna do when you're feeling so blue?
I'd like to know
What you gonna do when you're feeling blue?

Tell me, tell me...

What you gonna do when you're feeling blue?
What you gonna do when you're feeling blue?
What you gonna do when you're feeling so blue?
I'd like to know
What you gonna do when you're feeling blue?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry, woman?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do when your well runs dry?
Whatcha gonna do?
I'd like to know
Whatcha gonna do?
I'd like to know
Whatcha gonna do?
I want to know
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?
Mhmm hmm
Mhmm hmm
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do?...Embed
