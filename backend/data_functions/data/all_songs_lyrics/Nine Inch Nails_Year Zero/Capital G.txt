Capital G Lyrics
I pushed a button and elected him to office and uh
He pushed a button and it dropped a bomb
You pushed the button and could watch it on the television
Those motherfuckers didn't last too long ha ha
I'm sick of hearing about the have's and the have not's
Have some personal accountability
The biggest problem with the way that we've been doing things is
The more we let you have the less that I'll be keeping for me

Well I used to stand for something
Now I'm on my hands and knees
Traded in my god for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G

Don't give a shit about the temperature in Guatemala
Don't really see what all the fuss is about
Ain't gonna worry about no future generations and uh
I'm sure somebody gonna figure it out
Don't try to tell me how some power can corrupt a person
You haven't had enough to know what it's like
You're only angry cause you wish you were in my position
Now nod your head because you know that I'm right, alright!
Well I used to stand for something
But forgot what that could be
There's a lot of me inside you
Maybe you're afraid to see
Well I used to stand for something
Now I'm on my hands and knees
Traded in my god for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G
Greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed, greed, greed, greed

Well I used to stand for something
But forgot what that could be
There's a lot of me inside you
Maybe you're afraid to see
Well I used to stand for something
Now I'm on my hands and knees
Traded in my god for this one
And he signs his name with a capital G
Greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed, greed, greed, greed3Embed
