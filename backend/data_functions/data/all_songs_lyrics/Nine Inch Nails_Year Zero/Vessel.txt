Vessel Lyrics
I let you put it in my mouth
I let it get under my skin
I let you pump it through my veins
I let you take me from within
They tell us what we can and cannot do
Same thing we've heard a hundred times before
When I put you inside of me
None of that matters anymore

My God
Can it go any faster?
Oh my God
I don’t think I can last here

I am you and you are me
We will never be alone
I have finally found my place in everything
I have finally found my home
I can leave all of this flesh behind
I can see right through this whole facade
I am becoming something else
I am turning into god
My God
Can it go any faster?
Oh my God
I don’t think I can last here
My God
Can it go any faster?
Oh my God
I don’t think I can last here
My God
Can it go any faster?
Oh my God
I don’t think I can last here
My God
Can it go any faster?
Oh my God
I don’t think I can last here1Embed
