The Beginning of the End Lyrics
Down on your knees, you'll be left behind
This is the beginning
Watch what you think, they can read your mind
This is the beginning
I got my mark, see it in my eyes
This is the beginning
My reflection I don't recognize
This is the beginning

We think we climb so high
Up all the backs we've condemned
We face our consequence
This is the beginning of the end

You wait your turn, you'll be last in line
This is the beginning
Get out the way, cause I'm getting mine
This is the beginning
God helps the ones that can help themselves
This is the beginning
May be too late as far as I can tell
This is the beginning
We think we've come so far
On all our lies we depend
Facing our consequence
This is the beginning of the end3Embed
