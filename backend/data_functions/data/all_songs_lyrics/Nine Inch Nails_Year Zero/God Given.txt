God Given Lyrics
Hey man
Please don't make a sound
Take a look around
Can't you see what's right in front of you? (Ah)
Have a little taste
No more time to waste
You don't want to get left behind, because it's all coming down right now
Now - how
Hard is it to see?
Put your faith in me
I sure wouldn't want to be
Praying to the wrong piece of wood
You should
Get where you belong
Everything you know is wrong
Come on, sing along everybody now

(God Given)
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
When his kingdom come
And thy will be done
We have just begun
We're the chosen ones
(I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you)

Wait
Step into the light
How can this be right?
I'm afraid we're going to ask you to leave
Guess you can not win
With the color of your skin
You won't be getting in to the promised land
Besides
This is just another case
You people still don't know your place
Step aside, out the way, wipe that look off your face
Cause we are the divine
Separated from the swine
Come on, sing along everybody now

(God Given)
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
Still his kingdom come
And thy will be done
And we just begun
We're the chosen ones
And he gives us sight
And we see the light
And it burns so bright
Now we know we're right
Still his kingdom come
And thy will be done (And the father and the holy son)
We've just begun
We're the chosen ones
(I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you)

(God Given)
