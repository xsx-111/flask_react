The Great Destroyer Lyrics
Say your name
Try to speak as clearly as you can
You know everything gets written down
Nod your head
Just in case they could be watching
With their shiny satellite

I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Living inside of me
To murder everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer

Turn it up
Listen to the shit they pump into your head
Filling you with apathy
Hold your breath
Wait until you know the time is right on time
The end is near

I hope they cannot see
The limitless potential
Living inside of me
To murder everything
I hope they cannot see
I am the great destroyer2Embed
