Butcher Baker Candlestick Maker LyricsGod, my God, my dog has a broken leg
Grip this, grab that, have that, an empty bag
Grip this, grab that, have that, an empty plug in
And one's a friend of mine
And one's a Gemini
And one's a friend of mine
Oh wait, I'll wait a while
While (while) while (while) while (while) while

Really shouldn't bring that other guy (x5)
No you really shouldn't bring that other guy (x3)
God
Dig begin, this pad has a bigger grid
Grip this, grab that, have that, an empty bag
Grip this, grab that, have that, an empty plug in
At once, a bend of mind
And one gets left behind
At once, a bend of mind
Oh wait, I'll wait a while
While (while) while (while) while (while) while
