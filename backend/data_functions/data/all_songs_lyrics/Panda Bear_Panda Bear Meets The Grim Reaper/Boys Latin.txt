Boys Latin Lyrics
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but

Dark cloud descended again
Has a dark cloud descended again?
Has a dark cloud descended again?
And a shadow moves in
Dark cloud descended again
And a shadow moves in the darkness
Dark cloud descended again
Has a dark cloud descended again?
Has a dark cloud descended again?
And a shadow moves in
Dark cloud descended again
And a shadow moves in the darkness
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but
Beasts don't have a sec' to think, but
We don't 'preciate our things, but16Embed
