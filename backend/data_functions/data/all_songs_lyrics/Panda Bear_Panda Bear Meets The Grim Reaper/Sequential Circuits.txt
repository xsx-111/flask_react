Sequential Circuits Lyrics
Get just what you need
Just what
Want more than you need
Want more
Dread follows that lead
Follow the lead
Near as far from a ship as the oar
Come on

More than you can see
See more
Seeds become a tree
Because you can't
Be a growth
And the same as before
Come on

Get just what you need
Just what
Want more than you need
Follow the lead
Near as far from a balm as the cut3Embed
