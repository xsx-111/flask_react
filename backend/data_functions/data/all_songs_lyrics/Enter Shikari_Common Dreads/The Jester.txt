The Jester Lyrics
"Err, simmer down, ladies and gentlemen
Simmer down, hey
You're acting rather irresponsibly right now
Damn you all"

Hold your horses, steady now
'Cause we're floating precariously
And therefore furthermore frivolously on tectonic plates
And everything we stand on and everything we stand for
Is rather unstable right now
So I think I'll kill some time and have you done medium rare
But I think I'll tease my palate with some crudit√©s
Just to prepare
You see, we've had a joker in the pack now for quite some time
So I reckon it's just about time we roast this swine

This is a crock of shit I refuse to be fed
So knuckle down and use your head
Can it sunshine, bottle it up you ponce
Then knock me up a dish with some vol-au-vents
Now I think we should take a leaf from the Romans' book
Throw it up! Throw it up!
Now I think we should take a leaf from the Romans' book
Throw it up! Throw it up!
Let's throw it up and start again
Let's throw it up and start again

Nicely does it, now
Steady...
Hold, hold...
Target locked
Cop a load of this one
Oh, yeah!

Ah, that was great
My compliments to the chef, I'm very satisfied
So I'll be sure to dine here again, fine cuisine
The stuffed cheeks were very agreeable
All in all, a splendid spreadEmbed
