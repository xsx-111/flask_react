All Eyes on the Saint Lyrics
22nd of June, 209 AD
A crowd gathers
Oh, they fuckin' love a good beheading

Watch as St. Albans head rolls down the hill
The crowd stood still
Because what they just saw
It petrified them to the core
Ahh, to the core
Ahh

As the executioner raised his axe
I swear the saint smiled, I swear the saint smiled
As the executioner raised his axe
I swear the saint smiled, I swear the saint smiled

Welcome, Verulamium
Cathedral city, all eyes on the saint
Welcome, Verulamium
Cathedral city, all eyes on the saint

Our city with its beautiful history
Is being diluted
But we will not let go!
No we won't
Now get a grip on your roots, boy
Don't let go
But we will not let go!

As the executioner raised his axe
I swear the saint smiled, I swear the saint smiled
As the executioner raised his axe
I swear the saint smiled, I swear the saint smiled

Welcome, Verulamium
Cathedral city, all eyes on the saint
Welcome, Verulamium
Cathedral city, all eyes on the saint

And it's cold outside
And it's cold outside
And it's cold outside
And it's cold outside

As the executioner swung his wedge
His eyes popped right out his fuckin' head
Then when he should see the ancient moment
The making of the first British martyr
British martyr
Here lies truth, where I stand
Here lies truth, where I stand
Here lies truth, where I stand
Here lies truth, where I stand

So where St. Alban's head
Laid to rest, after the kill
Fresh water sprung up from the ground
At the bottom of what's now
Holywell Hill
Holywell HillEmbed
