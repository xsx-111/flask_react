Wall Lyrics
I'm gonna paste you up, cover you in wallpaper
Screw shelves into you and call you a wall
That's all you are to me, trying to keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
This is no white abode
You can have skirting board shoes
And plug sockets on your knees
I'll hang a painting on your lip
And put tinsel 'round it at Christmas
Trying to keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
Trying to keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house

You can't keep us inside much longer, pal
We've seen the view from the window
You can't keep us inside much longer, pal
We've seen the view from the window

It's glorious outside
(Have you seen the tide?) Have you seen the tide?
We'll sing all night!
We need cohesion
It's glorious outside
(Have you seen the tide?) Have you seen the tide?
We'll sing all night!
We need cohesion

As time keeps moving, we keep losing our rights
Freedom is not the choices between what job and what car
You can just look back into history to find corruption and mystery
And if we don't take note, we'll wake up in the same boat
Trying to keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
Trying to keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house

It's glorious outside
(Have you seen the tide?) Have you seen the tide?
We'll sing all night!
We need cohesion
It's glorious outside
(Have you seen the tide?) Have you seen the tide?
We'll sing all night!
We need cohesion
Have you seen the tide?
Have you seen the tide?

Grit your teeth then break the glass
Now sprint and don't look back
Full pelt into the dense forest
And ask him
What's your thoughts on lionising
What's your thoughts on the tensions rising
Deep in the dense forest?

Trying to keep people inside
Inside your sordid little house
Trying to keep, keep pe-people
Inside your sordid little house
That means nothing, whoa
Trying to keep people inside, inside your sordid little house
That means nothing, whoa
Trying to keep, keep pe-people inside your sordid little house
(Whoa, oh)
That means nothing, whoa (Whoa, oh)
That means nothing, whoa (Whoa, oh)
That means nothing, whoa (Whoa, oh)
(Whoa, oh)
(Whoa)1Embed
