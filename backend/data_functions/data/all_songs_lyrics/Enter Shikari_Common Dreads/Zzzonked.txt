Zzzonked Lyrics
These wars are directly out of order, mate
You get me?
They're passed their sell-by dates, seriously
I don't think you fucking get me. Listen!

Mate! I’m zonked, absolutely spent
I think I’m gonna give up my eyes for lent
I’ll use my sockets to stock stones instead
And with an icy cold stare I’ll hide bones in your bed
Mate! Please, accept this invitation
So I can take you away
Cos there’s a one in 40 thousand chance
That asteroid Apophis will collide with the Earth in less than 20 years
Oh, my god

Roll up for the knees up business
Yes, yes, yes, ok, I think we’ve heard quite enough from you, thank you
Listen to me!
All I am trying to say is…
Instead of staring at your Stella desperately for inspiration
Belt up and quiver at your indignation
I ain't saying anything that could be construed as an apology
There’s another case study of anthropology
(Alright) Let's announce embargos and denounce our far foes
Ingrowing egos a syntax he knows
It’s just distance that separates us
Or are we really all ethno-centric-ally inclined?
Mate! What the fuck are you going on about?
This is a draconian law, I protest
I protest
Squad up! Squad up!
The herd is rowdy
The squad is vexed
The herd is rowdy
The squad is vexed
Squad up! Squad up!
Yeah!1Embed
