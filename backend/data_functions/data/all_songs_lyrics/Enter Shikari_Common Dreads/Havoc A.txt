Havoc A Lyrics
The lions are at the door
We ain't taking orders from snakes no more
The lions are at the door
Yeah, we ain't taking orders from snakes no more
Knock, knock

Yeah, how d'you like that, boy?

It's another day in the acid nation
Expected to gulp down hindrance
Hold tight the real news networks
They're crucialEmbed
