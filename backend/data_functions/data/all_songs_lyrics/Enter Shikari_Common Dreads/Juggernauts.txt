Juggernauts Lyrics
And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'Cause I do not think we're invincible
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path

Now, don't get me wrong
I love what you've done with the place
I just wish we had a chance to help build it
Instead of just moving into this home of disrepair
And expected to work, prosper, and then share
Constantly relying on consuming to feel content
But only because we've lost touch
With this home that we've spent
Trillions of dollars tainting for our wants, not our needs
And now we're growing tired of planting bleary-eyed seeds
And I'm not saying that we could do better
But given the chance, we'd try (We'd try)
We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil
Listen to Batty C
And fill the trench with greedy eyes
(I'm not saying that we could do better
But given the chance, we'd try
We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil
And fill the trench with greedy eyes)

Imagine...
Back in the day as empires made haste
To colonize, to claim, to control, and contain
We sat patiently in the future, helpless
Switch!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another Juggernaut!
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path

(What the hell will happen, now?)
I really don't know, man!
We'll do what we've always done
Shut our eyes and hope for the best?
(No!) We're gonna face this
We'll step out onto the tracks
And stare it right in the face
(Thou shall not pass!)

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'Cause I do not think we're invincible
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
Crushing all in its path
And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another Juggernaut!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
And I do not think we're invincible
And I hope that we've still got time
'Cause I do not think we're invincible
