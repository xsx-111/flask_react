Havoc B Lyrics
Now let's cause some fuckin' havoc!

The lions are at the door
We ain't taking order from snakes no more
The lions are at the door
Yeah, we ain't taking order from snakes no more

Stand by...
Receiving...
Stand by for a second message

Now we're gonna take a stand
For we are the Grassroots Resistance!
Now we're gonna take a stand
For we are the Grassroots Resistance!
Power!

All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!
Shut down the war machine!
All this killing is obscene!Embed
