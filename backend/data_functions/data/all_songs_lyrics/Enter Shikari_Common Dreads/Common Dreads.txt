Common Dreads LyricsA heedless and harrowing future is developing
For our generation and generations to come
But as I walk the chartered streets of this familiar oblivion
I recognise nothing but unyielding unconsciousness
In which we have almost comfortably drowned
It is madness
This normality is madness!
We are clinging to manufactured crippling constraints...
We must no longer commute between brand laden homes
And quickly accepted, aimless roams
From our factories of slavery to wars of illusive bravery
We must unite
And we must let the flood gates open
Here tonight, I clock a thousand heads
Here to unite, through common dreadsEmbed
