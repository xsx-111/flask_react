Antwerpen Lyrics
Now I was feeling like a total giant!
But now it feels like Silvius Brabo has sliced my hand off
And thrown it in the river!

Now I was just doing my job
My feet sink into the bed of the Scheldt
But now my fingers are reeling about with the fishes

I know I'm not making any sense (No, you're not)
All will be revealed (Well, I hope so)
All will be revealed if we travel back in time


I've got to rest, it's for the best
To build a nest, to take the quest
To be given just one chance, to be the best

I've got to rest, it's for the best
To build a nest, to take the quest
To be given just one chance, to be the best
GO! GO! GO! GO!
GO! Go forth and re-colonize
GO! GO! GO! GO!
GO! Go forth and re-colonize
It appears the foundations of all our great nations
Are lies and indoctrinations
So if Silvius Brabo collects the hands of giants...
Will you join him?Embed
