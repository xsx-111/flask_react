Hectic Lyrics
To the multi story car park with our friends
Drinking from a bottle of White Lightning
On top of Marks and Sparks, roof running
Smoking chronic, hectic

And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we’re on on on our own again
And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we’re on on on our own again
And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we’re on on on our own again

We’ll convene at mine 3 PM to play
Sega Mega Drive, Golden Axe and Sonic all day
Never played it? I’ll teach you
Can’t hack it? I’ll beat ya
That’s Pendell making rhymes in the corner with a litre of finest Scrumpy Jack
Whilst Pdex pumps out the latest big club track
We’ll chip it to Justin’s and hit his King Kong
Then we’ll gather round the piano for a little sing song

Oh, if I could kidnap that feeling
The one that melts all fears from your mind
I’d make no demands, no ransom
’Cause I’d never set it free
’Cause I’d never set it free
Oh, if I could kidnap that feeling
The one that melts all fears from your mind
I’d make no demands, no ransom
’Cause I’d never set it free
’Cause I’d never set it free
’Cause I’d never set it free
Oh, these Halcyon days and Halcyon nights
Before we began to realise that things aren’t right
And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we’re on on on our own again
And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we’re on on on our own again
And it seems that nothing now will ever change
And it seems that we’re on on on our own again

On on on our own again
On on on our own again
On on on our own again
On on on our own againEmbed
