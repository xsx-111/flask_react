Fanfare for the Conscious Man Lyrics
Each nation used to provide its country with security
With factories providing arms for their country
Now multi-national companies compete in the arms trade
To serve any customer maximizing the money to be made
So just as farms compete to provide fruit for other countries
So people can live to enjoy the taste of nature
National warehouses compete to provide arms
Around the world to aid death and all hell unfurled

Our gracious queen should grasp her crown
And take a good fucking swing at Blair and Brown
For leading her country into illegal warfare
And trying to pass it off that we're doing it 'cause we care
"Now preemptive wars are a redemptive cause"
I've never heard such nonsense under international laws
We think we have the right to enforce democracy
When we're weakening ours everyday, what a hypocrisy

We'll be together against this!
We'll be forever against this!
We'll be together against this!
We'll be forever against this!
Fuck, man
I just woke up to a land where killing is part of every day
And every mind of this intelligent species
Is led blinded into the battlefield
Like it's natural for us to break instead of build
Unity's intrinsic, the only cause worth fighting for
All religions, colours, and creeds
Now we are the world and we are the people
We are the world and we are the people
And we will be heard

We'll be together against this!
We'll be forever against this!
We'll be together against this!
We'll be forever against this!

We'll be together against this!
We'll be forever against this!
We'll be together against this!
We'll be forever against this!3Embed
