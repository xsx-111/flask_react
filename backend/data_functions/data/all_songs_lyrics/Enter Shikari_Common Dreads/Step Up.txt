Step Up Lyrics
If our own lives aren't directly affected
Then it don't need to be corrected?
(How fucking cute is our ignorance?)
Yeah, we're insidious (as they're praying for deliverance)
We shelter ourselves from the outcries
We blinker ourselves from the eyesores
But I know we have greatness within us

"We have greatness within us: innovative, giving, determined
It's time for the best in us to come out"

(Search), and you can find imbalance
(Seek), you can destroy imbalance
And you can change your values
Step up today

Yes, solid

Now let me get one thing straight
You know what?
Sometimes I do wish apples were our currency
So your hoarded millions would rot in their vault
Then that'd teach you to lay off the assault
That you're barraging on the lands of the poor
And I know we've all got enough problems of our own
But, but they're not showstoppers as we sit on our throne
In a home heated by a life unknown to the exploited
And it's so frustrating the fucking state we're in...
If our own lives aren't directly affected
Then it does need to be corrected!
(How fucking cute is our ignorance?)
Yeah, we're insidious (as they're praying for deliverance)
We shelter ourselves from the outcries
We blinker ourselves from the eyesores

(Search), and you can find imbalance
(Seek), you can destroy imbalance
And you can change your values
Step up today
Search and you can find imbalance
Seek, you can destroy imbalance
And you can change your values
Step up today

Why is it so many companies built to serve us end up ruling us?
Our British empire built free-trade... opportunistic oppression?2Embed
