Solidarity Lyrics
Here, tonight, I clock a thousand heads
Here to unite through common dreads
Now who's with me?
Now who's with me?

Something trips inside
That's been dormant for a thousand years
Now we can no longer hide
The immediacy of these fears
Our names will not be writ on water
And we don't need an ark (No way!)
One day, I know, the dam will collapse
And we will be the current

Yes, what have you got for me?
And now the flood gates will open
Strike
You cannot hold back the tide
You cannot hold back the tide

We will sing as one in solidarity
We will swim together
No longer treading water
We're flowing with the tide
And you can taste the night
Don't waste the night
We will sing as one in solidarity
We will sing together now
And still we will be here
Standing like statues
The time is now
Belt it, brothers!

We will sing as one in solidarity (We're not hiding)
And still we will be here, standing like statues
We will sing together
We're not hiding
We will sing as one in solidarity (We're not hiding)
And still we will be here, standing like statues
We will sing together
We're not hiding
We will sing as one in solidarity (We're not hiding)
And still we will be here, standing like statues
We will sing together
We're not hiding
We will sing as one in solidarity (We're not hiding)
And still we will be here, standing like statues
We will sing together
We're not hiding5Embed
