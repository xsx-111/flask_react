Gap in the Fence Lyrics
And I lie here, staring up at the stratosphere
And hoping we're gonna get out of here
And it seems mad that we're born on the doorstep
Of squalor and of pedestals
And I lie here, surrounded by a range
Of general anaesthetics
To drowse the fact that funding in security
Is not matched by spreading equality

(You'll hear us singing)
In the sunlight, where you caught us
Plotting the downfall of hoarders
In the sunlight, where you caught us
(You'll hear us singing)
In the sunlight, where you caught us
Plotting the downfall of hoarders
In the sunlight, where you caught us

It seems that every gap in the fence
We'll peak, we'll scratch, we'll stretch
We'll grab anything we can
But if we grouped together
And made a bigger hole
Not just for our children's hands
But for bigger plans
Yeah, if we grouped together
And made a hole
'Cause I don't know about you
But I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
Whoa

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
I've gotta get out of here
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa

We live so subserviently
Accepting all normality
Drenched with routine
Doused in the foreseen
And yes, granted we prosper
But the fact that we prosper
Is even taken for granted2Embed
