Through the Ghost Lyrics
Speak of the devil, look who just walked into the room
The guilted and faded notion of someone I once knew
All the perfect moments are wrong
All the precious pieces are gone
Everything that mattered is just a city of dust covering both of us

Did you hide yourself away?
I can't see you anymore
Did you eclipse another day?
I used to wake up to the color of your soul
Did you hide yourself away?
Are you living through the ghost?
Did you finally find a place above the shadows
So the world will never know...
The world will never know you like I do

So many silent sorrows you'll never hear from again
And now that you lost tomorrow, is yesterday still a friend?
All the bridges we built were burned
Not a single lesson was learned
Everything that mattered is just a city of dust covering both of us

Did you hide yourself away?
I can't see you anymore
Did you eclipse another day?
I used to wake up to the color of your soul
Did you hide yourself away?
Are you living through the ghost?
Did you finally find a place above the shadows
So the world will never know...
The world will never know you like I do
Like I still do


Did you hide yourself away?
I can't see you anymore
Did you eclipse another day?
I used to wake up to the color of your soul (your soul)
Did you hide yourself away?
Are you living through the ghost?
Did you finally find a place above the shadows
So the world will never know... (never)
The world will never know you like I do3Embed
