Bully Lyrics
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

It’s 8 A.M
This hell I’m in
Seems I’ve crossed the line again
For being nothing more than who I am
So break my bones
And throw your stones
We all know that life ain’t fair
But there is more of us
We’re everywhere

We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this
We can end it all

All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No one's gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully
Hey!
Hey!

Think it through
You can’t undo
Whenever I see black and blue
I feel the past
I share the bruise
With everyone
Who’s come and gone
My head is clear
My voice is strong
Now I’m right here to right the wrong

We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this
We can end it all

All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No one's gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

It’s 8 A.M.!
The Hell I’m in!
Your voice is strong!
Now right the wrong!

All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully
All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully
Hey!5Embed
