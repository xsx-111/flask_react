Amaryllis Lyrics
In a while now, I will feel better
I’ll face the weather before me
In a while now, I’ll race the irony
And buy back each word of my eulogy
All the uninvited tragedies
Step outside

Ask yourself now where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With the moment you can’t forget?

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met, a lonely silhouette?
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be, so far out of reach?
Oh-oh, I wish you’d open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom

Stay a while now, undress your colors
'Cause they’re like no others, I’ve ever seen
I could get used to your company
Step inside
Ask yourself now where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With emotions you can’t resist?

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met, a lonely silhouette?
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be, so far out of reach?
Oh-oh, I wish you’d open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis

In a while now I will feel better
I will be better

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met, a lonely silhouette?
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be, so far out of reach?
Oh-oh, I wish you’d open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom
