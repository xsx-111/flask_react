For My Sake Lyrics
I remember like yesterday
You had a dream in your eyes
And a smile on your face
And I'm missing those days again
Yeah I'm missing those days again
And I forgot what really got in the way
Maybe the sun it wouldn't shine
Should be taking the blame
Cause its raining on me again
Yeah its raining on me again

A paradox
The key drops
I'm at it fast
But what you lost was me
For my sake please

Stop slowing me down, stop holding me up
We're making a scene, and that's enough
Let's be honest
Your promise, was never meant to last
I'm taking you on, I'm calling you out
There's nothing left, for us here now
Let's be honest, I promise
I'm never looking back
For my sake
For my sake
Tell my something that's poetic at best
Make me believe there was a time that you were like the rest
And I'll never ask you again
And I'll never ask you again
For all the moments in the memories
No one could ever say we never had a history
But I'm leaving that all behind
And there's nothing gonna change my mind

A paradox
The key drops
I'm at it fast
But what you lost was me
For my sake please

Stop slowing me down, stop holding me up
We're making a scene, and that's enough
Let's be honest
Your promise, was never meant to last
I'm taking you on, I'm calling you out
There's nothing left, for us here now
Let's be honest, I promise
I'm never looking back
For my sake
For my sake
A paradox
The key you dropped
I'm at it fast
But what you lost was me
For my sake please
Stop slowing me down
Stop holding me up
Stop slowing me down
And that's enough
Stop slowing me down
Stop holding me up
We're making a scene
And that's enough
Let's be honest
Your promise
Was never meant to last
I'm taking you on
I'm calling you out
There's nothing left
For us here now
Let's be honest
I promise
I'm never looking back
For my sake
I'm never looking back
For my sake (for my sake)
For my sake1Embed
