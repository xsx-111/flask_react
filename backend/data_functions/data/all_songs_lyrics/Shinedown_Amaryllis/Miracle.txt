Miracle Lyrics
Say it once, tell me twice
Are you certain I'm alright?
Just a sign, to remind me
Tomorrow's worth the fight

Ever changing, the story line that keeps me alive
So make a wish, and say...

Give me life, give me love
Scarlet angel from above
Not so low, not so high
Keep it perfectly disguised

Ever changing, the story line that keeps me alive
My Mona Lisa's making me smile, right before my eyes!

Take another look, take a look around
It's you and me, it's here and now
As you sparkle in the sky, I'll catch you while I can
'Cause all we are is all I am
I just want you to see
What I've always believed
You are the miracle in me
Show me faith, like you do
I'm amazed at how you move
Side to side, front to back
You know how to make it last

Ever changing, the story line that keeps us alive
My Mona Lisa's making me smile, right before my eyes!

Take another look, take a look around
It's you and me, it's here and now
As you sparkle in the sky, I'll catch you while I can
'Cause all we are is all I am
I just want you to see
What I've always believed
You are the miracle in me

These are the moments you can't pass by
Let's turn the water to wine, one more time

Take another look, take a look around
It's you and me, it's here and now
As you sparkle in the sky, I'll catch you while I can
'Cause all we are is all I am
I just want you to see
What I've always believed
You are the miracle in me
The miracle in me
You're the miracle in me2Embed
