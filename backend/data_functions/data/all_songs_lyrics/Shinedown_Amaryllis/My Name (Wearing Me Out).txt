My Name (Wearing Me Out) Lyrics
My name is worthless like you told me I once was
My name is empty cause you drained away the love
My name is searching since you stole my only soul
My name is hatred and the reasons we both know

Worthless, empty, searching, hatred
Well who am I right now?

You're fuckin' wearing me out
You're always dragging me down
You're the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don't need a gun to take back what's mine
It's over, it's over now
You're done wearing me out

My name is screaming like the sound of your heart failing
My name is loco like the motive that betrayed me

Screaming, loco, don't say you know
Who I am right now
You're fuckin' wearing me out
You're always dragging me down
You're the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don't need a gun to take back what's mine
It's over, it's over now
You're done wearing me out

You're wearing me out
You're wearing me out
You're wearing me out
You're wearing me out
You're wearing me out
You're wearing me out
You'll be ancient history
But who am I right now?
My name is revenge and I'm here to save my name

You're fuckin' wearing me out
You're always dragging me down
You're the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don't need a gun to take back what's mine
(You're fuckin' wearing me out)
It's over
(You're always dragging me down)
It's over
It's over
You're the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don't need a gun to take back what's mine
It's over
It's over now
You're done wearing me outEmbed
