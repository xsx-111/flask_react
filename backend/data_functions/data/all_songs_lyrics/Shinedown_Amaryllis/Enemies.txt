Enemies Lyrics
Listen up, there's not a moment to spare
It's quite a drop from the top, so how you feeling down there?
It’s a cold, cruel, harsh reality
Caught stuck here with your enemies

Who do you think you are
Tearing us all apart?
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It’s twenty to one
Yeah, so you better run

You got the world on its knees
You’re taking all that you please
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
You’re like the burden we bear
You’re all the hate that we share
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
But enemies
Enemies
You started something that you just couldn't stop
You turned the ones that you love into the angriest mob
And their one last wish is that you pay for it
And there's no way you're getting out of this

Who do you think you are
Tearing us all apart?
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It’s twenty to one
Yeah, so you better run

You got the world on its knees
You’re taking all that you please
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
You’re like the burden we bear
You’re all the hate that we share
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
But enemies
Enemies
Enemies
Where did you think you could go?
'Cause everyone already knows
It’s twenty to one
Yeah, so you better run

You've got the world on its knees
You've taken all that you please
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
You're like the burden we bear
You’re all the hate that we share
You want more (You want more)
But you'll get nothing from me (But enemies)

You've got the world on its knees
You've taken all that you please (Enemies)
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me (But enemies)
You're like the burden we bear
You’re all the hate that we share (Enemies)
You want more (You want more)
But you’ll get nothing from me
But enemies
Enemies
