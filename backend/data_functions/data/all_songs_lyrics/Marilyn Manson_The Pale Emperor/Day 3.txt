Day 3 Lyrics
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge
And I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

I can't decide if you wear me out or wear me well
I just feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

I've got bullets in the booth
I'd rather be your victim than be with you
I got bullets in the booth
I'd rather be your victim than to be with you

We've only reached the third day of a seven day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

I'd rather be your victim than to be with you2Embed
