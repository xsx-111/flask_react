Odds of Even Lyrics
Stood in the face of the grim death
Screaming monsters bring me to deafness
My dagger and swagger are useless in the face of the mirror
When the mirror is made of my face

This is the House of Death
Where even angels die in arms of demons
This is the House of Death
Where even angels die in arms from a demons

Hide your heart in your gut
But for what? When they're waiting to pull you apart like a scarecrow
On death row, so now all of your secrets are shown


No one is exempt from the odds of even9Embed
