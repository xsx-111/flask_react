The Devil Beneath My Feet Lyrics
I don't want your God and your higher power
I want power to get higher
And I'm not a liar, and I'm not a liar
When you look up, what will you see?
I don't need a motherfucker looking down on me
Motherfucker looking down on me
At least I know wherever I go
I've got the devil beneath my feet
At least I know wherever I go
I've got the devil beneath my feet
Beneath my feet

Don't bring your black cloud to bed
When I wake up you best be gone
Or you better be dead
Don't bring your black cloud to bed
When I wake up you best be gone
Or you better be dead

This what happens when you put an apple on your head
You can laugh all day but you can't laugh the darkness away
Can't laugh the darkness away
Too many pills and not enough kills
I need the Bug House, or the Big House
They'll never take me alive, never take me alive
Never fucking take me alive
It's better to be blamed for robbing Peter
Than guilty for paying Paul
It's better to be blamed for robbing Peter
Than guilty for paying Paul
Don't bring your black cloud to bed
When I wake up you best be gone
Or you better be dead29Embed
