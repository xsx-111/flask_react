Deep Six Lyrics
You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"Better watch yourself"
You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You better watch yourself"
"You better watch yourself"
Yeah

It's like a stranger had a key, came inside my mind
And moved all my things around
He didn't know snakes can't kneel or pray
Can't try to break my psyche down

It's as if my feathers were wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our bed?
Do you like our bed?

Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep
Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep
Yeah

It's like a stranger had a key, came inside my mind
And moved all my things around
He didn't know snakes can't kneel or prey
Can try to break my psyche down
As if my feathers were wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our bed?
Do you like our bed?
As if my feathers were wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our bed?
Do you like our bed?

Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep
Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep
Yeah

You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You better watch yourself"
You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You better watch yourself"
"You better watch yourself, better watch yourself"
(Watch yourself, watch yourself, watch yourself)

Eros is sore
Sin is sincere

Con is confidence
Eros is sore
Sin is sincere
Love is evil
Con is confidence
Eros is sore
Sin is sincere
Love is evil
Con is confidence
Eros is sore
Sin is sincere
Sin is sincere
Sin is sincere
Sin is sincere
Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep
Deep six (Six), six, six feet deep

You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You better watch yourself"
You wanna know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You better watch yourself"48Embed
