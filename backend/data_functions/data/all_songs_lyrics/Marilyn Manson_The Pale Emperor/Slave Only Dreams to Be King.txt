Slave Only Dreams to Be King Lyrics
The human wheel, that force unseen
The offspring of a deathless soul
Can hew away to any goal
The walls of granite intervene
Be not in patient delay, but
Wait as one who understands
When spirit rises and demands
The Gods are ready to obey

Take my money like an ugly bee
Covered in my honey, too dumb to see
My Fibonacci blinded by your jealousy
I'm happy to pull my veins out and braid a rope
I don't need hope to know that you'd die slow
I'm happy to pull my veins out and braid a rope
I don't need hope to know that you'd die slow

You are what you beat, yeah
You are what you beat, yeah

And then we met our brand new parents
But they didn't know it yet
So we chanted, "WED, WED, WED!"
But they didn't know they were dead
Didn't know they were dead
Then the witch tied her fruit to a stick
When our coin was looking too thin
It's like a winter in Hades, we drooled for the ladies
As if the apple was owned by God


Slave never dreams to be free
Slave only dreams to be King
Slave never dreams to be free
Slave only dreams to be King
