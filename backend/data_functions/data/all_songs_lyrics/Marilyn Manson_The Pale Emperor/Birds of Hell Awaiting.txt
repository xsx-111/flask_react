Birds of Hell Awaiting LyricsThe birds of Hell are waiting
With their wings on fire
This ain't no Fenix, baby
It's your death's desire
This is your death
This is your death
This is your death's desire
This ain't no Fenix, baby
It's your death's desire
The birds of Hell are waiting
With their wings on fire
This ain't no Fenix, baby
It's your death's desire
This is your death
This is your death
This is your death's desire9Embed
