Third Day of a Seven Day Binge LyricsWe've only reached the third day of our seven-day binge
And I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
I can't decide if you're wearing me out or wearing me well
I just feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
We've only reached the third day of our seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
I've got bullets, in the booth
Rather be your victim, than be with you
I got bullets, in the Boothe
Rather be your victim, than be with you
We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
I'd rather be your victim, than to be with you
Rather be your victim, than be with you37Embed
