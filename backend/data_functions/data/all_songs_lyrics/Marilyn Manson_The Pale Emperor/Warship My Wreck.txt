Warship My Wreck Lyrics
You're a paper doll
I'll fold you how I want
You're not my noose
I tied this knot
If this won't be
Our fingers locked together
Then this is total war
Method not objective
 x4
You can't ever say that I'm breaking the rules
If I can't glue them back together
 x3
Scars on my fingers, bruises, my neck
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck
 x2
Cut the hands off
Kamikaze into your soul
 x2
Worship my wreck
