Fading Lyrics
You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
Well, this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
Drifting, settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well, then apparently

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Bye bye, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy, you got me messed up
If we hooking back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away, yeah, yeah
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Ta-ta, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me, what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away12Embed
