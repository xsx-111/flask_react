Check My Eyelids For Holes Lyrics
I gotta lose weight
I, I swallow honey
Is my stand up show
Still, still, still that funny?
Am I back for good?
I said that I
Said that I would be
She's down waist low
Trying to make me happy
Because I like watching you

It's time I tried, gotta check my
Check my eyelids
Check for holes
It's time I tried, gotta check my
Check my eyelids
Check for holes

Two weeks late
I, I, I gotta test for babies
Shop take is falling low
I'm not going back
Back to the factories
Because I like what I do
It's time I tried to check my
Check my eyelids
Check for holes
It's time I tried to check my
Check my eyelids
Check for holes

It's time I tried to check my
Check my eyelids
Check for holes
It's time I tried to check my
Check my eyelids
Check for holes

It's time I tried
It's time I tried
It's time I tried
It's time I tried
It's time I tried
It's time I tried
It's time I tried to check my lids for holesEmbed
