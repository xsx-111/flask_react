Traffic Lyrics
We all face the same way
Still it takes all day
I take a look to my left
Pick out the worst and the best
She paints her lip
Greasy and thick
Another mirror stare
And she's going where?

Another office affair
To kill an unborn scare?
You talk dirty to a priest?
It makes them human at least
But is she running away
To start a brand new day?
Or is she going home?
Why's she driving alone?

Is anyone going anywhere?
Everyone's gotta be somewhere

She got a body in the boot
Or just bags full of food?
Those are model's legs
But are they women's are they men's?
She shouts down the phone
Missed a payment on the loan
She gotta be above the rest
Keeping up with the best
Is anyone going anywhere?
Everyone's gotta be somewhere

Waits tables for a crook?
Who wrote a hardback book?
To teach kids how to read?
Or sell your body on the street?
A nurse without a job?
Another uptown snob?
But have I got you all wrong?
One look and you were gone

Is anyone going anywhere?
Is anyone going anywhere?
Is anyone going anywhere?
Everyone's gotta be somewhereEmbed
