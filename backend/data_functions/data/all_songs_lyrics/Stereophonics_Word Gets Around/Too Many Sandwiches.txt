Too Many Sandwiches Lyrics
Shopping spree for the family tree
Haven't seen your family tree in quite a while!
Too many sandwiches and wine
Sherry stains down your best mans tie
What a speech
The band arrives, the granny's cry
Singers tongue's in the barmaids mouth
What a voice
Grandpa drunk a drop or two
His heads still stuck in the porta-loo
What a man

You bought a sequin dress for your chicken breast
The disco's late and he's overpaid tonight
You got a diamond ring
And the man who sings
The man who sings made love to the barmaid twice
And that's just tonight

The blue rinsed hairs lift up the chairs
The bands too loud they're off down stairs
What a noise
The bride and groom they dance their dance
And the singer mimes "there's still a chance"
The barmaid smiles
You bought a sequin dress for your chicken breast
The disco's late and he's overpaid tonight
You got a diamond ring
And the man who sings
The man who sings made love to the barmaid twice
And that's just tonight
You bought a sequin dress for your chicken breast
The disco's late and he's overpaid tonight
You got a diamond ring
And the man who sings
The man who sings made love to the barmaid twice

Ha! Grandpa drunk a drop or two
His heads still stuck in the portaloo again!
The bride and groom they dance their dance
The singer mimes "there's still a chance tonight"
And the barmaid smilesEmbed
