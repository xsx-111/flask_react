Goldfish Bowl Lyrics
The same long faces in the workman's hall
Caramel crisp counts his birds
Cliff chip's lines up his dominoes
King fisher, lead singer calms his nerves

I'm drinking, sinking, swimming
I'm drowning, working, smirking, learning
I'm burning, sleeping, thieving, cheating, beating
I'm eating, I'm deep in a goldfish bowl
It's sink or swim

The hall down town just burned to the ground
My boxing ring turned to ash
Red head ginger bread sells tickets at the door
Stella sleep walks in the sand

I'm drinking, sinking, swimming
I'm drowning, working, smirking, learning
I'm burning, sleeping, thieving, cheating, beating
I'm eating, I'm deep in a goldfish bowl
It's sink or swim
They're looking in, they're looking in!
Hard up outta luck, time to ride the village bike
A bike been used ten times or more
Grape vine here's the wife lays down her royal flush
I think I've lost another wife

I'm drinking, sinking, swimming
I'm drowning, working, smirking, learning
I'm burning, sleeping, thieving, cheating, beating
I'm eating, I'm deep in a goldfish bowl
It's sink or swim
They're looking in, its sink or swimEmbed
