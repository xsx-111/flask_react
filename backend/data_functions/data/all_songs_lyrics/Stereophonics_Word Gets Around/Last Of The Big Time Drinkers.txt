Last Of The Big Time Drinkers Lyrics
Ten minutes flat after that day at the factory
I'm drinking like a dog in the sun
I don't need to eat or sleep a wink at the weekend
Just rot my guts

And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink

I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
My beer don't taste the same without my name painted on my glass

I don't live to work, I work to live
And live at the weekend
And maybe spend a week in the sun
I come home, wet the bed
Throw my sheets out the window
Then Sunday morning comes

And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
The beer don't taste the same without my name painted on my glass

And I can't wait for my next drink
The first one is gonna sink

I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
Just give me the hops or the slops
I'm the last of the big time drinkers
I take pride in my work
I'm the last of the big time drinkersEmbed
