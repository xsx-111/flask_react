Monstre Sacre LyricsHastened decrepit
Old shrunken apple
Ready for the pit
I have let you go
Without forgiving
Or understanding
So now, you are gone
There could be nothing
You live within me
We communicate
The light it creates
And the tears it generates
Bring the forgiveness
Forgiveness
Don't let me down, now
Don't let me down, now
Life half sapped away
It took all that time
Since you passed away
To moisten the love
We have forged the sought after
Union brought us together
And the fullness
The completeness
The infinite simplicity
The world offers forgiveness
ForgivenessEmbed
