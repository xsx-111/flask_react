The Noise of Carpet Lyrics
I hate to see your broken face
This world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to

I hate your state of hopelessness
And that vain articulateness
You're a loser-type wreck wannabe
Not a pretty sight, really
In another world, it'd be funny

I hate to see your broken face
A lazy life, a fatal waste
Of fashionable cynicism
The poison they want you to drink
Oh no, man, that's too easy
Oh no, man, that's so easy

We weren't talking about happiness
Apply your leading potential
To be useful to this planet
The world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want to
I hate to see your broken face
A lazy life, a fatal waste
Of fashionable cynicism
The poison they want you to drink
Oh no, man, that's so easy
Oh no, man, that's too easy

We weren't talking about happiness
Apply your leading potential
To be useful to this planet
The world would give you anything
As long as you will want to
As long as you will want toEmbed
