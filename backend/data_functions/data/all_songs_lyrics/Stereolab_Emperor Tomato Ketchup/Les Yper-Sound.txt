Les Yper-Sound LyricsYou go in that team
I go on this team
Divide everything
A flag or a number
Make 'em opposites
So there's a reason
Stigmatization
Okay, now we can fight
Divide everything
Just put it all flat
Justification
Don't think now, you just fight
You go in that team
I go on this team
Divide everything
A flag or a number
Divide everything
Just put it all flat
Justification
Don't think now, you just fight
Make 'em opposites
So there's a reason
Stigmatization
Okay, now we can fight
You go in that team
I go on this team
Divide everything
A flag or a number
It is correct
It is correct
It is correct
And reasonableEmbed
