Slow Fast Hazel LyricsDiscovery of fire, America
The invention of the wheel, steel work and democracy
Philosophy, the Soviets and other events in history of humanity
Happened at a certain, given moment in time
Philosophy, the Soviets and other events in history of humanity
Happened at a certain, given moment in time
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, America'd not been discovered
The transition has been operated forever
What had gone on before from what there'd been after
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, America'd not been discovered
The transition has been operated forever
What had gone on before from what there'd been after
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, America'd not been discovered
The transition has been operated forever
What had gone on before from what there'd been after
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fire
Won't go back to the days, couldn't even start a fireEmbed
