Spark Plug Lyrics
There is no sense in being interested
In a child, a group, or in a society
There is no sense
If one does not see
In them before anything else
The life, its capacity
To be founded upon itself

There is no sense in being interested in
An ill person or unwell society
If one cannot believe their readiness
(Auto production, auto organisation
Auto production, auto organisation)
And the capacity
For proper recovery
(Auto production, auto organisation
Auto production, auto organisation)

An ill person or unwell society
If one cannot believe their readiness
And the capacity
For proper recoveryEmbed
