Drag LyricsShoot that cannonball into my wings
Shoot that cannonball into my wings
Into my wings
Gunpowder stings
You better tell me sweet things
Unload your pretty head into my ear
Unload your pretty head into my ear
Isn't it quaint
Isn't it queer
You gotta drag me back here
Here
Sing Van Morrison would ya kizza-my-eyes
Sing Van Morrison would ya kizza-my-eyes
Singing it low
Singing it high
Would ya kizza-my-eyes
My eyes
Turn me on my ear
When you drag me right back here
Here
You got to drag me right back here
You got to drag me right back here
You got to drag me right back
You got to drag me right back here
Into loveEmbed
