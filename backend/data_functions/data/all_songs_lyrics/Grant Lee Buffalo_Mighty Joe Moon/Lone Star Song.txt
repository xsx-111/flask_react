Lone Star Song LyricsThere's a bullet in the heart tonight
In the heart of Texas
Shout it to the Dallasites
We are rolling home
They shot an angel in mid-flight
And now she won't protect us
Shout it to the bedlamites
We are westward ho
Pray the holy war is ending
Like in the films of Hollywood
And the angels are descending (important important)
Like Koresh had said
They would before too long
Sing a Lone Star Song
They had him nailed up to a T
With a T for Texas
His disciples with artillery
They held the fort inside
And by the time the story broke
Down at Dealey Plaza
We've already caught the smoke
Read the TV guide
Pray the holy war is ending (ending)
Like the films of Hollywood
And the choppers are descending (easy words easy words)
Like Ma. Reno said
They would before too long
Sing a Lone Star Song
Lone Star Song of the south
Words that can't help
But escape my mouth
When they bring down the house
Day upon day
Day upon day
Day upon day
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Pray the holy war is ending (ending)
Like the films of the Hollywood
And the trumpet's blast is blending
With the crack of burning
Wood/would before too long
Sing a Lone Star Song
Lone Star Song
Lone Star
Lone Star Song
Sing a Lone Star Song
Lone Star (easy words come on come on)Embed
