Side by Side LyricsA fear of falling a fear that I could
From a place high above my stars well I would
Be a liar to say I'm not scared anymore
With a fear of falling on down to the floor
To the floor these have-nots
And haves divide for table scraps
And lantern light and on this spot
At last unite side by side by side
A fear of losing this war is enough
That I hold my head some days in my gloves
And I wait for this Stone Age to slow to a stall
But I fear we're nowhere near to a crawl
To a crawl these have-nots
And haves divide for table scraps
And lantern light and on this spot
At last unite side by side by side
By side
Side by side
I gotta tell you there's dissension in the soup lines
For they don't have much to show
And if you don't believe you're standing on a land mine
You'll just have to wait till it blows
You'll just have to wait till it blows
Blows
To the floor these have-nots
And haves divide for table scraps
And lantern light and on this spot
At last unite side by side by side
By side
Side by side by side
By side
Side by side by side
By side
Side by side by side
I gotta tell you
I gotta tell you
I gotta tell you
Side by side by side
Side by side by side
Side by side by side
Side by side by side
Side by sideEmbed
