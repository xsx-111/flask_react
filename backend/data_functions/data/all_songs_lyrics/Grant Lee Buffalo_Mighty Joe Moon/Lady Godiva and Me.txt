Lady Godiva and Me LyricsShe rides unclothed through the streets of Coventry
Upon a great cockhorse hair to her knees
I wore a Minotaur's Mask and I played the Moon Cow
I was the last to see her anyhow
No one's gonna lay eyes to see
Lady Godiva and me
Peeping Tom watched the whole thing from the sidelines
Till the Peeping Tom's peeping had stricken poor Peeping Tom blind
Even those things that we know can't be seen with two eyes
And all those who look her over are surely to die
No one's gonna lay eyes to see
Lady Godiva and me
Burn up the fields of your hallowed fuel
Hotter than you ought to be
Bury my bones in the stinking Sands
Casino for the world to see
I got the mean streak
I got the mean streak
I got the mean streak
The folks uptown they live on meat
The things they say I can't repeat
When you're walking down there
Down there
No one's gonna lay eyes to see
Lady Godiva and meEmbed
