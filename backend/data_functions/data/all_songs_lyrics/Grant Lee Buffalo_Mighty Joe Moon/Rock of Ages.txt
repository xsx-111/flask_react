Rock of Ages LyricsRock of Ages, I am tumbling down
Where the roots of trees embrace you
I do fall upon my knees and ask you how
You can just sit there and be
Rock of Ages, I am crumbling now
In an avalanche
I'm reaching for the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
Father, now I have stepped beyond my bounds
Now the pack I wear, it weighs a thousand pounds
It drags me down
Make me think crazy
O, my Rock of Ages I have gone astray
I heard my brother call, I turned the other way
Now I'm ashamed
To face him
Reach for the Rock of Ages
Rock of Ages
In the avalanche
In the avalanche
Heavy rock
And I reach for the rock
I reach for the rock
In the avalanche it falls
I reach for the rock
I reach for the rock
I reach for the rock
In the avalanche
In the avalanche
Heavy rock
Heavy rock
Such a heavy rockEmbed
