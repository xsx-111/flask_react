Demon Called Deception LyricsI'm in tight with a demon called Deception
It's alright he's a-treatin' me quite well
I'm in tight with a demon called Deception
He's right beside me when I fail
To whisper words like "Brother, nothin' here is any good
See the birds they're a-droppin' like the star Wormwood"
And all I wanted was a little patch of green
We were peasants and the cotton was our king
And in the fields how I sing a prisoner's song
While Deception whistles right along
Right along
Charlie sang for a pocket full of pills
While Deception was a-clickin' his high heels
We're in tight playing seven one night stands
And Deception made me as I am
As I am
As I am
As I am
As I am
I'm in tight
I'm in tight
I'm in tight
Truth is I'm in tight
I barely saw the light
Just as it kicked in
Something saved my skin
Something saved my skin1Embed
