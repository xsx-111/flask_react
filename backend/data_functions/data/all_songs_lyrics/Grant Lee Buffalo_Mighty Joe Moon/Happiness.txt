Happiness LyricsNever mind me 'cause I've been dead
Out of my body, been out of my head
Never mind the songs they hum
Don't wanna sing along with nothin' that I said
They don't bring you happiness
Happiness is hard to come by
I confess I'm bad at this thing, happiness
If you find it, share it with the rest of us
Never mind the words that came
Out of my mouth when all that I could feel was pain
The difference in the two of us
Comes down to the way you rise over things I just put down
And I don't bring you happiness
Happiness is hard to come by
I confess I'm bad at this thing, happiness
If you find it, share it with the rest of us
The rest of us
Never mind me 'cause I've been dead
Out of my body, been out of my head
Never mind the curse of war
Proud like a badge that just don't shine no more
I don't bring you happiness
Happiness is hard to come by
I confess I'm bad at this thing, happiness
If you find it, share it with the rest of us
The rest of us1Embed
