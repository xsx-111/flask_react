Mighty Joe Moon LyricsHave ya been to the Cumberland Gap? Oh, no
Fix yer eyes on the green of the map? Oh, no
Where the Appalachians rise? Oh, no
Oh, no
Have you tasted the finest of trout? Oh, no
Have you slept in a log-burning house? Oh, no
With your feet flopping over the couch? Oh, no
Oh, no
Like Mighty Joe Moon
There is no controlling him
Drive off a bridge
If he choose to swim
Mighty Joe Moon
Can't prevent...
What is Heaven sent
Joe can't control...
Where his money goes
He's Mighty Joe
Have ya been to the Cumberland Gap? Oh, no
The air is sweeter than oranges now Oh, no
Oh, no
Mighty Joe Moon
There is no controlling him
Drive off a bridge
If he choose to swim
Mighty Joe Moon
Can't prevent...
What is Heaven sent
Joe can't control...
Where his money goes
He's Mighty JoeEmbed
