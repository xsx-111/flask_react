Chicken Lyrics(Brot brot boogie)
Going home
I said I'm going home
Going, going, going, going home
Yeah, yeah well I'm going home
(Brot brot boogie)
My baby, my baby
She fixes, fixes chicken for me
Yeah, chicken
I said boiled chicken
Any kind, any kind of chicken
Boiled, chicken fried, chicken pot, picken' chicken
My baby, my baby
She fixes, fixes chicken for me
Yeah, I eat my dinner
She squeeze me till I hurt
I'd like to eat chicken fried for desert
Oh, chicken
(Brot brot boogie)
Boiled, chicken fried, chicken
Your kind of chicken
Well, my baby, my baby
She fixes, fixes chicken for me
Hey these chicks hot sticks are stickin' in the house forever
I'm going home
Start picking
You know I'm quicking when I'm picking all the chicken
Yeah, chicken
(Brot brot boogie)
Boiled, chicken fried, chicken pot, picken' chicken
Well my baby, my baby
She's fixes, fixes chicken for me
I said, I said, I said
My baby, my baby
She's fixes, fixes chicken for me
One more time
Yeah my baby, my baby
She's fixes, fixes chicken for me
