Cornfed Dames Lyrics
Callin' all cows down on the farm
Hey, Shut the door, you born in a barn?
Now, I ain't no farmer, that's no fun
Run some tractor till the work's all done
Hey, milk it bossie, I'll buy you a diamond ring

Now, good girls can't play the rent these days
These cornfed dames done found a way
Unzip that zipper, snap that snap
Round up the cattle in the Cadillac
Come on, whip that cream baby 'til the butter comes

Yeah, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake that thing I'll buy ya a diamond ring

Now, there's more things in Tennessee
Than's a dreamed of in your philosophy
Uh, gimme a barnful of cornfed dames
They just wiggle a little, I burst into flames
Oh, whip that cream baby til the butter comes
That's right now, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it
Shake that thing I'll buy ya a diamond ring

Oh, now, shake it baby
Yeah, take it all down, ... 
Oh, baby on that G-string 
I'll buy you a diamond ring
Let's go

Calling all you cornfed dames
Uh, Lux means bucks, remember the name
Oh, now go put on something real loud
Yeah, let's get up and go get plowed
Uh, shake that thing I might buy you a diamond ring

Oh, come on, shake it baby
Oh, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Go put on the purple one with the plumes at the hip
Oh, put in on upside down, baby
You know that really makes me flip
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I ain't no farmer
Oh, oh, oh, oh shake it baby, mmm, yeah
Shake one time for me
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shakeEmbed
