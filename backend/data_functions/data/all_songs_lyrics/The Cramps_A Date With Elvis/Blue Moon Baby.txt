Blue Moon Baby Lyrics
Way down in Mexico
There's a crazy little chick that I know
In the honky-tonk on the outskirts of town
Where the music is hot and the lights turn down

Blue moon baby
Yeah, Blue moon baby

Well, she's sitting in the dark corner
With the skip that's wrap around real tight
She looks into your eyes and you realize
That you don't feel well and that wrong is right

Blue moon baby
Yeah, Blue moon baby

Won't you buy me a drink of tequila?
Won't you buy me a glass of wine?
Well, I can sit with you for an hour or two
Would you like a little piece of my time?
Blue moon baby
Yeah, Blue moon baby

Alright, play the blues for me

Well, blue moon girl will make you wear a purple heart
Blue moon girl will tear your heart apart
Blue moon girl, take your money as you can
Turn around and find another man

Blue moon baby
Yeah, Blue moon babyEmbed
