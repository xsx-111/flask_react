How Far Can Too Far Go? Lyrics
Stick 'em up baby reach for the sky
Here's something you might like to try
I know a place that's far from here
Where the squares they won't come near

Oh, how far?
Yeah, how far?
Uh, how far, baby?
How far can too far go?

You'll be the queen of the tractor pull
In your training gear you'll break all the rules
I like it tough and I don't talk my kicks
If I had me a hammer I'd show you some tricks

Oh, how far?
Yeah, how far?
Oh, how far, baby?
How far can too far go?

I know a place that's far from here
Where the squares they won't come near
A smell of honey, a swallow of brine
Let's whoop it up have a real bad time

How far?
Yeah, yeah how far?
How far, baby?
How far can too far go?
Oh, how far, baby?
How far can too far go?
I said how far
How far can too far go?Embed
