Georgia Lee Brown Lyrics
The night was rainy and the night was blue
And I was thinkin' only of a gal I knew
I took a walk to the middle of town
I had to have a pretty lady named Georgia Lee Brown
A-pom-pom-pom, a-doo-doodle-doodle-doodle-doo

Told her I was lonely and only sad
She said, cheer it up and smile and don't you feel so sad
She took my hand and pointed to a lonely star
Then she walked me home to a neighbourhood bar
A-pom-pom-pom, a-doo-doodle-doodle-doodle-doo

An old streetlight was painting mystical circles
On the pavement out in front of the bar
While inside a band was playin' magical music
To the strings of a blue melancholy guitar

We did some dancin' and we drank some gin
Neath her angel smile, hear the devil grin
I discovered romance was her stock and trade
And that love was just a careless game that she played
A-pom-pom-pom, a-doo-doodle-doodle-doodle-doo
She told me, honey I don't want your love
My heart's as hollow as an empty glove
All that I can feel for you is a kind of blues
'Cause you're in love with love from your head to your shoes
A-pom-pom-pom, a-doo-doodle-doodle-doodle-doo

Well, that old streetlight was painting mystical circles
On the pavement out in front of the bar
While inside a band was playin' magical music
To the strings of a blue melancholy guitar

The music started blearin' and the lights burned bright
My heart didn't want to spent a wild night
She said, sonny I think you, you're kind of vain
Then Georgia Lee Brown disappeared in the rain
A-pom-pom-pom, a-doo-doodle-doodle-doodle-dooEmbed
