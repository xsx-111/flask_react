(Hot Pool of) Womanneed Lyrics
That happy updraft that wafts me hither
Spurned by man nor beast
It draws my love a-bubblin' in there
Into that hot pool of Womanneed

Hell, like the rud of two sticks wooden
This Womanneed is old as fire
The burning lure of that kissy puddings
The ancient curse of mankind's desire

Oh Womanneed
I got the faith
Oh, the power that flows so sweet
From the tower of salvation
To that hot pool of Womanneed

As Jacob said to I-Isaiah
In them biblin days of yore
Man that babe is a tomato
Oh my Lord, I'm longing for

Oh Womanneed
I got the faith
Oh, the power that flows so sweet
From the tower of salvation
To that hot pool of Womanneed
Like the funnel of the tornado
Like the whirlpool of stromy seas
My head spins to the serenade of
That wanton Womanneed

Oh Womanneed
I got the faith
Oh, the power that flows so sweet
From the tower of salvation
To that hot pool of Womanneed

Oh Womanneed
I got the faith
Oh, the power that flows so sweet
From the tower of salvation
To that hot pool of Womanneed

Need, need, need, need, need
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
To that hot pool of WomanneedEmbed
