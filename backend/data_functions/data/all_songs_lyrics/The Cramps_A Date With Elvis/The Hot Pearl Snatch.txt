The Hot Pearl Snatch Lyrics
Baby, you're a pearl, but you're such a tease
That thing a-danglin' there's brought me to my knees
You parade it 'round town so everybody knows
Oh, oh, I'm-a-gonna steal the show
Gonna get that thing baby, that's a fact

Baby I'm just talkin' 'bout that hot pearl snatch

Oh, so temptin' baby, such a pretty box
All fancy wrappin's and a bow on top
I try not to think about it, but it's hard
Ya always got it out layin' 'round the yard
Too hot to handle and a crime at that

Baby, I'm just talkin' 'bout that hot pearl snatch


Gonna get my hatchet, hack it off and snatch it
Jerk it right off of you
I gotta get away baby, you can't catch it
Do a swan dive on that jewel
Put it in my satchel then I'll lay a patch
Aw baby, I'm just talkin' 'bout that hot pearl snatch, uh
