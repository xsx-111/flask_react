Get Off the Road LyricsHey, who the hell do they think they are ?
Ah, they're just a bunch of girls
We are the Hellcats nobody likes
Maneaters on motorbikes
We own this road so you better get lost
When you hear the roar of cut-out exhaust
Bug off or you'll find that you've blown your mind
Get off the road !
Get off the road!
We know man's made out of clay
He shootin' clay pigeons today
Get off the road before we have crossed
Or you might get your rear-end tossed
Gonna be uptight, we're ridin'here tonight
Get off the road !
Get off the road !
Get off the road !
Get off the road !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !
Maneaters !Embed
