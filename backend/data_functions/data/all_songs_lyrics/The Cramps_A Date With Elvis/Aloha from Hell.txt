Aloha from Hell Lyrics
Gonna take a week off
Gonna go to Hell
Send you a postcard
"Hey I'm doin' swell"

Wish you were here
Aloha from Hell

I'll be dancing through the flames
Like a devil in disguise
You can hear me sing
But not by satellite

You can hear me sing
Aloha from Hell

Uh, gonna get a lei
Ring of fire round my neck
Big old she-devil kiss
Aw hell, what the heck?
I'm packin' my duds
Aloha from Hell


I'll be glad to get away
Up here everything's so swell
You know some like it hot
And down there it's hot as Hell

Don't forget to write
Aloha from Hell

Aloha from Hell
Aloha from Hell
I said aloha from HellEmbed
