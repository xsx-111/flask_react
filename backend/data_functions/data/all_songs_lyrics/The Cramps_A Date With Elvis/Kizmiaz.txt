Kizmiaz Lyrics
Uuuuuuuh
Uuuuuuuh

Take a magic carpet to the olden days
To a mythical land where everybody lays
Around in the clouds in a happy daze
In Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz

Flamingos stand easy on bended knees
Palm trees wave over tropical seas
Of azure waves and lazy breeze
On Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz

Over raspberry skies spires of the Shaz
Point to the heavens that this place has
You would swim all the way from Alcatraz
To Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz

It lies on the horizon in a golden haze
No one believes their eyes the legend says
Held hypnotized in a frozen gaze
On Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz
Over raspberry skies spires of the Shaz
Point to the heavens that this place has
You would swim all the way from Alcatraz
To Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz

Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz
Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz
The vibrations kiss
The ships would pass
Kizmiaz... Kizmiaz

Uuuuuuh
Uuuuuuh
Uuuuuuh
