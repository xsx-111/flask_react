Diamonds & Gasoline Lyrics
Undercover, blame it on the season
It ain't no kind of reason, baby
Why I come and go
I had a lover
She felt as good as treason
You can't ask her if it's pleasin'
You can't ask the wind to blow

And I would buy for you a diamond or myself some gasoline
If I can't afford you, darlin', then I can't afford to dream
And is it time I should be moving? Is it time I settle down?
Will I sit still, or will I feel the wheels a-spinnin' 'round?

Well I ain't the brightest
Bird that ever flew
I'm just someone you knew
A road you travelled on
All the colors
They shine and fade away
Well they're just like New Year's Day
They're here and then they're gone

And I would buy for you a diamond or myself some gasoline
If I can't afford you, darlin', then I can't afford to dream
And is it time I should be moving? Is it time I settle down?
Will I sit still, or will I feel the wheels a-spinnin' 'round?
Lord, I love you
I wish you only knew
Well I wish you had a clue
I wish you had a clue, you know
But I'm stuck here in Tulsa
With my Oklahoma blues
With a pair of concrete shoes
That got me sinking pretty low

And I would buy for you a diamond or myself some gasoline
If I can't afford you, darlin', then I can't afford to dream
And is it time I should be moving? Is it time I settle down?
Will I sit still, or will I feel the wheels a-spinnin' 'round?
The wheels a-spinnin' 'round
The wheels
Are spinnin'Embed
