1968 Lyrics
One, two, three

There ain't a thing in the world to take me back
Like a dark-haired girl in a Cadillac
On Main Street of an old forgotten town
And sunlight shines in fine white lines
On weathered stores with open signs
They may as well just close 'em down

And you look like 1968
Or was it '69?
When I heard you caught a bullet
Well I guess you're doing fine
And you speak of revolution
Like it's some place that you've been
Well you've been a long time gone
Good to see you, my old friend

Oh now that sun is gone away
Replaced instead by silver rays
Of moonlight falling on the Avenue
Oh and I could sleep if you would drive
I just can't keep my mind alive
And you've got nothin' better else to do
And we've all been lookin' for you
Like a hobo you walk in
Oh how the mighty all have fallen!
How the holy all have sinned!
Is that the clattering of sabers
Or the cool September wind?
Well you've been a long time gone
Good to see you, my old friend

And there's just two times of day like this
You find this kind of blissfulness
The sun, it sets and rises in the morn'
And we're shakin' hands, I rub my eyes
Free of all my alibis
Just a-blinking like the day that I was born

And you look like 1968
Or was it '69?
When I heard you caught a bullet
Well I guess you're doing fine
And you speak of revolution
Like it's some place that you've been
Well you've been a long time gone
Good to see you, my old friend
And when the rounds were fired that April
You were on the balcony
When ten thousand teardrops a-hit the ground
In Memphis, Tennessee
You were a prideful rebel yell
Among a million marching men
And you've been a long time gone
Good to see you, my old friend
Well you've been a long time gone
Good to see you, my old friendEmbed
