Long Hot Summer Day Lyrics
Well I'm gonna pick up some of these empties, Lord
As soon as I find where they lay
Tied off them jolly and leavin' lines
On a long hot summer day

For every day I'm workin' on the Illinois River
Get a half-a-day off with pay
Ole' tow boat pickin' up barges
On a long hot summer day

Well I got me a gal in Pekin
She's a good ole' gal, okay
Oh she's sittin' there waitin' by a window fan
On a long hot summer day

For every day I'm workin' on the Illinois River
Get a half-a-day off with pay
Ole' tow boat pickin' up barges
On a long hot summer day

Well last night we had pork for supper
And tomorrow it'll be chicken consomm√©
And a fruit jar full of iced tea
On a long hot summer day
And for every day I'm workin' on the Illinois River
Get a half-a-day off with pay
Ole' tow boat pickin' up barges
On a long hot summer day

Well we dropped a man off in Beardstown
When we got off yesterday
Gonna get off down in Alton
On a long hot summer day

For every day I'm workin' on the Illinois River
Get a half-a-day off with pay
Ole' tow boat pickin' up barges
On a long hot summer day


And for every day I'm workin' on the Illinois River
Get a half-a-day off with pay
Ole' tow boat pickin' up barges
On a long hot summer day
And for every day I'm workin' on the Illinois River
Get a half-a-day off with pay
Ole' tow boat pickin' up barges
On a long hot summer dayEmbed
