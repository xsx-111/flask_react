Evangeline Lyrics
Lookin' back, well I see you
With eyes that shouldn't be so blue
Clearer than the calm before the rain
So alive it wasn't fair
To live without a single care
I loved you and you felt for me the same

So beautiful that words cannot define
Sweeter than the Lord's communion wine

Evangeline, can't you see I'm sorry?
Can't you hear my tears ringing through the night?
I wait in hell between these bedsheets
And pray to God for morning light

And winter came and blood ran cold
As ever-present sleet and snow
Outside of a December window pane
And this house would never be our home
Oh hand-in-hand we walked alone
I thought the sun would never shine again
And the oldest violin could never whine
A melody as sorrowful as mine

Evangeline, can't you see I'm sorry?
Can't you hear my tears ringing through the night?
I wait in hell between these bedsheets
And pray to God for morning light

And now I've seen your face a thousand times
Nightmares running through my mind
It hurts just to pretend
But the Devil fell and so have I
From perfect grace, your face to sky
I never thought a love like this would end

Now your words, they cut right through me like a knife
Well I gave my love and now I take my life

Evangeline, can't you see I'm sorry?
Can't you hear my tears ringing through the night?
I wait in hell between these bedsheets
And pray to God for morning light
I wait in hell between these bedsheets
And pray to God for morning lightEmbed
