Every Girl Lyrics
Well she was born in the mornin', late October, San Antone
Aw she's every girl I've ever known

Well she was born in the mornin', late October, San Antone
Aw she's every girl I've ever known
She don't talk about religion, she talks about the Stones
Oh she's every girl I've ever known
And her tongue is like the Devil when she tries to concentrate
Says she don't want marriage but she still believes in fate
And she stands her ground defiantly, but cries when she's alone
Oh she's every girl I've ever known

Now her voice, it is a melody that sings just like a bird
Oh she's every song I've ever heard
And her heartbeat is a rhythm that commands her every word
Aw she's every song I've ever heard
She reflects the world in happiness and echoes all the pain
Her smile's a world of sunrise and cries to make it rain
And she hides the truth discretely, but you'd have to take her word
Aw she's every song I've ever heard

She's a sober Sunday kitchen conversation with my dad
Aw she's every friend I've ever had
Well we never failed to cut a trail whenever times were bad
Oh she's every friend I've ever had
She's a flighty good-time buddy in the corner of the bar
But she'd fight the Devil for ya just for being who ya are
And she's the last to cast a stone although she'd love to leave you mad
Aw she's every friend I've ever had
Well she was born in the mornin', late October, San AntoneEmbed
