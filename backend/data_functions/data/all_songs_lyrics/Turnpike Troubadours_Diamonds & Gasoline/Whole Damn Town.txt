Whole Damn Town Lyrics
I can go downtown and drink 'til dawn
I could sing those sad old country songs
Oh, but daylight finds me bored and blue
The whole damn town's in love with you

Well, the neon signs light up the block
It's a livin' breathin' honky tonk
And your hair's wet with the morning dew
The whole damn town's in love with you
The whole damn town's in love with you

Now, all the cowboys in this bar
Oh, and all those fools who play guitar
Well, they're well aware that we are through
The whole damn town's in love with you

Well, the music pours out on the street
Just as clean and cool as a cotton sheet
Well, them long and lonesome fiddle blues
The whole damn town's in love with you
The whole damn town's in love with you
Well, your worn out favorite pair of jeans
Oh, I remember everything
They were things I'd grown accustomed to
The whole damn town's in love with you

The whole damn town's in love with you
Well, the whole damn town's in love with you
The whole damn town's in love with you
The whole damn town's in love with youEmbed
