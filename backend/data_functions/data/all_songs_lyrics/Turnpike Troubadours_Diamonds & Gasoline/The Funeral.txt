The Funeral Lyrics
Well now stage right enter Jimmy, just a counterfeit James Dean
With a pocket full of delta blues and cheap amphetamines
Her feet up on the dashboard like a burned-out Betty Paige
She might have been pretty if she were half her age
But together they were something just a-closing down the bars
Headed down to Okie City in a slightly stolen car

Well, their folks were decent people but they didn't like their kind
When the car pulled in the driveway they were starin' through the blinds
The preacher in the kitchen, oh he's eatin' apple pie
Oh and Mama's in the bedroom, Lord she couldn't help but cry
And Daddy looked so natural like he'd just gone to sleep
And the preacher looked through Jimmy and prayed his soul to keep

And it's comin' home, comin' home
Ain't nothin' like a family to make you feel so damned alone
He should've brought flowers, shoulda got Daddy's gun
Ain't nobody waitin' on the prodigal son

Well they pulled out into traffic, nosed in behind the hearse
And that awful empty feeling, well it went from bad to worse
The preacher read from scripture and they put him in the ground
Ah well, everybody loaded up and headed back to town
But Jimmy got his whiskey out once everyone was gone
Felt he should say somethin', starin' down at the stone
And it's comin' home, comin' home
Ain't nothin' like a family to make you feel so damned alone
He should've brought flowers, shoulda got Daddy's gun
Ain't nobody waitin' on the prodigal son

Well the men-folk folded tables and the ladies cleaned the plates
The cousins asked about the car locked behind the gates
Jimmy knew his daddy's .38 was in that trunk, buried deep
And it'd find its rightful owner once its mama was asleep
But Jimmy looked at Mama, Mama just looked down
She said, "Why's it take a funeral, boy, to bring you back to town?"Embed
