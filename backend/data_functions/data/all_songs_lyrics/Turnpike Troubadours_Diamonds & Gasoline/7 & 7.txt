7 & 7 Lyrics
Back when you, oh, when you were my darlin', I
I didn't mind to lose a little sleep, I
I didn't mind to do a little walkin'
My reputation never meant that much to me

And how do I find that old familiar feeling?
The one that carried me so many years ago
When fun was dominos and Seven-Up and Seagram's
Well, things were simple then, just movin' nice and slow
Ain't it strange?
Well, ain't it strange?

Well, I had no clue I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about
Well, I had no clue I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about

Well, that old scene is always coming to me, I
I see you standing with your husband and your child
And you're a picture of strength and grace and beauty
And me, I'm just a fool in a supermarket aisle
Well I, well, I know "Hello" would surely end up awkward
I never had the knack for talkin' anyway
And you're not the kind for bendin' over backwards
Smile and turn my shopping cart around and walk away
And ain't it strange?
Well, ain't it strange?

Well, I had no clue I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about
Well, I had no clue I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about


Well, ain't it strange how well I knew you back when I was seventeen?
And loving you was easy, babe, but I was just a child
And these days you ain't nothin', just an interstate daydream
Folks were sleepin' and we were runnin' wild

And I still do my share of sleepin' on the floor
I'm not sure if anybody knows me anymore
Well, I had no clue I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you about
Well, I had no clue I'd be the boy who
Your mama warned you aboutEmbed
