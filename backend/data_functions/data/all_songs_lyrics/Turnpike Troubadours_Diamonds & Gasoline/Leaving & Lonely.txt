Leaving & Lonely Lyrics
Turn down the lights and turn up the A.C
Hold me close when it gets cold
Stuck in between lovin' and lonely
Stuck in between lines on the road

And it might have been the whiskey
Might have been the wine
Might have been the moonshine
In her eyes
It might have been bad luck
It might have been love
Or maybe just a good time
It probably was

Wake up scared at six in the morning
Reach out to see if you're still there
And these motel rooms are always the same scene
I remember a time when I still cared

And it might have been the whiskey
It might have been the wine
It might have been the moonshine
In her eyes
And it might have been bad luck
It might have been love
Or maybe just a good time
It probably was
Catch me when I'm fallin' down
Fallin' all apart
Try to pick myself back up
But I don't know where to start

Turn on the lights, turn off the A.C
Pack my bags, it's time to go
Stuck in between leavin' and lonely
Stuck in between lines on the roadEmbed
