Down On Washington Lyrics
Well you're standin' there
You say, "Life ain't fair"
Won't ya tell me somethin' I donâ€™t know
Oh and man I'm sunk
Red-faced and drunk
But there's a reason I stayed up all night and begged you not to go

Dear, I fear we've found ourselves a sticky situation
It's an awkward occupation, disregarding right from wrong
And you were down on Washington dancing like the devil
Oh and I am just a fool but I have loved you all along

Well the everyday
It gets in the way
Of all the things that we could be
Don't ya understand?
That I'm an honest man
But I would steal you in a heartbeat if the choice were up to me

Dear, I fear we've found ourselves a sticky situation
It's an awkward occupation, disregarding right from wrong
And you were down on Washington dancing like the devil
Oh and I am just a fool but I have loved you all along
Well what happens, little baby, when I blow this town
And ain't nobody like you?
Got a brand new high and lonesome
It's a bad dream comin' true
Oh what's a poor boy to do?

Dear, I fear we've found ourselves a sticky situation
It's an awkward occupation, disregarding right from wrong
And you were down on Washington dancing like the devil
Oh and I am just a fool but I have loved you all along
Yeah, I am just a fool but I have loved you all alongEmbed
