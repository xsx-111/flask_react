Did You Steal My Money Lyrics
I wake up on broken glass
But you left your number
All the members of the cast
Reckon I was lumbered

Did you steal it
Did you screw me
Did you peel it
Did you do me

Are you out there Mr no-one
Is my investment growing
Sorry that I got so drunk
But I wrote you a poem
Did you search me
Did you turn me over
While I cold turkey
On the sofa
Did you steal my money

How can we forgive a grievance
Now that we all live with demons
Did you know that poor old veteran
That you kicked out of his bed
Says that he cannot forget you
But he does not wish you dead
Leave his gold watch in reception
He will keep the sixteen stitches in his head
Did you steal his money
Did you pinch my trainer football
Say if you half inched it
Thought I heard a female foot fall
While I washed my kitchen
Did you use me
Why would I trust you
Why would you abuse me
I will not bust you
Did you steal my lorry
It fell right off my lorry
Did you pinch my brass
Nick my gilt you assholeEmbed
