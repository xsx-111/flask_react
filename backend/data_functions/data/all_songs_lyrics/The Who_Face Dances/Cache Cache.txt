Cache Cache Lyrics
Did you ever sleep in a bear pit
With apple cores and mice along
Did you ever lay on ice and grit
Or search for a place where the wind was gone
Did you ever tramp up endless hills
Past cozy homes with secret beds
Did you ever dream of a suicide pill
And wake up cold to the smell of bread

Well I have slept there badly twice
And shared my straw with scratching mice
Although you will find some deep brown hair
I will tell you something for nothing
There is no bears in there (cache cache)
Not a single bear in there (cache cache)

Did you ever have to make a draw
For a hard wooden bench or a bed of stone
Did you ever jimmy a stable door
Or scare the horse to escape the snow
Did you ever invade a neat little yard
Wake up the children who hope for ghosts
Did you ever cause their dogs to bark
Their guests to curse their noisy hosts
Do not jump in expecting fun
Do not swagger in there with your elephant gun
Do not enter the cage with waving chairs
Cos I will tell you something for nothing
There is no bears in there (cache cache)
Not a single bear in there (cache cache)

Did you ever pass the police at work
And hope that they might take you in
Did you ever wonder why music hurts
When someone plays it aloof to sin
Did you ever believe that a smile could cure
A happy face keep you warm at night?
Were you ever fooled by laughterâ€™s lure
Only to find that they laughed in spite?

Did you ever finally find a place
A soft warm bed in a room of flowers
And when you finally laid down your face
You found you slept for a hundred hours
A hundred hours
There is no bears in there (cache cache)Embed
