How Can You Do It Alone Lyrics
Saw a man about fifty or so
He looked lonely but his eyes were bright
He was walking up the Holland Park Road
And I stopped him to ask for a light
He practically froze when I spoke
But eased when he saw my cigarette
Then I saw as he lit up my smoke
Beneath his coat he was naked and wet

With eyes full of shame
For he knew that I knew
He slumped to the wall with a moan
I said "I know there is no name
For what you go through
But how can you do it alone."

I crossed the street to the local new store
Flicked through some cheap magazines
Beside me some school kid I saw
Push some girlie mugs down into his jeans
The shop girl was watching amazed
Asked me to call for the police
She screamed at his blushing young face
And he escaped into the streets
With eyes full of shame
Do it alone, how can you do it alone
I need your help, so I can do it by myself
Do it alone, do not have to breathe down a phone
I have got a clue, 'bout the things that you do
But how...can you do it alone

How can you do it
Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower
And was not too keen on me sharing
She came out well after an hour
And by that time I was past caring
Some women it seems have the knack
Of attaining that stars in their dreams
They simply relax and lay back
While people like us scratch our jeans

With eyes full of shame
And I know it must show
I slump - and I fall and I groan
Will somebody explain
What I need to know
How can you do it alone
How can you do it
How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourselfEmbed
