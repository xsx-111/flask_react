I Like Nightmares Lyrics
I like nightmares
I like being witless
Watch for the newsflash
Cool eyewitness
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, it's happening
Got to be a fucking fool to blame TV, don't get trapped in
If you are lucky be the same as me
I like nightmares, yes I do

There is a simple way to die they call it news
There is a simple way to fly they call it booze
There is an easy quiet escape just sleep and cruise
It is justifiable rape they say you choose

I like nightmares
I like feeling chick-less
Flicking my lighter
Watching life flit west
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, it is happening
Can we afford to strike three, do not trust the captain
He is just a boy like me
And I like nightmares, yes I do
There is a common way to weep they say just smoke
You can cry yourself to sleep they say just toke
There is a path that never fails you cannot get lost
Do not need roads, you are on rails, I pay the cost

And I like nightmares, yes I do
We were wasted, but you are only waylaid once
What we tasted was a voucher bag and lunch
We robbed their bank and we took their gold
And our lies in the tank must have sounded old
But we pleaded
I said, "Your honor, we are not chumps
After all, we only did it once!"

We like nightmares
They test our fitness
A full can of goulash
A taint in the mid-west
Eighty one, eighty two, eighty three, it is happening
Nothing floats interest free, do not care what it is wrapped in
You could be abreast like me
And I like nightmares, yes I do
I like nightmaresEmbed
