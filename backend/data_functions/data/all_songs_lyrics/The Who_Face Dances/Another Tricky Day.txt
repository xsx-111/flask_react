Another Tricky Day Lyrics
You cannot always get it
When you really want it
You cannot always get it at all
Just because there's space
In your life it is a waste
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call

(Just got to get used to it)
We all get it in the end
(Just got to get used to it)
We go down and we come up again
(Just got to get used to it)
You irritate me my friend
(This is no social crisis)
This is you having fun
(No crisis)
Getting burned by the sun
(This is true)
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you

You can always get higher
Just because you aspire
You could expire even knowing
Do not push the hands
Just hang on to the band
You can dance while your knowledge is growing
(It could happen anytime)
You cannot expect to never cry
(Patience is priceless)
Not when you try to fly so high
(Just stay on that line)
Rock and roll will never die
(This is no social crisis)

Another tricky day
Another gently nagging pain
What the papers say
Just seems to bring down heavier rain
The world seems in a spiral
Life seems such a worthless title
But break out and start a fire you all
It's all here on the vinyl
(No crisis)

(Just got to get used to it)
Got to get used to waiting
(Just got to get used to it)
You know how the ice is
(Just got to get used to it)
It is thin where you are skating
(This is no social crisis)
Just another tricky day for you fella1Embed
