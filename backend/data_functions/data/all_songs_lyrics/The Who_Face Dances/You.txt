You Lyrics
You – you are wasting my time
We are making music we are doing fine
Then a slap in the face takes me back to the starting line
You - your wasting my life
You cannot lose what you have already lost
Your arms are open but your legs are crossed

Save me - save me
I am going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me my next line

Too hot for me to handle
So cold I am getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I am sleeping
Maybe it is only a nightmare

You - why did it have to be you?
Of all those girls I had to choose
You win and I lose
You - you with the poisonous eyes
One look and I am hooked
One touch and my goose is cooked
Save me - save me
I am going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a life line

Too late to change partners
Too late you have got no chance
Too late to change partners
Too late to say I do not dance

You – there is a name for girls like you
You lead me on like a lamb to the slaughter
Then you act like a fish out of water
You - there's a name for girls like you
You have coming on like a steam train
Then you blow me away just like a hurricane

Save me - save me
I am going down for the last time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a lifeline
Save me I am falling
From the top of the page to the next line
Save me I am burning
From tips of my toes to my hairline
Too hot for me to handle
So cold I am getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I am sleeping
Maybe it is only a nightmareEmbed
