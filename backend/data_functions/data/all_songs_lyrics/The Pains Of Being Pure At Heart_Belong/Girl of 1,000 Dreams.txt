Girl of 1,000 Dreams LyricsHeld my breath, thought of death
And things I’d like to do ’til then
See my friends, lose my head
Wake up with you in my bed
When every feeling feels the same
And every creeper knows your name
He makes a pass on a passing train no shame
I know everything is so-so
I know you could just fly solo
But come on, we are going to go go
Around the world, cuz you?re the girl of 1,000 dreams
Sadness hurts, but that’s ok
Get back up and cry again
Fall asleep in outer space
But wake up at your parents’ place
So tell me how I’m supposed to live
When every night you die for it
So if you give, just say you won’t give inEmbed
