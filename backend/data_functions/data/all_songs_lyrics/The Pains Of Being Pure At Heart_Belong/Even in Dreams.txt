Even in Dreams Lyrics
You can drive around all night
With the radio on high
And wonder what it's like to be liked
And never feel out of time

You’re not the only one, you’re just my only one
Even in dreams I could not betray you (x2)

If I could shut my eyes
And disconnect my mind
There’s just one thought I’d think
I’d think it all the time

You’re not the only one, you’re just my only one
Even in dreams I could not betray you (x2)

Cuz there’s nobody like you
Is that why they don’t like you?
You are cold and dead to their jokes
Yeah, there’s nobody like you
Is that why they don’t like you
Like I do?
And I do

Even in dreams I could not betray you
Even in dreams I could not betray you
Betray you
Even in dreams I could not betray you
Even in dreams I could not betray you
Betray youEmbed
