Anne with an E LyricsThe things we used to do when the nightmare wouldn’t end
Turn up the sight of you and feel it all again
The posters on the wall that were our only friends
Their lives we never knew, but oh how we imagined
Let’s go out tonight and do something that’s wrong
Cuz I don’t feel alright when disaster’s gone
Anne with an E you’re everything to me
Take your sweater off and wear your spikes again
Cuz you can’t get off on that medicine
Let’s go out tonight and do something that’s wrong
Cuz I don’t feel alright when disaster’s gone
We’ll call in sick tomorrow and shake ’til we can’t speak
And know it won’t get better, but still you wanna see
Our bodies fall apart and lose the will to breathe
And fall asleep forever in perfect harmony
Anne with an E, you’re everything to meEmbed
