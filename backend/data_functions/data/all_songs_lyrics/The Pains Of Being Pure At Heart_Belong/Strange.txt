Strange LyricsWhen everyone was doing drugs
We were just doing love
A stranger said you’re strange like me
Ana, our dreams are coming true
Don’t tell me that a day will come
When we dress like everyone
Cuz I can tell you’re strange like me
Don’t say the hour’s growing late
Don’t say we should be going straight
Cuz I can tell you’re strange like me
And dreams can still come true
And it’s coming true for youEmbed
