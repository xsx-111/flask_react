Heart in Your Heartbreak LyricsTake a look around when you're going down
Cuz you'll never feel so high
As when you hid in her arms in the sky and the world slept
And there's no use to say just how much it kills
When it still kills all the same
Every thought of her name like a hand to an open flame
She was the heart in your heartbreak
She was the miss in your mistake
And no matter what you take
You're never going to forget
She was the tear in a rainstorm
She was the promise that you would've sworn
And no matter what you say
It's never gonna come back
An ambulance goes by, and you wonder why
It never stops when you want it to
It never stops when you need it to take you away
And your friends don't understand that the world could end
And it would feel no worse than this
Every thought of the look in her eye
Like a cold California sky
She was the heart in your heartbreak
She was the miss in your mistake
And no matter what you take
You're never going to forget
She was the tear in a rainstorm
She was the promise that you would've sworn
And no matter what you say
It's never gonna come back
And no matter what you pray
It's never gonna take the pain away
And even if she'd stay you know it's wrong
And no matter what you pray
It's never gonna take the pain away
Cuz even if she'd stay, you know she's gone
She was the heart in your heartbreak
She was the heart in your heartbreak
And no matter what you pray
It's never gonna take the pain away
Cuz even if she'd stay, you know, you know she's goneEmbed
