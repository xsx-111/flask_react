The Body LyricsCome on now stop staring at the ceiling
Your last daydream is slowly unreeling
Won't you come out tonight, like I know you want to
Cuz the city's alive and even though it haunts you, I want you
To tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I want to hurt like it did before
We shouldn't sin
Tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I lost mine and I need yours
It's only skin, we should swim
You try so hard to keep it together
And you look so hard in fishnets and leather
But I know who you are, you are just a lost saint
And if we go too far, there'll be heaven to pay
And what a priceâ€¦
To tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I want to hurt like it did before
We shouldn't sin
Tell me again what the body's for
Cuz I can't feel it anymore
I lost mine and I need yours
It's only skin, we should swim
I can't feel it anymore
I can't feel it anymore
Tell me again what the body's for
I can't feel it anymore
I can't feel it anymore
Tell me again tell me again it's only skin, we should swim1Embed
