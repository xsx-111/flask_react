My Terrible Friend LyricsWhat did you take? Cuz that's what I'll take
And I can't take it without you
When I feel dead, I lay in my bed
I don't want to lay here without you
Now you can't stand, well I understand
You can take my heavy hand
Cuz I can't resist the touch of your lips
I feel the bliss on my fingertips, oh shit
And I'm scared that this could end
Face down in the park again
Wondering where I left my mind last night
But that's alright, you're my terrible friend
Everyone is pretty and fun, everyone is lovely and young
Everyone is gentle and gone, but everyone's just everyone
And you're the one who's breaking me
And you're the one who just won't leave
Still I don't want it to end, you are my terrible friendEmbed
