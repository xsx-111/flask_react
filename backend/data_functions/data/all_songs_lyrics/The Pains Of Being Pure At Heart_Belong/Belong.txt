Belong LyricsWhat to do, nothing new
We tried each other, let's try another
When you came through the door
I felt everything and nothing that I had before
Tell yourself it's not yourself
But no one else can make me know there's no one else
When you came through the door
I was sure you never even felt the floor
I know it is wrong, but we just don't belong
In their eyes, in the sun
No we just don't belong
Change your mind and stop the time
That comes between us, that bends beneath us
If you're mine, I don't mind
We tried another, let's try each other
I know it is wrong, but we just don't belong
In their eyes, in the sun
No we just don't belong
In hospitals, in shopping malls
With heavy heads and locker walls
An empty street at 3 a.m
You told me you're not one of them
We took a vow to never sleep
While there was still air left to breathe
And you're the same, so slightly strange
Among the fakes you knew the pains
I know it is wrong, but we just don't belong
In their eyes, in the sun
No we just don't belong
I know it is wrong, but we just don't belong
In their eyes, in the sun
No we just don't belong
We just don't belong
We just don't belong
We just don't belong
Don't belong
Don't belong
We just don't belong
Don't belong
Don't belong
We just don't belong
Don't belong
Don't belong
We just don't belongEmbed
