Make It With You (Live at Fillmore West, 1971) Lyrics
If you came and didn't come with anybody
Perhaps you might want to turn around and say to the next person

Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on a rainbow
But baby, here goes (Baby, here goes)

Dreams are for those who sleep
Life, life is for us to keep
And if I had just one to see me through
Hey baby, I want to make it with you
(I really think that we could make it)
Yes I do (Make it, baby)
(I really think that we could make it)
I sure do (Make it, baby)

No, no, you don't know me well
Listen baby, in every little thing only time will tell
And if you do the things that I do
I'm gon' try my best to see you through (Make it through)
Yeah
Life, life is for us to keep
Dreams are for those who sleep
And if I had just one to see me through, woo-hoo
I wanna make it with you
(I really think that we could make it)
Yes I do (Make it, baby)
(I really think that we could make it)
Sure do (Make it, baby)

Hey, come on over here and let me whisper something in your ear
Uh-huh, uh-huh, that's right
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know me well
In every little thing only time will tell

And if I had just one, just one
Just one little thing to do
Hey baby, I wanna make it with you
(I really think that we could make it)
You're killing me (Make it, baby)
Ah baby (I really think that we could make it)
I sure do (Make it, baby)
Baby, I think (I really think that we could make it)
Hey (Make it, baby)
Choose me, choose me (I really think that we could make it)
Oh... (Make it, baby)
I wanna make it
Choose me, baby
Won't you choose me, baby
I got to make it
If not now then later, some other time
But I've got to make it with youEmbed
