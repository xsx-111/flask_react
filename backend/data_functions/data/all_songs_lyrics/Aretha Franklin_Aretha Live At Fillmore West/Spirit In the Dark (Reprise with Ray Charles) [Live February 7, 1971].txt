Spirit In the Dark (Reprise with Ray Charles)  Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles
He's gon' move with the spirit
He's gon' help us move
Come on, Ray, give us a little bit
I discovered Ray Charles, baby, yes I did

And I'm gonna move
Move with the spirit
Get it in the dark
Yeah
Oh, I'm gonna move
Go ahead and move now
Spirit in the dark
Yeah, go do that for me, yes
When I heard
Get down, Ray
Every when I wake up in morning
Yes, yes
Said I'm gonna move
Move on
Spirit in the dark
The spirit
(Doot-doot)
It's like Sally Walker
(Do-do-doot-doot)
Sittin' in a saucer (Yes)
(Do-do-do-do-do-do)
Right on, Ray, that's how you do it
(Do-do-doot-doot)
You get on into it
(Do-do-doot-doot)
Listen, just like a movie star
(Do-do-doot-doot)
Talking to Ray Charles
Lord, I'm gonna move
(Move)
Said I'm gonna move
(Move)
Do you want us to stay right there?
Every night and day
Stay right there, stay right there
I'm gonna move
Come on, Ray
Move
(Move)
Ah, move
(Move)
Hey, move
(Move)
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
Alright, Ray, alright, what I tell you
Why don't you sit right here, take this from me
Would you play just a little bit for 'em?
Okay, sure, I'll play for you, baby, you know that, anything you want
Alright, beautiful


It's funky up in here
Can you feel it?
Listen, can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feel the spirit
I feel it, I feel it
You feel it in your soul
I do, I do
When you get up early in the mornin'
Huh, when you feel it in your soul
Oh, late at night, you feel it in your soul
Yes I do, hey
Oh, somebody help me
You feel it in your soul
Wait a minute, listen to this
I got one more thing I wanna say
Can you feel it?
Listen, let me hear ya, can you feel it?
When Aretha sings, can you feel it?
Can you feel the spirit?
Way down deep inside
Listen, can you feel the spirit?
Can you feel the spirit
Listen, wait a minute, hold it
Listen to this, can you feel the spirit?
Wait a minute, can you feel the spirit?
When you hear Aretha sing y'all, oh Lord
Can you feel the spirit?
When my woman wake me up in the mornin'
She give me the spirit, ha
Oh, when I'm on my last go round
I need a little spirit
It's good for my soul, oh yes it is
Every night and day, oh Lord
I get a little spirit
Oh, Aretha, haha, can you feel the spirit, girl?
Yes I can, you know I can
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Ahhh, woo!
Can you feel the spirit?
Lord, don't hold me off
'Cause I feel the spirit
I got to find me a woman tonight
'Cause I feel the spirit
It's gettin' next to me now
Oh my...
