Respect (Live at Fillmore West, 1971) Lyrics
For all of us here at Fillmore West
This is a long-awaited privilege
And a great pleasure to bring on the number one lady
Ms Aretha Franklin

What you want
Baby, I got it
What you need
You know I got it

All I'm askin’
Is for a little respect
When you come home
(Just a little bit)
Hey, baby
(Just a little bit)
When you get home
(Just a little bit)
What you could do now
(Just a little bit)

I ain't gon' do you wrong
While you’re gone
I ain't gonna do you wrong
Because I don't wanna
All I'm askin'
Is for a little respect
When you come home
(Just a little bit)
Hey baby
(Just a little bit)
When you get home
(Just a little bit)
All you could do now
(Just a little bit)

I'm about to give you all of my money
And all I'm askin' in return, honey
Give me my propers
When you get home

(Just a, just a, just a, just a)
Oh yeah
(Just a, just a, just a, just a)
When you get home
(Just a little bit)
Do it for me
(Just a little bit)
Yeah

Ooh, your kisses
Sweeter than honey
But guess what?
So is my money

All I need
Is just a little respect when you get home
(Just a little bit)
Baby, when you get home
(Just a little bit)
Do it on me
(Just a little bit)

R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care, TCB, oh

(Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
A little respect
(Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
Yeah, yeah, baby
(Just a little bit)
I want a little respect
(Just a little bit)
Now, I get tired
(Just a little bit)
But I keep on tryin’
(Just a little bit)
You’re runnin' out of fools
(Just a little bit)
And I ain’t lyin'
(Just a little bit)
Respect
(Re, re, re, re)
Is all I want

Good evening
Hi, hello
In the beginning, we're gonna ask you to do just one thing, alright?
And it's just to relax, go in your soul just for a few minutes
I promise you gon' get it back
Gonna do a little this, some of that
And more or less, just feel good
I can say let it all hang out, every last bit of it
I promise you when you leave here
You will have enjoyed this show as much as any that you've ever had the pleasure to see, alright?Embed
