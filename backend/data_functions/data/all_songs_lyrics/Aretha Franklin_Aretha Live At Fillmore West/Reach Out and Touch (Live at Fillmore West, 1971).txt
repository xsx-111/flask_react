Reach Out and Touch (Live at Fillmore West, 1971) Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen, right
I would like to say before we leave that
You have been much more than I could have ever expected
I'd like to leave you saying

Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this a better world
If you can
We love you, reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Why don't you make it a better world
If you can

Turn around and touch your brother, touch your sister
Reach out and touch, extend your hand
Somebody's hand
Make this a better world
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make it a better world
If you can
Need I say more, need I say more? No
Reach out and touch, reach out and touch
Your brother's hand
Go on and make it a better world
I beg you, if you can
I love you, I love you, and I love you
Call me the moment you get back
I love you
Reach out and touch, yeah yeah yeah
Reach out for your brother's hand
Woo, woo, woo woo woo woo
Reach out and touch, reach out...Embed
