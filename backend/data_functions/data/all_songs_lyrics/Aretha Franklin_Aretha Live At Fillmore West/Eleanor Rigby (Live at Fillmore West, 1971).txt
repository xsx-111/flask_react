Eleanor Rigby (Live at Fillmore West, 1971) Lyrics
Don't fight the feelin'

I'm Eleanor Rigby
I picked up the rice in the church where the weddings have been
Yeah, I'm Eleanor Rigby
I'm keepin' my face in a jar by the door
If you wanna know what is it for, Well

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they, where do they all belong

Father McKenzie
Writing the words to a sermon
That no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Knotting his socks in the night
What does he care

Talkin' about all, all the lonely people
Where do, where do they all come from
All over this world, the lonely people
Tell me where, where do they all belong
Eleanor, Eleanor Rigby
Eleanor, Eleanor Rigby

Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie Wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave

Sayin' all, all of the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All over this world, the lonely lonely people
Tell me where, where do they all belong

Eleanor, Eleanor Rigby
Could it be, could it be Eleanor Rigby
Come on girl, do your thing, yeah yeah
Eleanor Rigby, Eleanor, woo
Eleanor Rigby, baby, do your thingEmbed
