Spirit in the Dark (Live at Fillmore West, 1971) Lyrics
Are you gettin' the spirit in the dark
Are you gettin' the spirit in the dark
(Mmm-hmm-hmm)
People movin', oh, tell me, and we're groovin'
Just gettin' the spirit
(Mmm-hmm) Oh, gettin' it in the dark

Tell me sister (Sisters), how do ya feel?
Tell me my brothers, my brothers, my brothers
How do you feel?
People, you feel like dancin'?
Get up and let's start dancin'
(Do the funky chicken now)
Start gettin' the spirit
(Start gettin' in the spirit)
Oh, get it in the dark
(In the dark)

(Doot-doot)
It's like Sally Walker
(Do-do-doot-doot)
Sittin' in a saucer
(Do-do-doot-doot)
That's how you do it
(Do-do-doot-doot)
Just go and get on into it
(Do-do-doot-doot)
Ride Sally ride
(Do-do-doot-doot)
Put your hand on your hips
Cover your eyes and move
(Move)
With the spirit
(With the spirit)
Go ahead and move
(Move)
With the spirit
(With the spirit)
Lord, help me now, move
(Move)
With the spirit
Now-now, help me move
(With the spirit)
Are you gettin' the spirit?
(Yeah)
Are you gettin' it in the dark?
(Yeah)
Are you gettin' the spirit?
(Yeah)
Are you gettin' it in the dark
(Yeah)
People are movin', yeah
And we're groovin', yeah
Just gettin' the spirit
(Start gettin' in the spirit)
Oh, gettin' in the dark
(In the dark)

We gon' do it one more time
(Doot-doot)
It's like Sally Walker
(Doo-do-do-do)
Sittin' in her saucer
(Doo-do-do-do)
That's how ya do it
(Doo-do-do-do-do)
Just go on and get on into it
(Doo-do-do-do-do)
Ride Sally ride
(Doo-do-do-do-do)
Put your hands on your hips
Cover your eyes and move
(Move)
With the spirit
(With the spirit)
Go ahead and move
(Move)
With the spirit
(With the spirit)
Hey, help me move

Hey now, help me move
