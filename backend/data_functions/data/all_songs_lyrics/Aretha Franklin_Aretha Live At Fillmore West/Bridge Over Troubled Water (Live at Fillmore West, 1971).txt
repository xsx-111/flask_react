Bridge Over Troubled Water (Live at Fillmore West, 1971) Lyrics
(Don’t trouble the water) Don't trouble the water
(Give it up, why don’t you, why don’t you let it be?)
Mmm-hmm, 'cause (Still waters run deep)
Still waters run deep, yes they do (Oh, yeah, yeah)

When you’re down now
When you look up and see yourself on the street
When evening falls (When evening falls)
Somehow (Somehow), I'll be there to comfort you
I’ll take the bow, I'll take it when darkness falls
When that is all, is all around

Just like a bridge over troubled water, I'll be there to lay me down
(Like a bridge) Just like a bridge
(Over troubled water) Over troubled and stormy waters
I'll be there to lay me down
(Oh, I lay me down, oh, I lay me down)
Yes He will, yes He will

Sail on silver moon, sail on by
Your time has come to shine, all of your dreams are on their way
(See how they shine) See how they, see how they shine
Oh, if you ever need a friend (Need a friend)
If you ever do, look around and sailing by, sailing right behind
(Like a bridge) Just like a bridge
(Over troubled water) Like a bridge over troubled water
I swear I’ll be there, I'll be there to lay me down
(Like a bridge) Like a bridge
(Over troubled water) Over troubled water
I'm gon' be there, gon' be there to lay me down
(Oh, I lay me down, oh, I lay me down)
Oh, yes I will (Don't trouble the waters)

Don't trouble the waters
(Leave it alone) Leave it alone
(Why don’t you, why don’t you let it be?)
Why don't you let it be because...
(Still waters run deep) Still waters run so deep
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Yes it do (Woo)Embed
