Mary of Silence LyricsOh Mary of silence
You pick my heart with a smile
Oh, sweet Mary
Come inside for a while
Help me get a hold on you
Oh I look in your light
I thought of myself beside you
Take me into your skin
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sleeping Mary of silence
We had a state of confusion
You're looking in fear
It doesn't seem like the first time
You walked out in a hurry
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sleeping Mary of silence
I look in, in your window
To check my head on your pane
My last thoughts say, "come to me
Why can't you take me in?"
Oh, sweet Mary of silence
Oh, sleeping Mary of silence
Help me walk with you
To the sky that we see
Shuddering in myself
It's not how it seems
Oh where
Oh where
Oh where, sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence
Sweet Mary of silence2Embed
