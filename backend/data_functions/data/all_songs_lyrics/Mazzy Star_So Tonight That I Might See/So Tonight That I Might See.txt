So Tonight That I Might See LyricsCome up, crash with the muses, fells dust and ash
Come so close that I might see the light inside that you didn't see
Let me hold you tight in hands, tight and long, you lost your chance
Come so close that I might see the crashing lights come down on me
With one look I find the dark
Stop me now, find me to your heart
Let me hold you tight like rain, sunshine on a rainy day
(See the lights)
Come so close that I might see, see the light come down on me
Searching like the crash goes by, small like wind and refuse to die
Free me now so I can see, the taste of wind and be like me
Taste the wind and be like me
Taste the wind and be like me
With one look I find the dark
Stop me now, find me to your heart
Let me hold you tight like rain, sunshine on a rainy day
Let me hold you tight in hands, tight and long, you lost your chance
(Sunshine on a rainy day)
Come so close that I might see, the crash of light come down on me
The crash of lights coming down on me
The crash of lights coming down on me
Let me hold you tight in hands, tight and long, you lost your chance
Come so close that I might see, the crashing light come down on me
With one look I find the dark
Stop me now, find me to your heart
(The crash of lights coming down on me)
So tonight the crash goes by, small like wind and fears to die
(The crash of lights coming down on me)
Come so close that I might see, see the light come down on me
And I hold you tight like rain
(Crashing lights coming down on me)
Sunshine on a rainy day
Sunshine on a rainy day
Sunshine on a rainy day
Sunshine on a rainy day
Sunshine on a rainy day2Embed
