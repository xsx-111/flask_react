Blue Light LyricsThere's a blue light
In my best friend's room
There's a blue light
In his eye
There's a blue light, yeah
I want to see it
Shine
There's a ship
That sails by my window
There's a ship that sails on by
There's a world under it
I think I see it
Sailing away
I think it's sailing
Miles crashing me by
Crashing me by
Crashing me by
There's a world
Outside my doorstep
Flames over
Everyone's hot
Don't you see them shining
I want to hear them
Beating for me
I think I hear them
Waves crashing me by
Crashing me by
Crashing me by5Embed
