Into Dust Lyrics
Still falling, breathless and on again
Inside today, beside me today
Around, broken in two
Till your eyes shed into dust
Like two strangers turning into dust
Till my hand shook with the weight of fear

I could possibly be fading
Or have something more to gain
I could feel myself growing colder
I could feel myself under your fate
Under your fate

It was you, breathless and torn
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
And two strangers turning into dust
Turning into dust9Embed
