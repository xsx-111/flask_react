Bells Ring LyricsBells ring into the night
Sounds like a mistress on a rainy night
Hold your thrown down together
And see the light that goes away
Leave my heart down by the water
He spins inside my soul
It isn't true but you follow
Just hold me down by the water
They say you look like a believer
Look up to see the weakness in the sky
Nobody's asked about your story
Nobody wants to know your reason why
Hold your hands out towards the water
In front of me to know I'm with you
Don't put it all into your hero
Look on if you believe
Look on if you believe
Don't want to say that I'm through with it
Just want to be
Right by your side
Right by your side6Embed
