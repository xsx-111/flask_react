Five String Serenade Lyrics
This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we play
And while I'm playing for you
It could be raining there too

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we play
And while I'm playing for you
It could be raining there too

And on my easel I drew
While I was thinking of you
And on the roof of my head
In came my five string serenade

This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we play
And while I'm playing for you
It might be raining there too

And on my easel I drew
While I was thinking of you
And on the roof of my head
In came my five string serenade
This is my five string serenade
Beneath the water we play
And while I'm playing for you
It might be raining there too
