Deep Down Lyrics
Gonna get deep down
Wanna do it right
Wanna get deep down
And look around this end of town tonight

Wanna get you up
Gonna take a bite
Gotta let me know
If we can throw a party every night

Wanna get deep down
Wanna do it right
Wanna get deep down
And look around this end of town tonight

I wanna pick you up
Gonna get a bite
Gonna let me know
And we can throw a party every night

Gonna get deep down
Wanna do it right
Wanna get deep down
And look around this part of town tonight
Wanna get deep down
Wanna get deep down
Wanna get deep down
Wanna get deep down

Wanna get deep down
I wanna do it right
I wanna get deep down
And look around this end of town tonight

Wanna get deep down
I wanna do it right
I wanna get deep down
And look around this end of town tonight

I wanna pick you up
Gonna get a bite
Gonna let me know
And we can throw a party every night

Gonna get deep down
Wanna do it right
I wanna get deep down
And look around this part of town tonight
I wanna get you up
I wanna have a bite
I wanna let you know
That we can throw a party every night

Wanna get deep down
Wanna do it right
Wanna get deep down
And look around this end of town tonight

I wanna get deep down
