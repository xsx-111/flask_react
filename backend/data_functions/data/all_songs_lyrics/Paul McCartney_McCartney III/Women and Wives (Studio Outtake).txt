Women and Wives (Studio Outtake) Lyrics
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husbands and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

Many choices to make
Many chains to unravel
Every path that we take
Makes it harder to travel
Laughter turned to sorrow
Doesn't get me down
Chasing tomorrow

Can you tell me when tomorrow comes around
That you set a good example to the children listening to you?
Well, you can help them keep their feet upon the ground
If you simply love them more than you ever loved before

Hear me, mothers and men
Hear me, brothers and sisters
Help the children and then
They'll discover new vistas
Some of them may borrow
Tales you hand them down
But they'll be chasing tomorrow
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husband and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

Chasing tomorrow
Chasing tomorrowEmbed
