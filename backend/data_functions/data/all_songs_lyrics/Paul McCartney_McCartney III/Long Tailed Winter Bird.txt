Long Tailed Winter Bird Lyrics
Do you, do-do, do you miss me?
Do you, do-do, do you feel me?
Do you, do-do, do you miss me?
Do you, do-do, do you feel me?
Do you, do-do, do you miss me?
Do you, do-do, do you feel me?
Do you, do-do, do you touch me?
Do you, do-do, do you?
Do you, do-do, do you miss me?
Do you, do-do, do you feel me?
Do you, do-do, do you miss me?
Do you, do-do, do you feel me?
Do you, do-do, do you miss me?
Do you, do-do, do you feel me?
Do you, do-do, do you touch me?
Do you, do-do, do you?Embed
