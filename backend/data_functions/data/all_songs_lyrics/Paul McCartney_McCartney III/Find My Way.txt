Find My Way Lyrics
Well, I can find my way
I know my left from right
Because we never close
I'm open day and night

I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I'm open 'round the clock
I don't get lost at night

You never used to be afraid of days like these
But now you're overwhelmed by your anxieties
Let me help you out, let me be your guide
I can help you reach the love you feel inside

Well, I can find my way
I know my left from right
Because we never close
I'm open day and night
Ooh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh yeah
You never used to be afraid of days like these
But now you're overwhelmed by your anxieties
Let me help you out, let me be your guide
I can help you reach the love you feel inside

I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I'm open 'round the clock
I don't get lost at night

You never used to be afraid of days like these
But now you're overwhelmed by your anxieties
Let me help you out, let me be your guide
I can help you reach the love you feel inside

I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I'm open 'round the clock
I don't get lost at night2Embed
