Lavatory Lil (Studio Outtake) Lyrics
One, two

Look out for Lavatory Lil
Look out for Lavatory Lil
You think that she's a winner when she's cooking you your dinner
But she's really moving in for the kill
Lavatory Lil

Watch out for Lavatory Lil
Watch out for Lavatory Lil
She says it's hunky-dory when she's telling you a story
But she really thinks you're making her ill
Lavatory Lil

If you saw her coming at you, you could look the other way
It isn't always easy when she's rollin' in the hay


So much for Lavatory Lil
So much for Lavatory Lil
You think she's being friendly, but she's looking for a Bentley
And she'd rather go and swallow a pill
Lavatory Lil
If you saw that she was coming, you could get up off the track
It isn't always easy when she hits you in the back
Oh yeah

Well, that's it for Lavatory Lil
That's it for Lavatory Lil
She's acting like a starlet, but she's looking like a harlot
As she's slowly heading over the hill
Lavatory Lil
