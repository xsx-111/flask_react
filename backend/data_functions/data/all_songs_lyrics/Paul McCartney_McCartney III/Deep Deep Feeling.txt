Deep Deep Feeling Lyrics
You know that deep, deep feeling
When you love someone so much
You feel your heart's gonna burst
The feeling goes from best to worst
You feel your heart is gonna burst

Here in my heart (Oh)
I feel a deep devotion
It almost hurts (Oh)
It's such a deep emotion
(Oh)
(Oh, hey)

Now every time it rains
It sometimes gets too much
You know I feel the pain
When I feel your loving touch

Emotion burns an ocean of love
You've got that hot emotion
Burns an ocean of love
The deep, deep pain of feeling
The deep, deep pain of feeling
The deep, deep pain
The deep, deep pain of feeling
The deep, deep pain
So intense, the joy of giving
How does it feel?
So immense, the thrill of living
How does it feel?
So intеnse, the joy of giving
How does it feel? (Thе deep, deep pain)
So immense, the thrill of living (Oh, hey, oh, hey)
How does it feel?
(Oh, hey)
(Oh, hey)
(Oh, hey)
(Oh, hey)
(Oh, hey)

Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Emotion
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Emotion
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Emotion
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Emotion
Sometimes I wish it would stay (Emotion)
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Emotion
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
(Oh, hey)
(Oh, hey)

The deep, deep pain of feeling
The deep, deep pain of feeling
The deep, deep pain of feeling
The deep, deep pain

You know that deep, deep feeling (The deep, deep pain)
When you love someone so much
You feel your heart's gonna burst
The feeling goes from best to worst
You feel your heart is gonna burst

Sometimes I, sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away (The deep, deep pain)
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay (The deep, deep pain)
Sometimes I wish it would go away
So intense, the joy of giving
How does it feel?
So immense, the thrill of living
How does it feel?
So intense, the joy of giving
How does it feel? (The deep, deep pain)
So immense, the thrill of living

Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay (The deep, deep pain)
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
And sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Sometimes I wish it would stay
Sometimes I wish it would go away
Go away
Go away
Stay, stay, stay

You feel your heart's gonna burst
The feeling goes from best to worst
You feel your heart is gonna burst
