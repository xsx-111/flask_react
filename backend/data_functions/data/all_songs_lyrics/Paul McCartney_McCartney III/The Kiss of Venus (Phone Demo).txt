The Kiss of Venus (Phone Demo) Lyrics
Okay, so here we go

Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She's scored a bullseye in the early morning glow
Early morning glow

And in the sunshine where we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Secrets blown

Now moving slowly, we circle through the square
Two passing planets in the sweet, sweet summer air
Sweet summer air

And in the sunshine where we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown
Reflected mountains in the lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
Asleep or wide awake?

Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

Harmonic sound
Harmonic soundEmbed
