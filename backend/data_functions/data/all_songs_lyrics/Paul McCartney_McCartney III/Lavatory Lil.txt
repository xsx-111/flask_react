Lavatory Lil Lyrics
Look out for Lavatory Lil
(Look out for Lavatory Lil)
You think that she's a winner when she's cookin' you your dinner
But she's really moving in for the kill
Lavatory Lil

Watch out for Lavatory Lil
(Watch out for Lavatory Lil)
She says it's hunky dory when she's tellin' you a story
But she really thinks you're makin' her ill
Lavatory Lil

If you saw her coming at you
You could look the other way
But it isn't easy
When she rollin' in the hay


So much for Lavatory Lil
(So much for Lavatory Lil)
You think she's being friendly but she lookin' for a Bentley
And she'd rather go and swallow a pill
Lavatory Lil
If you saw that she was comin'
You could get up off the track
But it isn't easy
When she hits you in the back

That's it for Lavatory Lil
(That's it for Lavatory Lil)
She's acting like a starlet but she lookin' like a harlot
As she's slowly headin' over the hill
Lavatory Lil
