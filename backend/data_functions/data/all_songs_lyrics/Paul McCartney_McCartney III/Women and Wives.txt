Women and Wives Lyrics
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husbands and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

Many choices to make
Many chains to unravel
Every path that we take
Makes it harder to travel
Laughter turned to sorrow
Doesn't get me down
Chasing tomorrow

When tomorrow comes around
You'll be looking at the future
So keep your feet upon the ground
And get ready to run

Now hear me, mothers and men
Hear me, sistеrs and brothers
Teach your children and thеn
They can pass it to others
Some of them may borrow
Tales you handed down
Chasing tomorrow
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husband and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

Get ready to run
Chasing tomorrow
Get ready to runEmbed
