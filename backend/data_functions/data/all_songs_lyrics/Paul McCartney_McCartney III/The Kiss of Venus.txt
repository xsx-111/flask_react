The Kiss of Venus Lyrics
The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye in the early morning glow
Early mornin' glow

Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

And in the sunshine, when we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

Now moving slowly, we circle through the square
Two passing planets in the sweet, sweet summer air
Sweet summer air

And in the sunshine, when we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown

Reflected mountains in a lake
Is this too much to take?
Asleep or wide awake?
And if the world begins to shake
Will something have to break?
We have to stay awake
Packed with illusions, our world is turned around
This golden circle has a most harmonic sound
Harmonic sound

And in the sunshine, when we stand alone
We came together with our secrets blown
Our secrets blown


The kiss of Venus has got me on the go
She scored a bullseye in the early morning glow
Early mornin' glow

The kiss of Venus has got me on the goEmbed
