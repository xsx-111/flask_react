Seize the Day Lyrics
I don't care to be bad
I prefer to think twice
All I know is it's quite a show
But it's still alright to be nice
Yankee toes and Eskimos
Can turn to frozen ice

When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
There'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that we had
Held on to the day
Seize the day

I don't mean to be wrong
I don't need to be right
I'm okay on a sunny day
When the world deserves to be bright
Dinosaurs and Santa Claus
Will stay indoors tonight

When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
Therе'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that wе had
Held on to the day
Seize the day
Seize the day
I bless the day
When you came into my life
And I could finally roll back the blind
You helped me to realize
Love was the greatest prize
I only had to open my mind
Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day

I don't care to be bad
I prefer to think twice
All I know is it's quite a show
But it's still alright to be nice
Yankee toes and Eskimos
Can turn to frozen ice

When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
There'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that we had
Held on to the day
Seize the day
Seize the day1Embed
