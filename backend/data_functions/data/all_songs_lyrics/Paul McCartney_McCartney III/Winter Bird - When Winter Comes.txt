Winter Bird / When Winter Comes Lyrics
Must fix the fence by the acre plot
Two young foxes have been nosin' around
The lambs and the chickens won't feel safe
Until it's done

I must dig a drain by the carrot patch
The whole crop spoils if it gets too damp
And where will we be with an empty store
When winter comes?

When winter comes and food is scarce
We'll warn our toes to stay indoors
When summer's gone, we'll fly away
And find the sun when winter comes

I must find the time to plant some trees
In thе meadow where thе river flows
In time to come, they'll make good shade
For some poor soul

When winter comes and food is scarce
We'll warn our toes to stay indoors
When summer's gone, we're gonna fly away
And find the sun when winter comes
Must fix the fence by the acre plot
Two young foxes have been nosin' around
And the lambs and the chickens won't feel safe
Until it's done

When winter comes and food is scarce
We'll warn our toes to stay indoors
When summer's gone, we're gonna fly away
And find the sun when winter comes

And find the sun when winter comesEmbed
