Life Is a Problem LyricsJesus won't you be my radio
Broadcast direction where I got to go
Send me your signal and I will receive
Jesus please be there and take care of me
Jesus please be my automobile
Won't get to heaven 'less God's at the wheel
Send me your chauffeur and I will get in
Jesus please drive me away from my sin
And I won't get to heaven
I won't be coming home
I will not see my mother again
'cause I'm lost and I'm gone
And this life is too long
And my willpower's never to strong
Jesus please be my aeroplane
Fly me to heaven and never again
Will I be weak-willed, stoned, or get high
Jesus please meet me the day that i die
Jesus please be my bullet and gun
Shoot all the sinners down, every one
Kill all my demons and that will be fine
But I will be reloading all the time
And I won't get to heaven
I won't be coming home
I will not see my mother again
'cause I'm lost and I'm gone
And this life is too long
And my willpower's never too strong1Embed
