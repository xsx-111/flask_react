Too Late Lyrics
My mother said when she got so concerned
Don't play with fire and you'll never get burned
Don't touch the flame and you'll never find out
My momma said that's what love's all about

But it's too late
I've made up my mind
Love always shows when there's eyes it can blind
Too late
Something I've learned
Love lights the flame when there's hearts it can burn

My momma said if you can't find a friend
Don't get too close cause you know it may end
Don't get too deep cause you know you'll regret
Heartache and pain - in love that's what you get

But it's too late
I've made up my mind
Love always shows when there's eyes it can blind
Too late
Something I've learned
Love lights the flame when there's hearts it can burn
This is dedicated baby
What more can I say
I won't love you more than I love you today
And I won't love you less
But I've made my mistakes
Stay away from love dear
If that's what it takes

But it's too late
I've made up my mind
Love always shows when there's eyes it can blind
Too late
Something I've learned
Love lights the flame when there's hearts it can burn

Too late, too late, love always shows when there's hearts it can break1Embed
