Hey Jane LyricsHey Jane, where you going today?
You took a call then you ran all day
That clock going 110
I never said I'll get you back again
So you ain't got time to make no mistakes
Ain't got time to waste my brakes
Hey Jane, where you're going today?
You lit a fire then you fanned the flame
They say you got a troubled soul
I say you got it on a roll
So you ain't got time to change your ways
Ain't got time to make no mistakes with you
Show 'em what you can do
Hey Jane, where you going today?
I got a love for you anyway
I guess I'm tired of hanging around
I'll meet you there when you're coming down
And you got good style and a little taste
Carve your name right into my face
Hey Jane, where you're going today?
You broke my heart then you ran away
Some say you've got a rotten soul
But I said "Janey loves rock and roll"
Said you ain't got time, you're a long time dead
Ain't got time to mess my head, and you
Show 'em what you can do
Hey Jane, where you going today?
You hit the fast lane right away
Got no breaks for your rotten life
A heart like yours never satisfies
Said you ain't got time for such a waste
Run so fast you get no place
Hey Jane where you goin' today?
I'll get a car for you right away
That cop goin' 110
"Fast lane," Jane said, "fast lane, faster!"
Ain't got no time to make no mistakes
Ain't got time to waste my time with you
Hey Jane, where you going today?
Hey Jane, where you going today?
Hey Jane, where you going today?
Hey Jane, where you going today?
Hey Jane, where you gonna die?
Live life like a butterfly
Feel safe, babe by your side
Cheat death on another ride
Hey Jane, where you gonna die?
You got wings like a butterfly
Meet death, baby all alone
"Sweet Jane" on the radio
Hey Jane when you gonna die?
That pain goes right inside
Hey Jane, got a rotten soul
Hey Jane, got it on a roll
Hey Jane where you going today?
Sweet heart and fade away
Hey Jane, when you gonna die?
Hey Jane, when you gonna die?
Hey Jane, when you gonna die?
Hey Jane, when you gonna die?
Hey Jane, when you gonna die?
Hey Jane, when you gonna die?
