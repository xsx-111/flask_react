So Long You Pretty Thing Lyrics
If you feel lonely and the world’s against you
Take the long way home past the scary Jesus
And you'll find my door with your name in diamonds
And you’ll feel lonely no more

Help me, Lord, help me, Jesus, 'cause I’m lonely and tired
Help me, Lord, it ain’t easy 'cause I’m living with the blind
I got no reason to believe in anything
Help me, Lord, help me, Jesus, 'cause I’m hurting inside
Help me, Lord, it ain’t easy 'cause I’m living a lie
And God, I’m hoping for a reason to be here
Help me, Lord, help me, Father, 'cause I’m losing my mind
Help me, Lord, its getting harder 'cause I’m losing all the time
I got no reason to be living anymore
Help me, Lord, help me, Father, 'cause I wasted all my time
Help me, Lord, it’s getting harder 'cause I've made a mess of mine
And God, I’m hoping for the reason to be clear

So long you pretty thing, God save your little soul
The music that you played so hard ain't on your radio
And all your dreams and diamond rings and all that rock and roll can bring you
Sail on, so long1Embed
