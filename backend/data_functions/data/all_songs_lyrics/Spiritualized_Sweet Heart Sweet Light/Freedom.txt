Freedom LyricsI got two arms that can hold you
But no mind for the road
And they're pushing my life right over
I'm getting so tired and alone
And I'm living my life on a prayer now
I got no right to be here
And they're pushing my life right over
You get to the edge and it's clear
Freedom is yours if you want it
But you just don't know what you need
I made up my mind to leave you behind
'Cos you just don't know what you fear
Two little words and it's over
Gonna practise saying it all the time
Show a little sign
We'll get there in time
But you don't accept that it's near
Freedom is yours if you want it
But you just don't know what you need
I made up my mind to leave you behind
You just don't know what you fear1Embed
