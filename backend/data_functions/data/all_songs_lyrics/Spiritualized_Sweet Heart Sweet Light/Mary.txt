Mary LyricsMary, take your big brown eyes and look away
You're searching in vain
Mary take your big red heart and turn around
They'll make you insane
You know you're getting beat in the morning
Spend the night on the tiles
You know you're only searching for glory
But now you've gone and missed it by miles
Mary, take your healing hands and turn around
There's nothing to save
Mary, take you words of love and tear them out
They're starting to fade
You know you're gonna hurt in the morning
Spend the night all alone
You know you're only searching for glory
But now you gotta face it alone
You know you're getting beat in the morning
Spend the night on the tiles
You know you're only searching for glory
But now you've gone and missed it by miles
Mary, you know this life's so sweet
And filled with stuff that ain't yet dead
Mary, you know we both had dreams
But you're the one who got to live them insteadEmbed
