Get What You Deserve LyricsGonna take more than I can borrow
When I get there, won't look back
Got more riches any man could hold
Ain't gonna make for what I lack
Used to care but I took care of that
Used to slow but now I'm lightning
Got a car all blue and red and white
Gonna roll it where I like it
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down
I lost all of my direction
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' still
I used up all of my affection
Gonna take more, I don't borrow
One more hit and I'll get high
Get more twisted every road I take
Ain't gonna stop until I die
I used to love but I got love for that
Used to know but now I'm blinded
Got a child all full and fed and fat
Gonna take him where I like it
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down
I lost all of my direction
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' still
I used up all of my affection
Gonna take more than I can borrow
When I get there, won't look back
Got more riches than any man can hold
Ain't gonna make for what I lack
Used to care but I took care of that
Used to slow but now I'm lightning
Got a car all blue and red and white
Gonna roll it where I like it
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down
I lost all of my direction
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' still
I used up all of my affection
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down
I lost all of my devotion
Gonna shoot you while you're laying still
I lost all of my emotion
Get what you deserve
Get what you deserve1Embed
