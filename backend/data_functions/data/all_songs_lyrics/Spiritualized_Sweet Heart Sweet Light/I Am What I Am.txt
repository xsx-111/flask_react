I Am What I Am LyricsI am the tide that pulls the moon
I am the planet that lights the sun
I am the way that leads the stars
I am the road that drives the cars
I am the rocket ship that blasts the bit that takes you to the stars
I am what I am
Got it in my hand
Hear what I say
See what I am
You understand?
I am the song that writes the mind
I am the man who don't wait for time
I am the heart that feeds your kiss
I am the faith that gets your soul
I am the pound of flesh that signifies the sum of all you're told
I am what I am
Got it in my hand
Hear what I say
See what I am
You understand?
I am the heart that calls you home
I am the grave that marks your stone
I'm misunderstood do you understand?
Like the sea holds back the land
I'm the mishap and coincidence that came out as you planned
I am what I am
Got it in my hand
Hear what I say
See what I am
You understand?1Embed
