Little Girl Lyrics
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
Cause only the living can feel the pain
Sometimes I wish that I could fly
You get so grounded that life will pass you by

Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on

Sometimes your world's so full of pain
You get so hurt inside, but dry your eyes
Sometimes the words you gotta say
They get so trapped inside and fade away

Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on
Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on
Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on
Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on
Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it onEmbed
