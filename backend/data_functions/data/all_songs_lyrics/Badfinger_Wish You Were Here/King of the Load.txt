King of the Load LyricsHe's the king of the road, the old man, the child
The joker runnin' wild, makin' it funny
He's of no fixed abode when he carries the load
He'll do anything he can to make it funny
But he'll never say die if he's livin' a lie
Pick up his hat and go
If there's reason to cry, he'll just make it a sigh
And wander on down the road
He's a natural friend with no money to lend
Or whatever it takes to turn you on to
He's the father, the son, he don't owe anyone
And his debts are all paid with his confection
Then he'll wander away with no time in his way
Pick up his hat and go
He'll never say die if he's livin' a lie
Just wander on down the road
Wander on down the road
And he'll wander away with no time in his way
Pick up his hat and go
He'll never say die, he was livin' a lie
Just wandered on down the road
Wandered on down the road
Wandered on down the road
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahEmbed
