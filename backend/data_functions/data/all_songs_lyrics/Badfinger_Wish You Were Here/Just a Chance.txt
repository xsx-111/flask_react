Just a Chance LyricsDoesn't matter what you think I do
All I wanna do is see it through
You may say it's not a great romance
All I want from you is just a chance to try
Any way at all
Don't you think we know it has to hurt
Are minds that small?
I won't tell you if it's short or long
All I know is that it don't feel wrong
You may say it's not a great romance
But all we want from you is just a chance to try
Any way we can
Don't you think we know it has to hurt
Won't you understand?
Doesn't matter what you think I do
All I wanna do is see it through
You may say it's not a great romance
But all I want from you is just a chance to try
Any way we can
Don't you think we know it has to hurt
Won't you understand?
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
