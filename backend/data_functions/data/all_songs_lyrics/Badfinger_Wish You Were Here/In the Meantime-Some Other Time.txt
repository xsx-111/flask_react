In the Meantime/Some Other Time LyricsYour eyes stick out in your head
Make me believe it
You don't need it
You don't need it
You already know
In time with time
In the meantime
You can leave it
Or not believe it
You're already here
But in the middle of the ocean seas
Things gonna be this way
To speak of love devotion
And dyin'
First, you must realise
Ah man, can ya spare the chain?
And in the heat of your emotions
Everythin' leads me to say
Build a house on higher ground
Man, help me make the change
Man, can ya spare the chain?
Wear you hair long
Sing a love song
Don't you believe it
You don't need it
You already know
In time with time
In the meantime
You can leave it
Or not believe it
You're already here
I can remember
Knowin' you better some other time (Lonesome)
I can remember
Bein' in love with a friend of mine
I've seen it before, now
It's always the same
Nothin' can change any part
I know what you're doin'
I think it's a shame
I'm gonna have to make a new start
I can remember some other time
I could believe in
Love has a reason for holdin' on (Hold on)
I can remember
Bein' together and feelin' strong
But somehow we lost it, drifted apart
It really took a piece of my heart
I've done it before now
It's always the same
I'm gonna have to make a new start
I can remember some other time
I've seen it before now
It's always the same
Nothin' can change any part
I know what you're doin'
I think it's a shame
I'm gonna have to make a new start
I can remember some other time
I can remember some other timeEmbed
