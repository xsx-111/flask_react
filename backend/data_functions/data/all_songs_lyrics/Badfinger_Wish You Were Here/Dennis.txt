Dennis Lyrics
Deeper waters flowed
Recently it showed
Tryin' to cover your head
Tryin' to frighten you
Tryin' to fight with you
Really gettin' you scared
But don't you worry, you love of mine
Pretty soon it will all be fine
And we'll just go on

Higher hills to climb
Climbin' all the time
Tryin' to find a way through
Fallin' down again, on the ground again
Wonderin' what you can do
But don't you worry, you love of ours
They look like weeds, but they're really flowers
And they'll soon be gone

You won't stand up, you won't sit down
Your head's a mile above the ground
And though we tend to scold you now
I couldn't start to tell you how
We couldn't start to tell you how
There's just no way to say how much we love you
You, little Dennis, you
You're full of new surprise
Love you
You, little Dennis, with the rascal in your eyes
You're a prize

It could be bad, it could be worse
You're takin' out your mother's purse
And though you cried when you got told
The money there was for the old
To keep their dogs from gettin' cold
The only thing that can't be sold is love

You, little Dennis, you
You're full of new surprise
Love you
You, little Dennis, with the rascal in your eyes

Will you pick up your toys?
Will you be a good boy?
Will you please, please?
There's a way
There's a way
If you'll play
If you'll stay
There's a way through
There's a way to
Take away blue
Take away blue

There's a way
There's a way
If you'll play
If you'll stay
There's a way through
There's a way to
Take away blue
Take away blue

There's a way
There's a way
If you'll play
If you'll stay
There's a way through
There's a way toEmbed
