Love Time Lyrics
Every day I look into your eyes
I see a love that's there
I see myself and stare

Loving you so many different ways
A kind of harmony
Another part of me
Makes it harder now

If it's easy to believe it
It's hard to realize
As easy to believe it
As the love that's in your eyes


Well, if it's easy to believe it
It's hard to realize
As easy to believe it
As the love that's in your eyes

Found amongst the laughter and the tears
Love I had inside
Love I used to hide
Makes it harder now
Harder nowEmbed
