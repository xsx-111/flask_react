Know One Knows LyricsKnow one knows it
Know one knows it
Know one knows it, no
Know one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow
Know one knows it
Know one knows it
Know one knows it, no
Know one knows how good I feel
When you let it show
Keep it comin', keep it long
Caress me with your body song
Reach it higher with each sigh
Knowin' soon that we will fly
Know one knows it
Know one knows it
Know one knows it, no
Know one knows how good I feel
When I see you glow
Know one knows it
Know one knows it
Know one knows it, no
Know one knows how good I feel
When you let it flow
Keep it movin', keep it bright
And guide me with your body light
Come in closer with each sigh
Knowin' soon that we will fly
(Mika's Japanese cooing over guitar solo (Pete Ham):
No one knows
No one knows
No one knows
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it show
No one knows
No one knows how good I feel
When you let it flow.)
Keep on feelin', keep it whole
And lead me with your body soul
Take me higher with each sigh
Knowin' you can make me fly
Know one knows it
Know one knows it
Know one knows it, no
Know one knows how good I feel
When I see you glowEmbed
