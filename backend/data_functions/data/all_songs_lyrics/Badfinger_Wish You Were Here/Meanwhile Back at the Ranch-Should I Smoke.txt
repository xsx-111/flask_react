Meanwhile Back at the Ranch/Should I Smoke LyricsWhy do they play so hard to get?
Is there something they might regret?
Is it better to just forget, just forget?
If they only would let us know
Then, we'd know just how far to go
But instead they just tell us no, tell us no
You, you always played the fool (Always played the fool)
You always break the rule
At every single school you know (You don't break the rule)
It always pulled you down
It would always pull you down
You, you never stayed the same (Never stayed the same)
And now you take the blame
For all the little games they play (No, won't take the blame)
And let it bring you down
Why'd you let it bring you down?
Why do they play so hard to get?
Is there something they might regret?
Is it better to just forget, just forget?
If they only would let us know
Then, we'd know just how far to go
But instead they just tell us no, tell us no
You, you never stayed the same (Never stayed the same)
And now you take the blame
For all the little games they play (No, won't take the blame)
And let it bring you down
Why'd you let it bring you down?
Should I smoke or should I die?
Somebody must tell me why
Should I laugh? Should I cry?
Won't somebody help me?
Don't know what to say
You're makin' me better
I've learned how to pray
Change in the weather today
Don't know what to do
Just makes it hard to lose
The day passes by
And nobody listens
Nobody cries
For anyone's vision today
Don't know what to do
Just makes it hard to choose
Should I smoke or should I die?
Somebody must tell me why
Should I laugh? Should I cry?
Won't somebody help me?Embed
