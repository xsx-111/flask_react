Some Distant Memory Lyrics
I don't know
If we could get lost in a city this size
If we wanted to
And I don't know
If I could survive without seeing you
And every time I see your face
I feel out of place

It's so easy, why are you leaving?
It's just because I've grown afraid of you
I wish we were at the beginning
It would be so good to be with you

See that girl? She's over there
I don't need her, she don't care
I could be one in a million
It would be so good to start again

It's so easy, why are you leaving?
It's just because I've grown afraid of you
I wish we were at the beginning
It would be so good to be with youEmbed
