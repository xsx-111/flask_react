The Patience of a Saint Lyrics
Talking of my attributes
The things I do so well
As anyone who's in cahoots
With me will readily tell
I've lived up here, I've been down there
I've bought so I could sell
And if I drove a faster car
I'd drive it bloody well
How could I change?
I live without restraint

And I would try the patience of a saint
And I would try the patience of a saint

Thinking of my attitudes
Talking one on one
I may disagree with you
But look where you've come from
And all that you've got
I thought that I would faint

But I would try the patience of a saint
And I would try the patience of a saint
I would try the patience of a saint
I'm talking to myself (I'm talking to myself)
Talking to myself
I'm talking to the one that I know best
I'm talking to the one that I know best

Bury me with gratitude
You can go to hell
Why should I care?
I'd rather watch drying paint

But I would try the patience of a saint
And I would try the patience of a saint
I would try the patience of a saint
And I would try the patience
Of a saintEmbed
