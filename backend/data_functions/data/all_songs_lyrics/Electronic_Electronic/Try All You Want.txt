Try All You Want Lyrics
It's the perfect situation
I'm trying hard to understand
You make my life a celebration
And then you never let me down

If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no

You've got me hanging on a string
I find it hard to turn the other cheek
You know it doesn't mean a thing
I could be through with you within a week

It's the perfect situation
I'm trying hard to understand
Is it still infatuation
Between a woman and a man?


There never was a minute on my own
I never felt I needed anyone
It's the perfect situation
I can't hope to understand
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say no
If you want to go, I just can't say noEmbed
