Tighten Up Lyrics
It's never too late I heard you say
How can you turn and go away
I'm staking my claim to some degree
Don't bring the secret home to me
Better to live than to know
Better the noise that we love than hate
Remember the moments we loved
Whenever I feel like I can't escape

There used to be a way but there ain't no more
Tell me why, because we need it
I used to run away but I can't no more
'Cause I feel that I can't beat it
There used to be a way but there ain't no more
There used to be a way but there ain't no more

How can we be free? We both need each other like
Sister and brother you mean that much to me
Better to live than to know
Better the noise that we love than hate
Remember the moments we left
Whenever I feel I can't escape
There used to be a way but there ain't no more
Tell me why, because we need it
I used to run away but I can't no more
'Cause I feel that I can't beat it
There used to be a way but there ain't no more
There used to be a way but there ain't no more


There used to be a way but there ain't no more
Tell me why, because we need it
I used to run away but I can't no more
'Cause I feel that I can't beat it
I'm never gonna do what you want me to
I'm never gonna do what you want me to1Embed
