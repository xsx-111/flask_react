Dame Chance LyricsYesterday I did see
Dame Chance is in the city
I took and a breath and I thought
"Dame Chance is really pretty"
Then I began to look around
What the hell did I found?
Our shadows welcome for love
Hey, what is up there in the tree
Pushing up the bright, bright sun
Pushing up
Pushing up
Pushing up
Yeah I was born with a crystal heart
The crystal mix harder than the stone
Sure enough I will fall
That I, I fall in love again
Pushing up
Pushing up
Pushing up
I gotta find something right
I gotta find something bright
I'll have my honey dance tonight
To welcome, welcome Dame Chance
Pushing up
Pushing up
Pushing up
Pushing up
Gotta find something bright
Yesterday I did see
Dame Chance is in the city
She never get to you if you look so down
No, she never get to you if you look so down
Pushing up
Pushing up
Pushing up
Pushing upEmbed
