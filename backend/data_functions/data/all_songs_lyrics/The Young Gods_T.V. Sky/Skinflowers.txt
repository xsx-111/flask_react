Skinflowers Lyrics
Gimme something skin
Something like an flower
Gimme something warm
Something like forever
Gimme something hard
Something ready to start
Gimme something strong
And i'll sing this song

Gimme something skin
Something like an shelter
Gimme something deep
Something you don't wanna keep
Gimme something love
Something without an glove
Gimme something wrong
And i'll sing this song

One for the skinflowers
Skinflowers
Gimme gimme gimme

What is burning inside
With warmer sun outside
What is burning inside
With warmer sun outside
One for the skinflowers
Skinflowers
I said skinflowers
