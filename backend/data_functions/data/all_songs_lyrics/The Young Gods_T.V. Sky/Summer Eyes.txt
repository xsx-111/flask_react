Summer Eyes LyricsTonight our city plays a sweet melody
You can hear tomorrow driving down the road
One and one are kissing in the air
One and one are free
Run, summer, run
We know where you go
Run, summer, run
You left something behind
I'd like to stay a little longer
If I can fly I wonder why
Eternal summer eyes
Tonight our city plays a sweet melody
I've 
On your eyes
Run, summer, run
We know where you go
Run, summer, run
You left something behind
I'd like to stay a little longer
If I can fly I wonder why
Eternal summer eyes
You might choice
Is this my voice?
I'm too late
You're my queen
My favourite 
I'm too late
Follow the 
Make you mine
I'm too late
Hit the ground
Follow the sound
I'm too late
Say you'll dance
Say you'll trance
I'm too late
Can you read my soul?
Writing on the wall
I'm too late
I can fire
But I can't forget
I can fire
But I can't forget
Hey the animals are 
The animals are 
Hear them calling for food
Calling for food
Hey mister watchman
Tired of watching the birds
Hit the sun every night
Hey mister watchman
Don't turn off the lighthouse
Don't turn off the lighthouse
Big black boat
Coming from the big blue sea
The big black boat is full of birds
Birds from the islands
The island of the thousand skies
Thousand summer eyes
Hey mister watchman
Stop what you 
Every night
Won't you leave us alone?
Won't you leave us alone?
America, America, the flowers need water
The flowers need water
I'm too lateEmbed
