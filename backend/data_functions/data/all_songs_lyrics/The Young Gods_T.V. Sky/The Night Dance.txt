The Night Dance LyricsLet's go see the night dance up there on the hills
Let's go see the night dance before the sky stops burning
Let's go join the night dance down there by the river
Let's dance all the crazy songs, turn on all the stars
And if we fall
We'll fall like her
And if we fall
We'll fall like her
Let's go see the night dance up there on the hills
Let's go see the night dance before the sky stops burning
And if we fall
We'll fall like her
And if we fall
We'll fall like her
Fall!
Two wings for the president
And two wings for the big fish
Let's go see the night trance
Let's go make a mess
Fall!
And if we fall
We'll fall like her
And if we fall
We'll fall like her
Gently in silenceEmbed
