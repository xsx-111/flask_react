I Love a Snot LyricsShaky shaky hands
Shaky shaky legs
Shaky shaky stomach
When I am with you
Shaky shaky thoughts
Each and every one
When I am with you
Run tubby, run to
Tubby tubby butt
Tubby tubby face
Tubby tubby stomach
When I am with you
Icky icky breath
Each and every kiss
When I am with you
Where does it go into?
You're a snot
And I adore you
I love a snot, hey
Rotten rotten luck
Rotting rotting rotting
What am I to do
When I am with you
Run tubby run
Run tubby run
Run tubby run
Run tubby run
You're a snot
And I adore you
I love a snot
You're a snot
And I adore you
I love a snot, hey, heyEmbed
