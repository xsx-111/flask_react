Baby on the Plane LyricsI see your eyes looking at me
Oh yeah, all right, love has started to take
You have given
I have taken a picture
This might not last forever
Your eyes beauty, and tequila
These eyes give this a reason
Baby on the plane
Woman shaking beside her
Oh yeah, your eyes, and tequila
Get me through today
Baby on the plane
The woman next to her was so old
And she was shaking
Why do we go through this
'Cause of the way you look at meEmbed
