We Suck LyricsHe's happy cause i didn't say
What I think anyway
I can't tell him what I think
He's happy 'cause I said you look gorgeous
I wanted to say you suck
Everything, you suck
Everything
He's happy cause he knows he got away with it
He knows my love runs deeper than my feelings
I can't say, I can't tell him what I think
So pretend what I say
Still protecting the boy from the truth
Mr. control you lose, you lose
Why does he call me, I'm so nice on the phone
In a bad fucking way
I suck, dignity, I suck
He's happy in a nice fucking way
He's happy, he sucks
I'm quiet, I suck
He's happy in a nice fucking way
I'm quiet I suck
She's happy in a bad sort of way
They're happy, they suck
So happy, we suckEmbed
