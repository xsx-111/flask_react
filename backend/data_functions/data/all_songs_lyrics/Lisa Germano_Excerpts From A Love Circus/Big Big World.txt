Big Big World LyricsGot a big big heart
A big broken heart
In a big big world
In a dance we smiled
A big big smile
On a big dance floor
Floating floating floating
Floating floating floating
Got a love so huge
A big big love
In a big big cave
Floating floating floating
Floating floating floating
'Cause love flies by
See it flying by
In the big big sky
Floating floating floating
Floating floating floating
With the same old smile
Stuck on my face
All by myself
With a big big heart
Great big love
In the big big world
Big big worldEmbed
