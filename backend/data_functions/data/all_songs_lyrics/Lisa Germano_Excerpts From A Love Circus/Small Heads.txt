Small Heads LyricsDo you ever think of me
When you're through thinking of you
Do you ever think of when we met
Do I ever cross your mind
As you're crossing the street
All the time thoughts of you in your head
The world revolves around you
But it revolves around me too
So how could we see the same one
It's a lonely life
What a lonely life
It's a lonely life
Do you ever want to know
Anything past your face
Do you ever think of other things
Like how about me, wouldn't that be something
All the time, thoughts of me in your head
Oh it's all right
Oh it's just good
We are so selfish together
What a lonely life
It's a lonely life
What a lonely life
Small heads, small heads
Small heads, small heads
How convenient to forget
All the lies that you say
When you're really really drunk
Like me
Did I ever think of you
Did you ever think of me
Probably not, with our heads in the clouds
The world revolves around you
But it revolves around me too
So how could we see the real one
What a lonely life
It's a lonely life
What a lonely life
Small heads, small heads
Small heads, small headsEmbed
