Hope LyricsHope climbs atop of the piano
Reaching out towards the warmth of the sun
Some man tries to ask her down
Well now maybe that's where she belongs
"My god," she said
"I'm a sunflower that wants"
"My god," he said
"This woman is gone"
Into the dark
Is there anybody there?
My god she said (4x)
He climbed up top to find that she was slipping
Let her go, let her go, let her go, let me go
How long must they leave before they're winning?
They don't know, they don't know, they just don't know
"My god," she said
"I'm a sunflower that wants"
"My god," he said
"This woman is gone"
Into the dark
Is there anybody there?
My god she said (5x)
You can't be there
I know it's best that
Nothing is denied
You can't be there
I know it's best that
Everyone changes sides
Into the dark
Is there anybody there?
Into the light
Is there anybody there?
Into the dark
Is there anybody there? no
Into the light, to the light, to the light
My god she said (4x)
My god (4x)
If she can't be there
I know it's best that
Nothing is denied
If she can't be there
I know it's best that
Everyone changes sidesEmbed
