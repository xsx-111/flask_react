Is It Safe? LyricsTime can't fix it fast enough, so we won't
Notice what it was that went wrong, went wrong
I saw something there much too familiar
A butterfly with a broken wing
She's fallen under, she's past the end
Communication is down and down and down
The scars have healed but they're back again
We've got to believe this man must bend
Because if you could you'd try and destroy her
And there we'd be with nothing at all
Is it safe to be a man
When you're tired and lonely?
Only the confident know where to stand
Is it safe to be a man
When the world is loaded?
Thousands can't figure out just what they did
Just what they did
Time can't fix it fast enough, so we won't
Measure just how far below, below
You kept on pushing her
You'll have to pay back all of the years that you stole
She's walking backwards, she's spun around
Her ears are ringing loud and loud and loud
She's on her knees, please understand
It's obvious this man, he must bend
Because if you could you'd try and destroy her
And there we'd be with nothing at all
Is it safe to be a man
When you're tired and lonely?
Only the confident know where to stand
Is it safe to be a man
When the world is loaded?
Thousands can't figure out just what they did
Just what they, just what they did
Is it safe to be a man
When you're tired and lonely?
Only the confident know where to stand
Is it safe to be a man
When the world is loaded?
Thousands can't figure out just what they did
Is it safe to be a man
When you're tired and lonely?
Only the confident know where to stand
Is it safe to be a man
When the world is loaded?
Ten thousand figure out just what they did
Is it safe for my soul?Embed
