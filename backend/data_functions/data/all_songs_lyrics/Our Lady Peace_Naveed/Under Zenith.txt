Under Zenith LyricsMaybe they'll come back again
Maybe they're all gone
One day you'll find me sending
This message strong
Under your feet the city falls
Down so far the ground is sky
We're under zenith again
Oh, it's healthy if not for long
Leave a little room for us to breathe
Much more than seven days
And you've slipped too deep
Much stronger than sympathy
Let your best friend pull back that leash
Sitting by a frozen man
Someone, somewhere, has to cry
We're under zenith again
Let the cycle run we won't die
Leave a little room for us to breathe
I love, love how you let me fall
Under, under, but not too far
I love, love how you let me fall
Only now I see where we are
Hold me, hold me, hold me
Leave a little room for us to breatheEmbed
