Dirty Walls LyricsSo you feel that stain
Dried up discussions without weight, yeah
It's that feeling, oh, that you will not have to destroy
It's that feeling, oh, that you will not have to ignore, ignore
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty
So you've been plagued, is everything okay, boy, but let it go
And I cannot bear the shallow words they throw, yeah
It's that feeling, oh, that you will not have to employ
It's that feeling that you will never
It's got to go, it's got to go
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty
This conversation, going nowhere
It's transparent as fuck, oh
This conversation must be over
'Cause all I see is mud
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
Dirty walls
