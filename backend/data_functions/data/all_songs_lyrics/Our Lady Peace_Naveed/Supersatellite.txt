Supersatellite LyricsI've read the bible, I've read Dylan
And I'm reading people now
Because it's much more chilling
I sit, sit, on a satellite
With the stars made of gold
There's life in this hollow lens
Well I know, know, I know, yeah
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
I watch the traffic
And I find the seeds, oh
And one man in particular
Well he's not what he seems
So I quick, quick
I can't focus in
On the lies in his head
Convinced, oh, that his blood is blue
Well it's red, red, red, yea
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Super yeah
And nothing dazzles me, I am in his dreams
And nothing is shocking, transparent human being
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Super yeah
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Supersatellite
Super, super, super
On the soul inside the world
Far better than the eye inside the mind
Fuck you, I am you, you hear me
Stop crying, stop cryingEmbed
