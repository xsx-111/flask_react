Naveed LyricsCome come naveed
Come come Naveed
Come come save
Are you there, and is it comfortable?
Did you want to escape, try to escape the population?
Sure is deceiving for you particularly
To let a young man die
Let him die if he wants to, die if he wants to
I can't live here anymore
But it's hard when you reach for that floor
There's something that tears me inside
So I can't go
Brother, are you there?
Now tell me, is it wonderful?
Or were you hoping to find, hoping to find
Something a little more?
Counting down the hours
I need to know now
Do the hands of time only rule this chapter?
I'll have to try once again ohh
I'll have to try when I want to
I can't live here anymore
But it's hard when you reach for that floor
There's something that tears me inside
I can't live here anymore
Anymore, anymore
There he's on his knees again
Trying hard to understand
Why Naveed would let a young man die
Convinced that he might break
He reaches for that phone
And another day has gone
And another day has gone
And another day
Has gone(x16)
I can't live here anymore
But it's hard when you reach for that floor
There's something that tears me inside
I can't live here anymore
I can't live here anymore
I can't live here anymore
I can't live here anymore
Anymore
Come, come Naveed
Come, come Naveed
Come, come nowEmbed
