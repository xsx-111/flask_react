Neon Crossing LyricsAll you people can feel it waiting
Innocence and love, wrapped in the arms
Of the burning neon
I feel it, I feel it
It's so entertaining and so wonderful
It magically calls for you
Big neon crossing
And show me the way
Big neon crossing
Save my soul today
Don't you worry and don't be afraid
Does it send you to the world appealing
Where there is spoken word that I can't take
So I'm the liar, I'm the liar
You're so disappointed
To find out that the magic was not
Really meant for you
Big neon crossing
And show me the way
Big neon crossing
Save my soul today
Call the liar
Call the liar
Call the liar
Oh, I can wait
I can be a liar, liar
And I can wait
And I can be the liar, liar, liar
Oh, the liar, liar
Big neon crossing
And show me the way
Big neon crossing
Save my soul today
Big neon crossing
And show me the way
Big neon crossing, oh
And save my soulEmbed
