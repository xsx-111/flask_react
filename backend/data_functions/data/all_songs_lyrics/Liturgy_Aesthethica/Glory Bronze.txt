Glory Bronze LyricsGashed shoulders and crippled loins
Huge steampunk boulders
Nestling between cargo khaki knees
Magenta flush across your cheek
Eyes on the horizon
On the oasis siren
On pairs of Tits
Helicopter of vultures
Tornado senselessly a'whirl
You diagonalize
You tear the continents apart
And plunge into the gulf
And flush your eyes with crime
And hoard up all the rubles
Glory bronze
Glory bronze
Along
As the blood of God
Bursts the veins of time
Give your avatar a kiss
An abyss spits out another abyssEmbed
