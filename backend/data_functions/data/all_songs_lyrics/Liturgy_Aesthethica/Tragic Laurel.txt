Tragic Laurel LyricsThe hero's statue drips with stones
Parched dried up like his bones
The tragic laurel goes
To the temples
As their doors come to a close
The lava blows
Vesuvius blushes
Underneath his clothes
The tragic laurel goes
With the torso
Locked in contrappasto pose
The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goes
The tragic laurel goesEmbed
