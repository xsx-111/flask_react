True Will LyricsFloating upwards
Lungs filling up with air
As God inhales me
Into the impossible
I wave a sad goodbye
To each newly conquered territory
Nomad hearth
Consuming its own home
The glow of warm joy
Leaving dry form
Carcass ashes
True will
Green life scraped from copper vaults
Silver pins in crippled cartilage
Ballooning substrate of eternity
Without reason's diamond
Without imagination
True will
Inhalation
Magnet charger
Lightning blaze
Everything that ever was
Slightly changes
Green life scraped from copper vaults
Silver pins in crippled cartilage
Ballooning substrate of eternity
Without reason's diamondEmbed
