Red Crown LyricsRub the red crown
Tie the knot of veins
Red crown
White collar
Golden tooth
Hang the chandelier of bones
Rub the red crown
Wear a purple robe of meat
A sparrow flits his feather
Like a chain of bubbles
Soaking in heat
Fucking in an orgy
Of primordial undecidability
From chaos to the brain
I am an army of pulses
My hard skin is a flute
My brawn is a catapult
Rub the red crown
Tie the knot of veins
Rub the red crown
Hang the chandelier of bones1Embed
