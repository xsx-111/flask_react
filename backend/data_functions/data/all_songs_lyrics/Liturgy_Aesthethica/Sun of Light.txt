Sun of Light LyricsGood genius
Offering itself in flickers
Everywhere fragile flashes
Wormholes into an unconceived future
Sun of Sun of Sun
Sun of Sun of Sun
Beads of acid
Bedfeathers flying
Through dried up gashes of air
Indices of the moment
When nature's necklace was clipped
And her pearls sprayed everywhere
Sun of Sun of SunEmbed
