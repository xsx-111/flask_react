Returner LyricsReturner
Bursting universal
Violation of the law
Renamer
God destroyer of a God
Returner
Violation of the law
Plant toxic bombs in marble tombs
Redeemer
Stream the universal us
Through optical ISP transmission lines
Crack my fathers' spines
And sail me to Chimera
Lay down a long leg
And elegant toe
And let me buckle your sandalEmbed
