Harmonia LyricsHurry weave me an old crystal web
Spheres of glass fight with axes of lead
Orbs of eyes hands of fathers of eggs
Hearts of shitwire hangers of heads
Chase of fortunes chafing red thighs
Caustic scales female justice averred
Hum together O little angels
Little bees crying in mirrors of wax
Hum together sections of agriculture
Hum together battlers of valor
Twang together frothing with reveined eyes
Glossolaliac little Jews harps
Wagging tongues dance with throats of raw ululation
Drip from jowls ye hot drops of prey
Harmonia
Hum O bothered web
Pull the hinges out from under your door frames
Puff an honest cough from your chest
Bend gymnastic O supple children
Shear the wool from your innocent flesh
Harmonia
Throb with sex O heartless web
Hurry weave me an old crystal web
Spheres of glass fight with axes of lead
Orbs of eyes hands of fathers of eggs
Hearts of shitwire hangers of heads
Chase of fortune chafing red thighs
Mounted hips wrinkled old drippy eyesEmbed
