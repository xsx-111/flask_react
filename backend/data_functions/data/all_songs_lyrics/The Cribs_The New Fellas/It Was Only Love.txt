It Was Only Love LyricsWhy don't we take a walk?
You know there's no one to tell us no
Because you can't regret something that you'll forget
And that's the beauty
I like you because you're strange
But you say that you need to change
But if I dress you like me, then you'll still never be
More than your bus fare to me
Why must you have to?
You know I never wanted anything more
I must forgive you
It was only love
But I never tried to
You must have known I never wanted anything more
I misunderstood you
It was only love
Do you remember when we were teens?
We were studying the same things
I'm sorry that you were wrong and that you never moved on
It's good to never belong
On your soapbox you feel so tall
But no one hears so that don't mean much at all
You mean nothing to me, home town jealousy
You're just a formality
Why did you have to?
You must never have known I never wanted anything more
And I never miss you
I thought it was only love
But don't ever call me
Don't ever call me baby
'Cos I won't be friendly
It was only love2Embed
