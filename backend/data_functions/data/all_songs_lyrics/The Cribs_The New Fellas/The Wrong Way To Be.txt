The Wrong Way To Be LyricsBecause a guy I used to know
Is returning now to show
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
I guess we were never going to be friends
I've never really liked people that are too right on
Mind you, I'd love to turn my back on everything I've preached for years
I bet that's a right laugh
Because a guy I used to know
Is returning now to show
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
And no you can't come back to mine
Because I know that you will find
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
You were funny the other night
You were just name dropping
Talking about scene hopping
Dreaming of chart topping
I remember, just before I walked away
Wondering to myself -
How someone that lives so much of their lives through other people
Could possibly have so much to say
Because a guy I used to know
Is returning now to show
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
And no you can't come back to mine
Because I know that you will find
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
You know, your scene has got a lot to answer for
Like all these clued up arseholes
Trying to set us and Wakefield at war
You know it's not right but it's something you like
Because a guy I used to know
Is returning now to show
That the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on me
And no you can't come back to mine
But you will always blow my mind
Yeah the wrong way to be
Is rubbing off on meEmbed
