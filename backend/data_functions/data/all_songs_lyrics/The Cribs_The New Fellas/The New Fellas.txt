The New Fellas LyricsWhat's the point in compromise?
Get your dignity and leave
Don't be too abstract though
'Cos I need a signal like you won't believe
You were always late but you always had a story
But that's not over, wait!
You hardly even saw me
You would always say you're a different kind of boring
Did I say that? No way
You hardly even saw me
People know the stories
And that we were in between
But I feel you need to know that
That I am so sorry now, my queen
You were always late but you always had a story
But that's not over, wait!
You hardly even saw me
You would always say you're a different kind of boring
Did I say that? No way
You hardly even saw me
Thought we had a meeting
I missed what we're discussing
Someone said it's meaning
To me it means nothingEmbed
