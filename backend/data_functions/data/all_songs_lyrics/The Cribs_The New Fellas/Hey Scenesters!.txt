Hey Scenesters! LyricsHey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
You lot are in trouble now
Someone's gonna cop it now
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Everybody's happy now
Nobody ain't laughing now
She was the glamourous type
There were times when you'd never have guessed it
Did you see her clothes?
Everyone said she looked like a mess, yeah
OK, alright (you think you're a leader)
About last night (well we won't ever believe you)
I was feeling strange (one last fling)
Slightly ashamed (we're nothing, it's alright we're leaving)
Casual looks (when we were steaming)
Have said enough (we're nothing, it's alright we're leaving)
It's different scenes
Different scenes
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
You lot are in trouble now
Someone's gonna cop it now
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Everybody's happy now
Nobody ain't laughing now
Did you see his clothes?
Everyone said he looked like a mess, yeah
OK, alright (you think you're a leader)
About last night (well we won't ever believe you)
I was feeling strange (one last fling)
Slightly ashamed (we're nothing, it's alright we're leaving)
Casual looks (when we were steaming)
Have said enough (we're nothing, it's alright we're leaving)
You're changing scenes
Change your scenes
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
Hey scenesters, hey hey scenesters
You lot are in trouble now
Someone's gonna cop it now
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Hey darling, hey hey darling
Everybody loves you now
Just don't go and let us downEmbed
