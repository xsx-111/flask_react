Hello? Oh... LyricsWith your knife and your bottle and your silver spoon
No one knows what you're gonna do
So stay away from everything that isn't true
'Cos when I hung around with someone else
Take your anger off the shelf
And arrange it in a way that no one else could do
But you
'Cos if you're dying I'd like to know
And if you're on one I need to show
'Cos you were saying you was alone
Well there's something you need to know
I'm sixteen and I'm really bored
"But we're not going to use you we're
Just scared we're gonna lose you"
Things are better when you are on board
I'm sure
But if you're dying I'd like to know
And if you're on one I need to show
'Cos you were saying you was alone
Well there's something you need to know
That you will always be my hero
With the way that you're letting go
And you were saying you was alone
Well there's something you need to knowEmbed
