Haunted LyricsNow I'm haunted by dreams of you
And all of the things that we've been through
I'm sorry is nothing new
I'm haunted by dreams of you
'Cos you was on our road
The day we were told
That you are not coming home
I'm haunted by dreams of you
I'm haunted by dreams of you
'Cos we was on the road
The day we were told
That you are not coming home
Now I'm haunted by dreams of you
I'm haunted by dreams of you
But I'd had a drink, it's not what you think
You mis-read what I said, and left me for dead
And you was on our road
The day we were told
That you are not coming homeEmbed
