Mirror Kissers LyricsYou aren't allowed to say that you're better
You aren't allowed to say that 'cos you're the hipster type
You've got a lot to say but don't mention
The mirror kissing ways of the hipster type
You aren't allowed to say anything
We kicked around down water lane
But you're not all there
You aren't allowed to say anything
You left me on the street, talking to drains
'Cos you're not all there
You aren't allowed to say that you're better
You aren't allowed to say that 'cos you're the hipster type
You've got a lot to say but don't mention
The mirror kissing ways of the hipster type
You like to tell yourself that I'm nobody
I think you must have known I'd make you sorry1Embed
