True Blue Lyrics
Never been a millionaire
And I tell you, mama, I don't care
Never gonna own a race-horse
Or a fast back mid-engine Porsche
Don't think I'll own a private jet
On the Stock Exchange, I'm no threat
So won't you help me make up my mind?
Don't you think I'd better get myself back home?
Oh yeah

Sitting in the moonlight glow
Excuse me if my feelings show
Watching all the trucks roll by
Dreaming up an alibi
You see, back home I'm considered the fool
But maybe they're right, I don't know
So can't you help make up my mind?
Don't you think I'd better get myself back home?
Who cares

Daddy says he'll buy me a car
To drive just as far as I need
He wants me back at any expense
He's got a lot more money than sense
Funny but now that I'm gone
They all wanna be concerned
Oh please, can you make up my mind?
Don't you think I'd better get myself back home?
Just don't know what to do, aw yeah
Maybe I'll walk, maybe I'll ride, maybe I'll never ever decide
Ow

Get out the way
I gotta get on home, woo!
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I gotta get home as soon as I can, yeah
Gotta get home as soon as I can
Gotta get home as soon as I can, wooEmbed
