Italian Girls Lyrics
I've got two and more to show
I was dreaming of a mobile
That couldn't be mine not without lyin'
Was I feeling kind a silly
When I stepped in soakin' beer down the cola machine?
Oh, stayin' 17
Well she claimed she was a killer
And she owned a floodlit villa
A little aways from the main highway
Oh, take me way down yonder, woo

She was tall, thin and tarty
And she drove a Maserati
Faster than sound
I was heaven bound
Although I must have looked a creep
In my army surplus jeep
Was I being too bold
Before the night could get old?
No, no, no, no
She proved me so wrong

Oh the Italian girls sometimes hold their religious habits
In front of your eyes, just to get you tied
Ah, but not my little Bella 'cause I did not have to tell her
That I'd be gone, with the morning sun
She made me so tired, woo
She took me way, way, away down yonder, woo
'Til I was gone with the morning sun on my back, woo
Gotta get on back there soon as I can
Take me there
And I miss the girl so bad
Oh yeah, wait a minute
She broke my heart, she broke my heart, she broke my heart, woo
Gotta get on back there soon as I can
I miss the girl, I miss the girl, I miss the girl so bad
I was a lot better offEmbed
