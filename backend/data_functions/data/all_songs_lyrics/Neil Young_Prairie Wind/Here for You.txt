Here for You Lyrics
When your summer days come tumbling down
And you find yourself alone
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and i'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you

Yes i'd miss you
But i never want to hold you down
You might say i'm here for you

When the winter comes to your new home
And snowflakes are falling down
Then you can come back and be with me
Just close your eyes and i'll be there
Listen to the sound
Of this old heart beating for you


In the spring, protective arms surrounding you
In the fall, we let you go your way
Happiness i know will always find you
And when it does, i hope that it will stay
