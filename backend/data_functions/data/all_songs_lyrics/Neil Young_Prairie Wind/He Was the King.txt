He Was the King Lyrics
The last time I saw Elvis
He was shooting at a colour TV
The phones were ringing in the pink motel
And the rest is history
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
He was singing a gospel song
You could tell he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
He was up on the silver screen
Pushing a plough in a black and white movie
And everybody started to scream
Yes, he was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
It was some kind of Vegas dream
Spotlights flashed on a silver cape
And a blue-haired lady screamed
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
He was fronting a three-piece band
Rocking on the back of a flatbed truck
With an old guitar in his hand
He was the king
The last time I saw Elvis
The last time I saw Elvis
He was riding in a Pink Cadillac
Wind was blowing through his hair
And he never did look back
He was the king
He was the king
Thank you very much
The last time I saw Elvis
He was singing that gospel song
You could tell that he had the feeling
And the whole world sang along
He was the king
He was the king
He was the king
He was the king
He was the king
He was the king
He was the kingEmbed
