Far from Home Lyrics
When i was a growing boy
A-rocking on my daddy's knee
Daddy took an old guitar and sang
Bury me on the lone prairie
Uncle bob sat at the piano
My girl cousins sang harmony
Those were the good old family times
That left a big mark on me

Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
Where the canada geese once filled the sky
And then i won't be far from home
Bury me out on the prairie
Where the buffalo used to roam
You won't have to shed a tear for me
Because then i won't be far from home

Walking down the trans-canada highway
I was talking to a firefly
Trying to make my way to nashville, tennessee
When another car passed me by
Some day i'm gonna make big money
And buy myself a big old car
Make my way on down to that promised land
And then i'm gonna really go far
