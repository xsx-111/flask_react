Reverse Running Lyrics
I’m reverse running
It doesn’t mean anything
Hurling headlong
Why would you even ask?
I’ve forgotten who I am
Snakes uncoiling
Pressed up to the glass
All the things that you shouldn’t ask
But you see through me

It doesn’t mean anything
A meaningless plaything
Reverse running
Running contrary-ways
Pulling off the anyways

I’m messing up
Messing up the balance
Breaking my trajectory
All the toys in the factory
While you all lie down
While you all lie down
I’m skipping back through the tapes
Skipping through the ad breaks
God in heaven!
It makes me feel energized!
All else is sanitized
And with such joy
Running contrary-ways
Pulling off the anyways
I jump back around

You don’t talk about me, you don’t talk about me
You don’t talk about me, you don’t talk about me
You don’t talk about me, you don’t talk about me
You don’t talk about me, you don’t talk about me
You don’t talk about me, you don’t talk about me

I’m reversing
I’m reverse running
I fall under the horses feet
All the things that I shouldn’t see
Animal or Bird
Animal or Bird
Moving in slow motion
This shit is gonna mess me up
