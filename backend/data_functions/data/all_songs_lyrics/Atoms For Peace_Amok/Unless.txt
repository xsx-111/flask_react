Unless Lyrics
Care less
I couldn't care less
Care less
I couldn't care less
Care less
I couldn't care less
Such a mess
I know it's useless
I couldn't care less
Care less
I couldn't care less

While my heart keeps returning
I am lost
I am weightless
With my arms by my side
I am hope
I can break this
I am rust
I am waiting
I am here
I am weightless
I am rust
Rust
Rust
Rust
Rust
Care less
I couldn't care less
Care less
I know it's useless
I couldn't care less
Care less
I know it's useless
Care less
Care less
I know it's you again
Couldn't care less2Embed
