Amok Lyrics
A penny for your thoughts my love
A penny for your thoughts my love
A swinging door
A swinging door
A penny for your thoughts
They try to jump me
They try to jump me
A penny for your thoughts my love
A penny for your thoughts my love
They’re spaghetti
They’re spaghetti
They possess me
They possess me
They possess me
I’m trying to be a thought killer
I’m trying to be a thought killer
But they come back to bite me
Come back to bite me
A penny for your thoughts
A penny for your
A penny for your thoughts my love
They court disaster
They court disaster
I’m trying to be a thought killer
A penny for your thoughts my love
A penny for your thoughts
You’ll forget me
I’m sending out choirs of angels
You’ll forget me
I’m trying to be a thought killer
Tying round pieces of string
A penny for your thoughts
Pieces of string, oooh, oooh,  oooh
To run amok, run amok, run amok
They distract me
A penny for your thoughts my love
To run amok
I’m sending out choirs of angels
Tying round pieces of string
A penny for your thoughts
Pieces of string, oooh, oooh,  oooh
A penny for your thoughts
They possess me
To run amok, run amok, run amok
They possess me
To run amok
You got me, you got me, you got me, you got me
Back to bite me, back to bite me, back to bite me
To run amok, run amok, run amok
Penny for your thoughts
To run amok
A penny for your thoughts my love2Embed
