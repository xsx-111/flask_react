Ingenue Lyrics
You know like the back of your hand
Who let em in
You got me into this mess so
You get me out
You know like the back of your hand
Your bell jar
Your collection
Ingenue
You got me into this mess
Fools rushing in, yeah
And they know it

The seeds of the dandelion you blow away
In good time, I hope, I pray
If I'm not there now physically
I'm always before you
Come what may

And you know it
Fools rushing in
Yeah
Well you know it
Who let them in?
Yeah
Well you know it
Gone with a touch of your hand
Gone with a touch of your hand
Move through the moment
Though it betrays
Transformations
Jackals and flames
If I knew now
What I knew then
Just give me more time
I hope and pray
I mistake all you say
The seeds of the dandelion you blow away12Embed
