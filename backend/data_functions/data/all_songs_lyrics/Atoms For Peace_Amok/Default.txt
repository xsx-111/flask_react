Default Lyrics
It slipped my mind
And for a time
I felt completely free
A world of trouble
Silent double
A pawn unto a queen

I laugh now
But later's not so easy
I've gotta stop
The will is strong
But the flesh is weak
I guess that's it
I've made my bed
And I lie in it

I'm still hanging on
Bird upon a wire
I fall between the waves
Ooooohhhhhhh
I avoid your gaze
I turn out of phase
A pawn unto a queen
Ooooohhhhhhh
I laugh now
But later's not so easy
I've gotta stop
The will is strong
But the flesh is weak
I guess that's it
I've made my bed
And I lie in it

But it's eating me up
It's eating me up
It's eating me up (If I get free of all my snares and my nets)
It's eating me up (If I get free of all my snares and my nets)
It's eating me up (If I get free of all my snares and my nets)
Ooooohhhhhhh10Embed
