Judge, Jury and Executioner Lyrics
Don’t worry, baby
It goes right through me
I’m like the wind and my anger will disperse
Thin persecutors
Thin twisted vespers
A haunted reptile that has crawled upon the earth

I went for my usual walk
I tell it like it is
Tell it like it was
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury

And darkness follows
No tomorrows
It’s all been decided
All spiced and scented
All bouncing voices down the echo chamber
If you come to me tonight
I'll be yours for good

I went for my usual walk
I went around the block
I just can’t talk or reason with my executioner
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury
Thin waist betrayers
Who talk in layers

I went for my usual walk
I tell it like it is
Tell it like it was
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury

Don’t worry, baby
It goes right through me
I’m like the wind and my anger will disperse3Embed
