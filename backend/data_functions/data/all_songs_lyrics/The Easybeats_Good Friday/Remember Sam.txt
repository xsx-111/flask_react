Remember Sam Lyrics
Remember Sam
You took his hand
You took his hand instead of mine

Remember Mike, huh?
A guy I like
Who took inside instead of me

But when I get around to ask you
You turn around, you smile and say
You say:

"Little man
Do understand
I'd really like to but I'm busy"

Call me any Monday
Busy every Tuesday
Maybe on a Friday
No...
But now I see
You're foolin' me
You only want someone with money

So little girl
I've had my fill
So if you want me, you can call me

Call me any Monday
Busy every Tuesday
Maybe on a Friday
No...Embed
