Do You Have a Soul Lyrics
Ow, ow
Coockoo, coockoo, coockoo, coocko, coockoo, coockoo, coockoo Cko, cko, cko, cko, cko!
Ahaha

With all my friends we hang around
The back streets here in my home town
Because I got no money and I look real poor
It doesn't mean to say that you can close your doors

(Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay)
Anybody here please tell me, what to do?
(Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay)
I see the world and my mind don't like the view
(Ooooooooooooh)

Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?
Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?
(Doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo)
You look real good in your white Rolls Royce
And you have a million pounds worth of playing toys
You're usin' all those people like you use the phone
The figures of your brother like a thing you own

(Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay)
Anybody here please tell me, what to do?
(Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay)
I see the world but my mind don't like the view
(Ooooooooooooh)

Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?
Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?
(Doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo doodododo)

Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?
Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?
Hey!

Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?
Do you have a heart? Do you have a soul?
Do you have a love that never grows old?Embed
