Made My Bed, Gonna Lie in It Lyrics
Tried so hard to be a man, a man, a man

I made my bed, now I've gotta lie in it
Seems instead like I'm gonna die in it

Where did I go wrong?
I tried so hard to see, I tried so hard to be
A man, a man, a man

You see my face, me I really don't mind it
They all laugh, but I didn't design it

When did I go wrong?
I tried so hard to see, I tried so hard to be
A man, a man, a man

Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it
Ooh, aha ha ha, ha ha
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it
Ooh, aha ha ha, ha ha
I didn't know my ma, didn't see my pa
How can you understand when you, the son, have no man?
Have no man

Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it
Na, na na na na na, na na
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in it
Na, na na na na na, na na
Made my bed, now I'm gonna lie in itEmbed
