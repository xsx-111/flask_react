Happy Is the Man LyricsEverybody says I'm bad
For what I've done and what I've had
I don't mind about what they say
They will see some other day
They say I've been sinnin'
'Cause I like good lookin' women
They don't know what it means to be alive
They wouldn't miss and wouldn't love
(Na na na na na na na na)
Have no time to chance and turn
(Na na na na na na na na)
Now they're stuck and in a rot
(Na na na na na na na na)
So they don't till I've been shot
(Na na na na na na na na)
Don't you tell me nothin'
'Cause I know enough guffin'
Yes, I know how to be a happy man
Happy is the man who has a lovely girl
'Cause she makes him feel like he owns the world
Aaah, Aaah, Aaah, Aaah
Well, she makes him feel man
(She makes him feel man)
And she gives him a soul
(She gives him a soul)
She makes him feel high
(She makes him feel high)
Like ten feet tall
I am happy with the world
(Na na na na na na na na)
Death to me is a funny word
(Na na na na na na na na)
I like life and what it brings
(Na na na na na na na na)
The rain, the sun, the child that sings
(Na na na na na na na na)
They say I've been sinnin'
'Cause I like good lookin' women
Yes, I know what it means to be alive
Happy is the man who has a lovely girl
'Cause she makes him feel like he owns the world
Happy is the man who loved a lot of love and he likes it
Happy is the man who gets above his back and he takes it
And happy is the child who wants a brand new toy and he gets it
(La-la-la-la-la-la, happy is the man, la-la-la-la-la)
And happy is the dog who finds another treat in the closet
(La-la-la-la-la-la, happy is the man, la-la-la-la-la)
And happy is the girl I gave my love to when she took it
(La-la-la-la-la-la, happy is the man, la-la-la-la-la)
And happy is the man who wants the most of life and he gets it...
(La-la-la-la-la-la, happy is the man, la-la-la-la-la)...Embed
