You Me, We Love Lyrics
There was an old man
Who lived by the sea
Who said: "Son, you've fallen in love"
He could tell by the way
I sang every day
And he knew I'd fallen in love

Fallen in love (hmhm-hm-hmhmmm)
Fallen in love (hmhm-hm-hmhmmm)
Fallen in love (hmhm-hm-hmhmmm)

(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)
You me, we love
(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)

But if he knew
Of the life I go through
Feeling pain, losing sleep
For a-wantin' you
He would take me aside
Saying "Son, where's your pride?"
But then I close my eyes and I see you, and I see you
(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)
You me, we love
(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)

You make me sigh
With that look in your eye
Just the move of your hand
Makes me feel so high
But you play, I obey
I should leave, go my way
But then I close my eyes and I see you, and I see you

There was an old man
Who lived by the sea
Who said: "Son, you've fallen in love"
He could tell by the way (Ooo-ooo-ooo)
I sang every day
And he knew I'd fallen in love

Fallen in love (a-aa-ahaa-aa)
Fallen in love (a-aa-ahaa-aa)
Fallen in love (a-aa-ahaa-aaaa)

(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)
You me, we love
(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)

(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)
You me, we love
(Na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-naaa)
