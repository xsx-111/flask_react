Saturday Night Lyrics
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

And as I stood there on the corner of the street
(Myah, yah, myaaah)
And there before me passed this lovely pair of feet
(Myah, yah, myaaah)
My eyes went dim, inside my head my mind it swum
'Cause as she walked on by, the pavement saw

Everybody sing
Da na na na, da na na na na, na da da (hey, hey!)
And again
Da na na na, da na na na na, na da da da

Saturday night and I had nothing to do
Everythin' seems so wrong
Saturday night, now I've got somethin' to do
'Cause she came and proved me wrong

I walked on up to her and asked her for her name
(Myah, yah, myaaah)
She gave me look that made me feel it was in vain
(Myah, yah, myaaah)
But when she spoke, she spoke with longin' in her voice
(Oooaah)
And when she took my arm, she made her choice
Her choice was
Da na na na, da na na na na, na da da (hey, hey!)
Let me hear it again
Da na na na, da na na na na, na da da da

Saturday night and I had nothing to do
Everythin' seems so wrong
Saturday night, now I've got somethin' to do
'Cause she came and proved me wrong
Da na na na, na da na na, na da da
There it goes again
Da na na na, na da na na, na da da
Let me hear it some more
Da na na na, da na na na na, na da da
There's that sound
Yeah
There it goes again
Yeah
Even in my dreams
Yeah
It might stop, it seems
Da na na na, na da na na na, na da da
Damn, get it out of my mind!
Da na na na, da na na na na, na da da
Why don't it stop?!
Da na na na, da na na na na, na da da...Embed
