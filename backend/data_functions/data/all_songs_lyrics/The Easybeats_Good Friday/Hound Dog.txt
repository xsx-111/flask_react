Hound Dog Lyrics
Hey
Whoa!

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine

They said you were high-classed
That was just a lie
Baby, baby, you're a high class
Well that's just a lie
Well, you never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine


You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine
Whoah!

Well they said you was high-classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, they said you were high-classed
Well, that's just a lie
Well, you never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you never caught a rabbit you ain't no friend of mine

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine
Yeah, yeah!
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You're nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mineEmbed
