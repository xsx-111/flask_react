River Deep, Mountain High LyricsWhen I was a little boy
I had a rag doll
The only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
M'only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger, in every way
And it gets deeper, let me stay
And it gets higher, day by day
Oh do I love you my oh my
Yeh river deep mountain high, yeh, yeh, yeh
If I lost you would I cry
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby
When you were a young girl
Did you have a puppy
Did it follow you around
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No I'll never let you down
'Cause it grows so long, like a river flows
And it gets bigger baby, heaven knows
And it gets stronger baby, as it grows
Oh do I love you my oh my
Yeh river deep, mountain high, yeh, yeh, yeh
Do I love you, will I die
Oh how I love you baby, baby, baby
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring
And I love you baby like a robin loves to sing
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pie
And I love you baby, river deep mountain high
Oh you got to
Oh do I love you my oh my
Yeh river deep, mountain high, yeh, yeh, yeh
Do I love you 'til I die
Oh do I love you baby, baby, baby
And again
And againEmbed
