Pretty Girl Lyrics
Pretty girl
Walks up and down the street
Pretty girl
Kind of girl I'd like to meet
She don't even know my name
Shame
But I wouldn't be right just to walk up to her
And I wouldn't feel right just to stand back while a

Pretty girl
Walks up and down the street
Pretty girl
Kind of girl I'd like to meet
She don't even know my name
Shame

(She's got big blue eyes and long blonde hair)
Girl, I'll find a way to wake her
(The kind of girl that makes you feel you're walkin' on air)
Never look at me
(She's got big blue eyes and long blonde hair)
Girl, I'll find a way to ask her
(The kind of girl that everybody stops and stares)
Would you walk with me?
Wouldn't she?
Wouldn't she?
Wouldn't she?
Yeah...

Pretty girl
Won't you make time with me
Pretty girl
Walk out of sight with me
I don't even know your name
Jane

(She's got big blue eyes and long blonde hair)
Girl, I'd like to go a-dancin'
(The kind of girl that makes you think you're walkin' on air)
With a girl like you
(She's got big blue eyes and long blonde hair)
Girl, won't you take a chance on
(The kind of girl that everybody stops and stares)
With a boy like me

Asking you
Want you to
Say you do
Yeah...
Pretty girl (Pretty girl-pretty girl)
Pretty girl (Pretty girl-pretty girl)
Pretty girl (Pretty girl-pretty girl)
Pretty girl (Pretty girl-pretty girl)
Pretty girl (Pretty girl-pretty girl)...Embed
