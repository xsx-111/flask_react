Protovision (Red Sky Mix) Lyrics
There's a red sky every morning when I wake up with you
They say red skies come as a warning I don't know what to do

I wanna be in love with you, but I can't
I wonder what Jes√∫s would do, I'm no saint
When I think about falling for you, I feel faint
I think about calling the truce, but I ain't
No restraints, no complaints
When I lay it down, no planks
No titles, no thanks
Just hot sex, and cold drinks
We roll dank, watch the stars do they 1 2
She know I got a girl, she got one too
She just having fun, I'm having fun too
We try and get together every month or two
Smoke a blunt or two, hotel motel
I fuck with you cause you don't tell, won't tell
Yeah red sky at the night, we delight
Red sky in the morning is a warning

There's a red sky every morning when I wake up with you
They say red skies come as a warning I don't know if it's true
There's a red sky every morning when I wake up with you
They say red skies come as a warning I don't know what to do
She said I wanna be in love with you, but I can't
She said I got love for you, but this ain't
I'm just passing time instead of watching paint
Dry on walls in my memory banks
And we make love, we don't think
And we wake up, and we see pink
A hint of crimson, the tide is rising
We don't heed the warning beyond horizon
Devise a plan so we can do it again
We would do it forever, that's if forevers don't end
Never again, never again
Neither one of us can say that never again
And maybe I miss you, but maybe you miss me
Or maybe you don't at all, maybe it's just me
Who sees red skies in the morning
Who takes red skies as a warning
And maybe it's red hot, maybe I'm still hot
But something's still telling me that this don't feel right


You know that old saying goes
Red sky at night, sailor's delight
Red sky in the morning, sailor's warning
I hope it doesn't apply to lovers
They say red skies come as a warning, I don't know what to do...Embed
