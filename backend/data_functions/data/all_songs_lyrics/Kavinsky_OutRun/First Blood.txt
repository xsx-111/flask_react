First Blood Lyrics"Let's go!"
Heads alight 'n' it strikes your weather, start the fight
You're shiftin' gears, you're punishing, you step through the night
I know you!
I know you!
Heaven! There's a thunder deep inside of you
It makes you think it's all a dream, it cannot be true
Wheelin' hell!
Wheelin' hell!
Just call me, I'm alone!
Just call me, I'm alone!
His time no one will do
They can break your heart again
Open my love and now my desire
I see you think that is not real but I'm still alive
I know you!
I know you!
Itchin' when the power comes from deep within
I never ran a story that will never begin
Wheelin' hell!
Wheelin' hell!
Just call me, I'm alone!
Just call me, I'm alone!
His time no one will do
They can break your heart again
"That's enough."1Embed
