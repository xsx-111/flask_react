Prelude LyricsThe year was 1986
He was a teenager like any other
Dreaming of his heroes and in love with a girl
But on a thunderous night along a ragged coast
A mysterious red car came to him
Its power lighting his eyes blood-red
In a flash all was lost in the hellfire of twisted metal
When our hero emerged from the burning wreckage
He and the car had become one, their souls spliced forever
Leaving him to wander the night alone
Invisible to everyone but herEmbed
