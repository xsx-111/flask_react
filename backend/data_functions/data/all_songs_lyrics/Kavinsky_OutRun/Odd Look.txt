Odd Look Lyrics
You are the snake, get around me
And it came with rain
Never seen what raining

So I just could lead the way
There’s nowhere to ride around me
No one around, it’s amazing
Elevating as it seems to you
But no, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when it’s raining?
You were mine

So I’m with you baby
You were to put it else yeah baby
You were right, you made it
You were alright
So I’m with you baby
You were more, I seen no more
You were right to enslave me
I think you would’ve made it
So I just could lead the way
There’s nowhere to ride around me
No one around, it’s amazing
Elevating as it seems to you
But no, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when it’s raining?
You were mine


So I just could lead the way
There’s nowhere to ride around me
No one around, it’s amazing
Elevating as it seems to you
But no, never mind
Never come out
Where to ride when it’s raining?
You were mine3Embed
