Endless LyricsThey say a flap of a butterfly’s wing can do your fate
That the road sometimes takes back what it had given
But true love never dies
And now you know how the legend of the dead cruiser was born
But what you don’t know
Is there’s a gap between living and dying
Some say they’ve seen the dead cruiser in a flash of lightning around the shadowy curves of the highway
Some say he was just a kid who met his fate in a fiery crash
But anyone fool enough to venture out onto to that treacherous road should know one thing
There’s no turning backEmbed
