Doctor Robert Lyrics
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there any time at all
Doctor Robert

Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

If you're down he'll pick you up
Doctor Robert
Take a drink from his special cup
Doctor Robert

Doctor Robert
He's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like
Doctor Robert
Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

My friend works for the National Health
Doctor Robert
You'll pay money just to see yourself
With Doctor Robert

Doctor Robert
You're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can
Doctor Robert

Well, well, well, you're feeling fine
Well, well, well, he'll make you
Doctor Robert

Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
Ring, my friend I said you'd call
Doctor Robert
