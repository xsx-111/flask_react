Like a Baby Lyrics
You gave me love to enjoy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
No matter what you would do
I depended on you like a baby
One thing I know I love you
Yes, I loved you like a baby
It was a fool's heart you took
And I fell 'cause you look like a baby
To lovers' ways, I was blind
'Cause I just had a mind like a baby
You're just a flirt
And I had to be hurt just like a baby
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I need you so, I need you so
The day I found how you lied
Then I broke down and cried like a baby
Well, it was then I could see
You were playing with me like a baby
Well, you can bet that someday
I'll forget just like a babyEmbed
