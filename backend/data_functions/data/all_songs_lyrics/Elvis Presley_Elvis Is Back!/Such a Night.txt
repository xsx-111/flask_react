Such a Night Lyrics
It was a night, ooh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
The moon was bright, oh, how bright
It was, it really was such a night
The night was alight with stars above
Ooh, when she kissed me, I had to fall in love

Oh, it was a kiss, ooh, what a kiss
It was, it really was such a kiss
Oh, how she could kiss, oh, what a kiss
It was, it really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips sets me afire
I reminisce and I'm filled with desire

But I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember

Oh, what a night, ooh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and her love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget the kiss, the kiss in the moonlight
Ooh, such a kiss, such a night
It was a night, ooh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and her love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget the kiss, the kiss in the moonlight
How well I remember, I'll always remember

That night, ooh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
When we kissed, I had to fall in love

But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember

Oh, that night, ooh, what a night
It was, it really was such a night
When we kissed, I had to fall in love

Well, she's gone, gone, gone
Yes, she's gone, gone, gone
Came the dawn, dawn, dawn
And my love was gone
But before that dawn
Yes, before that dawn
And before that dawn
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah
Such a nightEmbed
