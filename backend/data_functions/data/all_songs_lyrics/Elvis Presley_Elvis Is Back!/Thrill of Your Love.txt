Thrill of Your Love Lyrics
I have wished for the wealth of a great millionaire
I have reached for a bright star above
But the thrill of it all, to me, seems so small
When compared to the thrill of your love

I'd rather give everything that I own in this world
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give for your love

I'd rather give everything that I own in this world
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give for your loveEmbed
