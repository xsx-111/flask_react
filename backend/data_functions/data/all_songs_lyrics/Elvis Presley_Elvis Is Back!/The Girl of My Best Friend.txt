The Girl of My Best Friend Lyrics
The way she walks, the way she talks
How long can I pretend?

Oh, I can't help it, I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend

Her lovely hair, her skin so fair
I could go on and never end

Oh, I can't help it, I'm in love
With the girl of my best friend

I want to tell her how I love her so
And hold her in my arms, but then
What if she got real mad and told him so?
I could never face either one again

The way they kiss, their happiness
Will my aching heart ever mend?
Or will I always be in love
With the girl of my best friend?

Never end
Will it ever end?
Please let it end
Will it ever end?Embed
