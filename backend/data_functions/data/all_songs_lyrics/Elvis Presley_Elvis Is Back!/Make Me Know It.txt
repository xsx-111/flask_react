Make Me Know It Lyrics
You say that you love me
And swear it to be true
But if you care to come over here
And make me know you do
Come on now, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
But if you care to come over here
And make me know you do

You say you've got kisses
And swear that they're brand new
I think that's fine if you ain't lyin'
But make me know you do
Come on now, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
I think that's fine if you ain't lyin'
But make me know you do

You won't have no trouble
Proving it to me
Come right along, you'll find me
Helpful as can be
You say you wanna hold me
And stick to me like glue
Well, hearing's deceiving and seeing's believing
Make me know you do
Come on now, make me know it
Well, go ahead and show it
I say hearing's deceiving, seeing's believing
Make me know you do

You won't have no trouble
Proving it to me
Come right along, you'll find me
Helpful as can be
You say you wanna hold me
And stick to me like glue
Well, hearing's deceiving and seeing's believing
Make me know you do
Come on now, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
I say hearing's deceiving, seeing's believing
Make me know you do
Oh, make me know it
Then go ahead and show it
Make me know it
Then go ahead and show itEmbed
