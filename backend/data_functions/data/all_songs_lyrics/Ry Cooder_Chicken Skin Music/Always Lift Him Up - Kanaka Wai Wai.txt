Always Lift Him Up / Kanaka Wai Wai Lyrics
When a fellow has the blues and feels discouraged
And there's nothing else but trouble all his life
When he's always grumbled at and never happy
Living with a scolding, aggravating wife
If he's sick and tired of life and takes to drinking
Do not pass him by, don't greet him with a frown
Do not fail to lend a hand and try to help him
Always lift him up and never knock him down

If he stays out late at night because he's worried
And because his home is not what it should be
Have a smile for him whenever you should meet him
It would help him just the right way, don't you see
If he gambles when he's in the town or city
Tell him what he ought to do to gain the crown
Lend a hand and do not fail to show him pity
Always lift him up and never knock him down


If he cannot pay his debts and feels disgusted
If he's blue and doesn't have a word to say
Let him know you are his friend who can be trusted
It would cheer this lonely fellow on his way
If he finds it hard for him to keep his family
Let a kind word greet his ear when he's around
Don't say anything at all to make against him
Always lift him up and never knock him down
If he has no friends and everyone's against him
If he's failed at everything that he has tried
Try to lift his load, to help to bear his burden
Let him know that you are walking by his side
And if he feels that all is lost, and he is falling
Try to place that poor man's feet on solid ground
Just remember he's some mother's precious darling
Always lift him up and never knock him down
Always lift him up and never knock him down
