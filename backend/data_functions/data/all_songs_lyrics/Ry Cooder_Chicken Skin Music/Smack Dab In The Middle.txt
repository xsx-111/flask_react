Smack Dab In The Middle Lyrics
Pick me a town in any clime
People like a rockin' time
Stay awake both day and night
And everybody's feeling good and right
Then throw me

Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul

I want ten Cadillacs and a diamond mill
Ten suits of clothes all dressed to kill
Ten room house and a barbecue
And-a fifty chicks not over twenty-two
And I'm

Smack dab in the middle
(I like to be)
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul
I want a lotta bread and-a gangs of meat
Oodles of butter and-a something sweet
Gallons of coffee to wash it down
And buy carbonated soda by the pound

Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul

I want a big jazz band, a hundred ballet girls
A street that's paved with natural pearl
Bring me a wagon load of bonds and stocks
And then open up the door to Fort Knox
Then throw me

Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Smack dab in the middle
Well, let me rock and roll to satisfy my soul

Soul, (smack) soul, (dab) soul
(Smack dab) soul
(Smack dab) soul
(Smack dab) soul
(Smack dab) soul
(Smack dab) soulEmbed
