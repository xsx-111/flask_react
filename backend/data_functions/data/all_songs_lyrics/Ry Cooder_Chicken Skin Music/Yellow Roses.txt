Yellow Roses Lyrics
I just received, sweetheart, your yellow roses
You tell me that they mean we're all through
You tell me that tonight your heart is broken
But you should know I was never untrue

I'll place them near your photograph and as the petals fall
They'll hide from you my lonely tears that shouldn't fall at all
Then they will slowly fade away and die
But I'll still love you though yellow roses say goodbye


I'll place them near your photograph and as the petals fall
They'll hide from you my lonely tears that shouldn't fall at all
Then they will slowly fade away and die
But I'll still love you though yellow roses say goodbyeEmbed
