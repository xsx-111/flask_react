I Got Mine Lyrics
Now I went down to a big crap game
Certainly was against my will
I lost every doggone nickel I had
But a greenback dollar bill
Forty dollar bet laid on the floor
My buddy's point was nine
Well, the police they come in there
And caught all of us
But I got mine

I got mine, let me tell ya
I got mine
I grabbed that money
Out the back door I went flying
Well, ever since the big crap game
I've been livin' on chicken and wine
I'm a leader of society
Since I got mine

I know a barber shop
It's a way cross town
Down on North Walker Street
Onliest place on a Saturday night
Us gamblers cares to meet
Some comes in for a haircut
And others come for a scrap
But when you see me and my buddies up there, man
We means to shoot some crap
Hollering: "Seven, eleven, won't you come, come, come!!!
If you don't seven, eleven dice
I'm a-done, done, done"
If I see the police before he sees me
I'm gonna run, run, run
I'm a leader of society
Since I got mine

Well, I went down to my best gal's house
The hour was just about nine
I wasn't dressed up like Henry Ford
But I was feeling just as fine
I caught her sitting on another man's knee
And I didn't like that sign
Well, I told them what I thought about it, boys
And I got mine

I got mine, I got mine
I grabbed my hat and through the window
I went flying
I ran as fast as I could run
But I didn't get there in time
Because the rascal grabbed a shotgun, Lord
And I got mine

Man I got mine
Sho' did
I just didn't run fast enoughEmbed
