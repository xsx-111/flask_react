Goodnight Irene Lyrics
I asked your mother for you
She told me that you was too young
I wish dear Lord never have seen your face
And I'm sorry that you ever been born

Irene good night, Irene good night
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll get you in my dreams

Sometimes I live in the country
And sometimes I lives in town
Sometimes I have a great notion
To jump into the river and drown

Irene good night, Irene good night
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll get you in my dreams


I loves Irene, God knows I do
Loves her till the sea runs dry
If Irene turns her back on me
I'm gonna take morphine and die
Stop ramblin' and stop gamblin'
Quit staying out late at night
Come home into your wife and your family
Sit down by the fireside bright

Irene good night, Irene good night
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene
I'll get you in my dreamsEmbed
