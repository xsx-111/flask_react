Capital City LyricsNerve and nerve
This coastline swerves
To a city that they live on
I walk on by
Animals cry
To a city that they live on
To a city that they walk on
To a city that they live on
Pulse Feel Pulse
This train is late
I hesitate
To a city that they live on
Dance the dance of violence
To a city that they live on
To a city that they crawl on
To a city that they live on
Pulse Feel Pulse
City that they live on
Feel
To a city that they crawl on
To a city live on
Feel
City that they crawl onEmbed
