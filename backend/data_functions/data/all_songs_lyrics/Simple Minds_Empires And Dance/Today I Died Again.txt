Today I Died Again Lyrics
The human drum
Beats a rhythm of life
The clothes he wears
Date back to the war
He talks alot
Often to himself
She don't say much
Just cuts his hair
She can't remember
Before the heat
He can't remember
His wife's christian name
Paint me a picture
Towers in sand
America can fall

Today I died again
I died again
I died today
Today I died again
I died again
I died today

Back to a year
Back to a youth
Of men in church and drug cabarets
Is this the age
Of empires and dance
Oh what a world
Oh what a world
She can't remember
Before this heat
He can't remember
His wife's christian name
Paint me a picture
Bodies in sand
Presidents can fall
