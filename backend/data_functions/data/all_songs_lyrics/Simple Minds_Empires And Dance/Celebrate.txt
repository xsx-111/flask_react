Celebrate Lyrics
Act of love
Is a luxury
The suit he wears
Belongs to me
The road is long
Seven thousand miles
Soldier talk
And uniform

We can live
I can live
Celebrate
Celebrate
We can live
I can live
Celebrate
Celebrate

She rag doll
Keeps him warm
This negative
Shows no form
He salutes the crowd
"Go west young man"
Run run run
The hollow man

To a distant land
Sand and sand
Touch to touch
A marble man
The house is glass
Furniture's chrome
Soldier talk
And uniform
