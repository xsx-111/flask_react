This Fear Of Gods LyricsSomeone singing in the shower
Someone singing in the shower
Singing singing singing
Singing shower
Someone's singing in the shower
I hear a voice and hear no angel
I hear a voice and hear no angel
Hero see no hero see no
Hero see no
Hear and see no
Hear a voice and see no angel
Violence and vivisection
Violence and vivisection
Lust lust lust
Lust lust lust
Violence and vivisection
Gods
Gods
This fear of Gods
Some boys are calling
Boys are crying
Some boys are calling
Boys are crying
Calling calling calling
Crying
Calling calling calling
Crying
Fear is fast
I'm turning white now
Fear is fast
I'm turning white now
Faster faster faster
Faster faster faster
Fear is fast
I'm turning white now
Gods
Gods
This fear of Gods
I'm back on black
Fear of Gods
Back on blackEmbed
