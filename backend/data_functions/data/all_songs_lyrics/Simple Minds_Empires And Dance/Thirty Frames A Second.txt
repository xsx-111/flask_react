Thirty Frames A Second LyricsToday I saw a film going backwards
Thirty Frames A Second
Was a man I recognised
Say who you are
I lost my job
Security
Self confidence
Bank account
Identity
The league of youth
Coming backward at me
Thirty Frames a second
Say who you are
Go back to father
Father where's my food?
You food is on the table
That can't be food
It's dirt
Say who you are
Look at my skin
Look at my face
Look at my arms
Getting younger
Going backwards
Thirty Frames A Second
Say who you are
I crash my car
Collapse in town
Young immigrants
And legionaires
Fighting back back backwards
Thirty Frames A Second
Say who you are
Some friends of mine
I thought were dead
A coming back
"What are you doing coming back
Jack"
Say who you are
Feel I'm going backwards
Thirty Frames A SecondEmbed
