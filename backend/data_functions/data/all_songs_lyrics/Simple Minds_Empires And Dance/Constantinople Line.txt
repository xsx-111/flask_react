Constantinople Line Lyrics
Hey Waiter
I'm first class
Hey Waiter
Where are we now?
Am I last
Am I last
Hey Waiter
Don't talk back
These tenants speak
A traveller's language
Caucasian talk
They're saying nothing
I see a land
As we crawl by night
I see a face
In the window in front

These stations are useful
These stations we love them
Newspaper
Encounter
Confusion

Hey Waiter
I'm first class
Hey Waiter
What state is this?
These reptiles scream
A violent party
All art and jazz
And League of Nations
I see a land
As we crawl by night
I see a face
In the window in front
The east is calling
I'm feeling nervous
I love the western
Style and change

Constantinople
Red
Red star
Red
Constantinople
Red
Red star
