I Travel Lyrics
Cities, buildings falling down
Ideal homes falling down
Those pictures I see on the wall
Timeless leaders standing tall
Assassins in a hit and run
Asia has a new born son
Evacuees, refugees
Presidents and monarchies

Travel round, travel round
Decadence and pleasure towns
Tragedies, luxuries, statues, parks, galleries
Travel round, travel round
Decadence and pleasure towns

Europe has a language problem
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talking on
In central Europe, men are marching
Marching on now, marching on now
Love songs playing in the restaurants
Airport playing Brian Eno
No, no, no, no

Europe has a language problem
In central Europe, men are marchingEmbed
