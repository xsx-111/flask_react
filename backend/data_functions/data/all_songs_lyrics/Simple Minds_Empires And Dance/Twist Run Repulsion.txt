Twist Run Repulsion LyricsSwitch the light on
We can think it's dawn
Oh push along
Push along
Play a long song
I'm laughing at marine
Marine laughs back
Don't like those boys
Toy soldier boys
I'm lying in bed
You can play me fear
You can play me fear
Only rhythm I hear
You cut me up
With joys of life
I'm going somewhere
I'm going someplace
If caution is life
Then caution is sin
Contort contort contort
I'll win
These walls that close
Close in on me
Seductress shout
Seductress scream
Switch the light on
We can think it's dawn
Oh push along
Push along
Pray along
Play a long songEmbed
