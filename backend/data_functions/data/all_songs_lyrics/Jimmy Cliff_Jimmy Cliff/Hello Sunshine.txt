Hello Sunshine LyricsHello sunshine
Will old darkness be my friend?
Hello sunshine
To this you can put an end
Hello sunshine
Hey there sunshine
Don't let me down
Hey there sunshine
Hey there sunshine
My friend
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, oh yeah, oh yeah
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, oh yeah, oh yeah
Hello dark clouds
I don't want you round no more
Hello tear drops
Why don't you stay from my door
Hello troubles
I can't stand your face for sure
Hey there sunshine
Don't let me down
Hey there sunshine
Hey there sunshine
My friend!
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, oh yeah, oh yeah
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, oh yeah, oh yeah
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, oh yeah, oh yeah
Hello sunshine
Will old darkness be my friend?
Hello sunshine
To this you can put an end
Hello sunshine
Hey there sunshine
Don't let me down
Hey there sunshine
Hey there sunshine
My friend!
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Oh yeah, hello sunshine
Sunshine, I need you, hey hey hey
I've gotta help you, hello sunshine
When I'm down now, hey hey hey
Said I need you, hello sunshineEmbed
