Time Will Tell LyricsTime will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
When I was just a little boy only six years old
I asked my daddy what big things my future hold
He said, Son, when you grow up to be a man
The facts of life you will start to understand
Nobody knows just what tomorrow may bring
So I want to tell you now, and listen while I sing
Father said
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
Now I'm a lonely man trying to make life on my own
Ever since the day I was born, I never have a happy home
Just like the river, I've been running ever since
The day I was born in that broken down little town
I'm wondering now just what my gain will be
Cause it seems to me, happiness I'll never see
Mama said
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
What he say now
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
Time keeps on changing like the weather and the seasons
For every mistake, Mama said, there must be a reason
After a storm, there's got to be a calm
So I think I'll wait a while and try to wear a smile (Wear a smile)
Mama said
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
What he say now
Time will tell, I know, I know
Time will tell, said I know
Time alone will tell
One more time now
Time will tell, I believe
Time will tell, oh yes, I do
Time alone will tell, I believe thatEmbed
