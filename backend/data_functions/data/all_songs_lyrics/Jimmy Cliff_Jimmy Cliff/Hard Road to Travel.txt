Hard Road to Travel Lyrics
I've got a hard road to travel
And a rough-rough way to go
Said, it's a hard road to travel
And a rough-rough way to go

But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through (Let me tell you)

I'm all alone, this lonesome road I roam
I've got no love to call my very own
Oh, the river gets deeper, the hills get steeper
And the pain gets deeper every day (Yeah!)

I've got a hard road to travel
And a rough-rough way to go
Said, it's a hard road to travel
And a rough-rough way to go

But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through
Oh; oh-oh
Oh; oh-oh (One more thing)
I dream of a home far beyond the sea
Where there is love, peace and joy for me
Oh, in my eyes I see troubles and danger for me
But destiny, where it leads me, I must go (Hey!)

I've got a hard road to travel
And a rough-rough way to go
Said, it's a hard road to travel
And a rough-rough way to go

But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Oh; oh-oh (Oh, help me somebody)
Oh; oh-oh (Somebody please, help me)Embed
