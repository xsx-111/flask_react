Use What I Got LyricsI'm gonna use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
Look, I was born in a little old shack
Didn't have enough to eat
Not enough clothes on my back
Lord knows I kept the faith
A heart full of woe
Now they're trying to get me
At the end of my road
Use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
The rich is content
While the poor do without
If you ask for some herb
They don't know what you're talking about
All say they answer
As if they're on the wind
It changes sometimes
That why I'm afraid I've gotta
Use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
The road of life is mighty steep
When you're broke, busted and disgusted
For you ain't got nowhere to sleep
I'm gonna find me a woman to stand by my side
'Cause I'm so tired of running
Can't find no place to hide
I'm gonna use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
Use what I got, you know that I got to
Use what I got, said I've got to
Use what I got, you gotta use it
Use what I got, use it all up now
Use what I got, yes I have
Use what I got, I've got to, got to
Use what I got, said I got to
Use what I got
Use what I gotEmbed
