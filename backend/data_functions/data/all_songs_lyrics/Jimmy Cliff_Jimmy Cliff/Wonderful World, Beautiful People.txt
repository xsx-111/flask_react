Wonderful World, Beautiful People LyricsWonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can reveal
Take a look at the world
And the state that it's in today
I am sure you'll agree
We all could make it a better way
With our love, put together
Everybody learn to love each other
Instead of fussing and fighting
Cheating, backbiting
Scandalizing and hating
Baby we could have a
Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can reveal
Man and woman, girl and boy
Let us try to give a helping hand
This I know and I'm sure
That with love we all could understand
This is our world, can't you see?
Everybody wants to live and be free
Instead of fussing and fighting
Cheating, backbiting
Scandalizing and hating
We could have a
Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can reveal
Talking about the
Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, talking about you
Things could be pretty, talking about me
Wonderful world, talking about Nixon
Beautiful people, Harold Wilson
Wonderful world, power too
Beautiful people, and the Seagate1Embed
