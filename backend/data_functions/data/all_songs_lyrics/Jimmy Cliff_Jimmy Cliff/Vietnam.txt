Vietnam LyricsHey, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Yesterday, I got a letter from my friend fighting in Vietnam
And this is what he had to say
"Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time'll be up sometime in June
Don't forget", he said, "To tell my sweet Mary
Her golden lips are sweet as cherry"
And it came from Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
It was just the next day, his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
And this is what she wrote and said
"Don't be alarmed", she told me the telegram said
"But mistress Brown, your son is dead"
And it came from Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, hey, Vietnam
Somebody please stop that war now
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, oh
Vietnam, Vietnam, oh
Vietnam, oh oh, oh oh
Somebody please stop it
Vietnam, Vietnam, oh
Vietnam, Vietnam, oh oh, oh oh
Vietnam, hey, Vietnam, aha
Vietnam, oh oh, yeah
I wanna say now somebody stop that war
Vietnam, oh yeah, ahaEmbed
