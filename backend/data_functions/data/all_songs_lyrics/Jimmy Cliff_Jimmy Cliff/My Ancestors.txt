My Ancestors LyricsMy ancestors were kings of old
They ruled the world and all of its gold
But look at me, oh, look at me
Just look at me
My ancestors would find the sun
Before they bowed down to anyone
But you gonna look at me
Woh, look at me
Just look at me
Yeah, woh, look at me
I'm a stranger in this land
Watch me stand tall
Help me, help me be just a man, oh
My ancestors, they were mighty men
And my son, he will be one of them
And they'll just look at him
Yeah, they'll look at him
And they'll say, he's a man, he's a man
My son's a man, oh
My ancestors, they passed it on to me
I've got to, got to work
And pass it on to my son
And he will be a man, oh yeah
And pass it on to his son
And he will be a man, oh yes he willEmbed
