Come Into My Life LyricsMmh mmh mmh mmh, yeah
Come into my life, come into my life
Come into my life, oh baby
Come in today
(Come on in)
Come in to stay
(Come on in)
Come into my life, oh baby
The first time that I met you
I knew I had to make you mine
And when I kissed you
I knew I want you all the time
I don't need no sympathy
All I need is your love for me
Tell me now and I make you happy
Oh baby
Come into my life, come into my life
Come into my life, oh baby
Come in today
(Come on in)
Come in to stay
(Come on in)
Come into my life, oh baby
Hold me and fold me
Anyway into your will
Bend me and shape me
Baby as long as you love me still
I don't need no sympathy
All I need is your love for me
Tell me now and I'll make you happy
Hey baby
Come into my life, come into my life
Come into my life, oh baby
Come in today
(Come on in)
Come in to stay
(Come on in)
Come into my life, oh baby
Come into my life 'cause I need you
(Come into my life)
Said I want you
(Come into my life)
I gotta have you baby
(Come into my life)
Oh yeah, right now
(Come into my life)
And oh yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come into my life)
Said I need you, child
(Come into my life)
Ah ah yeah, I need your love
(Come into my life)
I gotta have you right nowEmbed
