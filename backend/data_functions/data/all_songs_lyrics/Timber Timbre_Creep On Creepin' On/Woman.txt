Woman LyricsHand to, hand to
Mouth to, mouth to
Mind to, mind to
Mouth to middle
Oh, woman, why aren't you moving with me yet?
Do you forget what you tried to remember
And you remember what you tried to forget?
Hand to, hand to
Mouth to, mouth to
Mind to, mind to
Mouth to middle
Oh, woman, it's an omen, this is it
But I forget what I tried to remember
I remember all I tried to forgetEmbed
