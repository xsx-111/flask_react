Do I Have Power LyricsIn a moment of a thousand helping hands
I am not beyond the saccharine of sycophantic rants
In a moment of a wilderness exposed
Is this lack of wisdom better than a charismatic soul?
And I'm bringing up blue horse meat, thinking that I've lost control
Do I have power? Do I have power?
Do I have power over it?
Do I have power? Do I have power?
Do I have any power over it?
For a moment, can I just pretend you're mine?
Would it kill you now to placate my chauvinistic mind?
For a moment, as my hoarse haunts harm ago
Bring the hypnotist back here to get me through another song
And I'm bringing up blue, hoarse me, wondering where I went wrong
Do I have power? Do I have power?
Do I have power over it?
Do I have power? Do I have power?
Do I have any power over it?Embed
