Lonesome Hunter Lyrics
What did that bad man put in you?
Did those rotten kids cross a line?
I'm afraid I'll never understand, baby
I'm so sorry you had such a bad time
Well, I had done some truly awful things
And you must be very terrified
Well, you have every reason to be frightened
Since you've been reading my mind

Who am I to deny this moment?
And who am I to even question it?
There is a cross on the mountain, baby
There is a cross flowing over your head

Please break this spell you have me under
Every heart is a lonesome hunter
Please break this spell you have me under, oh yes
Every heart is a lonesome hunter

Sparrows at your window
Starlings at your door
Magpies wherever we go
Is it blackbirds forevermore?
Well, I'm staring at a hole in my hand
And I've been staring at a hole in your head
And I've been feeling like a zombie, baby
I am a zombie coming slow to your bed
Well...


Is a lonesome hunter
Is a lonesome hunter
Every heart is a lonesome hunter2Embed
