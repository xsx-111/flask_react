Black Water Lyrics
All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

The siren called beyond the treeline
With another one for the caves
And in the tarn beyond those birches
There's a spirit that I crave
And from the island, people watched you
You set that viking ship ablaze
We reached the moon, fall's icy cauldron
And found the spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

You've fallen barefoot past the treeline
Beaten, bone-eyed, butchered, swayed
A thousand whitefish floating belly up
In the spirit that I crave
And we threw ourselves right into it
Where lay the bodies had been claimed
We dove a third out for the fifth
Banned to the spirit that I crave
All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

I found empathy from madness
Deliverance from malaise
My heart is is filled with gladness
At the only spirit that I crave

All I need is some sunshine
All I need
All I need is some sunshine
All I need

Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black water, black water (Call me down, black water call me down)
Black (Call me down, black water call me down)
(Call me down, black water call me down)
(Call me down, black water call me down)
(Call me down, black water call me down)4Embed
