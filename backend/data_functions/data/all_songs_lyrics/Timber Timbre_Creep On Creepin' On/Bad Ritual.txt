Bad Ritual Lyrics
There's a hat on the bed, the clock has stopped ticking
And nothing remotely romantic has been said
Let's not pass on the steps, let's take the season very easy
Let's take pills, saltwater, let's keep looking ahead

(Oh, oh) It's a bad, bad ritual
(Oh, oh) But it calms me down
(Oh, oh) It's a bad, bad ritual
(Oh, oh) But it calms me down

There is a history in pictures, there is evidence in boxes
There is proof of your love for him long after it's dead
And every creak a trigger, I will think of you with others
I could not smother out that fire in my head

And saw your levitating chair, I found your long blond hairs
I felt your poltergeist presence in the frame of the bed
Every creak is a trigger, I will think of you with others
I found depravity convinced me I may no longer care

(Oh, oh) It's a bad, bad ritual
(Oh, oh) But it calms me down
(Oh, oh) It's a bad, bad ritual
(Oh, oh) But it calms me down
(Oh, oh) It's a bad, bad ritual
(Oh, oh) But it calms me down
(Oh, oh) It's a bad, bad ritual2Embed
