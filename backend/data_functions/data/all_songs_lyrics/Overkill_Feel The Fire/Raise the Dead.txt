Raise the Dead LyricsFeel the power, rushing forward
It gets into your veins
Almighty power, building higher
You'll never be the same
I'm wanting more, I'm getting more
Of the feelings you can't tame
I'm the master, you're the bastards
Are you glad you came?
The sign of life
Your blood is red
Come with us and
Raise the dead
Electric fusion, no illusion
Terror in the night
Screaming thunder, white face murder
We complete the fright
The earth is shaking, ground is breaking
We complete the rite
The time has come for you to run
Now, take off in the night
See the stone above his head
Rise three days, the prophet said
The sign of life
Your blood is red
Come with us and
Raise the dead
Behind the headstone
He is watching you
Watching every move
Behind the headstone
See the body move
Come to get fresh blood
Feel the power, rushing forward
It gets into your veins
Almighty power, building higher
You'll never be the same
I'm wanting more, I'm getting more
Of the feelings you can't tame
I'm the master, you're the bastards
Are you glad you came?
Are you glad you came?
Are you glad you came?
Are you glad you came?
Raise the, raise the, raise the deadEmbed
