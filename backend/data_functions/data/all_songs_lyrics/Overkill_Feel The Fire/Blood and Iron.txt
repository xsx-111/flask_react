Blood and Iron LyricsOut for blood, take no prisoners
Out for the kill and looking for donors
As terror strikes, give your life
We drink your blood, a human sacrifice
Stick in the knife
For blood and iron
Iron, blood and iron
Thirst for more, our chosen path
Awake and find the Devil's wrath
All those who dare
And those who disobey
Alone you'll find dead as yesterday
Fight for your life
For blood and iron
Iron, blood and iron
Alright, donors
Donate
Flesh of steel, a legion of donors
We are one as our blood transfers
New found power
Racing through your veins
Blood metal donors
Eat the last remains
For blood and ironEmbed
