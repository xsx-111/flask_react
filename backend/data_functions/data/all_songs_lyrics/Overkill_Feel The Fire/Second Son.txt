Second Son LyricsRight
Damned at birth, the child king born
The prophets warned
Beware the second son
Born to lead
And then raised in peace and harmony
My fellow men and I live as one
Together forever
Forever in the kingdom of the son
Watched in fear
Another day, the final year
The light that fills our sky begins to die
Haunted dreams
I sleep in terror, wake in screams
The scent of burning flesh
Fills sacred skies
Skies filled with slaughter and
Slaughter from the order in my mind
History unfolds
As the prophets had foretold
And lightning strikes
The fire in my eye
Hell hath claimed another soul
To watch the spirit die
Evil minds now rule my destiny
A sinner by my side won't set me free
Thoughts of pain and power
Fill my veins
All hear my name
You were warned
If a child born, beware
Feel the fire, expect no mercy
Olympus burns
Father, forgive me
Know my wrath, brother before me
Beware, beware, beware1Embed
