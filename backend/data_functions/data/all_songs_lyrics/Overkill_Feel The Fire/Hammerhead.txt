Hammerhead LyricsFeeling the pain as it rips
Through my brain
Twisting what's left of my mind
Tearing the same
This blood burning flame
Decaying all it can find
Banging your head, stuck in the dread
Leaving the posers behind
Power you see, the powers you need
Nerves and bones we grind
Hammer, hammerhead
Hammer, hammerhead
Knocked to the floor, left wanting more
Scars decorate your face
Playing the game
You're never the same
The heat is melting this place
Emotion and fire, you never tire
Running a death metal race
Knife in the back, guitar heart attack
Murder, rest my case
Hammer, hammerhead
Hammer, hammerhead
No-one can stop our way to the top
No-one can get in the way
Neck-snapping force, taking its course
Keeping the dogs at bay
Nailed to the wall, giving your all
We know that you ain't dead
We know your name
Know why you came
You're a fucking hammerhead
Hammer, hammerhead
Hammer, hammerhead
Hammer, hammerhead
Hammer, hammer, hammerEmbed
