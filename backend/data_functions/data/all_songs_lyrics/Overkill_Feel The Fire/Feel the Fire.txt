Feel the Fire LyricsEat through the mounds of steel
Sift through the metal
Belly full, another deal
Stopping would be fatal
Round and round spins a forty-five
Is it vinyl or a bullet?
One to kill, one keeps alive
Get on your knees and suck it
Looking down the barrel
The feeling of new power
Look up the weasel
Feel the reign of terror
Crawling, scratching to stay alive
He's lying on his belly
One finger needed to rip apart
The soul Belial carries
Point your finger, scream in vain
Not a soul is listening
Never fast, you'll feel the pain
Long cold barrel glistening
Down the dead end street
He strikes to kill the weed
I call the Devil, laughing as you bleed
Prepare for your new life
Satan waits tonight
No-one cried when it was over
Your life, it had no meaning
Even friends of J.A.R
Quickly lost all feelings
You had warnings, you had time
Well, that was all you gave it
Said one day you'd be mine
Your life, you couldn't save it
Angels raining down
Stories that they tell
J.J. played with fire
Now, he burns in Hell
Prepare for your new life
Satan waits tonight
Higher, higher
Feel the fire
She burns at the stake like a witch
Kill her, slash her, slit her throat
There's nothing I despise more than a bitch
Burn her tonight
Run, hide from the Demon's fate
Too late, the fire is lit
Come in and sit for a while
Come in and feel the fire
Feel the heat, feel the fire
Fire of desire
Fall in
