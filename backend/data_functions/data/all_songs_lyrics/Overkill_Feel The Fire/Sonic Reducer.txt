Sonic Reducer Lyrics
I don't need anyone
Don't need no mom and dad
Don't need no good advice
Don't need no human race
But I got some news for you
I don't even need you, too
I've got my time machine
Got my metallic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser
Got the sonic reducer
Ain't no loser, no

We go out on the street
They don't know who I am
I watch them from my room
They're all just passing by
But I'm not just anyone
Yeah, I'm not just anyone
I've got my time machine
Got my electronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser
Got the sonic reducer
Ain't no loser, no, no, no

I'll be a pharaoh soon
We'll form some kind of tomb
Things will be different then
The sun will rise again
And I'll be two feet tall
And I'll be does it all
I've got my time machine
Got my electronic dream
Sonic reducer, ain't no loser
Got the sonic reducer
Ain't no loser
Got the sonic reducer
Sonic reducer
Got the sonic reducer
Sonic reducer, reducerEmbed
