Hammer Lyrics
I am the sinner with only socks on
They huddle around me across their arms
Seeking chaos in injury
Fear of breathing close to me

Hammer it home I want to hammer it in
Take the lot on and never give in
You don't know the pain it can cause
You don't know how far we had got

Now there is blood swirling inside of me
I cannot cut it and hurl it away
The problem returned a gift from hell
It licks and holds onto your fear

Hammer it home I want to hammer it in
Take the lot on and never give in
You don't know the pain it can cause
You don't know how far we'd got

Hammer it home if you'll believe me still
And my surprise at this kill
What would you do if you were like me
Taken in when he said
That he wanted to take me home
And he takes me up to his room
And he says no no no no it's good
But it's a last fatal fuck

Then you know that love is hellEmbed
