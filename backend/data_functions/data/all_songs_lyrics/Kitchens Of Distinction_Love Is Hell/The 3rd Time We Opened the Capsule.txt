The 3rd Time We Opened the Capsule Lyrics
Go good and gentle men
I'm falling asleep again
Take my sins and take my tablets
Have these notions culled from oceans
Hide them well in fear
I'll abuse them wake up with an unchanged whim
Take my sins and take my tablets
Have these notions culled from oceans

The third time we opened the capsule everything went.....

Here sings the innocent
He's turning water into brine
Take my words and take my language
Have these notions culled from oceans
Hide them well and let them rust
Falling asleep with more to trust
Take my words and take my language
Take my words and take my language

The third time we opened the capsule everything went.....
I want a light to shine in my eye
Holding secrets in controlled flight to make it easy
Breathing big take these truths and dig dig dig
Dig dig dig
I want a light to shine in my eye
Take these truths and dig dig dig
Dig dig digEmbed
