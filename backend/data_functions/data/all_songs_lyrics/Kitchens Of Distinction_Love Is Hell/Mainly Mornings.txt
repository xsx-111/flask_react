Mainly Mornings Lyrics
I open my eyes and look at his face again
Oh good god so nothing's changed
The shopping to eat and the coffee to drink
The untrusty work in this miserable clink

He reaches for a packet of cigarettes on the table
And takes one and lights it and inhales again
I close the front door behind him again
Oh yes dear child it's safe to come in why don't you come in

Where there's the television the radio the telephone
It all helps
There's the car the sex the love the alcohol
It all helps it all helps
It all helps all

I open my eyes and look at his face again
Oh good god so nothing's changed
I close the front door behind him again
Oh yes dear child it's safe to come in why don't you come in

Where there's the television the radio the telephone
It all helps
There's the car the sex the love the alcohol
It all helps it all helps
It all helps all
Sometimes I want to push the pedal down a little further
Until the car is unhappy
Mainly mornings
Mainly mornings
Mainly mornings
Mainly mornings
Mainly mornings
Mainly mornings
Mainly morningsEmbed
