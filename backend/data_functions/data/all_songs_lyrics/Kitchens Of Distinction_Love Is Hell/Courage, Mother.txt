Courage, Mother LyricsThere has been a question here
About a major leaving do
Should they stay together till death
Or ruin every hope they had and let go?
Can he let her go?
Has she strength to show?
Is there life after wife?
But what if she's right?
Then questions from catholic woods
From delicate rich neighbourhoods
Should she stay fat and betrayed
Or be poor again by letting go?
Can she afford to leave?
Has she strength to show?
Is there life after death?
But what if she's right to leave him?
And what if she dares to take herself to church
Shatter vows so sacred
Tell Him when her heart lies
Leave the children crying bravely letting go?
There have been some questions here
From a boy whose choice is clear
Could you forgive easily and live with someone
Free of guilt who let go?Embed
