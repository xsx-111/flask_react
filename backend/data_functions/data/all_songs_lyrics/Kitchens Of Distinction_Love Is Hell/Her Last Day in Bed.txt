Her Last Day in Bed LyricsThe look of death is in her eyes
Sunken dry glazed and calm
Unable to smile or frown
Softly she's lying waiting to go
Like browning in the sun
Me?  I'm watching to see what happens
To her crisp useless flesh
"Oh darling" I say as she twitches away
"Tell me what's it like?
Drifting into your unknown space
Tell me is there a bright light?
"Oh darling you promised to talk to me
Even after today
Keep me a seat at the drinking place
Between heaven and here."
Me?  I'd want a shot in my arm
Or the stab of a heart attack
Something quick you see
She breathes her last
I hold her hand
Her skin's suddenly yellow
I have no more questions
For she has no answers
I swallow her voice...Embed
