Shiver Lyrics
Wait and watch she's defrosting
Wets in trickles of sunshine orange skin
Slowly come the gong of her voice
Flopping belly seallike onto my aching back

She'll make you shiver
She'll make you shiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my fleshiver

Waiting's over she's singing
Surfs the shaking roof of my mouth
I am the moose I'll howl at the flakiest moon

She'll make you shiver
She'll make you shiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my
She guides a weight into my spine
Melts the darkest day away
Thaws a man out of my back
Licks and quivers until...
IÂ´ll shiver

She'll make me shiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my fleshiver
Make my fleshiver
Make myEmbed
