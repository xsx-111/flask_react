In a Cave Lyrics
Will you jump up here next to me?
The moon is close and warm and serene
And it's mine
Yes it's mine for you

In this cave I have found just for us
Forget your fat it's a pillow soft for my neck
For my neck

In this cave on the moon built for you
Just for you because you're perfect
O mental patch it swells and shudders
All your skin and hair in moonlight
With a hole in the roof
Where we can watch our planet circle away

Will you touch the cave's cream stone walls?
Here I'll hold your tender years
And they're mine your youth is mine in this cave

So jump up here onto the closer moon
I'll have the food and downy warmth
Your love will rear a family in this cave on the moon
For you because you're perfect
O mental patch it swells and shudders
All your skin and hair in moonlight
With a hole in the roof
Where we can watch our planet circle away
And come back
And come back

In this cave on the moon
In this cave on the moon
In this cave on the moon
In this cave on the moonEmbed
