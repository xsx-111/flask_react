Time to Groan Lyrics
Hey it always cuts her down when he talks about freedom
"Free from what my work is done my social conscience forgiven"
These are fast times speed is thrill times
He won't stop to understand
She's taken years to get this for crying hurry all along

What could she want from all these abrupt men?
What can she gain from all of those fast friends?
What can she take on?
Simply slow life

Hey she's bought her time to groan for singing and cooking
Living slower from now on, ignoring his pacing
Like a baby like a madman she'll eat and sleep as she pleases
And demand a three hour speech on his fondness for her knees

What could she want from all these abrupt men?
What can she gain from all of those fast friends?
What can she take on?
Simply slow life
Slowing down sweat no more now with time life can glow glow

What could she want from all these abrupt men?
What can she gain from all of those fast friends?
What can she take on?
Simply slow life

Slowing downEmbed
