Night Comes Down Lyrics
In the last rays of the setting sun and the past days
Yeah, that's where our memories run
And all of those times still race through my mind

I'm shattered inside to find

When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's nowhere to go

Call me and I'll wait until summer, you never understood
That I'll wait forever for love that's only good
As the light starts to dim, the fear closes in

And the nightmares begin

When the night comes down
I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
Oh, no, you won't be there tomorrow
Oh, no, say, it isn't true
I can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh, can't you see my heart is broken in two?


I'm shattered inside to find

When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to goEmbed
