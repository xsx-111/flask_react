Rock Hard Ride Free LyricsGet a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
You gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth
No denying
We're going against the grain
So defiant
But they'll never put us down
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Tough as steel, stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer, yeah
Grab the lead in the race
No denying
We're going against the grain
So defiant
But they'll never put us down, spit it out!
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end
No denying
We're going against the grain
Because it's so defiant
Everybody scream it again!
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all night
Rock hard, ride free
All your life
Rock hard, ride free
All day, all nightEmbed
