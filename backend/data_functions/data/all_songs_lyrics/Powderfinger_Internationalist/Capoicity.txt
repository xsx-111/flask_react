Capoicity Lyrics
Honesty is out of style
So hammer in the coffin nails
A message sent across to land
With kisses for you

We'll tell them nothing
Our little secret
They'll never make us
Ever open up

Tradition in and out the door
Family our fatal flaw
A future frameless in design
A seamless concept

We'll tell them nothing
Of our little secret
They'll never make us
Ever open up

I'll never break our trust
Until we're coffin dust
Oooh, ah
Oooh, ah
Oooh, ah
Oooooooooh, ah
When this feeling fades
It'll all seem like a waste
The fragile bond has shaken loose
This secret love, a shrinking noose
Suffocated on the truth
You're left with nothing

The fragile bond has shaken loose
This secret love, a shrinking noose
Suffocated on the truth
You're left with nothing

You're left with nothing
You're left with nothing
You're left with nothingEmbed
