Lemon Sunrise Lyrics
Do do do do do
Always on time
Do do do do do
Waiting in line

Whatever you say
Whatever you say
Whatever you say
Whatever

Do do do do do
Soda and lime
Do do do do do
Lemon sunrise

Whatever you say
Whatever you say
Whatever you say
Whatever you say (whatever you say)

See you Tuesday (see you Tuesday)
Never would stay (never would stay)
Whatever you say (whatever you say)
Whatever
The windmills of time
When we used to lay down (down)
In that lemon sunrise
Now I'm no longer around
Probably long gone
*unintelligible*
*unintelligible*

Whatever you say (whatever you say)
Whatever you say (whatever you say)
Whatever you say (whatever you say)
Whatever you say (whatever you say)

See you Tuesday (see you Tuesday)
Never would stay (never would stay)
Whatever you say (whatever you say)
WhateverEmbed
