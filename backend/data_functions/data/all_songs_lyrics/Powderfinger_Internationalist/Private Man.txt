Private Man Lyrics
I tell you he's a private man
In a public circumstance
He's eyeing off an old doorframe
Looking for a drastic change

It's such a shame this has to end
But things are out of his command

He has no further truth to tell
Now he has absolved himself
He's eyeing off an old doorframe
And history secures his name

It's such a shame this has to end
But things are out of his command

There's no more problems to defend
When he falls so far

I tell you he's a private man
In a public circumstance
He's eyeing off an old door frame
Looking for a tragic change
It's such a shame this has to end
But things are out of his command

There's no more problems to defend
Now he falls so far

Now he falls so far
And he falls so far
When he falls so hardEmbed
