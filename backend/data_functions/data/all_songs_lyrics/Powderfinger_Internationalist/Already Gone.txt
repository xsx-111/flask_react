Already Gone Lyrics
You've been working all your life
All weekends and overtime
While you're trying to unwind
You can't relate to the leisured life

Another day meanders by
Keeping nature's tabled time
All these things just pass you by
And you can't relax in a scheduled life
(Two, three, four)

Promises already gone
There's no escape, it's said and done
So keep your love forever young

You've been trying to decide
Multiply, or just divide?
All these things are on your mind
And you can't relax in a scheduled life

Promises already gone
There's no escape, it's said and done
So keep your love forever young
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

Promises already gone
There's no escape, it's said and done
So keep your love forever young

Promises already gone
There's no escape, it's said and done
So keep your love forever young1Embed
