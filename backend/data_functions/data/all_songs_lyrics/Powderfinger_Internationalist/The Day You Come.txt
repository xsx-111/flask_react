The Day You Come Lyrics
Memories are fading
A single voice complaining
Days are stacking up

It's hardly worth debating
The people are frustrated
Drink from poison cup

The system is collapsing
Conscience is relapsing
The damage has been done

On the day you come
Rising up
On the day you come
Rising up

Vision is rejected
The people's choice is tested
So ignorance has won
Children are infected
The remedy suggested
Don't drink from tainted cup

An overpopulation
A media sensation
The damage has been done

On the day you come
Rising up
On the day you come
Rising up

On the day you come
2:21 - 2:44

On the day you come
Rising up
On the day you come
Rising up
On the day you come
Rising up
On the day you come
Rising up

On the day you come
Rising up
On the day you come
Rising upEmbed
