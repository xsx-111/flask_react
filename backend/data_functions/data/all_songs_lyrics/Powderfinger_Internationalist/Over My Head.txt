Over My Head Lyrics
A combination of the two worst ideals that you might have
Well don't complain when you just concede
There's nothing left for you

It's sad to think that it all went over my head
I like to think it was easy not to have said
It's sad to think that it all went over my head
I like to think it was easy not to have said

Well look up, there's another place where you might just have come from
Well, hold me down, there is nothing to say I've been spent round here

It's sad to think that it all went over my head
I like to think it was easy not to have said
It's sad to think that it all went over my head
I like to think it was easy not to have saidEmbed
