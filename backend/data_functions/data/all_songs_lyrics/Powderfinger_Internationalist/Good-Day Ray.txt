Good-Day Ray Lyrics
He's at you again ray
Testing out your head space
No matter what you do
The money still loves you

And you have fallen down the stairs again
You might have to take it easy
You've fallen down the stairs again
You might have to take it easy

Because we love you
And we respect you
Because we love you
And we respect you

And you have fallen down the stairs again
You might have to take it easy
You've fallen down the stairs again
You might have to take it easy

Right
Alright
You ready Johnny?
You ready?
OK
Go!
He's at you again ray
He's at you again ray
He's at you again ray
Testing out your head space
