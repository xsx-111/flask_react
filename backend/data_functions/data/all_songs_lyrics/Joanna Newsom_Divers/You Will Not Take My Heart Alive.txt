You Will Not Take My Heart Alive LyricsAnd what do you remember most?
The line of the sea, seceding the coast?
Fine capillaries, glowing with cars?
The comfort you drew from the light of the stars?
And how long did you climb that night
With the ice in your lungs, on the rungs of the light?
Beyond recall, you severed all strings
To everyone, and everything
Oh, silent, constant driver of mine:
Wordlessly calling from the end of the line
Where, even though each hour I ever loved
Must queue and dive
Still, you will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart
In martial wind, and in clarion rain
We minced into battle, wincing in pain;
Not meant for walking, backs bound in twine:
Not angel or devil
But level, in time
And I rose, to take my shape at last
From the dreams that had dogged me, through every past
When, to my soul, the body would say:
You may do what you like
As long as you stay
Now the towns and forests, highways and plains
Fall back in circles like an emptying drain
And I won't come round this way again
Where the lonely wind abides
And you will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heartEmbed
