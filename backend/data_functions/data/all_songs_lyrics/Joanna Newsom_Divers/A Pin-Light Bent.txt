A Pin-Light Bent LyricsMy life comes and goes
My life comes and goes
Short flight, free rows:
I lie down and doze
My life came and went
My life came and went
Short flight; free descent
Poor flight attendant
But the sky, over the ocean!
And the ocean, skirting the city!
And the city, bright as a garden
(When the garden woke to meet me)
From that height was a honeycomb
Made of light from those funny homes, intersected:
Each enclosed, anelectric and alone
In our lives is a common sense
That relies on the common fence
That divides, and attends
But provides scant defense
From the Great Light that shines through a pin-hole
When the pin-light calls itself Selfhood
And the Selfhood inverts on a mirror
In an Amora Obscura
But it's mine. Or, at least, it's lent
And my life, until the time is spent
Is a pin-light, bent
It's a pin-light, bentEmbed
