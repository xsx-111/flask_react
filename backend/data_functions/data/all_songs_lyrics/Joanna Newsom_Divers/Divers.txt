Divers LyricsThe diver is my love
(And I am his, if I am not deceived)
Who takes one breath above, for every hour below the sea;
Who gave to me a jewel
Worth twice this woman's life (but would cost her less
Than laying at low tide
To see her true love phosphoresce)
And in an infinite regress:
Tell me, why is the pain of birth
Lighter borne than the pain of death?
I ain't saying that I loved you first
But I loved you best
I know we must abide
Each by the rules that bind us here:
The divers, and the sailors, and the women on the pier
But how do you choose your form?
How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life?
How do you choose the time you must exhale
And kick, and rise?
And in an infinite capsize:
Like a bull tearing down the coast
Double hulls bearing double masts —
I don’t know if you loved me most, but you loved me last
Recall the word you gave:
To count your way across the depths of this arid world
Where you would yoke the waves
And lay a bed of shining pearls!
I dream it every night:
The ringing of the pail
The motes of sand dislodged
The shucking, quick and bright;
The twinned and cast-off shells reveal a single heart of white
And in an infinite backslide:
Ancient border, sink past the West
Like a sword at the bearer's fall
I can't claim that I knew you best
But did you know me at all?
A woman is alive!
A woman is alive;
You do not take her for a sign in nacre on a stone
Alone, unfaceted and fine
And never will I wed
I'll hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life
And ever hold my breath
Till I may be the diver's wife
See how the infinite divides:
And the divers are not to blame
For the rift, spanning distant shores
You don’t know my name
But I know yours3Embed
