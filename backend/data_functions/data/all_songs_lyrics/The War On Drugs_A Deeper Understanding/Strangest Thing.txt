Strangest Thing Lyrics
Some are right underneath
And how I look today
I've been hiding out so long
I gotta find another way

Late at night, I wanna see you
Well, my eyes, they begin to fade
Am I just livin' in the space between
The beauty and the pain
And the real thing

Now the sky is painted
In a wash of indigo
I've been holdin' on too long
That I hardly know the score

I recognize every face
But I ain't got everything I need
If I'm just livin' in the space between
The beauty and the pain
It's the strangest thing

Yeah, should I surround my life?
Surrounded by the hole
Surrounded by no other
I wanna ride it home

Yeah, be the writer of your own story
Let it turn into you into love again
Yeah, be the writer of your own story
Let it turn into you into love again
I wanna run, I wanna run
Yeah, be the writer of your own story
Yeah, be the writer of your own story3Embed
