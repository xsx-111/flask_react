Holding On Lyrics
Once I was alive and I could feel
I was holding on to you
And I redefined the way I looked at dawn inside of you
I went down a crooked highway
I went all outside the line
I've been rejected, now the light has turned
And I'm out of time, yeah

Ain't no way I'm gonna last
Hiding in the seams, I can't move the past
Feel like I'm about to crash
Riding on my line I keep, keeping on, yeah, ooh

Once we were apart and I could see red
Never trying to turn back time
Never meant to bring my pain to the front
And into your life
Now I'm headed down a different road, yeah
Can we walk it side by side?
Is an old memory
Just another way of saying goodbye?

Ain't no way I'm gonna last
Hiding in the seams, I can't move the past
Feel like I'm about to crash
Riding the same line I keep, keeping on, yeah, ooh
I ain't never gonna change
He'll never get in line
I keep moving on the path, yeah
Holding on to mine
When we talk about the past
What are we talking of?
Did I let go too fast?
Was I holding on too long?
Ain't no truths from the past
As silent as the sea
I've been holding on too long
But you're right in front of me
Ain't no moving on a cast
Shadows on my seam
I keep moving to changes
Yeah, ooh

Heart or hope
Heart or hope
Heart or hope
Heart or hope3Embed
