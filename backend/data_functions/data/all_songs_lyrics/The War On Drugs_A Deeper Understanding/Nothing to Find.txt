Nothing to Find Lyrics
Oh, I'm rising from within
I see it every morning
Tell me where the river ends
"Is it cold without my love?"
I whisper through the screen
And there's nothing I can say or do, no in between

Oh, and all these changes, I don't understand
I keep movin' to the edge and now
Comes the feeling I can't stop
Laying motionless and dead
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah
Oh, you said

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, yeah

You played my brother like fire
And walked him through the rain
I ignored another call, he did the same
But the feeling that I get
The warmth of your embrace
There is nothing I can do or find another way
It was all so innocent
You could feel my loving arms
Then I saw you in the moving light
You were standing in my door
Laying motionless and bored
Ooh, ooh, yeah
I've been adorin', yeah, that river road

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

All my waiting was in vain
As I walked alone in pain
Through the early morning rain
Be the warmth to my embrace
Pull me underneath your shadow
Once before I get erased
But my love is on the line
I pushed it to the back
I kept sliding out of time
Now our moon is on the rise
There's always something bigger
Livin' on the other side, yeah
Ooh
Be the one that I need
On the road up ahead
I've been hangin' in and out of sight
Keep on pushing back
Leave it all on the hill
I'll take all I can get
I've been hangin' in and out of sight
I keep pushing backEmbed
