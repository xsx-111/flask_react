Knocked Down Lyrics
Far away, there is a star
Rainin' through the night sky like a drop
Give 'em all and be someone for me
Somehow I can make it rain
Diamonds in the night sky, I'm like a child
Now I'm all beaten up and weak

I wanna love you, but I get knocked down
I'm only shakin' 'cause I'm lyin' in the hole
I wanna shed it, but I can't break free
Anyway

Somewhere out there, look out, ma
It's like I'm raining in the night sky like a drop
Now you're all beaten up and weak
Somewhere they can make it rain
Diamonds in the night sky, I'm like a child
All alone, beaten up, free


I wanna love you, but I get knocked down
I wanna love you when I'm lyin' in the hole
I wanna shed it, but I can't break free
To be the one that I should dare to be
I wanna love you, but I get knocked down
I'm only shakin' 'cause I'm lyin' in the hole
I want to shed it, but I can't break free
AnywayEmbed
