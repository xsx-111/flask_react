In Chains Lyrics
Callin' out the words that I haven't done
Callin' out your name
Tryin' not to hate myself
For gettin' in the middle, shinin' every light upon it
Still, I miss the way you’d hold me close
In a cold wind
Caught you in our room starin' at the light, I’d been up all night
Is this life and we’re just livin' it?

Still I wanna celebrate
Our love, I
I’ve been rollin' on a sixteen, I can die on the floor
I’ve been shackled and delivered
There’s a girl out there with silence in her eyes
Her truth is in the dark

Yeah, I see you
Comin' in view
Yeah, I need you
I’m comin' in too
In view

Ain’t no wind that I could feel in the way of the wind
And I feel it
Turn around and rip my heart then look at it and say
How you broke away
Ain’t no way to elevate to another line
With nowhere to go
Ain’t no chains to hold you in, to hold you to
To losing you
Hiding from an enemy
When something inside me died
It’s hard to see real clear these days
With darkness on my mind
As I stare into the ocean floor
And I wonder where I once was
Was I fallin' through the air tonight
To crumble into your arms?

Is this love?
Are you sure?
Is it something
You can control?
I’m retired
I’m in chains
I’m in love
I’m in pain

All these changes everywhere
Just go ahead and take my hand
Hold me close, now let me go
Try and understand
I believe in all the power
In doing what we can do
We can try and learn to make it through
Then come out the other side
I don’t see you at all comin' in view
How do we decide what we can do?
I don't read your mind
Gimme truthEmbed
