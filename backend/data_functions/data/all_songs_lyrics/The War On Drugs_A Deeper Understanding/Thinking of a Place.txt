Thinking of a Place Lyrics
It was back in Little Bend that I saw you
Light was changing on the water
Where birds above had flown
There was pain in your eyes so you vanished in the night
Missouri River in the distance
So I lied upon the lawn

I remember walking against the darkness of the beach
Love is like a ghost in the distance, out of reach
Travel through the night 'cause there is no fear
Alone but right behind, 'til I watch you disappear

I'm movin' through the dark of a long black night
Just movin' with the moon and the light it shines
And I'm thinking of a place and it feels so very real
Just movin' through the dark

Once I had a dream I was fallin' from the sky
Comin' down like running water
Passin' by myself alight
In the morning, I would wake to the sound of someone's voice
Like little whispers through the silence
I'm movin' through the dark of a long black night
And I'm lookin' at the moon and the light it shines
But I'm thinking of a place and it feels so very real
Oh, sufferer of love

Come and take my hand, babe
There's a turn in the road that we've been takin'
Let it set you free
'Cause there's a rhythm in the way that we've been movin'
Yeah, there's a darkness over there, but we ain't goin'

See it through my eyes, walk me to the water
Hold my hand as something turns to me
Love me every night, drown me in the water
Hold my hand, is something turning me?
See it through my eyes, love me like no other
And hold my hand as something turns to me
And turns me into you
Lead me through tonight, pull me from the water
Hold my hand as something turns to me
Turns me into you
Just see it through my eyes, love me like no other
Hold my hand as something turns to me
Turns me into you
Turning me into you10Embed
