Up All Night Lyrics
I don't know
I've been away
Why I don't believe
In the real thing
I once got started
Then it all went black
Your love's got me
Like it always has
But it just stopped raining
I'm stepping out into the world
I'm stepping out into the light
Yeah

I've been through it
I always have
Paranoia
But it would not last
But I pinned it on you
Held it up and showed the world
Hold it up into the light
Once it's right between your eyes

You'll see it's right here
Look, it's glowing
It's not some feeling I can break
(Feeling, mm-mm
Feeling)
There's no way
If I hold on
Shots may ring
Through a lonely hall

I've been up all night
Spinning 'round on the floor
It's not some feeling I can break
I keep raising up, ma
I keep raising up my arms
It's not some feeling I can shake


There's no way
If I hold on
The shots may ring
Through a lonely hall
But the hole in my head
Emptied out into our love
Came pouring out into our life
Hold it up into the light
You'll see it's right here
Look, it's glowing, yeah
It's not some feeling I can shake
Yeah, yeah

I keep raising up, ma
Raising up, ma
Oh yeah
Am I made of something?
There's a pulling in me
Don't know how much I can take
I don't know anything
Ooh, ooh, ooh1Embed
