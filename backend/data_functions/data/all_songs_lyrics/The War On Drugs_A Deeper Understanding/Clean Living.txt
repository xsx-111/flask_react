Clean Living Lyrics
I waited all my life to come
Runnin' through the field when I see you
In the end, when you're young, you follow
Shadows even though they fade
Baby, oh

In the air was a red light shining
Shining on your life to come
Sometimes I lay in the darkness
Just to see if I can hear the spark

But I never went away, babe
Show me how you do it
I've been lookin' all night
Go away and back
Show me that you want it
I'm alone in life
All this living and no life

Once I was alone in a lonesome tower
You were livin' in my place
When I took the train up to see you
Everything that I couldn't change
But it never went away, babe
Show me how you do it
I've been lookin' all night
Go away and back
Show me that you notice
Been a long time
All this living and no life


I don't wanna have to make you
Show me how you do it
I've been lookin' all night
I went away and back
Show me that you noticed
Been a long time
I ain't giving in
I know my way around it
I've been doin' alright
And I don't need it back
