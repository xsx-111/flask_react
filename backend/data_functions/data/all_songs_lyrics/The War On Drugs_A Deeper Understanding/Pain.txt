Pain Lyrics
Go to bed now, I can tell
Pain is on the way out now
Look away, a domino falls away
I know it's hard lookin' in
Knowin' that tomorrow you'll be back again
Hang your head and let me in, I've been waitin'
So long

I was staring into the light
When I saw you in the distance and knew that you'd be mine
Am I moving back in time? Just standin' still?
I met a man with a broken back
He had a fear in his eyes that I could understand
I can't even shake the hand without breakin' it

I've been pullin' on a wire, but it just won't break
I've been turnin' up the dial, but I hear no sound
I resist what I cannot change
And I wanna find what can't be found


I'm aware you're tired and lost
Like a demon in a doorway, waiting to be born
But I'm here all alone, just beggin'
Pull me close and let me hold you in
Give me the deeper understanding of who I am
Yeah, I'm moving back again, I'm waiting here
I'm just pullin' on a wire, but it just won't break
I've been turnin' up a dial, but I hear no sound
I resist what I cannot change
Own it in your own way, yeah
Yeah, I wanna find what can't be found
