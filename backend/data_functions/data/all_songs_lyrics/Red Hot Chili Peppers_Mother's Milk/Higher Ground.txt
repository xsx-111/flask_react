Higher Ground Lyrics
People keep on learnin'
Soldiers keep on warrin'
The world keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Powers will keep on lyin'
While your people will keep on dyin'
The world keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long

So darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth, I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground

A-teachers a-keep on teachin'
A-preachers a-keep on preachin'
World, keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
Lovers a-keep on lovin'
While believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
So darn glad he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on Earth, I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin' 'til I reach the highest ground

And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's gonna bring me down
('Til I reach the highest ground)
'Cause me and Stevie, see, we're gonna be sailing on the fuckin' funky sound
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Bustin' out, and I'll break you out, 'cause I'm sailing on
('Til I reach the highest ground)
Just, uh, sailin' on, sailin' on the higher ground
('Til I reach the highest ground)4Embed
