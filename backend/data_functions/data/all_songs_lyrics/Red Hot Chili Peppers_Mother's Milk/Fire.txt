Fire Lyrics
Well, alright-a
Now, dig this

You don't care for me, I don't care 'bout that
You got a new fool, huh? I like it like that, ha-ha
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Oh, ah, could I make love with your fire?

Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, fire, fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Burnin', smoky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Aw, yeah)

Wah-huh
Now, just listen to this
Stop actin' so crazy
Say your mom ain't home, it ain't my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't get burned
I have only one burnin' desire
I'm gonna be doin' it in your fire

Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, fire, fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Aw, yeah)
Oh, move over, Rover, and let Mr. Huckleberry take over
You know he's bad, you know he drowns
You know who he gives it to, ya, ha-ha, yeah


That's right
Now, dig this

You try to give your money, you better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one a-burnin' desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire?

Let me stand next to your fire (Fire, funky fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Freaky, static fire)
Let me stand next to your fire (Oh, to your fire)
Let me stand next to your fire

You better slide yo ass over, girl
'Cause I'm comin' through once, and I'm comin' through once real hard
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ha, ha-ow, ha-yahEmbed
