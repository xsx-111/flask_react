Castles Made of Sand (Live) Lyrics
Down the street, you can hear her scream, "You're a disgrace!"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
All the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries, "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door, he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall, burn the garden green

And so, castles made of sand
Fall in the sea, eventually

Was an Indian, brave, too, before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian chief
Many moons passed, and the dream grew strong
'Til tomorrow, he would sing his first war song
Fought his first battle, but somethin' went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

And so, castles made of sand
Fall in the sea, eventually
Take it, Johnny!

There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
She was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop livin', so she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
To her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more."
But then, a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look a golden winged ship is passing my way!"
And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on goin'

And some castles made of sand
Sl-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-lipped in the sea, yeah, eventuallyEmbed
