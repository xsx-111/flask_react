Stone Cold Bush Lyrics
Ay ay ay ay ay

She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

Get up off your knees, come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to life, I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush
Ay ay ay ay ay

Haight Street's got nothing to show
Except the skirt on your ass
When you're living on the streets, you've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Aw, everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock
You do it oh, so well
She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush

She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby, that's alright
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And that's alright with me

She's got marble eyes
Sweet China doll, her thighs
An animal in pain, she starts to cry
Her pipes are open wide
She blows more than my mind
Echo sounds of soul time after time

She's stone cold bush
She's stone cold bush1Embed
