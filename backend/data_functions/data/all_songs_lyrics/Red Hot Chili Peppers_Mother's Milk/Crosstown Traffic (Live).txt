Crosstown Traffic (Live) Lyrics
You jump in front of my car
When you know all the time
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a lil' pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride

You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
Tryin' to get on the other side of town

I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red?
And with you, I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
Tryin' to get on the other side of town
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
Well, aw yeah (crosstown traffic)
Aye, aye, aye, be easy on 'em (crosstown traffic)
Aye, aye, don't fuck 'em up (crosstown traffic)
(Crosstown traffic) Well, aw yeah
(Crosstown traffic) All I need is to run over you
(Crosstown traffic) One more time for the band in blueEmbed
