Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky Lyrics
…Does that star-spangled banner yet wave?
Ha-ha-ha

I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I, I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
Goddamn what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced

Cop on
Sick a dig on
Right back

Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I
What do I… why?
Puts us in your pumpkin shell, where you keep us very well
It's Hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie, no place for me
I bleed

Bo-bo
Get your dig on
Bo-bo

Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I decide to defy

Kill my trust if you must, but in my blood, there is the lust for life
That's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing though me a-like a shark
Crashing though the dark
Bo-bo
Sick a dig on
Step back

Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I-I, I can fight, confide

What am I supposed to do?
I feel like I'm cut in two, confused by rules
Do these two cultures clash, or am I living in the past?
I ask, please tell me fast

Bo-bo
Sick a dig on
Right back
Won't somebody testify? Kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky)
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
(Testify, testify kick a hole right in the sky)
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I
I, that's right

To what do I belong, and if I change, will I be wrong?
Be wrong, that's wrong
I took my foot and kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead. Will fathers help me decide?
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple-black sky
The red cloud rains, and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on me like the mornin' sun
I'm a part of two worlds, and the mornin' comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I'm a master of a destin' and I got to take action
I'm a man, the animal manEmbed
