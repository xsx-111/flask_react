Sexy Mexican Maid (Original Long Version) Lyrics
Uh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh
Aw yeah

Hair so smooth, black as coal
Aw, baby, the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue, that you take my blues away
She comes and goes, that I know, aw
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist, I kiss your lips
You're my sexy Mexican maid

She cums
She cums
She cums
Lemme please get on my knees (She cums)
I come alone

When I wake up in the morn', she greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that it's a bright and sunny day
So serene, she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say? She's my sexy Mexican maid
She puts me in a bubble bath
She tickles me, and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean, then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow, then we make it very fastEmbed
