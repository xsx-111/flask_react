Knock Me Down (Original Long Version) Lyrics
Never too soon to be through
Bein' cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Every turn lookin' to burn
Some never learn, live and learn
Stop your searchin' for a curse
Before you end up in a hearse
Don't be afraid to show your friends that you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life, don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie
Don't slip away and don't forget
I'll give you more than you can get
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
Come to me

If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life

I'm tired of bein' untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you, and you're part of me
Why did you go away?
Too late to tell you how I feel
I want you back, but I get real
Can you hear my fallin' tears
Makin' rain where you lay?
Findin' what you're lookin' for can end up bein', bein' such a bore
I pray for you, most every day
My love's with you, now fly away
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life

If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Knock me, knock me, knock me)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Knock me, knock me, knock me)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, hey, aah-aah-aah-aah, yeah, yeah
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, hey, aah-aah-aah-aah, yeah, yeah

It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself (Aah-aah, oh, oh, oh, hey, yeah)
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself (Oh, oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, yeah)
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourselfEmbed
