Punk Rock Classic Lyrics
I'm a radio joe of the biz called show
I'm a rockin' pop star with a get up and go
Rubbin' elbows with the big wigs at my sold out shows
I've been on every cover, even Rolling Stone

Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

Conformin' to the norm straight out of the mold
Compromisin' each and every ounce of soul
I'm a-doin' anything for the records of gold
I only want what I can hold

Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

We know that we'll never be better than
Mister slick superstar David Letterman
I promise we're perfect gentlemen
Just put us on the show, you'll regret us then
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

Thank you very much! Be sure to label us
We wouldn't want to cause a ruckus or a fuss
Just put us in a category, if you must
AOR, CHR, Top Forty or Bust

Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please

Go, Arnito!


What I am is a picture on the TV screen
Don't make waves, don't make a scene
What I say when I play isn't worth a bean
I'm a video joe in an industry
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please
