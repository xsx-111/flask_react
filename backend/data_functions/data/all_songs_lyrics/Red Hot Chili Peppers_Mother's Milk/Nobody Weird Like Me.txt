Nobody Weird Like Me Lyrics
Mm-mm-mm
Gonna eat ya alive
Ooh

The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Livin' my life in and out the twilight zone

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walkin' totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Oh, I love ya
And love ya, too

Intercourse with a porpoise is a dream for me
Hell-bent on inventing a new species

Bust my britches, bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature, walkin' totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Gonna eat ya alive

Ridin' down the path on the back a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed 'cause I passed some gas

Bust my bitches, bless my ho
I'm a freak of nature, walkin' totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me

Enchanted as a rabbit that my life is a dream
Well, everything never just as it seems

The freakiest show I know is the show of my own
Livin' my life in and out the twilight zone
Yeah, yeah, you for free

Open my eyes, the developing sky
Sky is high I do reply
I'm on the way, nobody ask why
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh1Embed
