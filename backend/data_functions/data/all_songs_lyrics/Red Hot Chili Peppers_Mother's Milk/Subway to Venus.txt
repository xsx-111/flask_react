Subway to Venus Lyrics
Step right up and listen, please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Well, well, everybody a-gather 'round, all aboard the underground
You gotta get in before you get out
Gettin' out what it gonna be about
Well if you find that you are blind
Open up your bashful mind
Let my band step inside
Take you on a cosmic ride
A-let my band step inside
Take you on a cosmic ride
With honest sounds, I'll paint your brain
For in this song, I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip, you'll ride for free
As we leave, I'll trade us spots
Where outer space is not so dark
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily

Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid, you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw, be my guest inside my grove
'Cause what I got to give to you
Is gonna make you wanna boogalulu
I'll make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll

Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, a subway to Venus

Oh, what I got to give to you
Is gonna make you wanna boogalulu
I'll make you wiggle like a wiggly worm
'Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Well, take your body, a-shake it around
And do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make ya piss ya pants
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus
Space is king oh, oh, or so I sing, subway to VenusEmbed
