Magic Johnson Lyrics
LA Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a badass fact
A claim that remains intact

M-A-G-I-C, see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C, Magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams
But he don't give a fuck
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes Magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck
Scott stops, pops, and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named AC Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk

I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is comin' to your town and he's gonna make rubble
LA Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a badass fact, a claim that remains intact

M-A-G-I-C, I see your purple and gold
You can swim, but you won't get far
So you might as well go home
M-A-G-I-C in Buck we trust
Restoring order to the court, and justice is a must
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
'Cause they've got more moves than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum that deafens my ears
The one and only known of his kind sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for bein' bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar, all-time great super, superstar

I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is comin' to your town and he's gonna make rubble

Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)
Does anybody want some (Magic Johnson?)
LA Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a badass fact, a claim that remains intactEmbed
