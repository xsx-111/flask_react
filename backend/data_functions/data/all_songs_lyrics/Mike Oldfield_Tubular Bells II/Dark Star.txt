Dark Star LyricsAway to the westward
I'm longing to be
Where the beauties of heaven
Unfold by the sea;
Where the sweet purple heather blooms
Fragrant and free
On a hilltop high above
The Dark Island
So gentle the sea breeze
That ripples the bay
Where the stream joins the ocean
And young children play;
On the strand of pure silver
I'll welcome each day
And I'll roam for every more
The Dark Island
True gem of the Herbrides
Bathed in the light
Of the mid-summer dawning
That follows the night;
How I yearn for the cries
Of the seagulls in flight
As they circle above
The Dark IslandEmbed
