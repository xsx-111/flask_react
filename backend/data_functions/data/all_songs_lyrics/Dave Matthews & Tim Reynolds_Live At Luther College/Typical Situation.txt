Typical Situation Lyrics"I hope you all having a good time so far tonight, I hope you're enjoying yourselves
'cos you're being so attentive and and and and and and and that's really graceful of you
And I and eh and eh thank you all very much I hope you're having a good time"
Ten fingers counting we have each
Nine planets around the Sun repeat
Eight ball will last if you triumphant be
Seven oceans pummel the shores of the sea
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices, baby
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices, yeah
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different?
Why are you that way?
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
It all comes down to nothing
Six senses feeling five
Around a sense of self
Four seasons turn on and turn off
I can see three corners from this corner
Two's a perfect number
But one
Well Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different?
Why are you that way?
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
Ohh Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different?
Why are you that way?
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
It all comes down to nothing
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices, yeah
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices
We can't do a thing about it
Too many choices, yeah
It's a typical situation
In these typical times
Too many choices, yeah yeah
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different?
Why are you that way?
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different?
Why are you that way?
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
We'll keep the big door open
And everyone'll come around
Why are you different?
Why are you that way?
If you don't get in line
We'll lock you away
Everybody's happy
Everybody's free
If you don't get in line
You'll wait and see
Everybody's different
Everybody's different
Everybody's different
Everybody's sameEmbed
