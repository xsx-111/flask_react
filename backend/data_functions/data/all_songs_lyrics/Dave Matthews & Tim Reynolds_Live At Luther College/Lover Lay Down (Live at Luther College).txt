Lover Lay Down (Live at Luther College) LyricsSpring sweet rhythm dance in my head
Slip into my lover's hands
Kiss me oh won’t you kiss me now
And sleep I would inside your mouth
Don't be us too shy
Knowing it's no big surprise
That I will wait for you
I will wait for no one but you
Look please lover lay down
Spend this time with me
Together share this smile
Lover lay down
Walk with me, walk with you
Hold my hand your hands
So much we have dreamed
And you were so much younger
Hard to explain that we are stronger
A million reasons life to deny
Let’s toss them away
See you and me we
Lay down look see
She and he
By my lover's side
Together share this smile
Each other's tears to cry
Together share this smile
Lover lay down
Oh please
Look please lover lay down
Oh please lover lay down
And you weep
Lover lay down
Cause it's over
Lover lay down
Say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover, say lover
Could I love you
Could you love me (4x)
Darling it's
All the same (4x)
'Til we dance away (4x)
Chasing me all around
Leading me all around
Leading me all around in circles (2x)
