Dancing Nancies (Live at Luther College) Lyrics
See... so I watched the Pink Panther last night, and so I'm trying desperately to be funny... and then... this is not working out so good... ahh... (unintelligible mumbling)
I wonder, maybe I coulda been a comedian or something
Or maybe I coulda been a doctor and then I wouldn't have to make anyone laugh
Could I have been somebody other than myself?
I wonder sometimes
I wonder

He stands touch his hair his shoes untied
Tongue gaping stare
Could I have been a magnet for money?
Could have been anyone other than me?
Twenty three and so tired of life
Such a shame to throw it all away
The images grow darker still
Could I have been anyone other than me?
Then I look up at the sky
My mouth is open wide lick and taste
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying
Turn turn we almost become dizzy
I am who I am who I am well who am I
Requesting some enlightenment
Could I have been anyone other than me
And then I'll
Sing and dance
I'll play for you tonight
The thrill of it all
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes
But I'll work it out
And then I
Look up at the sky
My mouth is open wide lick and taste
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying
Turn turn we almost become dizzy
Falling out of a world of lies
Could I have been a dancing Nancy a dancing Nancy
Could I have been anyone other than me?Embed
