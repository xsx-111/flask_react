#41 (Live at Luther College) LyricsCome and see
I swear by now I'm playing time against my troubles
Oh I'm, I'm coming slow, but speeding
Do you wish a dance and while I'm in the front
My play on time is won
Oh, but the difficulty's coming here
Well, I will go in this way
And I find my own way out
I won't tell you to stay
But I'm coming to much more
Me
All at once, the ghosts come back
Reeling in you now
Oh, what if they came in crushing?
Used to play for
All of the loneliness that nobody notices now
Oh, begging slow, I'm coming here
Oh, I'm waiting
I wanted to stay
I wanted to play
I wanted to love you
I'm only this far
And only tomorrow leads my way
Coming waltzing back and pushing into your head
Please
I wouldn't pass you by
Oh, I wouldn't take anymore what
What sort of man goes by?
But I will bring water
Why won't you ever be glad?
It melts into wonder
But no one praying for you
Why won't you run into the rain and play
And let tears splash all over you?Embed
