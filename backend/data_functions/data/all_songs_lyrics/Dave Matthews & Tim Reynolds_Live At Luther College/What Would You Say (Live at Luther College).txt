What Would You Say (Live at Luther College) Lyrics
Up and down the puppies' hair
Fleas and ticks jump everywhere
Cause of original sin
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill
And you came tumbling after
Cause of original sin

Rip away the tears
Drink a hope to happy years
And you may find
A lifetime's passed you by

What would you say
Don't drop the big one
If you a monkey on a string
Don't cut my lifeline
If you a doggie on a chain
Don't bite the mailman
What would you say

I was there when the bear
Ate his head, thought it was a candy
Everyone goes in the end
Knock knock on the door
Who's it for, there's nobody in here
Look in the mirror my friend
I don't understand at best
I cannot speak for all the rest
In the morning rise a lifetime's passed me by

What would you say
(don't' drop the big one)
If you a monkey on a string
(Don't cut my life line)
If you a doggie on a chain
(Don't bite the mailman)
What would you say

Every dog has it's day, every day has it's way
Of being forgotten- "Mom it's my birthday"
Would you say
What would you say
What would you say
"What could you say"

I was there when the bear
Ate his head, thought it was a candy
Everyone goes in the end
Knock knock on the door
Who's it for, there's nobody in here
Look in the mirror my friend
I don't understand at best
Cannot speak for all the rest
Morning rise a lifetime's passed me by
What would you say

What would you say
(don't' drop the big one)
If you a monkey on a string
(Don't cut my life line)
If you a doggie on a chain
(Don't bite the mailman)
What would you sayEmbed
