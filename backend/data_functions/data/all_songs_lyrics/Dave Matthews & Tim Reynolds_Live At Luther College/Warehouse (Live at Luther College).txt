Warehouse (Live at Luther College) LyricsHey reckless mind
Don't throw away your playful beginnings
You and I, will fumble around in the touches
And be sure to leave all the lights on
And the black cat changing colors
And we can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide turns you around and around, love
Hey we have found
Becoming one in a million
Slip into the crowd
This question I found in a gap in the sidewalk
Keep all your sights on
And the black cat changing colors
And you can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide choose to turn you away
Said, Life goes on
End of tunnel, TV sets
Spot in the middle
Static fade, statistical bit
Soon I'll fade away, I'll fade away
Oh, but this I admit tastes so good
Hard to believe an end to it
Smell touch feel
How could this rhythm ever quit
Bags packed on a plane
Hopefully to heaven, yeah
Shut up I'm thinking
I had a clue, now it's gone forever
Sitting over these bones
You can read in whatever you're needing to
Keep all your sights on
Yeah man the black cat changing colors
And not the colors that matter
But that we all fade away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And Aye...
(Unintelligible)
And fade away, oh fade away
And its all to hard to admit
Oh seems so good
I can't believe it's gonna end
Oh and turn...
(Unintelligible)
Soon I'll fade away
(Unintelligible)
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Ooh, I'd love to stay, yeah
Here inside the warehouse
Where our blood is flowing
The warehouse
Where the hearts are bumping
The warehouse
Where the things seem to be going
The warehouse
Wouldn't you love to stay here
The warehouse
Don't you love to stay here
The warehouse
We're overexcited
The warehouse
Don't you love to stay here
The warehouse
Every man and woman lookin' like yeah
That's our blood down there
Seems poured from the hands of angels
But trickled into the ground
Leave the warehouse so bare and empty
And my heart's numbered beats
Will echo in this empty room
And the fear wells in me
But nothing seems big enough to stay
So I am going away
I'm going away
Lucky luck todayEmbed
