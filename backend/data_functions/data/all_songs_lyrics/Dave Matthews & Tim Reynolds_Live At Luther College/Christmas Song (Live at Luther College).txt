Christmas Song (Live at Luther College) LyricsShe was his girl, he was her boyfriend
She'd be his wife, and make him her husband
A surprise on the way, any day, any day
One healthy little giggling, dribbling baby boy
The Wise Men came, three made their way
To shower him with love
While he lay in the hay
Shower him with love, love, love
Love love, love
Love, love was all around
Not very much of his childhood was known
Kept his mother Mary worried
Always out on his own
He met another Mary who for a reasonable fee
Less than reputable was known to be
His heart was full of love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love was all around
When Jesus Christ was nailed to his tree
Said "Oh, Daddy-o, I can see how it all soon will be
I came to shed a little light on this darkening scene
Instead I fear I spill the blood of my children all around."
The blood of my children all around
The blood of my children's all around
So I'm told, so the story goes
The people he knew were
Less than golden-hearted
Gamblers and robbers
Drinkers and jokers
All soul searchers
Like you and me
Like you and me
Rumors insisted he soon would be
For his deviations taken into custody
By the authorities, less informed than he
Drinkers and jokers
All soul searchers
Searching for love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love was all around
Preparations were made
For his celebration day
He said, "Eat this bread, think of it as me
Drink this wine and dream it will be
The blood of our children all around
The blood of our children's all around
The blood of our children all around"
Father up above
Why in all this hatred do you fill me up with love, love, love?
Love, love, love
Love, love was all around
Father up above
Why in all this hatred do you fill me up with love?
Fill me love, love, love
Love, love, love
All you need is
Love, love, love
You can't buy me
Love, love, love
Love, love
And the blood of our children all aroundEmbed
