One Sweet World (Live at Luther College) Lyrics
Nine planets around the sun
Only one does the sun embrace
Upon this watered one
So much we take for granted

So let us sleep outside tonight
Lay down in our mother's arms
For here we can rest safely

If green should turn to grey
Would our hearts still bloody beat?
If the mountains tumble away, the river dry
Would it stop the stepping feet?

So let us sleep outside tonight
Lay down in our motherâ€™s arms
For here we can rest safely

Take all that we can get
When it's done
Nobody left to bury here
Nobody left to dig the holes
And here we can rest safely
One sweet world
Around a star is spinning
One sweet world
And in her breath, I'm swimming
And here I will rest in peaceEmbed
