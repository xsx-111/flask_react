Deed Is Done LyricsOh, Pray
Oh, Pray
Oh, so I'm praying all at night
And I wake up praying the whole daylight
I pray to you, and hear my request
I ask of you to save this baby
Oh, look at the girl
Awful inside, is cancer-eaten, is life-deprived
And if so by who? Could it be you?
I see no need for a baby's wisdom for you
Oh, God, the girl, all yellow turned
Her cheeks are swollen, and soul is burned
Oh, but the girl, the girl is gone
And the deed is done, oh it must be wrong
Check it down, check it down down
Oh and I pray, my prayer's not heard
Could it be you're deaf, deaf to mortal words?
Oh, and see her pain, and drain and drain
Could you be deaf, and blind my friend?
Oh, and so we hold
Can you not hear? Can you not see?
And if with words
You could change the way things are arranged
Surely you'd be speaking, speaking no change
Oh, but the girl, deaf, dumb, and blind
From the cancer burning deep down inside
Oh, but the deed is done
And the girl is gone
And I see no faith
That I have won
Check it down, check it down, yeah
Well, you may find your religion
You may find your attraction
You may go, for me the girl is gone
Oh, you may find you're faithful
You may find out the reaction
But to me the baby is gone
The baby...
Hey... hey...Embed
