No Promises Lyrics
Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide

Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say It

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on

Oh no, we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before, don't even say It
Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

Cause I've been living only for this moment
And I don't wanna let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
Yeah baby, please no promises
Baby please no promises
Baby please
Baby please no promises14Embed
