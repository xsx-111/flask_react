How to Forget Lyrics
Give her space, give her speed
Give her anything she needs
Get her out of here
Give her weed, give her wine
Give her anything but time
Get her out of here

She won't stop telling stories, and most of them are true
She knew me back before I fell for you
I was strained, I was sad, didn't realize what I had
It was years ago
I was sick, I was scared, I was socially impaired
It was years ago
My past's a scary movie, I watched and fell asleep
Now I'm dreaming up these creatures from the deep

Teach me how to forget, replace the character set
Teach me how to unlearn a lesson
Teach me how to forget, cause I ain't sorry just yet
Teach me how to unlearn a lesson

Have a seat, have a drink, tell the jury what you think
Was I good to you?
Was it hell, was it fun, did you think I was the one
Was I good to you?
Now that I found someone who makes me wanna live
Does that make my leaving harder to forgive?
Teach me how to forget, replace the character set
Teach me how to unlearn a lesson
Teach me how to forget, cause I ain't sorry just yet
Teach me how to unlearn a lesson
Teach me how to forget, replace the character set
Teach me how to unlearn a lesson
Teach me how to forget, cause I ain't sorry just yet
Teach me how to unlearn a lesson3Embed
