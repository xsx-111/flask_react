If It Takes a Lifetime Lyrics
I've been working here, Monday, it'll be a year
And I can't recall a day when I didn't wanna disappear
But I keep on showing up, hell-bent on growing up
If it takes a lifetime

I'm learning how to be alone, fall asleep with the TV on
And I fight the urge to live inside my telephone
I keep my spirits high, find happiness by and by
If it takes a lifetime

I got too far from my raising, I forgot where I come from
And the line between right and wrong was so fine
Well I thought the highway loved me
But she beat me like a drum
My day will come, if it takes a lifetime

I don't keep liquor here, never cared for wine or beer
And working for the county keeps me pissin' clear
The nights are dry as dust, but I'm letting my eyes adjust
If it takes a lifetime

I got too far from my raising, I forgot where I come from
And the line between right and wrong was so fine
Well I thought the highway loved me
But she beat me like a drum
My day will come, if it takes a lifetime
Man is the product of all the people that he ever loved
And it don't make a difference how it ended up
If I loved you once my friend, oh, I can do it all again
If it takes a lifetime

We got too far from our raising and we fought 'til we went numb
You were running up a mountain in your own mind
And I thought that I was running to what I was running from
Oh, our day will come, if it takes a lifetime
Our day will come, if it takes a lifetime2Embed
