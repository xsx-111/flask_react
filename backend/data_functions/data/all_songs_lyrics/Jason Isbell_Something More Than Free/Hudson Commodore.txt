Hudson Commodore Lyrics
In the time between the glory days and the golden years
She did the work of twenty able men
Sent Tommy off to school to be an engineer
And Sarah went to try out all her sins
She took to takin' tea out in the Belvedere
Bourbon in the evenings by the fire
As if The Great Depression never made it here
As if she had defeated her desire

She just wanted to ride in a Delahaye 135
She just wanted to ride in a Hudson Commodore
No need to worry anymore

A doctor, then a lawyer, then a Roosevelt
Tried to take her underneath the wing
When she was in her twenties in the Bible Belt
Before she knew she didn't need a thing
She didn't need their pity on a single girl
She didn't need their help to raise the brood
She wouldn't be returning to her daddy's world
She didn't want a better attitude

She just wanted to ride in a Delahaye 135
She just wanted to ride in a Hudson Commodore
No need to worry anymore
She just wanted to ride in a Delahaye 135
She just wanted to ride in a Hudson Commodore
No need to worry anymore5Embed
