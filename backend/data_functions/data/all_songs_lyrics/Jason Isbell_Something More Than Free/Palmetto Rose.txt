Palmetto Rose LyricsPalmetto rose in the AC vent
Cross stitched pillow where the head rest went
Said his cab was his orneriest friend
Left hand jumping trees in the wind
Thought he had the red lights memorized
Glass in the gravel like the stars in the sky
In that slow motion minute between living and dead
Looked in my eyes and he told me, he said
This war that I wage to get up every day
It's a fiberglass boat, it's azaleas in May
It's the women I love and the law that I hate
Lord let me die in the Iodine State
Lord let me die in the Iodine State
Palmetto rose in the sidewalk mud
Pearly white stem and a big green bud
Catch him coming out of a King Street store
Bullshit story about the Civil War
You can believe what you want to believe
But there ain't no making up a basket weave
Everybody in the tri-county knows
Who makes the best palmetto rose
And it's war that we wage to get up every day
It's a basket of sweetgrass, a wedding bouquet
It's the ladies I love and the law that I hate
But Lord let me die in the Iodine State
Lord let me die in the Iodine State
Out on Sullivan's Island, they're swimming
On the beach where the big boats rolled in
With the earliest slaves and their children
Our first American kin
Here on King Street we're selling our roses
Two for a five dollar bill
And tonight after everything closes
I'll follow my own free will
And I've taken my fill
I've taken my fill4Embed
