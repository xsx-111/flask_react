Futurology Lyrics
Defenders of the faith
With cruel hearts they make
You scarred and insecure
Scared to say a word
We've all fallen prey
To keep the wolves at bay

We'll come back one day
We never really went away
Went away
One day we will return
No matter how much it hurts
And it hurts

We've all killed some ants
All had broken plans
All failed ourselves
We've done the best we can
A magnifying glass
With questions left to ask
