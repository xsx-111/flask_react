Antisocialmanifesto LyricsSometimes I barely even recognise
I never felt the need to justify
And on and on and on it goes
I'm never tempted to ask or include
I'm always happier to self delude
And on and on and on it goes
Anti social manifesto
We all love our imperfection
Anti social manifesto
I want to avoid human contact
I am awkward amongst people
Stupid angry and so weakened
Emblematic
Symptomatic
Problematic
PsychopathicEmbed
