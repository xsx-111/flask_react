Empty Motorcade Lyrics
I am riding with the empty motorcade
All the politicians have left the stage
The spectre of the high street, the ghost towns return
The out of town cathedrals suffocate and control

We were young, and yet we were old
We were bought, and yet we were sold
We were body, and yet we were soul
We were rust, and yet we were gold

I am riding with the empty motorcade
Digital terrorists will remember these days
My eyes can't look into yours anymore
They are too scared to see what they once saw

We were young, and yet we were old
We were bought, and yet we were sold
We were body, and yet we were soul
We were rust, and yet we were gold

We were young, and yet we were old
We were bought, and yet we were sold
We were body, and yet we were soul
We were rust, and yet we were goldEmbed
