Blistered Mirrors Lyrics
Blistered mirrors
Distance lingers
Broken fingers
Bandaged together
Blistered mirrors
Sad and disfigured
Odd and impatient
Unlikely but human

These blistered mirrors stare back at me
They've slowly brought me to my knees
A heartbreak so pure, its killing is so clear
The best of times now fill me with tears
The best of times now fill me with tears

And capitalism
Neither rules or defines
It's virtual anarchy
That is the real crime
My hands are held high
The white flag is raised
I implore you all
Together, let's fail
Together, let's fail
These blistered mirrors stare back at me
They've slowly brought me to my knees
A heartbreak so pure, its killing is so clear
The best of times now fill me with tears
The best of times now fill me with tearsEmbed
