Misguided Missile Lyrics
I am a self obsessed fool
Self centered and bruised
I am a misguided missile
Consumed with denial

I am the Sturm und Drang
I am the schadenfreude
I was the boy who sang
I can still fill your void
Still fill your void

I am crawling into corners
I am a sky about to fall in
I am a sea about to part
A tiny piece of malcontent

I am the Sturm und Drang
I am the schadenfreude
I was the boy who sang
I can still fill your void
Still fill your void
Society never made an effort with me
And I was willing to be deceived
To understand your country you must understand yourself
It leads you to the path of least resistance
I destroyed the image of myself
Borrowed from pain and tolerance

I am the Sturm und Drang
I am the schadenfreude
I was the boy who sang
I can still fill your void
Still fill your void1Embed
