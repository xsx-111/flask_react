Sex, Power, Love and Money Lyrics
It reads like a novel within a sigh
It's cold, it's truthful, it really never lies
No black, no white, no left, no right
Just four simple words that will not be denied
Self created for self defence
Self esteem is self indulged
I guess we've ridden the back of love
Set fire to tears as they reign from above

Obsession
Possession
Confession
Recession

Sex, power, love and money
Sex, power, love and money

Upload your future and download your past
Lament for the weak for they will be crushed
We could have been heroes but failure's more fun
Predictive and powerless, it's now self engulfed
It reads like a novel within a sigh
It's cold, it's truthful, it really never lies
No black, no white, no left, no right
Just four simple words that will not be denied
Obsession
Possession
Confession
Recession

Sex, power, love and money
