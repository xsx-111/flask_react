Between the Clock and the Bed Lyrics
I’m well aware of happiness
And what it takes to get to it
But the simple struggle of survival
Transforms itself into betrayal

Between the clock and the bed
There’s only space and hell
Waiting for the transportation
Between the clock and the bed
Shapes move inside my head
Colliding with shared desperation

Yes I’m as guilty as the rest
A man of little consequence
Unable of forgiving himself
Still building the bypass in my head


Hatred and failure go perfectly together
Like the quick and the sand beautiful and damned
I live through these moments again and again
Repeated images of enemies and friendsEmbed
