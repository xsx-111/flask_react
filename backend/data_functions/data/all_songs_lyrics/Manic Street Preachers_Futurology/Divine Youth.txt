Divine Youth LyricsArms around each other
Fate falling in the distance
Eyes with the look of yesterday
The weakest in the gang
The last to feel alone
No luck in your tender bones
And I sing to myself
My civil wars within
The victories and failures
I daily lose and win
And money it just buys
A new way to disguise
A freedom you don’t own anymore
Divine youth is lying in
A battered and a bruised skin
I wear but don’t recognise
And I sing to myself
My civil wars within
The victories and failures
I daily lose and win
The kids are growing old
In a digital haze
Is it evolution in the virtual age
And I sing to myself
My civil wars within
The victories and failure
I daily lose and win1Embed
