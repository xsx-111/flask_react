The Next Jet to Leave Moscow Lyrics
An old jaded commie walking in Red Square
With rediffusion eyes of yesteryear
I'm the biggest flaming hypocrite you'll ever see
Because the market never lies and your conscience is so clean

So take your badges off and do your show
Then catch the next flight to leave Moscow

So you played in Cuba, did you like it, brother?
I bet you felt proud, you silly little fucker
And all the 60s dreamers called us English
Said we'd started something that they could finish

So take your badges off and do your show
Then catch the next jet to leave MoscowEmbed
