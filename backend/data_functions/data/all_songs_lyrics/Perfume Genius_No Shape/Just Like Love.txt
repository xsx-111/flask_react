Just Like Love Lyrics
Sleeve cut just off the shoulder
You are christening the shape
They'll talk
Give them every reason
For child, you walk...

Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love

Slick, sheen, so bright, it's a bother
You are cultivating grace
They're rough
Smother them with velvet
For child, you walk...

Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
When it happens again
Baby, hold on and stare them down
When it happens again
Baby, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
Just like love
