Wreath Lyrics
Burn off every trace
I wanna hover with no shape
I wanna feel the days go by
Not stack up
Running up that hill
I'm gonna call out every name
Until the one I'm meant to take
Sends her dove

I see the sun go down
I see the sun come up
I see a light beyond the frame
I see the sun go down
I see the sun come up
I see a wreath upon the grave

Needless, free
No light, no sound
Gone and spent
I'm high, I'm out

I see the sun go down
I see the sun come up
I'm moving just beyond the frame
I see the sun go down
I see the sun come up
I see a wreath upon the grave
Burn off every trace
I wanna hover with no shape
I wanna feel the days go by
Not stack up
Running up that hill
I'm gonna peel off every weight
Until my body gives away
And shuts up

I see the sun go down
I see the sun come up
I'm moving just beyond the frame
I see the sun go down
I see the sun come up
I see a wreath upon the grave2Embed
