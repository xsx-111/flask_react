Die 4 You Lyrics
Limit every second left
Until I'm off balance
Oh, love
I'm there in spirit, ooh
Each and every breath I spend
You are collecting

Oh, love
See it through
I would die for you

Each and every breath I spend
You are collecting, mm
Limit every second left
'Til I'm off balance, mm
Each and every breath I spend

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Take your time
Oh, my love, take your time
Oh, my love, oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love
Take your time
Oh, my love, take your time
See it through7Embed
