Run Me Through Lyrics
Pitted, deep-lined eyes
Rough as last night
Sharp as a mirror
Broke in two
Run me through
No ins, just outs
Pumping ichor
Bucket my mouth

Satin-matte my dewiness
Skin so soft, it sickens
Cut right through
Stretched outside
Salt and lime
Wear me like a leather
Just for youEmbed
