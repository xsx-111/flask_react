Sides Lyrics
Look
Sometimes you forget
To just let me in a bit
Baby, just -
Where do you go sometimes
Idle and empty-eyed?
Why still no love?
Fight
This loop is wearing thin
And I won't be here when it ends
Baby, trust

Lately, baby
I've been hiding away
Don't wanna start our game
That we play
Baby, if it ain't easy to love me
Baby, cut the cord and set me free
How many times I leave
When I used to stay
I'm a fool
For the games we play
Wish I had the
Strength to leave
Running free
A million tired things
That you used to say
Don't want to watch
The world we made break
And it's never too late to stay
Hold me right
Don't cut me down
Baby, it ain't easy to loveEmbed
