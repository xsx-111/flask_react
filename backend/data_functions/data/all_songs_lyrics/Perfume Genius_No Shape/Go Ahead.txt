Go Ahead Lyrics
What you think?
I don't remember asking
What you mean?
Baby, take a seat
Now watch me
Watch me walk on by
Honestly
Next one won't be free

Go ahead
Go ahead and try
Go ahead
Go ahead and try

If you need
To take a moment, take a moment
If you need
You can even say
A little prayer for me
Baby, I'm already
Walking in the light

Go ahead
Go ahead and try
Go ahead
Go ahead and tryEmbed
