The Chase Lyrics{Intro}
Aaaah aaaah aaah
What is it now
There's something I see in your face
Feel like a fox
Hounds close at heels at the chase
Do I see blood in your eyes, babe
Is it the end of the race
Aaaaah aaaaah aaaaaaah
{Instrumental break}
Hunted me out
Sapped me of strength and of will
Showered affections
Baited me, loved me until
My defenses and cautions were gone, babe
And you did it just for the thrill
Aaaaaaaah aaaaaaah aaaaaaaaah

Tally-ho! Tally-ho!Embed
