The Breeze LyricsGoing through shops and bars and houses
Blowing through stores in skirts and trousers
Following taxis, hanging on buses
Meadows, fields, in between rushes
Nobody knows, nobody sees
I am the breeze
Blowin’ the dust from sphinxes’ smiles
Scattering cents for miles and miles
Cooling bathers lying on beaches
Stealing through watches of pears and peaches
Nobody knows, nobody sees
I am the breeze
Wishing my way through parks and flowers
Gasworks, bridges, cooling towers
Caravans, horses, gypsy campfires
Through church steeples, elegant spires
Nobody knows, nobody sees
I am the breezeEmbed
