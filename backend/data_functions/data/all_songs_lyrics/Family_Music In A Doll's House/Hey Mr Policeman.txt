Hey Mr Policeman Lyrics
Hey mr policeman, one minute bail
Can I see her one time
Before I make jail
I cared for that woman
I cared for that woman
Cared for that woman, cared for that woman
The things I don't tell
Hey there driver
Wait for me here
Don't stop the engine
Keep out of gear
Last time I see her
The last time I see her
Last time I see her
Last time I see her
For many a year

Hey there woman
Seen me last time
Don't give a nickel
Don't give a dime
I care for you woman
I care for you woman
I care for you woman, care for you woman
You call it a crime
