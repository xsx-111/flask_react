Peace of Mind Lyrics
Take your time, ease my mind
Wait until my thoughts are blind
See the sun, day has come
That's the way that things are done
There's no stopping, things are throbbing
Still I find
Peaceful feeling, cars are speeding
Peace of mind (peace of mind)
I can feel, things reveal
Peace within, should I kneel
Overrun, things to come
Contented much to carry on
There's no stopping, things are throbbing
Still I find
Peaceful feeling, cars are speeding
Peace of mind (peace of mind)
{Outro}
Aaaaaah aaaaah aaaaah aaah
Aaaah aaaaah aaaah
Aaaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah
Aaaaah aaaaaah
Aaaah aaaah
Aaah aah
Aaaaah aahEmbed
