Old Songs New Songs Lyrics
Fire is on, I’m getting warm
My girl here, she lies sleeping
The other door slips ajar and it’s my wife
She’s been peeping
While I’ve been leaping
High grey stone walls, they all
They all surround me
Well the tracker dogs came around while their masters howled
Cowered they find me
Said I can’t be found near
Old songs, new songs
Keep on singing
A new day, yesterday
All gone, until tomorrow
But I surely know a girl like her could only bring
Bring me sorrow
Much worse to follow
All in all, I’m gonna do my best
To do the work that they hand me
Well I’m gonna do my best so if I’m asleep
Understand me
Don’t you underhand me, no
Old songs, new songs
Keep on singingEmbed
