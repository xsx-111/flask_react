Me My Friend Lyrics
Me my friend
I have seen many lands, me my friend
I have been far and wide
I have sailed many a tide
I have rode many a ride
But I wish, me my friend
I could sail to the stars
Have the gift to transport
My whole being, my whole thought
To a world of dreams
My friend
Me my friend
I have loved many girls, me my friend
I have told many lies
I have asked many whys
I have whispered many sighs
But I wish, me my friend
I could have 'til the end
Someone to love and hold
Through the warm and the cold
Of my lonely years
My friend
My friend
My friendEmbed
