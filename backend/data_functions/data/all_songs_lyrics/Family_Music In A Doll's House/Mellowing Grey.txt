Mellowing Grey Lyrics
Mellowing grey
In misty morning's day
My thoughts turn to you, king fisher blue
Loveliness born
In velvet shades of dawn
Joy from your eyes, soft summer skies
All things within the world supreme
I compare with the love that is my dream

Mellowing grey
The veil of evening's day
The dream that is you is midnight blue
Your lips that evade
A crimson charade
I wait for the dawn from whence you're born
All things within the world supreme
I compare with the love that is my dream
