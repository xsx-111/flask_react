See Through Windows Lyrics
See through windows
Look at things
Sunlight, shadows
Cat's paws, lap wings
Eyes see
Life's meaning
Mist clear windows
Look through them
Snow melts, grass shows
Doors open
Eyes see
Life's meaning
Real life's peculiar, the way things are happening
Mountains like embers, glowing and smoldering
Following, wallowing, deep in the void of it
Slowly but surely you start coming closer to it
'Tis on the plain
Windows mottled
Here through the rain
World looks bottled
Eyes see
Life's meaning
