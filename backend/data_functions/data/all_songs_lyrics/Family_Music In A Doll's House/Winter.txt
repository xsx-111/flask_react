Winter Lyrics
Winter time, it brings me down
Ice cold wind, snow on the ground
Soon I feel the summer breezes
Watch it as it carefully seizes
Whistle down, send it 'round
Slowly upward, slowly down
Gently moving, never a
Sound
Wish that I could hibernate
Go to sleep and never wake
Until the sun comes shining once again
Winter time, it brings me down
Overcoats and scarves thrown ’round
Cold dark nights, then wintry gales
Frozen feet in snowy trails
Slowly homeward, trudging through
Wind and rain and hail storms too
Where's the sun, I wish I
Knew
Winter time, it brings me down
Ice cold wind, snow on the ground
Winter time, it brings me down
Overcoats and scarves thrown 'roundEmbed
