Never Like This Lyrics
Wear Wellington boots when you tread into water
But what do you do when she's finally caught you
You can't just take off or go underground
You just have to find yourself another way 'round
Been through this before
But never like this
Her mother is smiling across from the sofa
Dad's watching the telly but taking no notice
Instead he just plays with some bright colored blocks
Occasionally speaks of little girls' frocks
Been through this before
But never like this
Beginning to wish that you'd never met
The girl with the far away look in her eyes
But to your surprise, she pours you some tea
How many lumps, is it two, why not five
You suddenly find yourself glad that you came
And you're sure that the room doesn't look quite the same
And Dad's got you into his bright colored blocks
Whilst Mother still smiles in her little girl frock
And the girl with the far away look in her eyes
Has now become very important in life
Been through this before
But never like this
