One of These Good Old Days Lyrics
Open your eyes
So you can see
Little girl
That you hurt me
Talking foolishly
About lies
Never really knowin' the reason why
Hey hey

I must have been dazed
'Cause' I don't know
But that's the price
You have to pay
See, what I feel is real
You want me to stay, I wili
Ya been lovin' me
For years, baby
Yeah, ah
Talkin' 'bout lovin' you
Hey, one of these good old days
Talkin' 'bout lovin' you

Time and time again
I wanted you to be my friend (My friend)
Gonna love you, 'til the end
Baby (Baby)
Here somethin' else, little girl
Deep down inside (Down inside)
You know you caught me by surprise (Yeah, ay)
Now I finally opened my eyes, baby
Hey, I must have been dazed
'Cause I don't know
But that's the price
You have to pay
Yeah, listen here!
Hey, talking 'bout lovin' you
You haven't seen anything, girl (Yeah, baby)
One of these good old days
(One of these good old days)
After I get myself together, baby
Talkin' 'bout lovin you!
When you think about it
Let me think about it
One of these good old days
(One of these good old days)
I won't have to do anything but call your name, baby
I'm gonna call your name, I think I wanna call your name
I wanna call your name
Expecting your love (Expecting your love)
Hey, one of these good old days
I wanna call your name, I wanna call your name
Hey hey hey, hey hey, uh-huh, babyEmbed
