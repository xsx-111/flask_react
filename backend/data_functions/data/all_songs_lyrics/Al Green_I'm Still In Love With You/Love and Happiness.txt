Love and Happiness Lyrics
Love and happiness
Yeah
Something that can make you do wrongâ€”make you do right
Yeah, hmmm-mmm
Love

Love and happiness
But wait a minute, something's going wrong
Someone's on the phone
Three o'clock in the morning, yeah
Talkin' about, how she can make it right, yeah
Well, happiness is when
You really feel good about somebody
There's nothing wrong
Being in love with someone
Yeah

Oh, baby
