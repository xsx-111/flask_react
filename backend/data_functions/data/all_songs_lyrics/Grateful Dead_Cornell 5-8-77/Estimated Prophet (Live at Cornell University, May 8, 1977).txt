Estimated Prophet (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where I'll go

Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Yes, I know I lead the way
And they'll tell me where I go

Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Shine on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And people will light my way


My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the fire below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no

Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, don't worry 'bout me
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)


No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)Embed
