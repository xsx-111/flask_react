Lazy Lightning (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I’d like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

You’re a loop of lazy lightning
Just a loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
So exciting
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell me a lie and I will swear
I will swear it's true
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Liquid loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You’re a loop of lazy lightning

Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
It’s either lunacy or lightning
You're a loop of lazy lightning


Lazy lightning
They say you never start the same place
I want a double dose in my case
I’d fly a kite if I thought
Thought that would do

Lazy lightning
The way you always electrify me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be
My lightning, my lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)
Loop of loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too
(My lightning too)Embed
