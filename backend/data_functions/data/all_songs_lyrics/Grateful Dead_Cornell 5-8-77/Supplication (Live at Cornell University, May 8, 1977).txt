Supplication (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
Woo, well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Got to help me
Well, I need some indication, good Lord, this is real now
Got to help me
Well, I've heard it said there's something wrong with in head now
Got to tell me, girl
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Bolt of lightning
'Cause me such excitation
Well, you got to like me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
WOO!Embed
