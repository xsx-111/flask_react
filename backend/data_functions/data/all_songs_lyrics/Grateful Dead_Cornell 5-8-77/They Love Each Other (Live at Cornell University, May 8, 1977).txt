They Love Each Other (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you wonder where it's been
You gotta try to see a little further

They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's trueEmbed
