Loser (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
If I had a gun for every ace I've drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moanin' low
You know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go

Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time

Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

Everybody's braggin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this time
Well, I've got no chance of losin' this timeEmbed
