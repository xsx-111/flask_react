Jack Straw (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me


We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run


Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

We can share the women, we can share the wineEmbed
