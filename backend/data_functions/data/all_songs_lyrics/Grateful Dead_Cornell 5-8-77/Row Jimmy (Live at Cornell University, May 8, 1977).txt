Row Jimmy (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more
Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row


Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row


Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, rowEmbed
