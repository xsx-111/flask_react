Not Fade Away (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away


My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away
