New Minglewood Blues (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion’s den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
I’m a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
Know she wish she would


Well now, the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Said the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
See, the preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

See, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men

See, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion’s den
See, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from other men
