Deal (Live at Cornell University, May 8, 1977) Lyrics
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no


Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonely blues

It goes to show that you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And please play it slow

Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh noEmbed
