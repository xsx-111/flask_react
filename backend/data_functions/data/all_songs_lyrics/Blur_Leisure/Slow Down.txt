Slow Down Lyrics
It's up to you
You know it is
I can't convince you
All you have to do is slow down
I've always said, "It will never change."
All you have to do
Just you be you
I think that's all I want to say

And all the things I've ever told you
I didn't mean at all
I didn't mean at all
I'd forget you
So if you come here
If you come here
All you have to do
Just you be you
I think that's all I want to say to you

And all those things that I told you
I didn't mean at all
I didn't mean at all
I'd forget you
So if you come here
If you come here
All you have to do
Just you be you
I think that's all I need to say to youEmbed
