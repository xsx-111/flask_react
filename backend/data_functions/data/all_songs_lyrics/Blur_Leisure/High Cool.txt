High Cool Lyrics
If you come here, which you sometimes do
Don't think that I really want you to
And if you come here, which you always do
Don't think that I expect you to

Is that all I give you?
Is that all I give you?

And you talk too much, which you always do
Don't think that I really want you to
And if you talk too much, which you always do
Don't think that I really need you to

Is that all I give you?
Is that all I give you?
Is that all I give you?
Is that all I give you?1Embed
