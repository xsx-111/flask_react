Come Together Lyrics
I don't understand
Walking all over me
All over me, to you
You must be mad
And you know you are
You should have known I'd do anything for you

So why, why
Can't we come together?
Why, why, why
Can't we come together?
Why?

Inside my head, there's nothing left
It's all been taken out by you
And do I care?
Well, you know I do
You should have known I'd do anything for you

So why, why
Can't we come together?
Why, why, why
Can't we come together?
Why?
Now it's all been said
And you know it all
Then you should have known I'd do anything for you
For you
For you
For you
For you

So why, why
Can't we come together?
Why, why, why
Can't we come together?
Why?2Embed
