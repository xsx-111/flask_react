Repetition Lyrics
So sure, so sure you are
Nothing can touch you now
I need to know that you think of me
But you're forgetting me now
Slow down, don't be so eager to let me go
Realize it could change you
It could change your mind

Try, try, try
Try, try, try
All things remain the same
So why try again?
Try again

Slow down, don't be so eager to let me go
I need to know
Do you think of me?
But you've forgotten me now

Try, try, try
Try, try, try
All things remain the same
So why try again?
Try again
Try again
Try again

Try, try, try
Try, try, try
All things remain the same
So why try again?
Try again
Try again
Try again

Try, try again
Try, try againEmbed
