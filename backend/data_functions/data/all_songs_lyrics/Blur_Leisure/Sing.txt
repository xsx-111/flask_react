Sing Lyrics
Can't feel
'Cause I'm numb
Can't feel
'Cause I'm numb
So what's the worth
In all of this, this?
What's the worth
In all of this?

Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Sing to me
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Sing to me

So what's the worth
In all of this, this?
If the child in your head
If the child is dead
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Sing to me
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Sing to me


Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Ah ah ah ahh
Sing to me5Embed
