Rockets LyricsHe went off
Like a rocket touched
Way up in the sky
Beyond the bars
In our minds
Just took off
Rocket to the sun
Blast his way through here
Beyond the world
In our eyes
We grow up
If we can join the dots
That got us here to there
Beyond our dreams
In the spheres
We go off
Like little fireworks
Exploding in the streets
And crumpled sheets
Where we lie
All our lives
The system all decides
The institution's old
But still in control
Nothing in the chambers
Worth nothing at all
All the wealth is hidden
Diamonds a-glistening and solid gold
Well, have it all
It's worthlessEmbed
