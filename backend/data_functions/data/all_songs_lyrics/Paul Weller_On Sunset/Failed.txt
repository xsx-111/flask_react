Failed LyricsBetween the devil and the deep blue sea
Between a rock and a carbonised tree
And everyone quite easily says, "Bye"
I banished all when I went away
I never said what I wanted to say
And every time I brought it up
I failed
I hate myself when it gets to this
I'm just a coward when it comes to it
And every time I try to reach
I fail
If everything was different now
How different would I be?
If I could change onе thing around
Would that pattern still be completе?
I banished all when I went away
I couldn't face standing there all day
Tryna think of clever things to say
I bailed
If everything was different now
How different would I be?
If I could change one thing around
Would that pattern still be complete?
What kind of person have I really been?
I never took it, I just follow a dream
And all the things I just don't get
And all the words I never meant
And all things that make no fucking sense
I failed
Oh, I failed
Mmm, I failed
Mmm, I failed
Oh, I failedEmbed
