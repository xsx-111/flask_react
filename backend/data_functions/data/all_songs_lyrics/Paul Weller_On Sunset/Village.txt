Village Lyrics
Here I am, ten stories high
Not a single cloud in my eye
Not a thing I'd change if I could
I'm happy here in my neighborhood

All the things I've never been, I've
Never seen, I don't care much
All the things I've never done, I've
Never won, I don't care much
Never knew why the world is false
'Til I looked in my heart
Saw myself for what I am
Found the whole world in my hands

All the things I'm supposed to be
All the things that you want for me
I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why, I don't know why


I don't need all the things you got
I just wanna be who I want
I don't need all the things you hold
In high regard, they mean nothing at all
All the things I've never been, I've
Never seen, I don't care much
All the things I've never done, I've
Never won, I don't care much
This village is where I'm from
It's one place that I call home
Wanna show me another side
I've got Heaven in my sights
Never knew why the world is false
'Til I looked in my heart
Saw myself for what I am
Found the whole world in my hands

And all the things I've never seen, I've
Never been, I don't care much
All the things I've never done, I've
Never won, I don'tEmbed
