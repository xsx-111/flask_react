Earth Beat LyricsShe's a new day
A new morning
On a new day
The world is turning
She's a new day
A new morning
She's the songbird
She's the warming
I feel that Earth beat
Close to mine
I'd know that Earth beat
Anytime
She's a new day
She's a warning
That on a new day
The world is turning
She's a new day
A new morning
She's the songbird
She's a warming
It's just the start
Of something fine
That heart beat
Runs through age and time
I feel that Earth beat
Close to mine
I'd know that Earth beat
Anytime
It's a new day in the morning
When the sun shines we're still going up
When your heart beats to my beat
Songbird sleep
Oh ain't no slowing up
Leaving old news right behind you
I'm the only one knew how to find you
When your heart beats to my beat
Songbird sleep
Oh ain't no slowing up
She's the new day
She's a warning
That on a new day
The world is turning
She's a new day
A new morning
She's the songbird
She's a warming
It's a new day in the morning
When the sun shines we're still going up
When your heart beats to my beat
Songbird sleep
Oh ain't no slowing up
I feel that Earth beat
Close to mine
I'd know that Earth beat
AnytimeEmbed
