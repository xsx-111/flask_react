Mirror Ball LyricsMirror ball, when will you spin?
Light up the room and our lives begin
Till we no longer feel the cold
We're now embraced by the mirror ball
The sound of soul spins through the air
Lifting up our hearts, our eyes and our ears
Till we no longer accept our fate
We're now empowered in your wake
And the moon
And the sun
And the love
For the one
And in every brick I pass I see you
In every blade of grass I feel you
In everything
Mirror ball, you shine so bright
Illuminate the ways of our sight
Till everyone's a shining star
The moon's a balloon and we'll go far
And the moon
And the sun
And the love
For the one
And in every brick I pass I see you
In every blade of grass I feel you
In every silver sky I see you
The streets that pass me by, I feel you
Oh, in everything
Till everyone's a shining star
Till everyone's a shining star
And the stars
And the rain
And the love
Fills the sea
For the one
For the oneEmbed
