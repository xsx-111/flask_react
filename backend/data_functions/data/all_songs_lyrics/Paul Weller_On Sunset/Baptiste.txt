Baptiste LyricsI never used to pray
I never been to church
But when I hear that sound
It goes to my heart
Straight to my soul
Oh, I don't know
Straight to my soul
If I've got a God
It's in the stars above
But when I get that sound
Oh, it makes me strong
Feeling real
Not a choice
A melody strong
An angel's voice
And I find myself
Find myself
In awe of its truth
And when I go
I go where I go
As long as I have that sound
I'm gonna go real slow
Straight to my heart
Hey, I don't know
Straight to my soul
Feeling real
It's not a choice
A melody strong
An angel's voice
And I find myself
Find myself
In awe of its truth
From the mountains high
To the valleys low
From the oceans deep
To the sky so wide
As long as I got that sound
As long as I got that soundEmbed
