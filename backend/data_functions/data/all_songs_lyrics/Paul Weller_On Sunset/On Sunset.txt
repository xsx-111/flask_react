On Sunset LyricsI was gonna say hi
But no one there
There's me forgetting
Just how long it's been
And the palm trees sway
As a warm breeze blew
And the sun was high
On Sunset
And the world I knew
Has all gone by
All the places we used to go
Belong to a time
Someone else's life
Another time
No long goodbyes
I have no point to prove
Take a drink in the Whiskey
Moved on to the Rainbow
And the palm trees sway
They say good day
And the sun was high, high
On Sunset
But the world I knew
Has all moved on
All the places that we used to go
Belong to a time
Someone else's life
Another time
And the world I knew
Has all gone by
All the places we used to go
Belong to a time
Someone else's life
Another time
And the palm trees sway
And a warm breeze blew
And the sun was high, high
Higher than it ever been before
And the palm trees sway (Palm trees sway)
And a warm breeze blew
And it blew my mind
On Sunset
On Sunset
On Sunset
On Sunset
On Sunset
On SunsetEmbed
