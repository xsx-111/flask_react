Ploughman LyricsI am a ploughman and I plough my earth
I get my pay from the earth I serve
A little corn and a glass of wine
I want no more 'cause this life is fine
Fly away
High away
Fly away
I watch the land and the prey at work
I get my pay from the soil I serve
It's always giving if I treat it right
I plough my earth and the earth delights
Fly away
High away
Fly away
I am a ploughman and I till my fields
I love to search in all the ground I till
I love the rain on the soil I tread
My field is giving and my family's fed
Fly away
High away
Fly away
High awayEmbed
