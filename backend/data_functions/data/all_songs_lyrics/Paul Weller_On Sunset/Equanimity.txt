Equanimity LyricsWhat ya gonna do when the light
Slips from your eyes?
And what will you keep bar the penny
In your fist for the tide?
Become the joke because you can't let go
You suffer hurt because you can't let go
Give the penny to the boatman
See he guides you well
Reflect upon the water
As you reflect upon yourself
This river always will be here
Always rushing here
All traces disappear
So, as equanimity shows
To try and stay in control
And not fall apart
Slow, the ataraxy will grow
As the shepherd has shown
Gentleness and kindness
Is what our world needs now
Find it in my heart somehow
Oh yeah you know
This river always will be here
Always rushing here
All traces disappear
And soon, equanimity blooms
Giving scent to the room
You might not have noticed
Ah, and so, some self control
Might save the day
Which is worth saving
It's what our world needs now
Let's find it in our hearts somehow
You know, yeah, you knowEmbed
