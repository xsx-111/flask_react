Old Father Tyme LyricsLike those tired branches
On that old oak tree
Strange beauty in winter
But how sweeter in spring
Time will become you
You'll become time
All hail the love
It’s the love divine
We don't know
We can't always see
But Old Father Tyme
Ah, you know that he don’t care
Whatever he gives you
Has a price to bear
In this time of confusion
Hang onto what is real
Hail the love around us
See how deep it feels
We don't know
We can't always see
But Old Father Tyme
Ah, you know that he don't care
Whatever he brings you
Got a price to bear
Woo! Yes, I'm ready, ready
Yes, I'm ready rider
Woo! I'm ready, ready
Yes, I'm ready rider
Woo! I’m ready, ready
Ow! Yes, ready rider
Woo! Yes, ready, ready
Sit in the sun
Writing these songs to the ocean
Woo! I’m ready, ready
Yes, I'm ready rider
Woo! I’m ready, ready
Wow! I'm ready rider
Yes, I'm ready, ready
Ow! I'm ready riderEmbed
