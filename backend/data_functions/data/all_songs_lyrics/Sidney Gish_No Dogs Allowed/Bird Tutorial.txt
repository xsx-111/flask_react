Bird Tutorial LyricsTeaching a parakeet to talk is fun
Teaching a-a-a-a parakeet to talk is fun
But the old method took time
This record was specially designed to teach (to teach)
Any of these parakeets to talk
Any of these parakeets to talk
Using a scientific method that is hard hard to learn
Because a carefully trained voice
A scientific voice
Repeats (repeats) over and over and over
Same words, the same phrase
Same words
In the future
For the next few seconds this record will be silent
Then begins your parakeet's talking lessons
Place your parakeet near enough so that he can
Hear the lesson
Same words (same words), the same phrase (the same phrase)
Same words, same phrase
(Hello baby, hello)1Embed
