Good Magicians LyricsFlying around a corner
Scrutinizing all the screens
That you’re on, well naturally
I want to know your secret
You figured out a something
That you are now expressing
Through manipulation
Of a master degree

Just with sleight of hand
You (you!) make (make!) the whole room vanish
Yeah I study good magicians
Twentieth paragraph I’m
Trying to entertain a
Deeper understanding
Of whatever it is you’re on
An absolute basket case
In unassuming basket casing
I think this late in life
I want to learn to do the same

Just with sleight of hand
You (you!) make (make!) the whole room vanish
Yeah I study good magicians
If I tried to do the same tricks
I would end up with Trix cereal’s mascot suffocated in a hat
And half a torso cut in half
From messing the box routine up bad
That, the rabbit - and a non-comedic lawsuit on top of that

Just with sleight of hand
You (you!) make (make!) the whole room vanish
Yeah I study good magicians

Take my greatest fear
Make it disappear
Yeah I study good magiciansEmbed
