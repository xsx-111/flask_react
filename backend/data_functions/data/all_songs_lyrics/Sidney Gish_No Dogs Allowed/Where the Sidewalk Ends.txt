Where the Sidewalk Ends LyricsI wanna write a book
And put it in your mailbox and when you go to pick it up
You would send it back to Amazon
I wanna write a list
I wanna pepper it with everything unvalidated
Just to see if you’ll agree with me
'Cause that’s all fine with me
Toeing on the line
Of reality
And the mud in your mind
Where the sidewalk ends
Is the only place
We can be good friends
I wanna circle you
Like a rabbit courting both my shoes
For fun, we just assume
Characters and never get confused
I wanna play a song
Nobody in the world interprets wrong
But that’s hilarious
At this point, everyone is caked in mud
And that’s all fine with me
Toeing on the line
Of reality
And the mud in your mind
Where the sidewalk ends
Is the only place
We can be good friends
'Cause that’s all fine with me
Toeing on the line
Of reality
And the mud in your mind
Where the sidewalk ends
Is the only place
We can be good friends
We can be good friendsEmbed
