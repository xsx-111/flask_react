I Eat Salads Now Lyrics
It pains me to say but maybe I'll grow out of it
(Outgrown, outgrown, out of it)
I’m a businessman, I don’t waste time on any shit
(Don't waste time, don't waste time on shit, what?)

These sweet instincts ruin my life
There’s no progress, just good times
Bitch, I’m wasted, just kidding, I’m high
We’re gonna go to a show, and then come home and probably die
These sweet instincts ruin my life
There’s no progress, just good times
Bitch, I’m wasted, just kidding, I’m high
We’re gonna go to a show, and then come home and probably die

It pains me to say but maybe I’ve grown out of it
(I've grown out, grown out of it)
I’m 20, washed up already
And all I want to do is sit
(Down sit, down sit, down sit, sit)

These sweet instincts
(Ruin my life) Ruin my life
(There's no progress) There’s no progress
(Just good times), just good times
(Just a pretty good time)
(Bitch, I'm wasted) Bitch, I'm wasted
(Just kidding, I’m high) Just kidding, I’m high
We’re gonna go to a show
And then come home and probably die (Die)
(These sweet instincts) These sweet instincts
(Ruin my life) Ruin my life
(There's no progress) There’s no progress
(Just good times) Just good times
(Just a pretty good time)
(Bitch, I'm wasted) Bitch, I’m wasted
(Just kidding, I’m high) Just kidding, I’m high
We’re gonna go to a show
And then come home and probably die!1Embed
