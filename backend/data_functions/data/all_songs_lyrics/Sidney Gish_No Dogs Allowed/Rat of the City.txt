Rat of the City Lyrics
I would let solipsists
Plug me in the matrix
Rest in it, happy to think
Not cut out for anything

So your taste is the best like the books that you read
But I’m not a lot like you
When we act really blank and stand in the same places
The standing’s all we do
And I don’t mean to say there’s a vat for my brain
But I’m not a lot like you
If I’m floating alone, then the liquid’s my home
And at least I’ve got the goo

Leaving, straight back to the wall
Thinking, filtering it all
Just observe, don’t say a word
Ghost town, no dogs allowed

Upon realizing I don’t owe anything
There’s a lazy sense of glee
Down the corners and streets, I’m a rat of the city
I’m not a lot like me
Rebrand as NPC, audience on TV
My own latchkey kid I’ll be
If I’m floating alone, then the liquid’s my home
And at least I’ve got saline
I don’t know who I am, I don’t know what to do
But I’m not a lot like you
I don’t know who I am, I don’t know what to do
But I’m not a lot like you
I don’t know who I am, I don’t know what to do
But I’m not a lot like you
I don’t know who I am, I don’t know what to do
But I’m not a lot like youEmbed
