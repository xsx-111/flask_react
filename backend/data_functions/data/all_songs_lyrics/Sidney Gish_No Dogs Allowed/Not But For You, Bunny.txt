Not But For You, Bunny LyricsYou don’t come around here like you’re supposed to do
I'm sitting around here waiting next to you
I see the truth
Is right inside of you
Who could take a minute just to talk to you
And walk away with everybody who
Could leave you too
I’m right in front of you
Oooooooo
Glitter candy and perfume
Ooooooo
Bubble bath of entropy
Ooooooo
And what a lovely day
And what a lovely feeling
We - we met inside the gelateria
You worked the motherfucking register
Reminded me it was a pizzeria
I - I looked around at all the pies
I cleared my throat and said “oh no. you’re right.”
And then i tried to bleach my whole damn mind that night
Oooooooo
Glitter candy and perfume
Ooooooo
Bubble bath of entropy
Ooooooo
And what a lovely day
And what a lovely feeling
Ooooooo
Ooooooo...
You don’t come around here like you’re 'sposed to do
I'm sitting round here waiting next to you
I see the truth
Is right inside of you
Glitter candy and perfume
Bubble bath of entropy
And what a lovely day
And what a lovely feeling
Careers are on the phone
But I don’t care about it
But I don’t care about it, bunny
Careers are on the phone
But I don’t care about it
Not but for you, bunny
Careers are on the phone
But I don’t care about it
For one second, bunny
Careers are on the phone
But I don’t care about it
Not but for you, bunny
Not but for you, bunny
Not but for you, bunny
Not but for you, bunny
Not but for you, bunny
Not but for you, bunny
Not but for you, bunnyEmbed
