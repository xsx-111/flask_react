The Bonus Track On No Dogs Allowed LyricsThis is the bonus track on No Dogs Allowed
Burning a hundred discs inside of my house
Been in New York a fortnight
Came back to stay the night, and
Print everythin' I needed out
Speakin' in limericks for the new year now
And for the bonus track on No Dogs Allowed
Thank you for purchasing this
Compact disc kind of thing, this
Song isn't on the internet
It's just for you
And now it endsEmbed
