Sophisticated Space LyricsWhat a sophisticated space
What a well educated population
What socialite would go donate
What it takes to own this place for 60 days
In a sophisticated congregation
There’s a collection of a space that puts on
Banquets that I have vice-reported on
From the balcony and the wall
The worst permission slip you can imagine wouldn’t gain entrance to anything other than who
Would dole out all the tickets to imagine that don’t go to anything at all
Good luck ever knowing yourself
You’re sitting in a room and speaking well
Reporting on the temperature
Fake-deep, non-eloquently, every hour?
Lost deep inside the MFA
Ten mental breakdowns we are navigating
I think in all regards I’ve found a welcome home
Amongst the people made of stone
Now if you wait in between
What did you say man and what did you mean?
Whatever it’s just good etiquette
To sink the model ships
A model pirate and a model wave
Two varieties, oceanic and friendly
If the news is really great
Now if you really think the time is running out to say all the great things you thought of today
You’re more than right, you are enlightened, knowing that your place is never to fill anything at all let alone space
Good luck summationed in a place like this
Taking okay care of myself
Scan the spiral stairs
Teleport back to the middle of the room
I can’t give my mind back but I can try to take it back to me
Take it back to
Scanning the spiral stairs and
Teleporting back into the middle of the room
I can’t give my my mind back but I can try to take it back and I can try to make it work too
Take it back to me
Take it back1Embed
