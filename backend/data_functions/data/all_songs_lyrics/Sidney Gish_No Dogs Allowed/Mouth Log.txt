Mouth Log Lyrics
On my phone, I've got a list
Of food I ate and people I kissed
And because of this, I'm losing weight
I'm batting my eyes like siren bait
Just like a hate-watched series
I catalog life dearly
Dreary how-tos on half-assed self-abuse

Probably when I'm 22
Then I'll be doing something new
Because I lose attention fast
And I get bored right off the bat
But I hate class, and I hate work
And doing nothing's even worse
But I still curse and complain every day

If I thrive best in hate machines
And shallow tabloid magazines
And groups for memes where everyone fights
And tries to make straight white boys cry
Then will I die still swallowing
All sides of conflict? Possibly
I'm 3 percent non-hikikomori
97 speaks and now I'm there
Fuzzy socks and shampooed hair
Cyst acne bare, I'm eating healthy
Watching Ina cook for Jeffery
I'm kinda pissed if this is the real me
But at least I know who I kissed and what I eat
