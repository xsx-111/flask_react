Jet Pack Blues Lyrics
I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy, the kind that makes June
Feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent

She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember, "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) Did you ever love her? Do you know?
(I remember) Or did you never want to be alone?
(I remember) And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight
And just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our heads were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember, "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) Did you ever love her? Do you know?
(I remember) Or did you never want to be alone?
(I remember) And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember, "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"
(I remember) Did you ever love her? Do you know?
(I remember) Or did you never want to be alone?
(I remember) And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
(I remember) "Baby, come home"57Embed
