Mirror Image LyricsA cold night and the wind keeps blowin'
A cold heart here, but no one knows it
I look at you and I see myself down that lonely road
A woman frozen and a man still on fire
The crime of fear and the pain and desire
You and me and the mirror between us that begs to explode
No one feels better now, no one really tries
No one gets to the truth past these eyes
Old memories linger still
A cup of coffee and a dollar bill
Lay on the table like a fortune waiting for us to read
But no news seeps in today
The old blues decide to stay
No passion breaks this train running through my mind
No one feels better now, no one really cares
No one takes time to look, they just stare
No one feels better now, no one makes it through
No one gets past these eyes to the truthEmbed
