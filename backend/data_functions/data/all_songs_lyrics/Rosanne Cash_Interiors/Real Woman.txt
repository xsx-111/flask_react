Real Woman LyricsI don't want to be a star
I don't want to talk through glass
I don't want to check my appearance in your eyes
I don't need a million bucks
Baby, it don't take much
I don't need to play the princess all the time
I want to be a real woman changing every day
I want to be a real woman, real in every way
I want to be a real woman
I don't want to be admired
I don't want to fake my smile
I don't want to use my charm to disarm you
You don't have to spin your wheels
Oh baby, I know how that feels
You don't have to pass some test just to impress me
I want to be a real woman changing every day
I want to be a real woman, real in every way
I want to be a real woman
Real is how I deal with what I deal with
Real is how I feel when I know how I'm feelin'
I don't want to be a man
I just want to be what I am
I don't want to hide my light so yours keeps shining
If you don't want to face the truth
Then you're not gonna like what I do
You're not gonna make or break me, so don't start trying
I want to be a real woman changing every day
I want to be a real woman, real in every way
I want to be a real womanEmbed
