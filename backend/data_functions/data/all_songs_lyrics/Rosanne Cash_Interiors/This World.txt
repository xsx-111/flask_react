This World LyricsI read about this baby
She got beat up by her dad
She was nine months old
And he was a full-grown man
She may have been learning how to crawl
And he put a fist in her face
The doctor said, "this baby's gone
She can't be replaced"
Now you read a lot of things in the daily news
But I'm laying awake at nights wondering what to do
I pray the Lord her soul to keep
'Cause all down here are fast asleep
But I want to say this baby belongs to me and you
So we gotta wake up
This baby belongs to me and you
Everyday I wake up in this world
It's spinning out of control
Who is at the wheel?
Seems no one knows
We're all just like a baby
Frightened and so sad
Feeling beat up by someone
Who looks like Dad
Now you read a lot of things in the daily news
But I'm laying awake at nights wondering what to do
I pray the Lord her soul to keep
'Cause all down here are fast asleep
But I want to say this world belongs to me and you
So we gotta wake up
This world belongs to me and you
Just want to wake up
This world belongs to me and youEmbed
