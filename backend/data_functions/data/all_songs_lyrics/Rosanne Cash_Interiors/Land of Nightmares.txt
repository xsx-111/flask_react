Land of Nightmares LyricsI love you 'til I just can't feel
I need you 'til it makes me numb
We hang on a noose of subtle abuse
Like there's nothing to fear
Living in the land of nightmares
The ocean's calm outside my door
The storm rages inside my head
In perfect control, so no one could know
I smile, but I'm not even there
Living in the land of nightmares
A vision full of sound and light
I think she's holding back the night
With bitter desire, she stoops to conspire
She is the reason I'm here
Living in the land, living in the land of nightmaresEmbed
