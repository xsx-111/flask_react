All Come True LyricsSomeone was round here asking questions
About somebody who looks like you
I said I don't know where you are
Sounded like he was going to be back someday
So I told her where you are
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
Got to find the brightness in the soul
Gotta look outside to find out who we are
Oh you won't be satisfied yet
Until you make possessions of the stars
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
Someone was round here asking questions
About somebody who looks like you
I said I don't know where you are
She said she was going to be back someday
So I told her where you are
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this time
He's making it all come true this timeEmbed
