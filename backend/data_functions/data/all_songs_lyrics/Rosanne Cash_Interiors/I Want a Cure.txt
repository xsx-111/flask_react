I Want a Cure Lyrics
Distance makes the heart start wondering
Absence makes the anger grow
The world may just be spinning through us
And separation lets it show

I walk away the fear and anger
I'm talking through the tears each day
I push myself to points of danger
But nothing makes it go away

I want a cure
A mental, geographical cure
A physical, chemical cure
Sugar or shopping
Drinking or dropping
The emotional highs
Of my life in disguise
There's one thing for sure
I want a cure

Love seems like a fancy theory
Fame a substitute for friends
Those who love can't get near me
And those who don't are moving in
A heart is like a broken window
Pain depends on point of view
The world may just be slowly stopping
And no one knows but me and you


Where no one can see me
No one knows how I'm feeling
