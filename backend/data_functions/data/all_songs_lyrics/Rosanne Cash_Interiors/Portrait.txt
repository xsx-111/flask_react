Portrait LyricsI have a portrait of my man
Two strong arms, two gentle hands
And a heart that stays a mystery to me
And the portrait in my head
Is not a stranger to my bed
Like the real man that I love has come to be
The man I long to see is like a shadow in my dreams
And the portrait is who keeps me company
The man I want to hold would never let our love grow cold
But the real man hides his love away from me
I have a portrait in my mind
Of two hearts that beat in time
And the rhythm that is not so hard to feel
But a picture of a dream
Is never what it seems
And the steps we take don't make picture real
The man I thought I knew is a vision veil removed
Keeps me wondering how it's gonna be
The man I want to touch doesn't comfort me as much
As his picture that I hold so close to me
I thought I knew him
Now I see right through him
I have a portrait of my man
Too little time to understand
A heart that stays a mystery to me
And the picture in my heart
Is not a stranger in the dark
And not afraid to be the man he could beEmbed
