What We Really Want LyricsWe tried to make ourselves pay
For something we've never done
Threw the best parts of life away
On street talk, strangers and drugs
But what we really want is love
What we really need is love
I want to call out your name
I want to hold out my hand
The woman silent in the mirror tonight
Wants to talk to your mirror man
And what they really want is love
What they really need is love
We are ships in the night
The waters deep in between
The air is freezing and we can't find the light
So we sail off into our dreams
But what we really dream is love
What we really need is love
What we want is love
What we need is love
I tried to make it feel right
In someone else's world
I sat and looked out my window last night
And knew that things had changed for this girl
'Cause what I really found is love
What I really feel is love
What we really want is love
What we really need is love
What we want is love
What we need is loveEmbed
