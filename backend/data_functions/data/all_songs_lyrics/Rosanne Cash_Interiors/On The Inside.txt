On The Inside LyricsWe crawled night and day through the tears and debris
Now I'm reaching out to you, but I'm keeping my hands clean
The tables are turning, the tempo slows down
We're gettin' off this misery-go-round
It's a brand new world, baby, now things have changed
It's a brand new picture in a brand new frame
A turn of the page with a blink of your eye
Our two steps in rhythm, our hearts beat in time
On the inside
It all happened on the inside
It all went down on the inside
A critical moment, I know you'd agree
Both of us separate, but neither one free
We traded our papers for new walking shoes
But I had no idea how I'd feel without you
We watched it unravel, we heard it unwind
Imprisoned by anger, embittered by time
No one could tell me we'd be standing here today
Steeled by the fire and sealed by the pain
On the inside
It all happened on the inside
It all went down on the inside
I'm holding on to you
And I know you're holding on to me too
We gave it one more chance
And found the key to romance
None of it happens like we think it should be
It'd all be a disaster if left up to me
The power of love and protection divine
We found we held hands through the darkness and then there was light
On the inside
It all happened on the inside
It all went down on the inside
On the inside
It all happened on the inside
It all went down on the insideEmbed
