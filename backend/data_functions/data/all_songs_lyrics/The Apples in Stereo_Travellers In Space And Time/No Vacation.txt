No Vacation LyricsThrill-seekers, loudspeakers
Calling out voices in my head
Distractions, overt reactions
Falling out through spaces in my bed
(Chorus)
I tell myself I'm doing fine
There's no vacation in my mind
I've got no space, I can't unwind
There's no vacation in my mind
Skyscrapers, wallpapers
Filling out faces in my dreams
Sensations, covert creations
Spilling out through spaces in between
(Chorus, x2)
No-Va-ca-tion
No-Va-ca-tion
No-Va-ca-tion
No-Va-ca-tion
No-Va-ca-tion
No-Va-ca-tionEmbed
