Next Year at About the Same Time LyricsFour stoic trees spreading over woods
White mossy fingers form a leafy hood
Turning the night into some other life, now
Red roofs curve out, make a curious line
Farm houses shout and machinery whines
Out for a stroll with a girl in a hard hat
Old wooden horse with a plaster leg
Resting behind the community shed
Catching his breath and scratching his ankle
Post office bell rings at nine-o-five
Schoolchildren move just like bees in a hive
Darting their eyes and biting their wings
Post office bell rings at three-o-five
Schoolchildren flee just like bees in a hive
Riding their bicycles onto the sidewalk
Four stoic trees spreading over woods
Dark mossy fingers form a leafy hood
Darting their eyes and opening their wingsEmbed
