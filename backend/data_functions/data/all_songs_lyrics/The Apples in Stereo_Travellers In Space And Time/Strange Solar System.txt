Strange Solar System LyricsAll the people came from a distant star
And they travelled far to get where we are, bum-bum-bum
Our people came from a distant place
And they travelled through space for a change of pace, bum-bum
I know we are from a better place
A brighter star far away in space
We're on a dangerous mission
In a strange solar system
We're on a dangerous mission
In a strange solar system
We're not alone, one day we will go home
Ah...Embed
