Dignified Dignitary LyricsYou must try harder to remember
When you are living in the future
To stay connected to your brother
Even in the middle of the city
When you are flying in the taxi
Above the people and machinery
Tell it to the dignitary
She's gonna take you down
Tell it to the actuary
And she's gonna tell you, tell you how
You must try harder to remember
When you are scanning with your visor
To keep the faces with the numbers
You must try harder to depressurize
When you are looking at the night sky
The starlight filters through your mind's eye
Tell it to the dignitary
She's gonna take you down
Tell it to the actuary
And she's gonna tell you, tell you how1Embed
