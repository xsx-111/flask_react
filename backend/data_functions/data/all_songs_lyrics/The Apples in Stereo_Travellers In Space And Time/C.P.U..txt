C.P.U. Lyrics
You know what it's like when you're out of range of your satellite
You know you feel blue when you're out of sync with your C.P.U

You've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long
Ooh, you've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long
Ooh, you've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long

You know what it's like when you're out of range of your satellite
You know you feel blue when you're out of sync with your C.P.U

You've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long
Ooh, you've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long
Ooh, you've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long

You've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long
Ooh, you've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long
Ooh, you've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too long
Ooh, you've been gone, you've been gone
You've been away for too longEmbed
