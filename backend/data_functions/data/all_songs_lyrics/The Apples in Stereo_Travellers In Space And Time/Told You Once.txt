Told You Once Lyrics(I told you once)
Ooh ooh, what do you do to your baby?
(Ooh ooh, what do you do?)
Ah ha, I hear her cry she's so lonely
(Why you make her cry?)
Why do you treat her bad?
Why do you treat her bad?
Ooh ooh, I see right through how you use her
(Ooh ooh, I see through you)
Ah ha, I'll be nearby when you lose her
(Ah ha, I'll make her mine)
(Why do you treat her bad?)
Why's that?
(Why do you treat her bad?)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Chorus:
I told you once, I told you twice
(Ooh ooh ooh)
I wanna treat your baby nice
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(x2)
Ooh ooh, if I were you I'd be there with her
(Ooh ooh, wish I were you)
Ah ha, I'd be nearby to take care of her
(Ah ha, I'll make her mine)
(Why do you treat her bad?)
Why's that?
(Why do you treat her bad?)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
