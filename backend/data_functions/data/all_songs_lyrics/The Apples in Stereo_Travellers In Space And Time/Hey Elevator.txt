Hey Elevator Lyrics
Hey
Hey
Hey

If I had my dream, I'd be
Where you are, in your car
If I could be anywhere I wanna be
If I had my dream I'd be
In your home, turn off the phone
If I could be anywhere I wanna be

Elevator, take me straight to your bed (hey, elevator)
I'm so tired, and I gotta dream in my head (hey, elevator)
Elevator, take me straight to your bed (hey, elevator)
When I look around (elevator)
When I look around it distracts me

If I could believe in someone
I choose you, you're so smooth
If I could believe in anything at all
(Yeah, I'd give you a call)
Elevator, take me straight to your bed (hey, elevator)
I'm so tired, and I gotta dream in my head (hey, elevator)
Elevator, take me straight to your bed (hey, elevator)
When I look around (elevator)
When I look around it distracts me

When I look around at the world today (hey)
You know it distracts me

(Hey, hey, hey)

Elevator, take me straight to your bed (hey, elevator)
I'm so tired, and I gotta dream in my head (hey, elevator)
Elevator, take me straight to your bed (hey, elevator)
When I look around (elevator)
When I look around it distracts me

When I look around at the world today (hey)
When I look around at the world today (hey)
When I look around at the world today (hey)
You know it distracts meEmbed
