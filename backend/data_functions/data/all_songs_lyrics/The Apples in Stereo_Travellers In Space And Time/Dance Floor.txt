Dance Floor Lyrics
I wanna peel back, I wanna feel that
That my future's still coming
I walk into the night and 'fore the city lights
But my mind is still running
I can see your face again, I can see my old friends
In my sweet imagination (sweet imagination)
I walk into the street and 'fore the city beat
But my mind is still racing

The dance floor isn't there no more
But my body's still moving
Tell me, do you know where are we to go
When our world is so confusing?

Ooh, I wanna go there, sensations fill the air
In my sweet recollection (sweet recollection)
Ooh, I see a for sale sign where we made up our minds
To be more than just good friends (ba)

The dance floor (dance floor) isn't there no more (there no more)
But my body's still moving (ba, my body's still moving)
Tell me, do you know (do you know) where are we to go (we to go)
When our world is so confusing? (ba, my world is so confusing)
You know, the dance floor (dance floor) isn't there no more (there no more)
But my body's still moving (ba, my body's still moving)
Tell me, do you know (do you know) where are we to go (we to go)
When our world is so confusing? (ba, my world is so confusing)
You know, the dance floor (dance floor, dance floor)
Isn't there no more (there no more, there no more)
You know, the dance floor (dance floor, dance floor)
Isn't there no more (there no more, there no more)

When our world is so confusing
When our world is so confusing
When our world is so confusing
When our world is so confusing
When our world is so confusing
When our world is so confusing
When our world is so confusing
When our world is so confusing

I walk into the night and 'fore the city lights
But my mind is still running (mind is still running)
I wanna peel back, I wanna feel that
That my future's still coming (ba)

The dance floor (dance floor) isn't there no more (there no more)
But my body's still moving (ba, my body's still moving)
Tell me, do you know (do you know) where are we to go (we to go)
When our world is so confusing? (ba, my world is so confusing)
You know, the dance floor (dance floor) isn't there no more (there no more)
But my body's still moving (ba, my body's still moving)
Tell me, do you know (do you know) where are we to go (we to go)
When our world is so confusing? (ba, my world is so confusing)
You know, the dance floor (dance floor, dance floor)
Isn't there no more (there no more, there no more)
You know, the dance floor (dance floor, dance floor)
Isn't there no more (there no more, there no more)Embed
