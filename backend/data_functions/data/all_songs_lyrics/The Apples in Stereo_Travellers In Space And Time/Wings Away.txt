Wings Away LyricsIn silence we are born
No sound to call our own
Daybreak, first impression
And up against what they say
The fight to radiate
Lost in all connection
When we got a game to play
Breathing in and out all day
Hey, taking your wings away
So we open up and scream
Until it all becomes a dream
We're only roaming
I know that in the end
The silence comes again
And finds you without warning
When we got a game to play
Breathing in and out all day
Hey, taking your wings away
(x3)
In silence we are born
No sound to call our own
(Tak-ing your wings away)
Taking your wings away, hey
Taking your wings away, hey
Whoa, whoa
(x3)Embed
