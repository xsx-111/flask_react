Floating in Space LyricsI've been gone for too long, I was orbiting at first
I can't say what went wrong, maybe it went right

Look out and there's no atmosphere
No sign of life, It's only us here
We float along, no direction
No gravity no recollection

Of the time, don't know the year
So slowly it goes when you're up here
Or are we down? I don't feel down
It's so quiet, except for this sound

Look out and there's no atmosphere
No sign of life, it's only us here
We float along, no direction
Day and night, no recollection
Look out and there's no atmosphere
No sign of life, it's only us here
We float along, no direction
No gravity no recollection
Of the time, don't know the year
So slowly it goes when you're up here
Or are we down? I don't feel down
It's so quiet, except for this sound

Look out and there's no atmosphere
No sign of life, it's only us here
We float along, no direction
Day and night, no recollectionEmbed
