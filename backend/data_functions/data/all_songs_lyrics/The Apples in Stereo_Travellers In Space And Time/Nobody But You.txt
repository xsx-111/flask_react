Nobody But You LyricsThe stormy weather it drags you down
Reaching for the higher ground
You packed your bags and you went away
Searching for a brighter day
The stormy weather's not far behind
Destination undefined
You packed your bags and you headed home
Situation still unknown (situation still unknown)
I don't wanna (I don't wanna) be with nobody but you
(I don't wanna be with nobody but you)
(x2)
The stormy weather is still outside
Looking for a place to hide
Unpack your bags and you stay right here
Situation seems so clear (situation seems so clear)
I don't wanna (I don't wanna) be with nobody but you
(I don't wanna be with nobody but you)
(x4)
The stormy weather it drags you down
Reaching for the higher ground
Unpack your bags and you stay right here
Situation seems so clear (situation seems so clear)
I don't wanna (I don't wanna) be with nobody but you
(I don't wanna be with nobody but you)
(x3)
(I don't wanna be with nobody but...)
But you, but you
(I don't wanna be with nobody but you)
