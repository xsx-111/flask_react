No One in the World LyricsI don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what to say
When you go, when you go, when you go
And you look at me that away
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
If you think into my eyes
There's a line, there's a line, there's a line
That I will not trivialize
I gotta tell you
Oh, oh, oh, there's no one in the world
Oh, oh, oh, like my little girl
(x2)
Like my little girl, like my little girl
Ooh, like my little girl
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
If you wish to socialize
(it's all right, it's all right, it's all right)
You're so nice, you're so nice, you're so nice
And you seem so civilized
(you're so nice, you're so nice, you're so nice)
In another life, in another life, in another life
Maybe you'll sit by my side
(in another life, in another life, in another life)
But not tonight, not tonight, not tonight
'Cause it keeps me satisfied
(not tonight, not tonight, not tonight)
I gotta tell you
Oh, oh, oh, there's no one in the world
Oh, oh, oh, like my little girl
(x2)
Like my little girl, like my little girl
Ooh, like my little girl
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what to say
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
When you go, when you go, when you go
And you look at me that away
(when you go, when you go, when you go)
In another life, in another life, in another life
Maybe you'll sit by my side
(in another life, in another life, in another life)
Not tonight, not tonight, not tonight
'Cause it keeps me satisfied (right)
I gotta tell you
Oh, oh, oh, there's no one in the world
Oh, oh, oh, like my little girl
(x2)
Like my little girl, like my little girl
Ooh, like my little girlEmbed
