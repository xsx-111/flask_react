Dream About the Future Lyrics
Ah
Ah

When I tell you that I need you, you don't believe me
When I tell you I won't leave you, you don't believe me
When I tell you it's forever, you don't believe me
When I tell you it's not over, ooh-ooh, you don't believe me

You don't know what you do to me
(You don't know what you do)
Girl, you don't know what you do to me
(You don't know what you do)

What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
When you dream about the future?
Do you see me?
(What do you see when you dream about the future)
When you dream about your life?
What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
When you dream about the future?
(Dream about the future)
Ah

When I tell you there's no other, you don't believe me
When I tell you there's no lover, ooh-ooh, you don't believe me

You don't know what you do to me
(You don't know what you do)
Girl, you don't know what you do to me
(You don't know what you do)

What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
When you dream about the future?
Do you see me?
(What do you see when you dream about the future)
Ooh, when you dream about your life?
What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
When you dream about the future?
(Dream about the future)

You don't know what you do to me
(You don't know what you do)
Girl, you don't know what you do to me
(You don't know what you do)

What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
Ooh, do you see me?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
(I dream about the future)
What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
When you dream about the future?
Do you see me?
(What do you see when you dream about the future)
When you dream about your life?
(I dream about the future)
What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
When you dream about the future?
Do you see me?
(What do you see when you dream about the future)
When you dream about your life?
(I dream about the future)
What do you see?
(What do you see when you dream about the future?)
When you dream about the future?
Do you see me?
(What do you see when you dream about the future)
When you dream about your life?
(I dream about the future)Embed
