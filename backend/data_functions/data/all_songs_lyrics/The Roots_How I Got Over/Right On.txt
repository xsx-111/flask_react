Right On Lyrics
Hit it!

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on

Yo, I try to get it how I live it
A lot of people counting on me kinda like a digit
It's a cold world, I'm not fronting like it isn't
It's no time for coming up shorter than a midget
Y'all know I'ma raise the bar though like Brigitte
See there a star go, don't blink, you might miss it
It's precious cargo, you gotta be strong to lift it
The light comes in different types, be more specific
Shit, I'm Black Thought, what could be more prolific?
For this love, I go above and beyond the limit
I told y'all I'm above and beyond a gimmick
I get into your head and spread like a pandemic
I never put myself in a race I can't finish
I'm well grounded, founded on the same premise
As any man with a hitlist that's about business
Yo, can a brother get a witness? Dig it
Right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on

Okay, I'm above and beyond hot, my measurement in watts
Time rate of flow and energy ain't never gon' stop
Pressure's on, I won't pop, microphone I won't drop
Gemstones niggas cop ain't shit if I ain't in the spot
It's the Orion of the hop, the new star of the hip
I shine a light for the future so my presence's a gift
It's evident I'm heaven sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverence for what I represent should show my benevolence
This is Philly, I'm repping for the art of the city
Came from southwest Atlanta, gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shooting up the club like they party with Diddy
You get the diggy? I flip my incandescence to fluorescence
And in essence I can burn more joules of energy per second
I put them on to lessons while I'm smoking on the blessing
The switch hitter like Pete Rose, right up the session
Right on

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on, it was right on
Take it to the very top
Another track, I'ma do the snare roll5Embed
