Do This My Way Lyrics
I be the first ever Asian astronaut
Blastin' off, castin' off
The ties that bind like a smashed guitar
Rode a mastodon out Jurassic Park
Chased by a fan in a Tyrannosaur mask
Trampled the traffic cop
Past the spot
Where the ostrich got all props for the ocelot
What I couldn't have bought
'Cause they wouldn't a popped it y'all
Just for me to cop it one
So I had to be up
I'm going gradually up
Into the galaxy bus
Until I can't feel my lungs
I pass the family of
Sea anemones plus
Saw the anatomy of
A cast of ballerinas

Now I was walkin' down this one block
Didn't hear a gun shot
Smellin' hella nature
Pickin' fruit off of a kumquat
Tree, another day up in this life under the sunspot
Light upon my innervision, searchin' for an unsought
Territory, man-in-glory, days of the mental fury
Inventory took and while I raise rain began to pour
From the verbal dance I did amaze all the natives
And the ladies said "You're crazy, would you love to have my baby?"
And I blaze with the chief of the Mohicans and the Sheikh
And travelled everywhere from Delaware way up to Mozambique
Was givin' praise with the Deacon at the steeple
Spirit-seekin' on the weekend with a tea can and a pair of old shades
It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
Ain't shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes, it's a mutual thing
'Cause it's the root of all things, and we aim to be

To be the venomous instrumentalist, syllable, mystic man, traveller
Skippin' through the bricks on a Wednesday into a city plaza
Tryna make a 20 out of 15 pennies on the avenue
The cold-hearted world creepin' on my destiny like salamanders
Enchanters, 'cause I'm on that goose and I be the gander
Cleanin' out the digestive tract of hip-hop like cranberries
Shinin' like amber
All of the children told me "Damn you're an
Answer to our ears and deadly threat to peers like cancer"
On Prancer, on Comet, on Cupid, I'm Santa
Got more flow than Flo Jo, I laugh Ho Ho Ho, got Jo Jo Dancer
Punchlines, I'm a crunch time counselor, and a one-time champion for it
A hundred lifetimes in the hereafter, and for the reincarnation transform
What the heck I come back for?
Gotta handle chores now, and discuss all of that with God afterwards
We gon' bobsled off the Himalayas
With a bottle of bop-shoo-bop blended with Baileys
And a big ol' box of the latest compilations
And then we won't stop 'til we hit the Appalachians
To the Bullets Bargain Basement
Then 'cross the Baltic ocean basin
The ride 'cross that Oakland Bay Bridge
A drop deposit in the tropic Caymans
Makin' cakes that taste like theacrine
Bacon, eggs, potatoes, raisins
Plaintains, M&Ms, peanuts, grape juice
I'm savin' my pay checks to get my plane fixed, why's that?
We goin' fly all night, stop the propellors and
Jump out of the side with umbrellas and
Land smack-dab on backs of caterpillars that
Take us to the top the Himalayas

It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
Ain't shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes, it's a mutual thing
'Cause it's the root of all things, and we aim
A lot of people follow shallow fellows, hollerin' indeed
About to lead 'em all to battle upon the bottom of the beat
And plant a seed of thought that sproutin'
Like a balance like a teeter-totter
Seen a lot of freedom bound to feet and 'bout to beat the drama

Now he began to 
Until the nurse, the passengers had grabbed his shirts
And nothin' happened, assured the captain and the person
But the pressure had expanded, and inertia burst, the cabin burst
And all 'em burgers, blankets, rations, animals and drinks
They flew out

Fleet of lots of band
Climb upon the wall like Peter Parker
Meter of the creed of darker regions,  season
Oh but these are not the reasons for the grief
And now proceed to outer-reaches
How to keep the styles from seepin' outta me

They flew out, the fuselage had blew its top
Itâ€™s do or die, the altitude would take a dive into the ground
Now if you'd have thought of suicide
If you would try but you would tie
A parachute onto a slide and took a dive
Now who's alive?

It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
Ain't shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes, it's a mutual thing
'Cause it's the root of all things, and we aim2Embed
