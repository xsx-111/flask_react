This is a story of a kid, his name is Cisko (Cisko)
Who made more money than the Count of Montecristo (Crisco)
He lived a lavish style of life, fast money, women, cars
And he liked to frequent bars, pubs, and discos (discos)
Made his living as a world famous rap star (rap star)
When he first started: mic, respects what he was after (after)
And so he got inside his mind, day and night, and he'd write
Constantly, his art and craft he'd try to master (master)
Started winning local battles and his rep grew (rep grew)
Gave his crew a reputation as the best crew (best crew)
And what life would do to him, all the cards that was hard
Pen and pad, stress relief would be his refuge (refuge)
Paid his dues, doing shows, now he's on track (on track)
In the lab, pumping demos, making songs fat (songs fat)
Then he quit his nine to five, finally his time arrived
When he signed a major label record contract
Don't let money change ya!
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah

His first single was an overnight success hit (success hit)
And now he went from wearing rags to the best fits (best fits)
All his new acquaintances, gassed his head, taking it
To the point where he lost proper perspective ('spective)
Started cutting off the people he came up with (up with)
Ego blown like his soul had been abducted (abducted)
Though his heart was once real, now material has filled
Up his world, and he couldn't get enough of it (get enough of it)
Used to wanna be the best of the rap dons (rap dons)
Now his only one concern is going platinum (platinum)
And his skills has since decreased, and the inner hunger ceased
Now content, just as long as fame and cash come (cash come)
He's a Big Willie now, rapping 'bout cars
Thousand dollar shopping sprees, hanging out with stars (out with stars)
I mean just a year ago he was broke, bumming money
Drinking out the 40 bottle, living outdoors
Don't let money change ya!
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Don't let money change ya!
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Don't let money change ya!
Laaaaah, di-dah, da-da-dee-dah
Lah-di-dah, da-da-dee-dah

Second LP, my rap changes fast (changes fast)
Here today, gone tomorrow, now his label has (label has)
Found the new poster boy with the hip now sound
Second time around everything isn't stable as (stable as)
It once was, now he's looking for the same hit (same hit)
But his sound is played, he forget to change with (change with)
The moving times, no one feeling him, his rhymes ain't appealing
Anymore, and his records ain't selling shit (ain't selling shit)
Now he's dropped from his label, and he's going broke (going broke)
Tried the underground return, ghetto pass revoked (pass revoked)
And the same faces that he dissed, on his way to the top
Laughed as they watched him do the downstroke (downstroke)
Now the moral of the story is that some go (some go)
Why would money make the inner vision crumble? (crumble)
So if you're blessed with the talent utilize it to the fullest
Be true to yourself and stay humble
Don't let money change ya!
