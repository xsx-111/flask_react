A to G (A2G) Lyrics--We're going to learn to hear words with vowel "A" sound, listen with care

I be the analog arsonist, aimin' at your arteries
All-seeing abstract, analyze everything
Adding on, absolutely abolishing
Average amateur's arsenal just astonishing
--Next, we'll learn words that begin with letter "B"
I be the big, bad body rockin' Bombay to boulevard bully back
Better bring a bomb to the battlefield
Bloody black beats bringing bottoms that boom
Basically build barriers bewilder buffoons
--Listen now to words that begin with letter "C"
Crazy character, constantly creating concontions
Catalyst, a cannabalistic rhymes conqueror
Correctly connecting craniums, crumble down
Consistent capacity
--Next we'll hear words that start with letter "D"
Done did that done did this diddle don
Domination don't dignify diction
Doin' it deep down dialect
During doomsday duck devastate during the duration
--Listen to our song for vowel "E"
Extraterrestrial, electrical, effortless
Eons of energy, everyone affected
Efficiently epitomize excellent
Extravagant elevate where the essence is
--"F" is the letter with which these words begin
Blackalicious got funk for the future filling up fiends finally
Fabulous, furious, fatness, follow me
Fakers fall frequently, fact
Verbal felon fired up federally foundation fadin' all of this wack shit
--You will listen carefully again to words with sounds for letter "G"
*scratches*
I be the Gift of Gab
The- the- the- the- the man with the given gift of gab
Man with the gift of gab
I possess the gift of gab
Gi- gi- gi- gift of gab, gab
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Got the gift of gab
When I shoot the gift, I shoot
The gift of gab like a harpoon
On the serious tip, I'm equipped with a gift
The gift of gab, it don't waiver
Yo, man you gotta
Grab- grab- grab- grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab
--These are the letters B, C, D, and F, and then comes the letter GEmbed
