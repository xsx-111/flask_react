Dream Seasons Lyrics
2000 the season of: All the dreams that you're dreaming of
Trouble times that are easing off
Fill the world full of peace and love
All the souls that are reaching up
Just a song in time be’s enough
To balance out and to even up
All the thoughts that your thinking of

Inner world wisdom
Temporarily all the voice filled in
Light shining in the places that were real dim
Realin'? body mind 'n spirit building
Delivering a scalping to a pilgrim
And throw a pow-wow with indigenous men
Return to present through the womb of a big pen
Slipping back out as altered reality slip in
I'm on a journey to a whole other dimension
The deeper that I get I'm leaving comprehension
Envision a blur life is but a big spin
A musical aura is another way I'm glimpsing

2000 the season of: All the dreams that you're dreaming of
Trouble times that are easing off
Fill the world full of peace and love
All the souls that are reaching up
Just a song in time be’s enough
To balance out and to even up
All the thoughts that your thinking of
Even in the hard times
Feeling precious suddenly I feel the god-mind
I design put me back in line, acting fine
If life is prison then the music is the yard time
It's all fine put my anger in a war rhymes
You won't forget 'em even if you stuck with Alzheimers
From outta nowhere to the Earth so call me fall guy
My big eye guides the vision of my small eyes
It’s from the heart so, good or bad, I won’t apologize
It ain't me anyway it's coming from the all-wise
Raw hide dig in deep into the archives
No matter what I gotta hit it where the ball lies
At all times

2000 the season of: All the dreams that you're dreaming of
Trouble times that are easing off
Fill the world full of peace and love
All the souls that are reaching up
Just a song in time be’s enough
To balance out and to even up
All the thoughts that your thinking of

Go around come around
Come on now
Homeward bound, show 'em how
Growing now
Cop blow 'em down, hold it down
Throw it down
Much wholer now, slowing down
A lowenbrau
A world within a world I'm
Folder now
Woven vow, chosen style
Golden child
Soul in doubt, older now
No denial
In it for the love won't
Throw the towel
Goat around motormouth
No to doubts
All them non believers is
Moded now
Living through the music at
No amounts
Hold the ground on the town
Grow a pound
2000 the season of: All the dreams that you're dreaming of
Trouble times that are easing off
Fill the world full of peace and love
All the souls that are reaching up
Just a song in time easing ya
To balance out and to even up
All the thoughts that your thinking of

You are ready to go on

2000 the season of: All the dreams that you're dreaming of
Trouble times that are easing off
Fill the world full of peace and love
All the souls that are reaching up
Just a song in time be’s enough
To balance out and to even up
All the thoughts that your thinking of
