As the World Turns Lyrics"Now, I thought I would talk about today
For your consideration, as the world turns
As the world turns, you read in all these scriptures
About the world, find out that the world does turn!"
As the world keeps spinning, we live these days
Dollar bill done drove the whole world crazy
While sitting on the porch letting ganja blaze
Never hesitate a moment to enhance my phrase
Since I needed that escape I take my pull
Seen the thugs on the corner trying to act all cool
Pretty much out of character
I look right through, their transparent exterior
You in my book getting written and I'm the derriere
Thought you was peeping me but I was aware of ya
You peep my ill expressions, how I just glare about
Trying to trace my inner world and my whereabouts
Well try on, try on
I'm watching everything that's going down
And it ain't nothing that I ain't been around
The same ghetto but a different town
Weeell, I remember growing up in the P-a-c
It was a whole lot of love in my family
I had clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
Times we didn't have a lot but that was fine with me
In good times and even bad times
Whether rainy, grey sky or the sunshine
Life was so much simpler, I didn't realise it then
But time has definitely made me a wiser man
The world keeps turning round
And time just keeps on moving
Sunday morning in the church just singing a song
Mama gave much praise cause her soul was strong
When I was young I used to do lots of thangs was wrong
I never thought about till one day she was gone
Now my daddy passed on about a year before
Reminiscing as I glance at the fishing pole
But these things gotta happen so we all can grow
And now they spirits much freer than they was befo'
So fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on
Cause there's angels in the midst
And they're guiding and watching me every day
And even though at times I let it get to me
Just a little and I go astray
We keep marching on and on
Young militants will watch and now we're growing
With kids of their own, as it all unfolds
As the world keeps turning on, the world keeps turning on

This one goes out to family, y'all come first
