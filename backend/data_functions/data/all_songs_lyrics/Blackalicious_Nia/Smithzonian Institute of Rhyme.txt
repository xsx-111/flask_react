Smithzonian Institute of Rhyme Lyrics
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Blackalicious
Lateef the Truth Speaker

A little something

Now if you want some you best come with a gun
You can't fuck with the tongue or the way the song is sung
By Lateef and Blackalicious we keep it fat, delicious
Complete and grant your wishes
So peep the rap and listen
You can't be idle you best come trifle
But even with a rifle your style'll get stifled

Quick

Lateef and Blackalicious we coming for that dough to get
The lyrics that we wrote again
Are sounding rather viscous beyond scientific
I'll snap like a doberman I'm unable to hold it in
I really hope you feel it, check it out
Drop a little topic and me apocalypse
Hip hop metropolis we stalking mc's
Don't stop this marvelous three partners
This bottomless beat has opened wideness
Inviting us inside of its deep rhythmic environment
A labyrinth, its violent beings just won't be silent
And higher, and higher means to a world (?)
Where all I need is prez
And that is my rent
Just by fating the rest
Who won't admire it
Won't rule as a tyrant
Don't condone violence
Till the next man tries it
Don't tax no pirate
Just watch as I begin to shape your world
All mc's in the land spanked and baked and broiled
Charred and seasoned in a pan
Damn
Awakened world stagnant even though they always been there
Lagging about exposing it to the hearing impaired establishment
Raw energy they can't be compared
Tag em then we drag them then we finished  yeah

Now if you want some you best come with a gun
You can't fuck with the tongue or the way the song is sung
By Lateef and Blackalicious we keep it fat, delicious
Complete and grant your wishes
So peep the rap and listen
You can't be idle you best come trifle
But even with a rifle your style'll get stifled
Quick

Let it hit them
The suffocation begins your soul it gets engulfed in
The sound like its emotion it works just like a potion
It hurts just like that's only motion gotta think about some rules
See it can't just all be coasting
Get to get the spectrum of the wave
Whenever you know its flowing
Got a notion and its deep keep it growing like the ocean don't get salty
Its just me get a dose that's instantaneous essential constantly
Fits like a constellation glowing naturally in facts you see the past
The future marches on triumphantly defiantly relentlessly
If it ain't one thing its something something else
The instrumental that contributes to your mental health
As for most emcees we moving like a ninja that is killin' ya stealthily
Handle your business candidly fool we gigantic globally locally
And organically ain't nothing you gonna do that's gonna damage me
In this current scene, its tragedy we value beyond championing originality
Is this shit that's happen
We trigger an emotional response causes you to react violently
Yeah we trigger an emotional response causes you to react violently

Now if you want some you best come with a gun
You can't fuck with the tongue or the way the song is sung
By Lateef and Blackalicious we keep it fat, delicious
Complete and grant your wishes
So peep the rap and listen
You can't be idle you best come trifle
But even with a rifle your style'll get stifled
Quick

Lateef and Blackalicious is coming for that dough to get
The lyrics that we wrote again are sounding rather vicious
Now if you want some you better come with a gun
You can't fuck with the tongue
Or your ass'll get stung by Lateef and Blackalicious
We keep it fat, delicious
Complete and grant your wishes
We move just like eclipses
You can't be idle cause even with a title
And even with a rifle your style'll get stifled hey

The king is going home to get his throne
From the root to the fruit that's where everything started at
