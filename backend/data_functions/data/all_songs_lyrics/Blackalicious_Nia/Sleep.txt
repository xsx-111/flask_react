Sleep Lyrics(Sleep)

The hazy days go to nights returning on and on
The eye in the sky that don't lie be watching all y'all
The troublesome time filled anxieties just keep crawling on
And a dream world line up in your mind just keep on calling y'all

The shining lights of stages after the show are faded
The crowd is gone away, and now the dawning day
Gives way to creatures lurking, can hear the crickets chirping
Only the owls can see for this is when they stalk their prey
The homeless ask for quarters for shelter and some water
Say "sorry not today" and turn and walk away
The busy street is empty whistling winds are blowing gently
Listening intently to all of the things they have to say
A day of work completed a night of rest is needed
Almost done read a book but eyelids to heavy to read it
The fireplace is kindling, snug with your queen and building
About the victories tomorrow's gonna bring your way

The hazy days go to nights returning on and on
The eye in the sky that don't lie be watching all y'all
The troublesome time filled anxieties just keep crawling on
And a dream world line up in your mind just keep on calling y'all
Gazing outside the window the sunny skies dwindle
And now it's full of stars a hurling comet soars
While during the body slumber the soul begins to wander
To dream dimensions see the inner conscious doesn't pause
Keeps moving where it's bound to say now I lay me down to
After that stretch and yawn energy left and gone
The sandman's on your shoulder whispering in your ear he told you
Let all your problems go tonight I'm rapping hear my song
A day of work completed a night of rest is needed
Almost done with a book but eyelids to heavy to read it
The fireplace is kindling snug with your queen and building
About the victories tomorrow's gonna bring your way

The hazy days go to nights returning on and on
The eye in the sky that don't lie be watching all y'all
The troublesome time filled anxieties just keep crawling on
And a dream world line up in your mind just keep on calling y'all
The hazy days go to nights returning on and on
The eye in the sky that don't lie be watching all y'all
The troublesome time filled anxieties just keep crawling on
And a dream world line up in your mind just keep on calling y'allEmbed
