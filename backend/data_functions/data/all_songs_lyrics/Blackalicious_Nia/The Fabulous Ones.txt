The Fabulous Ones LyricsSuper fabulous the patterns have been uplifted
Smokin' chalice with the maddest and the most spliffed
Turn the alphabet to calculus and flow swiftly
See the matter of the fact is that I'm so gifted
Due payer you do say I behead a terra moda rhymin' in a toupee
A true player who moves layers of earth
Showin' you are officially ridin' with the crusaders
Check it, I go Hawaiian on an island in a fat tipi
Then down to Thailand for some dining in a black three piece
I'm intertwining and aligning with a mack thesis
The tongue of iron rule the lion of this rap species
I go abominable all up in your snowcone
Clockin' the dollars goin' all across the globe scorin'
All of the followers of doubters I'll be cold doin'
The diabolical infallible that's most cruel and

In come the fabulous ones, make way for the fabulous ones
In come the fabulous ones, make way for the fabulous ones
Super fabulous the patterns have been updated
Wanna battle you'll be baffled at the stuff stated
Drowning in the shallow waters of the rough ragin'
Verbal canoe with no paddle heading up state and
I got a home made of chrome, got an iron maiden
Etchin' poems in the stone with a wire cable
I'm the lone wolf who don't condone violating
And when its on I'm leavin' domes steady vibrating

I love waiting for rappers to arrive baked
It's my nature so smile now and die later
Cause y'all fakers, and nothing but some cry babies
That's why I'm writing out your citations
Check it, I'm riding shotty doing Gotti dirty work spiffy
In an Impala with a dolly and her skirts skimpy
The verbal scholly make you holla, you get hurt simply
Cause the holocaust, and all across the earth's empty

Super fabulous the patterns have been upgraded
Triple stamina commando get your hut raided
Couldn't handle it you panicked and your luck faded
Keep on yapping out your trap and I'mma duck tape it
See we been doing this since you was in a wet diaper
Confusing as a Rubix cube is to decipher
Intuitive just like Confucius in your next life
Or a new addition of a ludicrously vexed sniper
Pursuing moving units influence the next writers
Student you ruin because you're truant before your test biter
Blooming and moving on in unison consuming the consumer
And you and your crew'll be known as 'west siders'

Welcome to a new kind of listening experienceEmbed
