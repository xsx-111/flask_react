July LyricsThe sun fell down again last night on my anger
The sun fell down again last night on my frustration
And on my spite
And I didn't even cry
I didn't even try to stop it at all
I just stood there and watched it fall
The sun fell down again last night on my anger
The sun fell down again last night on my frustration
And on my spite
And I didn't even cry
I didn't even try to stop it at all
I just stood there and watched it fall
And this is the last song that I should ever sing
And this is the last song that I should ever sing
Just one more time and I'll shut my mouth forever
Just one more time and I'll shut my mouth foreverEmbed
