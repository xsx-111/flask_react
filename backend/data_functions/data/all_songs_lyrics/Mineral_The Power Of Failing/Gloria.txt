Gloria Lyrics
A brave morning, thoughts flap their wings and fly
And I can still taste defeat on my lips
Bright tie, fish fly, I have not yet arrived
How can I not admit, I need to know you

'Cause I just want to be
Something more than the mud in your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands

Hey sorrow, where are you?
Tomorrow just won't be the same without you here
I'll wish for shoulders bold and broad to bear
And strength to hold my head above them

'Cause I just want to be
Something more than the mud in your eyes
I want to be the clay in your hands

'Cause Gloria is silent, Gloria is silent
Gloria is silent and glory is a silent thingEmbed
