Five, Eight and Ten Lyrics
The humble and righteous and meek
Are teaching me whose will to seek
But who really knows how to speak
About these things
Questions of where can he go
When he is feeling so low
And kicking himself just to show
How he still bleeds

And I want to know
The difference between
What sparkles
And what is gold

I wonder how many eyes
Are fixed like a vulture's on me now
I wonder if I can even move or breathe
Without disappointing someone
And I know what they call themselves
But I don't remember inviting them
To put me on this pedestal and make me feel so naked
Afraid to look down, afraid to turn around
I'll bring it on myself
I know I'll bring it on myself

And I want to know
The difference between
What sparkles
And what is gold

I walked along beside the purple mountains
Beneath the orange sky
Imagined what it all might look like
With these planks out of my eyes
I wondered if the big white horse
Was coming down tonight
I wanted to taste that victory
But my mouth was dry, my mouth was dry
There is only tonight
And the light that bleeds from your heart
Makes me want to try
And start againEmbed
