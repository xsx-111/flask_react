Take the Picture Now LyricsThere are blue skies in my dreams
And laughter that seems unending
There are green grass fields there
And happiness and hope for tomorrow
My cup is full and my heart
Spills awkward and embarrasing blood
Onto white golden streets
And I am unashamed of the stains my steps leave
Tears stream down my cheeks
Only to meet their redeemer
And be wiped away, wiped away
And there is joy, there is joy
And there is joy, there is joyEmbed
