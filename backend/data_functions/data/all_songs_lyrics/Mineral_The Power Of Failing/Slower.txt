Slower Lyrics
It's been so long since I've been by myself
And I need this more than you will ever know
People like you and me never feel the breeze
People like you and me will never know the easy way

I scream into the wind and laugh
As the words slap me in the face
I would gladly trade a lifetime of convenience
For an honest day or two
It's just not the same when you're staring
Into a perfect golden sunset
And thinking about how you sold your soul
To send the rain away

It's been so long since I've stood on my two feet
I'd really rather lay here and pretend
But people like you and me never get that peace
It comes from denying that everything is so screwed up
It's so screwed up

I stand on a building and throw
Up my arms to the sky
I swallow my pride and admit that it's not always best
To understand the reasons why
It's just not the same when you wake up in the morning
With a smile on your face
When you know you lied yourself to sleep
To make it betterEmbed
