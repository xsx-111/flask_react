Parking Lot LyricsI wouldn't mind if you took me in my sleep tonight
I wouldn't even put up a fight
I wouldn't care if you took it all away today
I'm sure I wouldn't even miss the pain
But I know I've got to live my life
And roll around on the ground and feel the strife
And realize along the way that I'm nothing more than
A grain of salt in the salt of the earth, and everything is grace
So come on with the darkness
Come on with the fear
Cause I've got to start somewhere
And it might as well be here
And when I'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight
I'll look back at all this selfishness and foolish pride
And laugh at myself, laugh at myself
Laugh at myself, laugh at myself
Laugh at myself3Embed
