Avalanche LyricsI lie in a field, in the trailer-park of my dreams
Saving up for someday
But what does someday mean?
And I'm young but I let it slip on by
I'm co-dependent and I'm not in side
And you, you look like freedom
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need
And there's a road, leads away from here
And every day I stand in place and watch it disappear
And there's a bird, circles in my mind
Security's the whore in me that never lets me fly
And you, you look like freedom
And you,you look like change
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need
With your sunburned soul
And your hunger for the road
I'm snowblind and I'm crying after
Like nothing else matters
When you go down take me
When you go down, yah, make me
I got a hunger you could feed
And I know it's a fine line divides
The place I'm looking for and what's inside
And I know it's a long, long way
Through the outskirts of everyday
And you, you look like freedom, you look like change
You look like the avalanche I need
The avalanche I need
