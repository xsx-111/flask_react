Heart and Shoulder LyricsWanna cry for you
Would it do any good?
If I rained for you
It would just be water
And the night's with you
And the storm's in your hand
And you're down, and you're down
And I can't lift you
I'm powerless to change your world
I'm powerless to stop the hurt
But I'll give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
I give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
Over and over
Wanna run for you
Would it do any good?
If I flew for you
You would still be standing
And it's hard watching
'Cause I'm part of you
And it's hard not to
Not to know what I can do
I'm powerless to change your world
I'm powerless to stop the hurt
I'm trying hard to be your tower of strength
I'm trying hard to bring you back to joy
I'll give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
I give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
When the night just cuts you through
And the dream is lost to you
When you're worried and confused
I will give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
I give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
Over and over
Time and again
Give you my shoulder
I will, I give
Give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
I will
I will
Time and again
Over and over
I give you my heart
Give you my shoulderEmbed
