Water From Wine LyricsI've lost my headlights
Dark lets me see too much
And I'm just groping for anything to touch
Am I a seabird? I have the strangest cry
Am I just drifting? Am I too far inside?
Everything's changing, changing my mind
I'm going backwards to water from wine
I can hear thunder but I am made of stone
I'm reaching out but I'm still alone
Look for my body but it just disappears
Nobody knows me everything feels like years
Everything's changing, changing my mind
I'm going backwards to water from wine
I look for joy it's in the cracks sometimes
I can hear music but it's been locked insideEmbed
