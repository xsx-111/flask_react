Blood of Me LyricsBig ring around the moon
It's gonna rain hard soon
I know you're gonna leave
It's like a storm inside
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts
You're the memory
You're the drug that works
Why do people change
When hearts, hearts, still beat the same ?
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts
You're the memory, yeah
You're the drug that works
I don't believe you when you tell me
I don't believe you when you hold me
I don't believe you
You're my medicine
I don't believe you when you fuck me
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts
You're the memory, yeah
You're the memory
You're the drug that works
You're the Blood Of Me, yeah
You're the Blood Of Me
You're the truth that hurts, hurts
You're the memory, yeah
You're the memory
You're the drug that works
Big ring around the moon
Gonna rain hard soonEmbed
