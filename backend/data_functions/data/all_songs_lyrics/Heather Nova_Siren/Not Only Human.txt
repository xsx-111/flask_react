Not Only Human LyricsMorning is almost here, let it wait
I just want to lie here a while, tempting fate
I don't think I could breathe now with you gone
But it's not weakness it's just something I've begun
Maybe there's a light that's always on
Maybe we're not only human (maybe)
Maybe there's a light that's always on
And we're not only human
When you're sleeping your ceramic
You're surrounded by little stars
Every shimmer is a searchlight
Every planet is ours
Change the street, change the decade
Still the longing's left inside
But why am I too small to carry you?
Why does twilight make me cry?
Maybe there's a light that's always on
Maybe we're not only human (maybe)
Maybe there's a light that's always on
And we're not only human
When all is said and done
When all the weight is gone
When all is said and done
When all the weight is gone
We're not only human
Life is something set to music
I can hear it when I'm sad
There's a chord in every muscle
Every kiss you ever had
There's a power when you're near me
In our heads or in our bones
I know nothing, but I'm guessing
When we die we're not alone
Maybe there's a light that's always on
Maybe we're not only human (maybe)
Maybe there's a light that's always on
And we're not only human
When all is said and done
When all the weight is gone
When all is said and done
When all the weight is gone
We're not only human
Not only human
