Ruby Red LyricsI've got a ruby red desire
Like a virus like my last hope
I've got a ruby red desire
I've got to hear the red bird sing
I've got to rip this cord
And rinse this lazy blood
Clear a path and walk away
I've been waiting for the sky to fall
I've been worried I could lose it all
I've been waiting for the safety net
Tell myself that I'm not ready yet
And every memory's a dream
And each uncertainty reminds me why
I saw a kid outside playing by a moongate
Making paper things that fly
I've been waiting for the sky to fall
I've been worried I could lose it all
I've been waiting for the safety net
Tell myself that I'm not ready yet
I want to live (and shed my skin)
I want to live (and dive in)
I want to live (and shed my skin)
I want to live (and dive in)
I've been waiting for the sky to fall
I've been worried I could lose it all
I've been waiting for the safety net
Tell myself that I'm not ready yet
I want to live (and shed my skin)
I want to live (and dive in)
I want to live (and shed my skin)
I want to live (and dive in)Embed
