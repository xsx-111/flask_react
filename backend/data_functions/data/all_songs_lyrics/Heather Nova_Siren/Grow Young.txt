Grow Young LyricsSitting here on the water's edge
Now that the storm is gone
First time in years it feels like
Nothing's wrong
There've been a lot of changes
I was so lost for a while
Sitting here I remember
How it's easy to smile
Oh let me grow young
Like a brand new day
Like I've just begun
Like a shiver like a rush
Like a soul I might touch
Let me grow young
Nobody to tell me where to go
Nobody to call
Just me and the kiskedees
And my guitar
Oh let me grow young
Like a brand new day
Like I've just begun
Like a shiver like a rush
Like a soul I might touch
Let me grow young
Gotta try to remember this feeling
Gotta store it up inside
Bring it out when it's cold in the city
And I'm worried and tired
Oh let me grow young
Like a brand new day
Like I've just begun
Like a shiver like a rush
Like a soul I might touch
Let me grow youngEmbed
