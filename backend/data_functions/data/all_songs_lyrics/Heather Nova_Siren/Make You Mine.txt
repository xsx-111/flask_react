Make You Mine LyricsYou're the one I think about time after time
You're the one that comes to me, visions in the night
I want to complicate your feelings
I want to heat you up inside
Yeah yeah yeah, I wanna make you mine
I'll be your sun coming up
I'll be your dog days
I'll be your new morning
Kiss you baby
I'll be the bluebird singing
I'll keep you warm
I'll take you deep in
Take you deep in
Gonna make my bed beside you
In the bluebells of your soul
Gonna slip into your river, babe
Linger in your shoals
And when the stars are bright like fireflies
And the night is black as coal
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm gonna make you mine
I'll be your sun coming up
I'll be your dog days
I'll be your sweet honey
I kiss you baby
I'll be the bluebird singing
I'll keep you warm
I'll take you deep in
Take you deep in
On another side of time
Before the sea runs dry
Yeah yeah yeah
On another side of time
Where the love runs high
I'm gonna make you mine
Gonna make you mine X4
Gonna make you mine, yeah
I'll be your sun coming up
I'll be your dog days
I'll be your new morning
Kiss you baby
I'll be the bluebird singing
I'll keep you warm
I'll take you deep in
Take you deep in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
On another side of time
Before the sea runs dry
Yeah yeah yeah
On another side of time
Where the love runs high
I'm gonna make you mine
Gonna make you mine
Gonna make you mine
I'm gonna make you mine
On another side of time
Before the sea runs dry
Yeah yeah yeah
On another side of time
Where the love runs high
I'm gonna make you mine
Gonna make you mine
Gonna make you mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna make you mine
Gonna make you mine
In the bluebells of your soul
Yeah before the sea runs dryEmbed
