Valley of Sound LyricsMove me
Don't try
Let the music
Reach me tonight
Push me over
Into something new
I've been riding all day on a bus
Just to listen to you
I love, I love, I love I love the look
In your trespassed eyes
I love, I love, I love I love the way
You can make me cry
Sink me into stirred-up sea
Something I can drown in
Only you can do this to me
I love, I love, I love I love the look
In your trespassed eyes
I love, I love, I love I love the way
You can make me cry
Fill me up
And drop me down, yeah
Now I'm alive in the valley of sound
In the valley of sound
In the valley of sound, yeah
In the valley of sound
I love, I love, I love I love the look
In your trespassed eyes, yeah
I love, I love, I love I love the way
You can make me cry
Yeah yeah, in the valley of sound
Hmm, the valley of sound, yeah yeah yeah
Valley, valley, you can
The valley of sound
YeahEmbed
