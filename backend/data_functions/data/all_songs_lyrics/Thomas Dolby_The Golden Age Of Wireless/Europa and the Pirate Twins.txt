Europa and the Pirate Twins Lyrics
Okay
I was fourteen
She was twelve
Father traveled, hers as well, Europa
Down the beaches, hand in hand
Twelfth of never on the sand
Then war took her away
We swore a vow that day:
We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country, Europa
I'll stand beside you in the rain, Europa
Ta république, Europa
Nine years after
Who'd I see on the cover of a magazine?
Europa
Buy her singles and see all her films
Paste her pictures on my windowsill
But that's not quite the same - it isn't, is it?
Europa, my old friend
We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country (Oh my country), Europa
I'll walk beside you in the rain, Europa
Ta république, Europa
Blew in from the hoverport
She was back in London
Pushed past the papermen
Calling her name
She smiled for the cameras
As a bodyguard grabbed me
Her eyes were gone forever as they drove her away
We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country, Europa
I'll walk beside you in the rain, Europa
Ta république, Europa
We'll be the Pirate Twins again, Europa
Oh my country (Oh my country now)
I'll stand beside you in the rain, Europa
Ta république, Europa
Down in some bar along the Seine, Europa
Oh my country, Europa
I'll walk beside you in the rain, Europa
Ta république, EuropaEmbed
