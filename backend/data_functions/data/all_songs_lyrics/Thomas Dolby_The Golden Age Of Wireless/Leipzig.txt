Leipzig LyricsThirty-nine and you need some leeway
Soon you're eyeing the overseas page
The trains are running late as you close the garden gate
Step through your steel front door frame
"Dinner's in the microwave, sweetie"
Leipzig is calling you Henry (on the cardboard thoroughfare)
Leipzig is calling you Jane
Leipzig is calling you Leonard (and the clouds run parallel)
Leipzig is calling your name
Cars were burning on yellow lines
Wheels turning, traffic light changing
Another misty bus-queue morning
Faces smile down from a hoarding
Stoop to the bin, drop something in
Well you'll soon feel yourself again
And every place is just the same, isn't it?
Leipzig is calling you, Benny (from the mouth of the megaphone)
Leipzig is calling you, James
Leipzig is calling you, Leonard (and other cartoon characters)
Leipzig is calling your name
Like the sound of taxi brakes
The sound of a dentist's drill
The colour of skates on ice under clingfilm
It's calling:
Leipzig is calling your name
Hear it calling
And every place is just the same isn't it?
Leipzig is calling you, Benny (from the mouth of the megaphone)
Leipzig is calling you, James
Leipzig is calling you, Leonard (and other cartoon characters)
Leipzig is calling your nameEmbed
