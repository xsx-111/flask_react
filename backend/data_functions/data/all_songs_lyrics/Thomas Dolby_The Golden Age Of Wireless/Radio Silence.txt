Radio Silence LyricsCaroline
Makes the final adjustments
In her rear-view mirror
She's nervous and tense
But she's thinking it over
With logic and sense
She'll overcome her phobia
Oh to paint her eyes so red and her lips so blue
Carve her legend on the bow - Caroline four-five-two
When they come to call for her I will be there too
Observe Radio Silence observe
Radio Silence observe Radio Silence
Maintain Radio Silence throughout
Now where can he be?
What's wrong with the parking meter? What's happening to me?
She'll burst a blood vessel if he doesn't show
She's caught up in traffic
And I am on her radio
Oh to paint her eyes so red and her lips so blue
Raise her likeness on the mast, Caroline four-five-two
When they come to call for her, I will be there too
She tune in till the tune suits her right
She tune in till the dial come alight
She turn the dial till the needle is in the white
Tune in tonight
Tune in tonight
Tune in tonight
Try to think of nothingEmbed
