One Of Our Submarines Lyrics
One of our submarines
Is missing tonight
Seems she ran aground on manoeuvres
One of our submarines

A hungry heart
To regulate their breathing
One more night
The Winter Boys are freezing in their spam tin
A Baltic moon
Along the northern seaboard
And down below
The Winter Boys are waiting for the storm

Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye
Shallow water, channel and tide
And I can trace my history
Down a generation to my home
In one of our submarines
(One of our submarines)

The red light flicker, sonar weak
Air valves hissing open
Half her pressure blown away
Flounder in the ocean
See the Winter Boys drinking heavy water from a stone
Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye
Shallow water, channel and tide
Bye-bye empire, empire bye-bye
Tired illusion drown in the night
And I can trace my history
Down one generation to my home
In one of our submarines

One of our submarines
One of our submarines
One of our submarines
Is missing tonight
Seems she ran aground on manoeuvres
One of our submarines1Embed
