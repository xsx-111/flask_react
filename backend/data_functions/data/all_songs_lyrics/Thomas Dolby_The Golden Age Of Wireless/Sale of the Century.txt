Sale of the Century LyricsMy economist's been in touch
My commodities don't mean much
Take a look at those unit trusts
Everybody here's going bust
It's the sale of the century-get back in line
The sale of the century-these things take time
The sale of the century-you place or mine?
Take a lesson on easy terms
Take the money but don't get burned
False economy pave the way
Now we're turning a whole new page
In the sale of the century-get back in line
The sale of the century-these things take time
The sale of the century-you place or mine?
Palm grove on horizon
Some fruit are sweet and some are poison
The Sale of the Century!Embed
