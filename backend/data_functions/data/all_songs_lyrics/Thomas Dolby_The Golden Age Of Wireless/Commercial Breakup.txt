Commercial Breakup LyricsNight so bright - transmission smooth
I take my head and I take my head
And stuff it in the tube
I find something that I can use
But there's no credit where no credit is due
It cost me ten dollars
But in thirty seconds it's so clear
And I adhere - I'm only humanoid
Oh man - they're waving from the street again
"Hey Franzi!", they're calling up to me
"We're living, we're living through the breakup
This is the breakup, commercial breakup
Commercial breakup, here it comes again."
Well just today you told me
You told me 'bout the way it is
I walk on out and make me
A few small purchases
What was that name you called me?
Say, what was that grin you grinned?
An expression so uncertain
That breaks a line so thin?
Well now that 2-D, and that 2-D beckons - the colour is high
It seems so ripe - don't touch the line hold
Something has dropped me in the heat again
"Hey Franzi!  What about your symphony?
We're living, we're living through the breakup
This is the breakup, commercial breakup
Commercial breakup, here it comes again"
("Here we go!  And the first item up for bids on The Price is Right is a telephone booth!")
C'mon, break it up!
Night so bright - transmission smooth
I take my head and I take my head
And stuff it in the tube
I find something that I can use
But there's no credit where no credit is due
It cost me ten dollars
But the 2D beckons, the colour is high
It seems so right - so alive!
Something has dropped me in the heat again
"Hey Franzi!  What about your symphony?
We're living, we're living through the breakup
This is the breakup, commercial breakup."
Oh man - they're waving from the street again
"Hey Franzi!", they're calling up to me
"We're living, we're living through the breakup
This is the breakup, commercial breakup
Commercial breakup, here it comes again."Embed
