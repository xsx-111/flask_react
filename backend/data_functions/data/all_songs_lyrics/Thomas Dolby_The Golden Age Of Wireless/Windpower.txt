Windpower LyricsSwitch off the mind and let the heart decide
Who you were meant to be
Flick to remote and let the body glide
There is no enemy
Etch out a future of your own design
Well tailored to your needs
Then fan the flame and keep the dream alive
Of a continent, a continent, a continent, a continent, a
Windpower
There is no enemy
Switch of the mind and let the heart decide
We're a continent, a continent, a continent, a continent, a
Shatter the lens and grind it into sand
One measured exposure
Scatter the seed and furrow in our land
The future is roses, roses
Switch off the mind and let the heart decide
There is no enemy
Lift up the hearts of this your only tribe
We're a continent, a continent, a continent, a continent, a
We're a continent, a continent, a continent, a continent, aEmbed
