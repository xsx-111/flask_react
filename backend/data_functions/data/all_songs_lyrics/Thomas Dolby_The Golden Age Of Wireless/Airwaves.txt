Airwaves LyricsStrange how the scale forms
In tiny patterns
On my antenna
And the five o'clock show, 'Allo, 'Allo
Brooklyn is crawling with famous people
I turn my vehicle beneath the river, west from south
Through the airwaves
People never read the airwaves
Do we only feed the airwaves
I really should have seen through the airwaves
Electric fences line our new freeway
Here in the half-light, the motor homes leave
Knee-deep in water under a pylon
How slow my heartbeat
How thin the air I'm breathing in
Through the airwaves
People never read the airwaves
Do we only feed the airwaves
Or stamp them out at street level?
Airwaves, the dampness of the wind
The airwaves, the tension of the skin
The airwaves
Control has enabled the abandoned wires again
But the copper cables all rust in the acid rain
That flood the subway with elements of our corrosion
Cadled in to me, cable them to me
Cable them to me
Be in my broadcast when this is over
Give me your shoulder
I need a place to wait for morning
No it was nothing, some car backfiring
Please don't ask questions
I itch all over
Let me sleep
Through the airwaves
People never read the airwaves
Do we only feed the airwaves
Or stamp them out at street level?
Airwaves, the dampness of the wind
The airwaves, the tension of the skin
The airwaves I really should have seen throughEmbed
