White Punks On Dope LyricsTeenage, had a race for the nighttime
Spent my cash on every high I could find
Wasted time in every school in L.A
Gettin' loose, I didn't care what the kids say
We're white punks on dope
Mom and Dad moved to Hollywood
Hang myself when I get enough rope
Can't clean up, though I know I should
White punks on dope, white punks on dope
White punks on dope, white punks on dope
Other dudes are living in the ghetto
But born in Pacific Heights
Don't seem much betto
We're white punks on dope
Mom and Dad live in Hollywood
Hang myself when I get enough rope
I can't clean up, though I know I should
White punks on dope, white punks on dope
White punks on dope, white punks on dope
I go crazy cause my folks are so fuckin' rich
Have to score when I get that rich white punk itch
Sounds real classy, living in a chateau
So lonely, all the other kids will never know
We're white punks on dope
Mom and Dad live in Hollywood
Hang myself when I get enough rope
I can't clean up, though I know I should
White punks on dope, white punks on dope
White punks on dope, white punks on dope
White punks on dope, white punks on dopeEmbed
