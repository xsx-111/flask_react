Up From The Deep LyricsTell me how you want it
And that's how we'll play it
Listen to our single
Watch how they play it
Tell me how you want it
That's how I'll have our guitar player
Roger Steen, play it
Play this song together
That's how we like it
And all my boys will play along
Even if they don't like the song
Even if the progression's wrong
Wake us up from a sleep
Comin' up from the deepEmbed
