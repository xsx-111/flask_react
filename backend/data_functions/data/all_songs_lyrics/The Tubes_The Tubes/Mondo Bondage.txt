Mondo Bondage LyricsMondo Bondage
I've been tied up so long
There's no escape
I've been strangled
All choked up inside
Swallowed all my pride
Roped and hogtied
Been tied up in knots
That's all I got
G-g-gimme glove shoes
This ain't no way for havin' fun
I could run away to Spain
But I'd just get tied again
I could run off to Jamaica
If this bondage I could break-a
I could run away to Spain
But I'd just get tied again
I could run off to Jamaica
If this bondage I could break-aEmbed
