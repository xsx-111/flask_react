Space Baby LyricsSpace baby, you got no planet
Space baby, you got no planet
Got no home to give a name
No air to breathe, but just the same
I dig my atmosphere machine
Space baby, you been so far
Unknown face on an unknown star
The time is now my life's begun
I'm burnin' green like a rhomboid sun
I've never seen a flower grow
It's a mystery to me just how my being came to be
And why it came here
Maybe I'm not even human but I know
There's lots of room, infinity
There's got to be a time and place
For me to cease this endless search
And settle down with my own race
And never, ever, ever be a Space Baby
Space Baby
Space Baby
Space..., you got no planet
Space Baby, you been so far
