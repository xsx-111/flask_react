Haloes LyricsI am looking for someone today
Someone I can get to see my way
When I find that light I'll lay down low
When I know I'm right I won't let go
In my mind I feel this world is small
I think I would like to see some more
Eventhough my name is in the neighborhood
I can't find that line in the way I should
Can't they tell I built my heart a wall
And I would be so glad to be recalled
Looking through the eyes of one who knows
The world is small, but I could make it grow
How can I believe in the things you say
You can't sing the song I wanna play
Hey by now I know I got it right
And you can't even see the end in sight
In my mind I feel this world is small
I think I'd like to see some more
Looking through the eyes of one who knows
The world is small but I could make it grow
In my mind I feel this world is small
I think I'd like to see some moreEmbed
