Boy Crazy LyricsWas it Jimmy's fault on your first date
You promised Mom you wouldn't be home late
At the drive-in you climbed in the back
Skipped the movies and forgot the snack
Petting heavy didn't, didn't bother you
Your eighth grade teacher showed you what to do
Failed your English and Biology
But you learned the facts of life from A to Z
Boy Crazy, from town to town
Boy Crazy, the rumor went around
Boy Crazy, from town to town
Forgot all the names
They're all the same
Forgot all the names
Jimmy told Bobby 'bout your transgressions
And you told the priest in your confession
And he told ya God would get ya someday
But you were to quick, and ya moved on Monday
Another waitress with an I.U.D
Went to the clinic, where you got it free
There's something missing, but you don't know what
Someone should tell ya, I'd rather not
Boy Crazy, from town to town
Boy Crazy, the rumor went around
Boy Crazy, from town to town
Forgot all the names
They're all the same
Forgot all the names
Boy Crazy, so ya...
Boy Crazy
Boy Crazy
The rumor went around
Boy Crazy
Boy Crazy
Boy Crazy
Rumor went around
Boy Crazy
Boy Crazy
Boy Crazy
Rumor went around
Boy Crazy
Boy Crazy
Boy Crazy
Rumor went aroundEmbed
