No Pressure Over Cappuccino (MTV Unplugged) LyricsAnd you're like a 90's Jesus
And you revel in your psychosis
How dare you?
And you sample concepts like hors d'oeurves
And you eat their questions for dessert
And is it just me or is it hot in here?
And you're like a 90's Kennedy
And you're really a million years old
You can't fool me
They'll throw opinions like rocks in riots
And they'll stumble around like hypocrites
Is it just me or is it dark in here?
You may never be or have a husband
You may never have or hold a child
You will learn to lose everything
We are temporary arrangements
And you're like a 90's Noah
And they laughed at you
As you packed all of your things
And they wonder why you're frustrated
And they wonder why you're so angry
And is it just me or are you fed up?
God bless you in your travels
In your conquests and queries2Embed
