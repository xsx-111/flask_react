Princes Familiar (MTV Unplugged) Lyrics
Please be philosophical
Please be tapped into your femininity
Please be able to take the wheel from me
Please be crazy and curious

Papa, love your princess
So that she will find loving princes familiar
Papa, cry for your princess
So that she will find gentle princes familiar

Please be a sexaholic
Please be unpredictably miserable
Please be self absorbed much (not the good kind)
Please be addicted to some substance

Papa, listen to your princess
So that she will find attentive princes familiar
Papa, hear your princess so that she will find curious princes familiar

Please be the jerk of my knee
I've fit you always
You finish my sentences
I think I love you
What is your name again
No matter
I'm guessing your thoughts again correctly
And I love
The way you press my buttons so much sometimes I could strangle you
Papa, laugh with your princess
So that she will find funny princes familiar
Papa, respect your princess
So that she will find respectful princes familiar
Papa, love your princess
So that she will find loving princes familiar
Papa, cry for your princess
So that she will find gentle princes familiar

Please be strangely enigmatic
Please be just like my2Embed
