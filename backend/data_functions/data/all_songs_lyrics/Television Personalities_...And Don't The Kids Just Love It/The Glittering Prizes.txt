The Glittering Prizes LyricsIn the past I always tried
But I never got amongst the glittering prizes
I put it down to confidence
Or something trendy like an emotional complex
Pretty soon I'm gonna change
Pretty soon I'm gonna change
Pretty soon I'm gonna change
You won't recognize me
Glittering prizes for me
Glittering prizes for me
I wear a clean shirt every day
I quite enjoy my job as an office boy
But the novelty begins to fade
'Cause I never get the chance to play with executive toys
Pretty soon I'm gonna change
Pretty soon I'm gonna change
Pretty soon I'm gonna change
You won't recognize me
Glittering prizes for me
Glittering prizes for meEmbed
