Parties in Chelsea LyricsWhat are you doing next saturday week?
Would you like to come to a party with me?
Eddie and Theresa are getting engaged
Should be really good, something to look forward to
Parties in Chelsea
The week after that is Sandie's birthday
Having a party Saturday night
You can come too if you want too
Half past nine if you got an invitation
Parties in Chelsea
I've been to all the parties in ChelseaEmbed
