This Angry Silence LyricsHear my father shouting at my mother
In the room next door
He's always threatening to pack his bags
Cause he can't take anymore
And my brother's anorexic
But no one seems to care about the state he's in
And my sister's in the tub, she's a barmaid in a pub
And my mother's full of gin
Can you hear this angry silence?
I spend the days on my own
Writing shitty poetry
Writing poems for the girl I love
But she doesn't love me
And I'm scared to go out at night
It's not safe on the streets
And it's hard to disagree in today's society
You can't trust anyone you meet
Can you hear this angry silence?
Listen, listen, listen... this angry silenceEmbed
