Silly Girl LyricsSilly girl, wasn't you a silly girl?
Silly girl, what have you done now?
Silly girl, wasn't you a silly girl?
Silly girl, what have you done now?
You ran away on a train to Crewe
Such a silly thing to do
Your parents are worried about you
Time you changed your attitude
Silly girl, wasn't you a silly girl?
Silly girl, what have you done now?
Silly girl, wasn't you a silly girl?
Silly girl, what have you done now?
I'm sitting alone in a quiet room
Trying to write a letter to you
It's only me who understands
Girl I'll always hold your hand
Silly girl, wasn't you a silly girl?
Silly girl, what have you done now?
Silly girl, wasn't you a silly girl?
Silly girl, what have you done now?Embed
