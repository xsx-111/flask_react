Geoffrey Ingram LyricsGeoffrey's got a nice new suit, he bought it yesterday
Ten pounds in an Oxfam shop near Hammersmith Broadway
All the kids admire him, Geoffrey is the face
Geoffrey is that kind of guy
Who always gets away with that sort of things
Geoffrey shops at Safeways, it's got everything he wants
He fills up his pockets with baked beans and blancmange
And all the girls at the tills smile at Geoffrey
He's that kind of guy
Who gets away with that sort of thing
Just like Geoffrey Ingram
Just like Geoffrey Ingram
Just like Geoffrey Ingram
Geoffrey always gets home as it starts to rain
Me an Geoff got to a Jam gig, we got there too late
The Marquee was sold out and it was only five past eight
But Geoffrey got us on the guest list please don't ask me how
Geoffrey is that kind of guy
Who always gets away with that sort of things
Geoffrey gets away with that sort of thingsEmbed
