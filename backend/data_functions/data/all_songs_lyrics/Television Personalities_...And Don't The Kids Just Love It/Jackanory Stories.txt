Jackanory Stories LyricsJackanory stories, settle down and we'll begin
Now we're up to page nineteen and it looks like the indians will win
But just like life there's a good beginning but there is no middle
So you may as well skip to the end
It's the same old story
And I've heard that story a thousand times before
Read a book at bedtime to help you off to sleep
I've found I get the same effect from fixing on reality
It's just like life there's a good beginning but there is no middle
So you may as well skip to the end
It's the same old story
And I've heard that story a thousand times before
Sit amongst the bowler hats and make your crossword last
Travel intercity, get nowhere twice as fast
Just like life there's a good beginning but there is no middle
So you may as well skip to the end
It's the same old story
And I've heard that story a thousand times beforeEmbed
