A Family Affair LyricsMrs. Brown is sad
Her husband Jack has just passed away
Mrs. Davies cries
The welfare have taken her children today
Jenny's so upset
She's just received the results of her test
It proved positive
And the father has loved her and left her
But why should I care?
It's just a family affair
I telephoned God today
But all I got was the answering machine
