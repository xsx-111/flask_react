World of Pauline Lewis LyricsIn the afternoon afternoon in the staff canteen
Just another teenage girl with teenage girl dreams
In the world of Pauline Lewis
Everything is fantasy
It's easy to see
Spends the night alone in her cold bedroom
Seven nights a week, seven nights of gloom
In the world of Pauline Lewis
Everything is fantasy
It's easy to see
In the world, in the world of Pauline Lewis
Pauline died alone, they found her slumped on her bed
Took her life because she could no longer pretend
In the mirror Pauline saw a catalogue girl
Wearing make-up by Mary Quant, shoes by Ravel
In the world, in the world of Pauline LewisEmbed
