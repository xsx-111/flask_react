Look Back in Anger LyricsI said some things I shouldn't have said
Should have kept them to myself instead
I was wrong, I admit I was wrong
I'm very sorry when I look back at you
I was wrong, I made you cry
But isn't that what you want to hear?
I look back in anger, I look back at you
I look back in anger at you
I did some things you thought weren't good
Not quite the way you thought I should
I listened to your advice
Did what you said, never thought twice
I'm very sorry when I look back at you
I was wrong, I made you cry
Isn't that what you want to hear?
I look back in anger, I look back at you
I look back in anger at you
All the things you doEmbed
