A Picture of Dorian Gray LyricsWhen I'll buy my mansion I'll invite the world to stay
So everyone can see a picture of Dorian Gray
We'll sit by the river drinking lemon tea
And there's a thousand midget Russians in midget submarines
You can come and stay
You can bring your friends
You can come and stay for a day
And see a picture of Dorian Gray
Take you to my mansion, can see my gallery
Lots of pretty pictures, all of them of me
We'll sit by the river drinking lemon tea
Eat tiny cucumber sandwiches made by Emily
You can come and stay
You can bring your friends
You can come and stay for a day
And see a picture of Dorian GrayEmbed
