I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives LyricsThere's a little man
In a little house
With a little pet dog
And a little pet mouse
I know where he lives
And I visit him
We have Sunday tea
Sausages and beans
I know where he lives
'Cause I know where Syd Barrett lives
He was very famous
Once upon a time
But no one knows
Even if he's alive
But I know where he lives
And I visit him
We have Sunday tea
Sausages and beans
Jelly and ice cream
I know where he lives
'Cause I know where Syd Barrett lives
He was very famous
Once upon a time
Now no one cares
Even if he's alive
But I know where he lives
And I visit him
In a little hut
By the edge of the wood
I know where he lives
'Cause I know where Syd Barrett lives
In a little hut
At the edge of the wood
He's very sadEmbed
