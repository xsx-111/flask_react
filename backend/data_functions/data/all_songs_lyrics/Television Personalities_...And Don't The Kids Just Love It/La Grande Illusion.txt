La Grande Illusion LyricsI know a girl who's very sad, she lives on her own
Looking from an open window, looking up to the sky
The girl's got tears in her eyes, she's looking very sad
When that girl looks sad I feel also bad
I just don't know what to do
The girl's got tears in her eyes
She always falls for his tricks, thinks that she's in love
But she's not in love at all, she doesn't realize
So the girl's got tears in her eyes and she's always looking sad
And why she looks so sad I'm trying to understand
I just don't know what to do
The girl's got tears in her eyes
La grande illusion
I just don't know what to do
The girl's got tears in her eyes
Monday she was so upset
Tuesday she was blue
Wednesday I telephoned her
Thursday, didn't know what to do
(Friday) so I telephoned again
(Saturday) (Sunday) but her mother said she was gone
I just don't know what to do
The girl's got tears in her eyes
