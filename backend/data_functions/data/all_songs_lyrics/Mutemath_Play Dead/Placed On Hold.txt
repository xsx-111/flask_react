Placed On Hold Lyrics
Field of shock
Full of echoes from when the world stopped
Saying what a shame
'Cause our picture's bigger than the one that got framed

Trailing through all the cobwebs
Daring to call it God's will

Early to rise
Your star is beaming tonight
Counting on days yet to go
All placed on hold

Color's gone
From the pathways that we used to walk along
In a crystal rain
We're part of a canvas that the dawn will come to paint

Sunshine is out for the first time
A gold stage for our rehearsed life
Early to rise
Your star is beaming tonight
Counting on days yet to go
All placed on hold

I know, we'll walk a last mile together
And I know, we'll have a home in forever
I know, we'll walk a last mile together
And I know, we'll have a home in forever
I know, we'll walk a last mile together
And I know, we'll have a home in forever
I know, we'll walk a last mile together
And I know, we'll have a home in forever
I know, we'll walk a last mile together
And I know, we'll have a home in foreverEmbed
