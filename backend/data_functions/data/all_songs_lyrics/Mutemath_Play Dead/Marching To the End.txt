Marching To the End Lyrics
Lights widen out
Casting down shadows of doubt
God, give me time
'Cause I'm running low on these hours of mine
Change, it hurts for some
But I'm counting on what's yet to come

Marching to the end, I thought
Then I found a place
A place to start
Marching to the end, or so it seemed
Then I found a place
To build a dream

Marching to the end
We're marching to begin, oh
Marching to the end
We're marching to begin, oh

If it can't change, we'll leave it out
If it won't break, we'll bleed it out
If it can't wait, we'll see it out
We're gonna make believe it out
If it can't change, we'll leave it out
If it won't break, we'll bleed it out
If it can't wait, we'll see it out
We're gonna make believe it out
Marching to the end
We're marching to begin, oh
Marching to the end
We're marching to begin, oh

If it can't change, we'll leave it out
If it won't break we'll bleed it out
If it can't wait, we'll see it out
We're gonna make believe it out
If it can't change, we'll leave it out
If it won't break we'll bleed it out
If it can't wait, we'll see it out
We're gonna make believe it out
If it can't change, we'll leave it out
If it won't break we'll bleed it out
If it can't wait, we'll see it out
We're gonna make believe it out
If it can't change, we'll leave it out
If it won't break we'll bleed it out
If it can't wait, we'll see it out
We're gonna make believe it out1Embed
