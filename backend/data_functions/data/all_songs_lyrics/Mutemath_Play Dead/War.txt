War Lyrics
Break my bones, I'm feeling funny
I'm not sure why
If they call, don't give ‘em money
I made up my mind this time

Aw let it go, I could but I won't
I gotta fight it

The war is in my nature
The war is in my nature
Got a target on my back and always ready to attack
The war is in my nature

Take my time, I'm in no hurry
Walk that thin line
If they call just let ‘em worry
We won't see eye to eye this time

Aw let it go, I could but I won't
I gotta fight it
The war is in my nature
The war is in my nature
Got a target on my back and always ready to attack
The war is in my nature

Happily in danger
Happily afraid
I'm happily a stranger
And happy I could set them straight

Got a target on my back and always ready to attack

Got my laws of survival
With my hand on the Bible
It's my own vicious cycle
And I'm at it again
Oh, I'm at it againEmbed
