Achilles Heel Lyrics
I was born in the vacant
Wasteland of the faithful
You say prayers when you're scared
To be careless and found ungrateful
I was born a defender
Of a hell made for sinners
And never did ever forget
That it's still well equipped for quitters

I've been under impressions
Of a God in the heavens
Who strikes down all the heathens
And fights to protect His children

The Achilles heel
In this world
You gotta hold ground, but you can't stick around forever
You only feel when it hurts
You wanna cheat death, but you can't hold your breath forever

I'm a man on a mission
Working hard for the vision
I preach love all around but I can't get these clowns to listen
I will die as a martyr
A brimstone firestarter
And proud to burn down the town, to drown it in the baptismal water
The Achilles heel
In this world
You gotta hold ground, but you can't stick around forever
You only feel when it hurts
You wanna cheat death, but you can't hold your breath forever

I can't believe it
I can't believe it
I-I-I-I can't believe it

The Achilles heel
In this world
You gotta hold ground, but you can't stick around forever
You only feel when it hurts
You wanna cheat death, but you can't hold your breath forever

My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round
The Achilles heel
In this world
You gotta hold ground, but you can't stick around forever
You only feel when it hurts
You wanna cheat death, but you can't hold your breath forever
The Achilles heel
In this world
Heel
In this world
You only feel when it hurts
Achilles heel
In this world

My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round!
My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round
My head is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round, is spinnin' round!Embed
