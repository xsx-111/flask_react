Break the Fever Lyrics
It wasn't long ago
Imagination could've never crashed
And now I'm wondering
How long reverse psychology can last, last
Another point of view
Constantly shows up uninvited
My head is burning up
From all the voices jammed inside it
Childhood beliefs can hardly breathe
Waiting to see its favorite half
Of every glass

All this time we starved
Just trying to break the fever we caught
This life is so short
And I'm trying to break the fever we caught
Don't mind this war
I'm just trying to break the fever we caught
Surprise us all
And finally break the fever

My sympathies for the obsolete are climbing higher every day
It ain't so funny when you see it's you that's in everyone's way
I've got nothing to prove and no one 'round to care if I did
My head is burning up from all the doubts that overcrowd it
It's all a matter of time before I run out of points to make
Out of points to make
Can't you see all the time it's wasting
They can't believe all the space we're taking

All this time we starved
Just trying to break the fever we caught
This life is so short
And I'm trying to break the fever we caught
Don't mind this war
I'm just trying to break the fever we caught
Surprise us all
And finally break the fever

Those monsters in your head so high, so high
Play dead, don't be afraid tonight, tonight
Those monsters in your head so high, so high
Play dead, don't be afraid tonight, tonight

All this time we starved
Just trying to break the fever we caught
This life is so short
And I'm trying to break the fever we caught
Don't mind this war
I'm just trying to break the fever we caught
Surprise us all
And finally break the fever
Just trying to break the fever
Trying to break the fever
Just trying to break the fever
Trying to break the fever
Don't mind this war
Don't mind, don't mind this war
Don't mind, don't mind, don't mind this war
(Don't, don't, don't)
Trying to break the fever
Trying to break the fever
(Don't mind, don't mind, don't mind this war)
(Trying to break the fever)1Embed
