Nuisance Lyrics
Don't let go of what has held you together
Childish as it might be
Nothing here is better
I don't know why all the answers
Seem to hang around the place you fall
Pay your attention to the writing on the wall

And I won't trouble you
I won't trouble you
I won't trouble you anymore

It's a slippery slope beside that
Need to understand
And I'll count every second
Until we meet again
High above the northern lights we'll walk on
Streets of our eternal home
As for now, don't let the doubts you're feeling
Ruin where you roam

And I won't trouble you
I won't trouble you
I won't trouble you anymore
Eyes for the sun
Stare if they ever find it
Not everyone can be cautious while raising their young
Never try for what you never want

I won't trouble you
I won't trouble you
I won't trouble you anymoreEmbed
