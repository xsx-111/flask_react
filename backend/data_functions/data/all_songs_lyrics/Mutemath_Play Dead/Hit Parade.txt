Hit Parade Lyrics
Here's a final straw to take a stride
In a right direction
I can hardly see the sky
Covering this lonely path
Nothing's built to last
I can almost say that I want you back
But I won't, no I won't, I won't
Sun, come on around

Tie yourself to me
Cavernous jewelry
I'm on your shoulder
Don't leave me sober

Gold coins, I want it
Yellow doubloons, I need it
A silo, I want it
Stuffed animals, I need it
Mama, I'm runnin'
Feeling so electric

Tie yourself to me
Cavernous jewelry
I'm on your shoulder
Don't leave me sober
Tell me something, tell me anything
Is there one thing that could mean everything
Tell me something, tell me anything
Is there one thing that could mean everything
Yeah, Yeah
Find me something, find me anything
Is there one thing that could mean everything
Find me something, find me anything
Is there one thing that could mean everything
Yeah, Yeah

Cannonball, I want it
Into the blue, I need it
Center row, I want it
The way you move, I need it

Tell me something, tell me anything
Is there one thing that could mean everything
Tell me something, tell me anything
Is there one thing that could mean everything
Yeah, Yeah
Tell me something, tell me anything
You're the one thing that could mean everything
Tell me something, tell me anything
You're the one thing that could mean everything
Yeah, Yeah
But I had a good life, I really did
I wore a hat and smoked a pipe
Aw man I was number one on the hit parade1Embed
