Saint Joe on the School Bus LyricsSaint Joe, he said he's never been
Dressed up like a woman
Saint Joe they said your dad is gay
They said your mom she's a whore
They said it 'til you were raw, yeah
They said your mom she's a bore
And they made her beg them for more
Oh, my
Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary says, they have the darkness there in their eyes
Saint Joe, he said he's never been
Made up like a woman
Saint Joe, the time is coming when
When Mary never will return
Aunt Mary never will come back here
Aunt Mary never will return
Oh, Mary please come home
Oh, my
Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary says, they have the darkness there in their eyes
Oh, my
Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary
Aunt Mary says, they have the darkness there
They have the family disease
They have the darkness there in their minds1Embed
