A Cloak of Elvenkind LyricsA cloaking robe of Elvenkind
Hangs in my wardrobe behind
All those things that Mother said
Were proper for a boy
And I know I, I, I
Could not say why, why, why
On this summer evening
Sixteen books on magic spells
Stacked below the cloak of elves
And sixteen books on magic spells
So elegantly bound
And I know I, I, I
Could not say why, why, why
On this summer evening
And I know something
Something about you
And I know something
Something about you
A cloaking robe of Elvenkind
Hangs in my wardrobe behind
All those things that Mother said
Were proper for a boy1Embed
