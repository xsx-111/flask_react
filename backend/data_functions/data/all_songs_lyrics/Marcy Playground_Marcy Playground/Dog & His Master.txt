Dog & His Master LyricsHey little boy
See the Johnny and Jane's
Hey little boy
You see them all go insane
Look and see Spot run
'cause he pissed in their hallway
Run, Spot, run
Run away from it all
And I say you can be anyway that you wanna be
How I'll be, that's up to me
Hey little girl
See them all run around
Hey little girl
You see them all tumble down
Johnny will boss
Jane will buy
Spot will beg
But everyone dies
As I said you can be
Any way that you wanna be
How I'll be, that's up to me
One little, two little, three little idiots
Four little, five little, six little idiots
Seven little, eight little, nine little idiots
All in suit and tie
One little, two little, three little idiots
Four little, five little, six little idiots
Seven little, eight little, nine little idiots
All dressed up to die, and I say
You can be any way that you wanna be
But how I'll be, that's up to meEmbed
