The Vampires of New York LyricsCome see the vampires of New York
Come lose your mind in Central Park
But don't leave your soul behind
Come take in 8th Street after dark
Such peculiar people you'll remark
You might even see a murder
And all the whores on Bleecker Street
They wear the blissful grin
Caused by the drugs they take
To relieve them of their sins
And "Oh, oh, Lord, I think she's dying", I heard somebody say
"I think she's dying" and "oh, oh, Lord, I think she's dying"
Or maybe she's already dead and maybe she's gone to Mars
Maybe we could even write her epitaph in the stars
It'd say "If you go away from here... If you go a million miles...
Come downtown to see them go into the den of the vampires of New York
But please watch your step as you're getting off, kids."Embed
