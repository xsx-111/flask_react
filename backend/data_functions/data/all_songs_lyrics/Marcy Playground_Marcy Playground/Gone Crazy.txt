Gone Crazy LyricsCome back and be
Come back for free
Come back and stay
Child have you gone crazy
Molly it must be fine
It seems so dreamy to be sublime
And Molly has gone to Spain
Has gone with Venus to watch the rain
It seems that's not the place where you belong
It seems that's not the place where you belong
When there's no sun
And there's no moon and there's no stars
Child have you gone crazy
Come back and be
Come back for free
Come back and stay
Child have you gone crazy
Molly it must be fine
It seems so dreamy to be sublime
And Molly the whip-poor-will
She's gone to space where she is there still
When there's sun
And there's moon and there's no stars
Child have you gone crazyEmbed
