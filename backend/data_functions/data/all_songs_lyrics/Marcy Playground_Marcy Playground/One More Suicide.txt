One More Suicide LyricsChristopher O'Malley went out on a bridge
Down in Chehalis
And clutching his bible and a letter from her
Fell into the river
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
"One More Suicide", yeah
His mama stayed by the riverside
Down in Chehalis
And clutching her bible and a letter from him
Fell into crying
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
"One More Suicide", yeah
Pity no one was there
No angels in the air
And the morning paper ran
"One More Suicide", yeah
"One More Suicide", yeah
"One More Suicide", yeahEmbed
