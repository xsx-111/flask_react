Sherry Fraser LyricsOoh I saw stars falling all around her head
Red, gold, and blue
Sherry Fraser where are you?
Cause I saw stars falling all around your head
When we were young
Sherry Fraser, where have you gone?
We're all wondering
When will you come back, and play, some day
Sherry yeah
The mad hatter
He waits for Alice
To come to tea again
He waits forever
For his old lover
And always wonderin'
Will I see stars falling all around your head?
When, you return
Sherry Fraser, what have you learned?
We're all wondering
When will you come back, and play, some day
And please do come back, and play, some day
Please do come back, and play, some day
Sherry yeahEmbed
