Kid Fears Lyrics
Pain from pearls, hey little girl
How much have you grown?
Pain from pearls, hey little girl
Flowers for the ones you've known

Are you on fire
From the years?
What would you give for your
Kid fears?

Secret staircase, running high
You had a hiding place
Secret staircase, running low
But they all know, now you're inside

Are you on fire
From the years?
What would you give for your
Kid fears?
Kid fears

Skipping stones, we know the price now
And any sin will do
How much further, if you can spin?
How much further, if you are smooth?
Are you on fire
Are you on fire
From the years?
From the years?
What would you give for your kid fears?
What would you give

What would replace the rent with the stars above?
Replace the rent with the stars above
Replace the need with love
Replace the need with love
Replace the anger with the tide
Replace the anger with the tide
Replace the ones, the ones, the ones that you love
Ah the ones that you love

Are you on fire
Replace the rent with the stars above
Are you on fire
From all the years?
Replace the need with love
From the years?
What would you give
Replace the anger with the tide
What would you give
For your kid fears?
For the ones that you love
The ones that you love
Hold on now
Are you on fire
Replace the rent with the stars above
Are you on fire
From all the years?
Replace the need with love
From the years?
And what would you give
Replace the anger with the tide
For your kid fears?
What would you give
For the ones that you love
What would you give
The ones that you love
For your kid fears?
What would you give
What would you give for your kid fears?
Your kid fears
Hey kids
Hold on1Embed
