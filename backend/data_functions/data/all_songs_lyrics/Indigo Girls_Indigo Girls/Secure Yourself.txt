Secure Yourself Lyrics
Secure yourself to heaven
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens
You have just begun

In the ink of the night I saw you bleed
Through the thunder I could hear you scream
Solid to the air I breathe
Open-eyed and fast asleep
Falling softly as the rain
No footsteps ringing in your ears
Ragged down worn to the skin
Warrior raging have no fear

Secure yourself to heaven
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens
You have just begun

I'm kneeling down with broken prayers
Hearts and bones from days of youth
Restless with an angel's wing
I dig a grave to bury you
No feet to fall
You need no ground
Allowed to glide right through the sun
Released from circles guarded tight
Now we all are chosen ones
Secure yourself to heaven
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens
You have just begun
Secure yourself to heaven
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens
You have just begun

In the ink of the night I saw you bleed
Through the thunder I could hear you scream
Solid to the air I breathe
Open-eyed and fast asleep
Falling softly as the rain
No footsteps ringing in your ears
Ragged down worn to the skin
Warrior raging have no fear

Secure yourself to heaven
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens
You have just begun
Secure yourself to heaven
In the ink of the night I saw you bleed
Hold on tight the night has come
Through the thunder I could hear you scream
Fasten up your earthly burdens
Solid to the air I breathe
You have just begun
Open-eyed and fast asleep
Secure yourself to heaven
No feet to fall you need no ground
Hold on tight the night has come
Allowed to glide right through the sun
Fasten up your earthly burdens
Released from circles guarded tight
You have just begun
Now we all are chosen ones
Now we all are chosen ones
Secure yourself to heaven
Allowed to glide right through the sun
Hold on tight the night has come
Released from circles guarded tight
Fasten up your earthy burdens
Now we all are chosen ones
Now we all are chosen onesEmbed
