Center Stage LyricsLaughing in a crown of jewels
Numbness from a scepters wound
Toss and turn, i spin and learn
"catch yourself before you burn"
A joker's dance before the king
Jangling beads, and silver rings
Close your eyes and bare the sound
Jumping up - falling down
Falling, falling, falling, falling down
Look yourself in the eye before you drown
Royal rebels discover you
Trust? you turn there is no truth
And circle, circle, why are you scared
Why a smile instead of tears
I'm gulping smoke i fade away
Figures floating down to lay
I meet the joker and the thief
The king and queen but - no relief
"the king is in the counting house
(falling, falling, falling, falling down)
Counting all his money
(look yourself in the eye before you drown)
The queen is in her parlor
(falling, falling, falling, falling down)
Eating bread and honey
(look yourself in the eye before you drown)
I cross myself before i die
And the leaping man, he asks me, "why?"
"well your rhythm is off" i reply
"now you must dance the dance
That you imply!"
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
"the higher the leap," i said
"the harder the ground!"Embed
