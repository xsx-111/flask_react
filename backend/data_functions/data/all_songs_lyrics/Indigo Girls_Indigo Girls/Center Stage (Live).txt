Center Stage (Live) LyricsLaughing on a crown of jewels
Numbness from a scepters wound
Toss and turn, I spin and learn
Catch yourself before you burn
Jokers dance before the king
Janglin' beads and silver rings
Close your eyes and bear the sound
Jumpin' up, fallin' down
Oh, fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' down
Look yourself in the eye before you drown
Royal rebels discover you
You trust, you turn, there is no truth
And circle, circle, why are you scared?
Why a smile instead of tears?
I'm gulping smoke, I fade away
Figures floatin' down to lay
I meet the joker and the thief
King and queen but no relief
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' down
(The king is in the counting house, counting all his money)
Look yourself in the eye before you drown
(The queen is in her parlor, eating bread and honey)
Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' down
(The king is in the counting house, counting all his money)
Look yourself in the eye before you drown
(The queen is in her parlor, eating bread and honey)
I cross myself before I die
And the leapin' man, he asks me, "Why?"
"Well your rhythm is off", I reply
"Now you must dance the dance that you imply"
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
"The higher the leap", I said, "The harder the ground"Embed
