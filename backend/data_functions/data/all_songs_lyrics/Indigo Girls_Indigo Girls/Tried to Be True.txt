Tried to Be True Lyrics
From baby to best with no second test
These little storms destroy you
Here is the fame they promised to give you
Taking the place of my hand now

Well did you try to be true?
What separates me from you now?
What separates me from you?

Did you borrow the soul
The soul that you sell now?
What does your conscience tell you?
Where are the demons of your desires?
Why does my love destroy you?

I said i tried to be true
What separates me from you now?
(What separates me from you now?)
I said I tried, tried to be true
What separates me from you now?
(What separates me from you now?)
What separates me from you?
(What separates me from you now?)
I think it's you now
Tell me where is the fame?
Where is the fortune?
Where is the world that denies you?
Who is to blame
When my heart finally forfeits
To a road that will only misguide you?

Well did we try to be true?
What separates me from you now?
(What separates me from you now?)
Oh did we try, try to be true?
(What separates me from you now?)
(What separates me from you now?)
It separates me from you now
(What separates me from you now)?
It separates me from you
(What separates me from you now?)
It's you
Baby

Yeah I bought my love a hunger
(i tried, tried to be true)
More precious than a stone
(I tried, tried to be true)
(Where is the world that denies you?)
All these fatal flowers
(I tried, tried to be true)
(Where is the world that denies you?)
Did i misguide you?
(Tried to be true)Embed
