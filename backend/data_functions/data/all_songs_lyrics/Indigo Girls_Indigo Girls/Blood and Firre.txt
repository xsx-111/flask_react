Blood and Firre Lyrics
I have spent nights with matches and knives
Leaning over ledges only two flights up
Cutting my heart, burning my soul
Nothing left to hold
Nothing left but blood and fire

You have spent nights thinking of me
Missing my arms but you needed to leave
Leaving my cuts, leaving my burns
Hoping I'd learn

But blood and fire are too much for these restless arms to hold
And my nights of desire, they're calling me back to your fold
And I'm calling you, calling you, from ten thousand miles away
Won't you wet my fire with your love, babe?

I am looking for someone who can take as much as I give, baby
Gonna give back as much as I need you know
And they, they still have the will to live, ah no
'Cause I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love
But I feel forsaken, you know like the things I, I gave away
And blood and fire are too much for these restless arms to hold
And my nights of desire, they're calling me back to your fold
And I'm calling you, calling you, from ten thousand miles away
Won't you wet my fire with your love, babe?
Babe, babe

I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love, you know and
I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love
I am intense, I am in need, I am in pain, I am in love

And blood and fire are too much for these restless arms to hold
And my nights of desire, they're calling me back to your fold
And I'm calling you, calling you, from ten thousand miles away
Won't you wet my fire with your love, babe?
Won't you wet my fire with your love, babe?
Wet my fire with your loveEmbed
