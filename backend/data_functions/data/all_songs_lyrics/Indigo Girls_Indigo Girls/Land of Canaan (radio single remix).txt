Land of Canaan (radio single remix) LyricsYou can go to the East
To find your, your inner hemisphere
You say we're under the same sky
Babe, you're bound to realize
Honey it's not that clear
I'm not your promised land at all, oh no
I'm not your promised one
I'm not the land of Canaan, oh, sweetheart
Waiting for you under the sun
I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now
Wanting your love and you're giving it out
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight (oooh... yeah)
Well, the meaning's changed
For what it's worth, it's just a senseless game, ah
Well I should think of a love
But it's fear every time I hear
Honey your heartbeat strain
It's not the fallen man, honey, ah
It's not the call of time
It's just the London skyline (oh sweetheart)
Telling me you're not mine
I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now
Wanting your love and you're giving it out
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight (oooh... yeah)
My blood is running dry, my skin is
My skin is growing thin (skin is growin' thin) oh yeah
For every time you find yourself
You lose a little bit of me (you lose a little bit)
Honey, from within (you loose a little bit)
It's just a raging cycle (it's just a raging, raging cycle)
Why can't we bring it all to the end of the line (I'd like to bring it to the end of the line)
From inside this existence, oh sweetheart
Time is not on my side
I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now
I'm wanting your love and you're giving it out
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight (oooh... yeah)
I'm not your promised land (I'm lonely tonight)
I'm not your promised one (Honey I'm trying)
I'm not your promised land (to tell you that I'm lonely tonight)
I'm not your promised one
I'm not the land of Canaan (I'm lonely tonight)
I'm not your land of Canaan (I'm lonely tonight)
I'm not the land of Canaan, sweetheart
Waiting for you under the sun
I'm lonely tonight...Embed
