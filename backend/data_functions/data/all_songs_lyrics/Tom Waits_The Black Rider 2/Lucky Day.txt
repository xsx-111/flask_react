Lucky Day LyricsThe prettiest girl in all the world
Lives in a little Spanish town
But I left her for a bonnie lass
And I told her I'd see her around
But that bonnie lass and her heart of glass
Could not hold a candle to bummin' around
So don't cry for me, 'cause I'm going away
And I'll be back some lucky day
So tell the boys back home that I'm doing just fine
I left all my troubles and woe
So sing about me, for I can't come home
I've many, many, many more miles to go
Why, there's Miss Kelsey, she taught dance at our school
And old Johnny O'Toole, I'll still beat you at pool
So don't cry for me for I'm going away
And I'll be back some lucky day
Well, when I was a boy, my daddy sat me on his knee
And he told me, he told me many things
And he said, "Son, there's a lot of things in this world
That you're gonna have no use for
And when you get blue and you've lost all your dreams
There's nothin' like a campfire and a can of beans."
Why, there's Miss Kelsey, she taught dance at our school
And old Johnny O 'Toole, I'll still beat you at pool
So don't cry for me, for I'm goin' away
And I'll be back some lucky day
So don't cry for me, for I'm goin' away
And I'll be back some lucky day2Embed
