Lucky Day (Overture) LyricsLadies and gentlemen!
Harry's Harbour Bizarre is proud to present under the big top tonight, Human Oddities
That's right, you'll see the three-headed baby
You'll see Hitler's brain
See Leah Graff, the German midget who sat in J.P. Morgan's lap
You'll see Priscilla Bajano, the monkey woman
JoJo, the dog-face boy
Jim Milton Malone, the human skeleton
That's right, ladies and gentlemen!
See Grace McDaniels, the mule-faced woman
And she's the homeliest woman in the world
Under the big top tonight, never before seen
And if you have a heart condition, please be warned
Don't forget to visit our snack bar at Charleston Grotto
All sales are final
Void where prohibited by law
You'll see Sealo the seal boy who has flippers for arms
You'll see Johnny Eck, the man born without a body
He walks on his hands, he has his own orchestra, and is an excellent pianist
See Gerd Bessler, the human pincushion
And don't forget it's Ladies' Night here at Harry's Harbour Bizarre
You'll see KoKo, the bird girl
Mortando, the human fountain
Step a little closer, ladies and gentlemen, and don't be shy
Dig deep in your pockets
You'll see Radion, the human torso
Deep from the jungles of Africa
Ladies and gentlemen
Harry's Harbor Bizarre
