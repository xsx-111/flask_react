The Last Rose of Summer LyricsI love the way the tattered clouds
Blow wind across the sky
The summer goes and leaves me
With a tear in my eye
I'm taking out my winter clothes
My garden knows what is wrong
The petals of my favorite rose
In the shadows dark and long
Though every year, it's very clear
I should be used to carrying on
But I can be found in the garden singing this song
When the last rose of summer is gone
The last rose of summer is goneEmbed
