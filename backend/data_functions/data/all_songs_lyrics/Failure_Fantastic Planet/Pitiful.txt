Pitiful Lyrics
Down by the railroad tracks, I will enjoy you
Can't feel a single thing, that won't fade away
We'll laugh like we always do, when we hear the whistle
So high and satisfied, let's sleep for a spell

Pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent

Down at the carpet shop, you wanna cut me
The patterns are laughing out, I know it's not fair
Go ahead roll me up, in your detachment
I'm here to decorate, your fear for awhile

Pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent

You wanna hold on to me
I wanna hold out on you
That's what you'll tell yourself
As I fade away into your isolation
Pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent
You're pitiful, laughable, once again silent
