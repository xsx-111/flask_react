Pillowhead Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three, four!

I sprained my will, lying in bed
Counting the pores across my skin
I'm so ashamed, to love no one
My ego's bent and my pride's undone

I'll spend the night with my pillowhead girl
We never fight or say a word
I'll spend my life with my pillowhead girl
She is my lovely faceless queen

I gave up hope, in finding you
I've got a friend I've grown used to
I'm so ashamed, to love no one
My ego's bent and my pride's undone

I'll spend the night, with my pillowhead girl
We never fight or say a word
I'll spend my life, with my pillowhead girl
She is my lovely faceless queen
I'll spend the night, wasting away2Embed
