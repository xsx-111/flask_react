Daylight LyricsI've got a catacomb with fur covered styrofoam
So come over now and sleep
Time isn't here again, wasted thoughts that could've been
Now we can devise our plan
Daylight
Daylight
Daylight won't find us here
I've got a catacomb with flags that flew fifty years ago
Let sleep overcome your mind
God isn't safe again, molests trees and chopped down men
So we must revise our plan
Daylight
Daylight
Daylight won't find us here
Daylight
Daylight
Daylight won't find us here2Embed
