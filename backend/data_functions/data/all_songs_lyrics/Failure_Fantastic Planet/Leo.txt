Leo Lyrics
Leo woke up in his bed again
Startled by all his familiar friends
Burnt out stubs, confectionary, wrappers, bottles spent and empty
Leo felt a terror in the world

He sighs, it's not so bad
And goes about his day
As if nothing changed

He finds it so hard to explain the way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say why it's so hard to relate to anyone

Leo quickened his step toward his car
He broke into a sprint at twenty yards
As he guessed the dogs had come ripping into his arm for fun
Leo got away in his blue car

He sighs, it's not so bad
And goes about his day
As if nothing changed
He finds it so hard to explain the way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say why it's so hard to relate to you or anyone


He finds it so hard to explain the way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say why it's so hard to relate
He finds it so hard to explain the way he can't communicate
The feeling's there but he can't say why it's so hard to relateEmbed
