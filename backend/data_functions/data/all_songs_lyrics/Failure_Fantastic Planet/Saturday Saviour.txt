Saturday Saviour Lyrics
I'm never gonna say the words that you want
I'm never gonna feel the shame like you do
I'm never gonna stretch my shape to be with you
I only need you for a day

'Cause I only wanna be your Saturday savior
I can be that Saturday savior
I will be your Saturday savior
I can be that impostor in your plan

I'm never gonna make you feel that you're satisfied
I'm never gonna feel your pain like you wish I would
I'm never gonna open up more than this
I just wanna be your

I just wanna be your Saturday savior
I can be that Saturday savior
I will be your Saturday savior
I can be that impostor in your plan
Wake him up please

I'm never gonna break apart quite like you
I'm never gonna long for life the way you do
I'm never gonna push you out
'Cause you're not in, this'll only take a while
'Cause I only wanna be your Saturday savior
I can be that Saturday savior
I will be your Saturday savior
I can be that impostor in your bed
Let him out pleaseEmbed
