Heliotropic Lyrics

Right now we're sick of everything
Tonight we'll bind up our brains again
With eyes pinned I'll fly around on your bed
We'll grow close while our hearts disconnect

Morning is limping into the room
Pleading that we blind ourselves again
Rip out that heliotropic rose
Back off please let the lost get lost

I know my faith has meaning
But I've forgotten why
It's so important to me
I can't remember why

Living a phantasm of the nerves
Girlfriend's chemicals in your head
Good days eventually oxidize
Put them with thoughts that escape your mind's eye
I know my faith has meaning
But I've forgotten why
It's so important to me
I can't remember why
Seems like I'm fucked forever
Seems like at least right now
But I forgot why
I need to feel these things
