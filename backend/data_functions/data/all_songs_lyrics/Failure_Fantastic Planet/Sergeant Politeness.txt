Sergeant Politeness Lyrics
They won't ever find out just where I hid them
One-hundred stones that sparkle in darkness
They caught me downtown changing the bus lines
An easy target midday no disguise

Sergeant Politeness
Searching for weak points
Caress my ego
Trick me so softly

I only took them to find my way out
The self-infixed freeze that comes from boredom
You see I let them, I let them find me
One-hundred stones that mean nothing to me

Sergeant Politeness
Searching for weak points
Caress my ego
Trick me so softly

I'm so innocent sir that I can't reveal a thing
I'm blind and happy sir to be tortured in this way
Sergeant Politeness
Searching for weak points
Caress my ego
Trick me so softly

Sergeant Politeness
I'm so enlightened
Go on molest me
I won't confess now
Sergeant politeness
Sergeant politeness
Sergeant politeness
Caress my egoEmbed
