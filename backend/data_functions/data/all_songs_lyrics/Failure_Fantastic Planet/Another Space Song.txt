Another Space Song LyricsThe solar panel's shining face
Is smiling back on me
Twisting off into the sun
It's okay to be lonely
All my missions float away
I never trained too hard
I'm so caught up in the tree of stars
Falling in my backyard
She'll always be what I can't find
She'll always be where I break down
She'll always hide behind a star
I'll always dream she can't be far
I've got no Houston to whine down to
I've got no protocol
Gravity's so far away
Wrapped on that shrinking ball
I eclipsed my memories
Sleeping inside this pod
Patient time will carry me
On her back without a sigh
And I won't let her down
My soul is celestial-bound
And if I'm never found
She'll always be...
She'll always be what I can't find
She'll always be where I break down
She'll always hide behind a star
I'll always dream she can't be far
She'll always be what I can't find
She'll always be where I break down
She'll always hide behind a star
I'll always dream she can't be far
She'll always be what I can't find
She'll always be where I break down
She'll always hide behind a star
I'll always dream she can't be far
She'll always be what I can't find
She'll always be where I break down
She'll always hide behind a star
I'll always dream she can't be far...4Embed
