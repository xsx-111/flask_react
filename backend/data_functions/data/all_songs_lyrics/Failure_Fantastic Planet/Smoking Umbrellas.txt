Smoking Umbrellas Lyrics
Woke in my warm bed
Just in time for all the brilliant red lights
They were streaming through my half-shuttered window
Christmas lights in time with my stuttered brain waves
The door knob was glowing
All my photographs were rippled and melting
Through the walls I could hear panicked voices
They seemed to say, "go back to bed there's no choices
And nowhere not burned out"

The fireman calls out
We've got another
Smoking umbrella left
In the hallway and
The fireman calls out
We've got another
Smoking umbrella left here

I gave no answer
To all their shouted questions, just lay back choking
Didn't want to stay but my bed was on fire
Instead of screaming I fell back into dreamland
Blinking and sighing
The fireman calls out
We've got another
Smoking umbrella left
In the hallway and
The fireman calls out
We've got another
Smoking umbrella left here

I don't wanna leave
The comfort of my bed
I'd never believed it would happen this way

The fireman calls out
We've got another
Smoking umbrella left
In the hallway and
The fireman calls out
We've got another
Smoking umbrella left hereEmbed
