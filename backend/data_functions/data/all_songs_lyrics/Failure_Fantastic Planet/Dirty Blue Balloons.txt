Dirty Blue Balloons Lyrics
I got high on scrapings from my nails
Now I'm back down
My eyes are growing dark
My burnt spoon has dried beneath the bed
And I'm dreaming of dirty blue balloons

I've waited so long without you
I've waited too long for you

He came in, he didn't speak my language
I paid him with everything I had
And promised next time he opened up his mouth
And then they floated out dirty blue balloons

I've waited so long without you
I've waited too long for you
I've waited so long without you
I've waited too long for you

Nothing helps and no one else
Can make it feel okay
Float me through the day
Nothing helps and no one else
Can make it feel alright
Float me through the night
I can not let 'em go
