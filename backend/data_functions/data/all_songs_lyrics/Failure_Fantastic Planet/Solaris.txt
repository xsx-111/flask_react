Solaris Lyrics
I've been freezing my time
I've been slowing my breath
I've been saving my soul
I want you to freeze too

Are you haunting me again?
Are you thawing out my head?
I want you to get out

I'm on an ocean that has a brain and makes us dream
I'm on a mission to wipe imagination clean
You grow inside me dying time and time again
I'm on a mission to escape from what my life has been

I've been hiding in snow
I've been treading on ghosts

Are you haunting me again?
Are you burning up my head?
I will never solve algebra of need
Any thought just might turn to flesh and drag me back to life

I'm on an ocean that has a brain and makes us dream
I'm on a mission to wipe imagination clean
You grow inside me dying time and time again
I'm on a mission to escape from what my life has been
Without you2Embed
