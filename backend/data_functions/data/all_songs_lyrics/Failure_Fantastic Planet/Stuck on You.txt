Stuck on You Lyrics
I heard you driving in my car
Then in a frozen bar
I claimed I didn't care for you
But your verse got trapped inside my head
Over and over again
You played yourself to death in me

I thought I'd drop you easily
But that was not to be
You burrowed like a summer tick
So you invade my sleep
And confuse my dreams
Turn my nights to sleepless itch

Stuck on you, till' the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you, till' the end of time
You've got me paralyzed

Holding on the telephone
I hear your mid-range moan
You're everywhere inside my room
Even when I'm all alone
I hear your mellow drone
You're everywhere inside of me
Stuck on you, till' the end of time
I'm too tired to fight your rhyme
Stuck on you, till' the end of time

You've got me trapped
I can't escape
Your incessant whine
When you beam it out
All across the sky
No I can't escape
Your insipid rhyme
When you shoot it deep
Straight into my mind2Embed
