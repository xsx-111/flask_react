The Nurse Who Loved Me Lyrics
Say hello
To the rug's topography
It holds quite a lot of interest with your face down on it
Say hello
To the shrinking in your head
You can't see it but you know it's there
So don't neglect it

I'm taking her home with me
All dressed in white
She's got everything I need
Pharmacy keys
She's falling hard for me
I can see it in her eyes
She acts just like a nurse
With all the other guys

Say hello
To all the apples on the ground
They were once in your eyes but you sneezed them out while sleeping
Say hello
To everything you've left behind
It's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it
I'm taking her home with me
All dressed in white
She's got everything I need
Some pills in a little cup
She's falling hard for me
I can see it in her eyes
She acts just like a nurse
With all the other guys


She's got everything I need
Pharmacy keys
She acts just like a nurse
With all the other guys


Say hello
To the rug's topography3Embed
