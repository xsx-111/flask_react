Work Lyrics"Are you working? What kind of work do you do?"
- Uh -
"Boy - boy - boy -
What is it you wanna do when you grow up?"

Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

Now, I'm gon' start collecting props, connecting plots
Networking like a conference ‘cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down, haters wanna take me down
Break me down, CLAP! – all they heard was a sound
Yo, I scoped it out, I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch don't really got no ass, she just poked it out
On the D-low, I'm saying you versus me though?
We can do this shit right here in front of your people
See, time is money, kid and BS walks
And to me it's funny, kid when you meatheads talk
I see feds stalk, they wanna dig up the dirt, son
Is it me they hawk? ‘Cause I be putting in work, son
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

You cornballs get stonewalled, blackballed, I own y'all
The veteran, running my plan, I'm the better man
Crazy raw, doing my job like the mob
Blazing y'all and disappearing in the fog
Or a mist and chicks can't resist what I kick
They be begging for attention or some more of the dillznick
Word up, baby, someone may have to get hurt up, baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a TEC
Keep you hitting the deck, feeling heat in your chest
Banging your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for going where he should not
Viciously, I make history instantly
Those other lame-ass loser-ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doing my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be putting in work
Aiyo, I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work and watch my status escalate

"Fu-fu-fu-fully - qua-qua-qua-qua - qualified pro
In this business of rap"
"Fully-fu-fully qualified pro
In this business of rap"
"Are you working? What kind of work do you do?"
"Boy, what is it you wanna do when you grow up?"20Embed
