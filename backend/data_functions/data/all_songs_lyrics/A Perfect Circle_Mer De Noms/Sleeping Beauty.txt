Sleeping Beauty Lyrics
Delusional
I believe I could cure it all for you, dear
Coax or trick or drive or drag the demons from you
Make it right for you, sleeping beauty
Truly thought I could magically heal you

You're far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
I'm failing miserably to rescue

Sleeping beauty

Drunk on ego
Truly thought I could make it right
If I kissed you one more time
To help you face the nightmare
But you're far too poisoned for me
Such a fool to think that I could wake you from your slumber
That I could actually heal you

Sleeping beauty
Poisoned and hopeless
You're far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
Failing miserably to find a way to comfort you
Far beyond a visible sign of your awakening
And hiding from some poisoned memory

Poisoned and hopeless
