Rose Lyrics
Don't disturb the beast
The temperamental goat
The snail, while he's feeding on the rose
Stay frozen, compromise
What I will, I am

Bend around the wind
Silently blown about
Again I'm treading so soft and lightly
Compromising my will, I am

I am, I will
So no longer will I lay down
Play dead, play your doe

In the headlight
Locked down and terrified
Your deer in the headlights
Shot down and horrified
When push comes to pull comes to shove
Comes to step around this self-destructive dance
That never would've ended 'til I rose
I roared aloud here
I will, I am
I am, I will
So no longer will I lay down
Lay dead, play this
Kneel down, gun-shy martyr, pitiful
I rose, I roared, I will, I am3Embed
