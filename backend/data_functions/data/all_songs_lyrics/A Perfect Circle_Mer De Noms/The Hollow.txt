The Hollow Lyrics
Run desire, run, sexual being
Run him like a blade to and through the heart
No conscience, one motive
To cater to the hollow

Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up again
And temporarily pacify this hungering

So grow, libido, throw
Dominoes of indiscretions down
Falling all around in cycles, in circles
Constantly consuming, conquer and devour

'Cause it's time to bring the fire down
Bridle all this indiscretion
Long enough to edify
And permanently fill this hollow

Screaming feed me, here
Fill me up again
And temporarily pacifying
Feed me, here
Fill me up again
And temporarily pacifying16Embed
