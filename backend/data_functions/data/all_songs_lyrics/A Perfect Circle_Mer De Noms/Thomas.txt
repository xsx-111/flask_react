Thomas Lyrics
Humble and helpless and learning to pray
Praying for visions to show me the way

Show me the way to forgive you
Allow me to let it go
Allow me to be forgiven
Show me the way to let go
Show me the way to forgive you
Allow me to let it go
You'll allow me to be forgiven
And then show me the way to let go

Illuminate me
Illuminate me
And illuminate the way
I'm just praying for you to show me where I'm to begin

Hoping to
Hoping to
Hoping to
Hoping to reconnect to you
Hoping to reconnect to you3Embed
