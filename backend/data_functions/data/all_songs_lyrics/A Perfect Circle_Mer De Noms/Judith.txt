Judith Lyrics
You're such an inspiration for the ways
That I will never, ever choose to be

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your savior has abandoned you

Fuck your God
Your Lord, your Christ, He did this
Took all you had and left you this way
Still you pray, you never stray, you never
Never taste of the fruit
Never thought to question why

It's not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed
He did it all for you
He did it all for you

Oh, so many ways for me to show you
How your dogma has abandoned you
Pray to your Christ, to your God
Never taste of the fruit
Never stray, never break never
Choke on a lie!
Even though He's the one who did this to you
Never thought to question why

Not like you killed someone
It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side
Talk to Jesus Christ as if He knows the reasons why
He did it all for you, oh
He did it all for you, woah
He did it all for you14Embed
