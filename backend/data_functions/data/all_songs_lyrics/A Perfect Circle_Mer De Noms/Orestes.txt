Orestes Lyrics
Metaphor for a missing moment
Pull me in to your perfect circle
One womb, one shame, one resolve
Liberate this will to release us all

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this
Umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you

And from pulling you down with me here
I can almost hear you scream

One more medicated, peaceful moment
Give me one more medicated, peaceful moment
And I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility
I don't wanna feel this overwhelming hostility

Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this umbilical residue
Gotta cut away, clear away
Snip away and sever this umbilical residue
Keeping me from killing you
(Snip away and sever this)
Keeping me from killing you13Embed
