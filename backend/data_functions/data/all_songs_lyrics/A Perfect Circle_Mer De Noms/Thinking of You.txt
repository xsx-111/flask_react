Thinking of You Lyrics
Lying all alone and restless
Unable to lose this image
Sleepless, unable to focus on
Anything but your surrender

Tugging a rhythm to the vision that's in my head
Tugging a beat to the sight of you lying
So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes that
Unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakable sound that I know so well
Spent and sighing with a look in your eyes
Spent and sweating with a look on your face like

Sweet revelation
Sweet surrender
Surrender, surrender, surrender

Tugging a rhythm to the vision that's in my head
Tugging a beat to the sight of you lying
So delighted with a new understanding
Something about a little evil that makes that
Unmistakable noise I was hearing
Unmistakable sound that I know so well
Spent and sighing with a look in your eyes
Spent and sweating with a look on your face like
Sweet revelation
Sweet surrendering
Sweet revelation
Sweet

Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Thinking of you, thinking of you, thinking
Sweet revelation
Sweet surrendering
Sweet revelation2Embed
