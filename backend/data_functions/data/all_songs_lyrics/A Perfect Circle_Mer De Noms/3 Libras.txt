3 Libras Lyrics
Threw you the obvious
And you flew with it on your back
A name in your recollection
Down, among a million same

Difficult not to feel a little bit
Disappointed and passed over
When I look right through
To see you naked, but oblivious
And you don't see me

But I threw you the obvious
Just to see if there's more behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy

Here, I am, expecting just a little bit
Too much from the wounded
But I see, see through it all
See through, see you
'Cause I threw you the obvious
To see what occurs behind
The eyes of a fallen angel
Eyes of a tragedy, oh well

Oh well, apparently nothing
Apparently nothing, at all

You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me
You don't see me
You don't, you don't, you don't see me, at all13Embed
