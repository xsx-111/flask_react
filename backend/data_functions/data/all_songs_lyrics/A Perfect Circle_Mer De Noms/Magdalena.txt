Magdalena Lyrics
Overcome by your
Moving temple
Overcome by this
Holiest of altars

So pure, so rare
To witness such an earthly goddess
That I've lost my self control
Beyond compelled to throw this dollar

Down before your
Holiest of altars

I'd sell my soul and my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss
One taste of you, my Magdalena

I bear witness to this place
This prayer, so long forgotten
So pure, so rare
To witness such an earthly goddess
That I'd sell my soul
My self-esteem a dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss
One taste of you, my black Madonna

I'd sell my soul and my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one taste, one taste
One taste of you, my Magdalena1Embed
