POWERLESS Lyrics
You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end
I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless

And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side, powerless
