A Man of His Appalling Posture LyricsConglomerate inspection
We'll breed that infection
Release it to the world
We'll blame it on the girls
We'll blame it on the boys
Again, again, again, again
Taste the infection
And tolerate rejection
We'll feed it to the world
We'll blame it on the girls
We'll blame it on the boys
Again, again, again
Then you try, and you're faking it
Open up, 'cause you're faking it
Wait for a time, everyone
Can tell you know
Feels like everything's a farce
Take it on your head
When you're faking it
Open up, 'cause you're faking it
Wait for a time, everyone
Can tell you know
Feels like everything's a farce
Take it on your headEmbed
