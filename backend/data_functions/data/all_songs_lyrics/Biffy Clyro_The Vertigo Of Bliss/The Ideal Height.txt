The Ideal Height Lyrics
You've opened the door to reason
Without invitation
Forget what you had, it's vanished
Except for the minions
But we'll scratch away to find the ideal height

How well do you think that you know me?
I'll tell you now, I didn't even mean it
Circumstance predicts I, slim the main

We hope that you don't remember
Instructions of Heaven
'Cus everyone has a purpose
Even the minions
But we'll scratch away to find the ideal height

How well do you think that you know me?
I'll tell you now, I didn't even mean it
Circumstance depicts I, slim the main
How well do you think that you know me?
How well do you think that you know me?
Make the strain go away!
The ideal height, the ideal...
The ideal height
How well do you think that you know me?
I'll tell you now, I didn't even mean it 
Make the strain go away! Embed
