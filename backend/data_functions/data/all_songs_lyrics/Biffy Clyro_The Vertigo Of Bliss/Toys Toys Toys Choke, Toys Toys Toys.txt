Toys Toys Toys Choke, Toys Toys Toys Lyrics
Would you change? I have
Fall in love, with you
Anyway
(We suffer, we suffer, I suffer, we suffer, we suffer now)
Have a dance, I will
Easily, lose it
Anyway
(We're dancing, we're dancing, I'm dancing, we're dancing, we're dancing now)
Love makes some things taste good
Not all just you
I love your style you hate my lies
In time always you suffer

In the shadows of your eyes you look like God
I will be right here
When your life's been shattered, embrace your emotion
I will be right

If even the stars fall from your eyes
Revolve as they burn in the night
Reach with your mind, never goodbye
Take me away from your all
Winter's long dance, lovely construction
It's a part of you now
Watch it implode, your ghostly possession
Will always possess you

In the shadows of her eyes you look like God
I will be right here
When your life's been shattered, embrace your emotion
I will be right

If even the stars fall from your eyes
Revolve as they burn in the night
Reach with your mind, never goodbye
Take me away from your all
Infinity lies, save yourself
Infinity lies, save yourselfEmbed
