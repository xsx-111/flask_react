Questions and Answers Lyrics
Grab a handle
Twist it 'til something drops
You're up when you're winning
Feel like your head's gone soft
Even though we spend our time without a chorus

Little twitches
Giving a special edge
You can't understand it
Transparent and soft in the head
Even though we spend our time now, here's the chorus

You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions

Take advantage of the sound
Lean in to walls leading to minds

You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Still I feel them passing me by)
You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Still I feel them passing me by)
You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Still I feel them passing me by)
You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Still I feel them passing me by)

You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Try to understand)
You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Try to understand)
You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Still I feel them passing me by)
You've got all these great answers, to all these great questions
(Still I feel them passing me by)Embed
