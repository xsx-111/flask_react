Now the Action Is On Fire LyricsI'm cagey about stories involving time
It's like I'm slowly burning, breathing crimes
This is alright
Burn the action now
Tell me how you feel
Burn the action now
Protection, take hold
Clear my filthy grime
This is alright
Burn the action now
Tell me how you feel
Burn the action now
This is alright, alright
When the inner energy pollutes my soul
With selfish need and small conspiracies you make from loyalty
And over and over and over and over and
Take all I have
And under and under and under and under and
Could you make it any easier
So we can set this on fire
This is all I have
And over and over and over and over and
Take all I have
And under and under and under and under and
And over and over and over and over and
Take all I have to decide
In all I have
We'll change the world how we want to
We'll change the world inside you
You changed the world, you changed the world
You changed the world, you changed the world
You changed the world, you changed the world
You changed the world, you changed the world
Burn the action, burn the action, burn the action now
Burn the action, burn the action, burn the action now
You changed the world, you changed the world
You changed the world, you changed the world
You changed the world, you changed the world
You changed the world, you changed the world
Burn the action, burn the action, burn the action now
Burn the action, burn the action, burn the action now
Burn the action, burn the action, burn the action now
Burn the action, burn the action, burn the action nowEmbed
