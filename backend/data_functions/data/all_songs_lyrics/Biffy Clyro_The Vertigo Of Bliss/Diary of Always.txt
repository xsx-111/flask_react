Diary of Always LyricsI just wish we all could betray (repeat through entire song)
I'm the one distinctly plain to you
For a solemn glance is another rightful taste
Did you wish for your pain?
Did you wish for your pain?
Wish I could have faltered
Wish I could have changed
Wish I could have faltered
Wish I could have changed
I'm the one distinctly plain to you
For a solemn glance is another hopeful taste
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Wish I could have faltered
Wish I could have changed
Wish I could have faltered
Wish I could have changedEmbed
