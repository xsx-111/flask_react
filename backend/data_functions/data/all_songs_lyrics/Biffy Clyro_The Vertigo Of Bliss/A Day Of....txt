A Day Of... LyricsI get my drugs from God oh yeah (oh yeah)
You should see the shit he's got oh yeah (oh yeah)
And then it starts the trip of a lifetime
Our spaceship up against yours
A war on drugs would surely bring
I get my drugs from God oh yeah
You should see how high I go oh yeah (oh yeah)
The shrooms kick off the trip of a lifetime
When lovers see more clearly
I'm sure we're on a ride to a day of love and religion
I'm drifting in a blackness of ideas, colours, movements
Kapow, kapow, kapow!
I'm drifting in a vacuum of ideas, colours, movement
Kapow, kapow!Embed
