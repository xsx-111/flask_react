With Aplomb Lyrics
Fix my new memory with a cold, naked stare
Chew up the words, but with floods beware
Fondness can escalate beyond my repair
Chance is the fiction will orchestrate despair

Again, these hands blow dry
But I can handle it again
These words collide
But I can handle

Happiness is coated in a mindless kicking
Let's fall apart, get up high and leave

Again, these hands blow dry
But I can handle it again
These words collide
But I can handle
(Instrumental break)
Kill your bizarre mindset, fuckhead
Soldered to a three-layered concrete brainwave, castration
Kill your bizarre mindset, fuckhead
Soldered to a three-layered concrete brainwave, castration
Walking backwards home with you Embed
