Liberate the Illiterate LyricsDon't be sad, keep smiling
Leave us open to communicate
Oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Lying there on the desk you left a letter
When I touched it, it shivered in my hand
I rub the surface to see your face in the mirror
Translation lost me in a crowded room
Leave exposed the wounded
Look down kids, it starts to decompose
Oh woah-oh-oh-oh
Looking for some meaning or recognition
And your eyes are as blank as my head and heart
I rub the surface to see your trace in the mirror
Translation lost me in a crowded room
If you want to believe everything you say
It keeps you high and in control
What I can't understand is why you'd want to
Give the impression of a young lost soul
In the end you'll lack a stance on important subjects that you've lost
It's like you're out of control
When you turn round, my head cracks
Like it's for the millionth time again
(Liberate the illiterate)
You wanted to jump half a canyon
I'm at least a companion to it all
(Liberate the illiterate)
Liberate the illiterate
Liberate the illiterate
Liberate the illiterate
Liberate the illiterate1Embed
