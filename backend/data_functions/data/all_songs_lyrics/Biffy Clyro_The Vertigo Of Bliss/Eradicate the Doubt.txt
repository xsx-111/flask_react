Eradicate the Doubt LyricsYou are the summer
I'll feel forever
I'll bleed forever
You think you are the greatest
I'll feel forever
I'll bleed forever
Think that the circus is friendly
It's more like a mutual interest in a nosebleed
Think again
Scared of the now
Take all the air
Look out dear, stick up kid
Take all the air
I'll bleed forever
I'll bleed forever
I'll feel forever
I'll feel forever
A-list with an alias
Eradicate the doubt
Eradicate the doubt
Eradicate the doubt
Eradicate the doubt
Tackle heat, its in a cool, cold slipstream
That you will not find
Caught in a high-speed, hateful procedure
Scared of the now
Take all the air
Look out dear, stick up kid
Take all the air
Sometimes, you'll dare
To become forever
And provoke the fear
Inside you, awakened
Take me to your heart
Take me to your heartEmbed
