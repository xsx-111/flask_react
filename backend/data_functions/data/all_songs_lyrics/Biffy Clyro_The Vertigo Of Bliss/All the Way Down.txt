All the Way Down Lyrics
Taking part's what counts
But you were not around
Never understand my goals for you

Looking back, seems that everyone in my life
I will be waiting for you, I will be waiting for you
Until the evidence conveys another side
Never understand my hopes for you

Sleeveless in miniature
Monster overture
Never be complete unless you know

Looking back, seems that everyone in my life
Will be waiting for me, I will be waiting for you
Until the evidence conveys another side

Have you found your way home?
Have you found your way?
Have you found your way home?
Have you found your way?
I feel wondrous, controlling me seems like a good idea
I'll do my best to uphold you, but I know that in the night
Ever wonder if it's forever?
The moment passes, but I feel you now

I feel wondrous and holy and I know it's alright
I'll do my best to uphold you, and I know that in the night
Ever wonder if it's forever?
The moment passes, but I feel you now
All the way down
All the way down

All the way down
All the way down
All the way down
All the way down
So I'll try not to breathe as I hold my head still
The light bends on my face, there'd be tears if I cried
And I'll try not to think what the happy things were
I'll just think of the stuff that just made me shit-scared
And I'll just close my eyes and I'll see everyone
That I'm leaving behind for the dawn of the sun
And I'll try not to feel, yes I'll try not to feel
And I'll try not to feel on the way down
Wahey!Embed
