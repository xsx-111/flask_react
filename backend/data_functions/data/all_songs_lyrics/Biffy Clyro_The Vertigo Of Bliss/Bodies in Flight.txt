Bodies in Flight LyricsYou're free to choose, what we want you
Feel free to do, what we want to
You're free to choose, what we want you
Feel free to do, what we want to
When we collide, the air will rise
Is all that you will need it for, before you go
When the day wears you, create simple lies
When the day wears you, create simple lies
Sleep well my dear
Sleep well my dear
Bodies in flight
Bodies in flight
Bodies in flight
Bodies in flight
You're free to choose, what we want you
Feel free to do, what we want to
You're free to choose, what we want you
Feel free to do, what we want to
Slip into your dreams, and the air will clash
Hovering in a perfect sphere, we'll watch you go
When the day wears you, create simple lies
When the day wears you, create simple lies
Sleep well my dear
Sleep well my dear
Bodies in flight
Little or no movement
When you say love I know that you mean hate for
Borders of spite-ridden love decay
A mansion in an easy disguise of simple lies
Borders of spite-ridden love decay
Bodies in flight!
Bodies in flight!
Bodies in flight!
Bodies in flight!Embed
