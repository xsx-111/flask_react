Marine Boy LyricsWhat they want for their lives
What they want for their lives
I crossed the sea in something
It's very light
What they want for their lives
Did you glide in with great stride?
Taking strength from a smile
Present state of marine life
I crossed the sea in something
Was it nice?
What they want for their lives
What they want for their lives
Did they fall into grand saloon?
What was that smile just about?
I crossed the sea in something
Was it nice?Embed
