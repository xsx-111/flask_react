Fantastic Day LyricsWell there's a great amount of strain
About getting on that train
Every day and every night
The only thing that makes it good
Is seeing my favourite sight
Prance and flutter stride down that green escalator yeah
When I'm getting off my train
And my love is on my brain
Every day and every night
The only thing that makes it right
Is seeing my favourite sight
Crying in the night with the summer in her eyes tonight
Fantastic day today
Fantastic day
Well I can find a funny feeling
Funny as a smile
When your mouth is all dry
Why?
Fantastic day today
Fantastic day
Well it's a fantastic day today
Well it's a fantastic day
I know I've lost myself again
True love has past me by
I tried to shave myself
Be a happier guy
Night and day
I can see it in your eyes
Now the summer never smiles
On a happy honey day
Am I being in the way?
When I'm so in love with you
I can't sit down and I cry in pain
With night and day
Fantastic day today
Fantastic day
Well it's a fantastic day today
Well it's a fantastic day1Embed
