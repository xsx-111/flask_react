Milk Film LyricsWhere is only things that they call love
Being only labeled for one time
Is it that you never fall in love?
Riding through a parish all your life
I'll be the only one
Undoing what you've done
Doubt if you'll come and see
What has become of me
Seeing things that they might fall in love with
When will life become a major film?
Calling once and call again in springtime
Grab some snow and build yourself a mountain
I'll be the only one
Undoing what you've done
Doubt if you'll come and see
What has become of me
Hi
Bye!
Glad that I live am I
Glad that the sky is blue
Glad for the country lanes
Glad for the fall of dew
I can't take the time
Calling once and call again at film milkEmbed
