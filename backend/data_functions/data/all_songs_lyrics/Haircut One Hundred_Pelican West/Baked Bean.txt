Baked Bean LyricsHow about the time
When I'm feeling there
Feathers in science time
Take that bean down
Dig it in to me
Be sensible
Weathers in science time
Be ten only
How about waiting time
See you on my range
Cry big into
Be beneath the rays
Don't bring down
No
Being only ten
Is when life begins to grin
Being only ten
Is when life begins to grin
Being only ten
Is when life begins to ringEmbed
