Surprise Me Again LyricsWell I remember the day when she said go away
I rearrange my hair
Well I can't take anymore
I bought some natural food
And then I fell on the floor
Well I can't take anymore
I need a change of address
By the way, why can't you smile
She said at first it was great
And in the middle I stayed
But at the end I was sick
I said I've got to get out quick
Then you suddenly smiled
You took me by surprise
You suddenly smiled
You took me by again
Well I remember the time
Wrapped up nice and cosy
She was washing my hair
Well I was thinking of midnight, falling in love
Watching the rain fall
When we relax I'm going to sleep on your chest
And listen to your beats
And let's go to Norway, live in rain and snow
And get totally depressed about nothing
At all really hello
Then you suddenly smiled
You took me by surprise
You suddenly smiled
You took me by again
You suddenly smiled
You suddenly smiled, again and again
You can't smile
Then you suddenly smiled
You took me by surprise
You suddenly smiled
You took me by again
You suddenly smiled
You suddenly smiled
You suddenly smiled
You suddenly smiled
You took me by againEmbed
