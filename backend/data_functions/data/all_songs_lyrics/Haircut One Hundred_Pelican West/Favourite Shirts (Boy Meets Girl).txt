Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl) LyricsTime can't afford no time
Can't afford the rhyme
Nevermind, someday maybe
Boy meets girl
And love, love is on it's way
Boy meets girl
Boy meets girl
Bang, feel a little love
Carino dime
Never mind, someday Terry
Feel the pain
Hit, feel, rap, sweat
Why, feel the floor
Sweets for my way
Boy meets girl
Boy meets girl
Why, feel the floor
Sweets for my way
Boy meets girl
Boy meets girl
Feel the rhyme
Take the time
Go fighting to the top
Go number one
Stick a honeybun
Your mind begins to flop
Now take your steam
Recall your dream
Hey Camisas
Your favourite shirt is on the bed
Do a somersault on your head
Boy meets girl
Boy meets girlEmbed
