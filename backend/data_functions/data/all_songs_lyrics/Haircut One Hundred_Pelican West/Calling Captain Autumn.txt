Calling Captain Autumn LyricsGive me a little breath
Quarantine
B.C.G. might never might rain
What is is now, Hoffman style
What a great film
What a great weather style
Calling captain autumn
When will I die
When can I cry
F.B.G. my T.B.E
Give a little dream, quarantine
What a great film
What a great weather style
Calling captain
Calling captain
Calling captain action
Calling captain calling
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
