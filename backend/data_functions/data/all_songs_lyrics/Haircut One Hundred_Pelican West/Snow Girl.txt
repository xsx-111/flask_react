Snow Girl LyricsSnow girl
Snowy girl
Won't you take me down
Because I'm coming down
But is there anything there
Everything there
Everything happy with
My little snow girl
Snowy girl
I pick up the picture of you
You pick up the picture of me
I pick up the picture of you
Won't you take me down
I need to be your clown, yeah
But is there anything wrong
Weather's all gone
Anyone listening to my little snow girl
Snowy girl
Everything pretty
Everything pale
Every little touch of a rose in the mail
Only one girl, she's laying in the snow
Let me have a lean on your little elbow
When we kiss, we kiss with laughter
Snow girl
Snow girl
Snowy girl
I pick up the picture of you
You pick up the picture of me
I pick up the picture of you
You pick up the picture of me
YeahEmbed
