Falling Snow LyricsThe water pours its embracing arms 'round the stone
Decay drips from the unquiet void where the ice forms, where life ends
The stone is, by the crimson blood, swallowed; the red tide, beyond the ebon wound, contorted
My sacrifice bids farewell in this river of memory: a wave to end all time
Oh...
Red birds escape from my wounds, return as falling snow to sweep the landscape
A wind, haunted; wings without bodies
Oh...
The snow -- the bitter snowfall
You long to die in her pale arms, crystalline; to become an ode to silence, in the soul of a mountain of birds, fallen
Oh...
The cascading pallor of ghost-less feather
The snow has fallen, and raised this white mountain on which you will die and fade away, in silenceEmbed
