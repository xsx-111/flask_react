Not Unlike the Waves LyricsAurora swims in the ether
Emerald fire scars the night sky
Solstafir!
Amber streams from Sol
Are not unlike the waves of the sea
Nor the endless horizon of ice
Solstafir!
Aurora swims in the ether
Emerald fire paints the twilight
Heidrun bleeds the golden nectar
For the rising sun and the moon
The midnight wolves who watch over the dawn
The golden dawn
Solstafir!3Embed
