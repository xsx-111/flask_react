Fire Above, Ice Below LyricsThe woeful silence and wind's reflection
Of your body's pale ode, an icy fortress of blood and ages
Sky fire above, ice below the hearth
Fall away from me to that citadel at the end of time
Where death sleeps and dreams of your buried pain
There has never been a silence like this before
There will never be an ode like this againEmbed
