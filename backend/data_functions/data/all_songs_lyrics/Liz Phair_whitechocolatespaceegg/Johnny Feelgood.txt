Johnny Feelgood Lyrics
Johnny feel good, Johnny right on
Johnny miss you, Johnny light on
Johnny makes me
Feel strangely
Good about myself

Moderation is a memory
Dive right in and let him send me
I could take this
In doses
Large enough to kill

And I never met a man
Who was so pretty inside
He's got diamonds on the
Bed of his thumbnails
And I never realized I was
So dirty and dry
Til he knocked me down
Started dragging me around
In the back of his convertible car

And I liked it
Let me tell you I liked it more and more
Crimson and clover
Soon he's taken over all my senses now
And I never met a man
Who was so pretty inside
He's got petals on the
Bed of his sweat sock drawer
Who the fuck am I to criticize him?
Cause I really need him now
In fact I'm kinda freaking out
And I'm wondering where
The hell you all are

Johnny feel good, Johnny right on
Johnny miss you, Johnny light on
Johnny makes me
Feel strangely
Good about myself

And I've never met a man
I was so crazy about
It kinda has become an obsession to me
I hate him all the time
But I still get up
When he knocks me down
And he orders me around
Cause it loosens me up
And I can't get enough
And I'd pay to spend
The night with him some more
And I liked it
Let me tell you
I liked it more and more
I liked it, I liked it, yeah
I really liked it
I liked it
I really, really, really liked it
I really liked it
I can't believe itEmbed
