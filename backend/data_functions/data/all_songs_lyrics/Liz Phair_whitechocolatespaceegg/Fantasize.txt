Fantasize LyricsHe's a friend of mine, kind of special guy
He's a run-around
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
I hear people are talking about us
And I just have to say, I lie awake every night
Thinking about you, I fantasize
All around us people are changing
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
I hear people are talking about us
He's a special guy, kind of sentimental inside
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
I hear people are talking about us
That's okay with me
Get it easily insideEmbed
