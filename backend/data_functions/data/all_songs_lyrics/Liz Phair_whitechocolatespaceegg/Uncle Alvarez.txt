Uncle Alvarez LyricsThere's a portrait of Uncle Alvarez
Hanging in the hall
Nobody wants to look at it
But Uncle Alvarez sees us all
Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even
Shake the hands of presidents
Better send a postcard
And keep the family quiet
He's not really part Cherokee Indian
He didn't fight in the Civil War
He's just Eugene Isaac Alvarez
We feel sorry for the wall
Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even
Shake the hands of presidents
You're gonna make em
Sorry when you die
And it's a long way down
You're hoping for a heart attack
Running around
Investing in this and that
And your beautiful wife
Keeps your life on a shelf for you
Safe in the bedroom where
There's no dust or mildew and
It's hard to believe you were
Once a beautiful dancer...
Better just to shake it off
As you write your resum√©
Don't think of Uncle Alvarez
And the price he had to pay
Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even
Shake the hands of presidents
You're gonna make em
Sorry when you die
Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even
Shake the hands of presidents
Better send some money
