Shitloads of Money LyricsLewis is probably thirty years old, but he looks like a solid forty-five
Lewis says he's got a headache
I look in his eyes, and I believe him
The big L.K.'s and the Gangster Disciples
Lewis can't think of who else could take over
But he just can't get up in the morning
A genuine face, braced for survival
It's nice to be liked, but it's better by far to get paid
I know that most of the friends that I have don't really see it that way
But if you could give 'em each one wish, how much do you wanna bet?
They'd wish success for themselves and their friends and that would include lots of money
Don't know how many times you were stuck in the morning
You just couldn't move, though your mother was calling
You know what you need is a Lotto revival
A train flashes by and you're lost in a spiral
It's nice to be liked, but it's better by far to get paid
I know that most of the friends that I have don't really see it that way
But if you could give 'em each one wish, how much do you wanna bet?
They'd wish success for themselves and their friends and that would include lots of money
Take the train on up to the zoo, and don't look back on what you've been through
Cause everyones got a Monday, it looks like shit and it must be America
It burns so quick, and it must be America
It's nice to be liked, but it's better by far to get paid
I know that most of the friends that I have don't really see it that way
But if you could give 'em each one wish, how much do you wanna bet?
They'd wish success for themselves and their friends and that would include lots of money
That would surly include lots of money
You have got to have shitloads of M-O-N-E-Y, moneyEmbed
