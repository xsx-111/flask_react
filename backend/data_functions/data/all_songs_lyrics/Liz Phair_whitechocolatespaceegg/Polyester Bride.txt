Polyester Bride Lyrics
I was talking, not two days ago
To a certain bartender I'm lucky to know
And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
If I should bother dating unfamous men
And Henry said, "You're lucky to even know me
You're lucky to be alive
You're lucky to be drinking here for free
'Cause I'm a sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes"

And then he said
Do you want to be a polyester bride
Do you want to hang your head and die
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here

And I was sitting, not two days ago
Feeling lonely 'cause I'm just feeling low
And I asked Henry, my bartending friend
Why it is that there are those kind of men
And Henry said, "You're lucky to even know me
You're lucky to be alive
You're lucky to be drinking here for free
'Cause I'm a sucker for your lucky, pretty eyes"
And then he said
Do you want to be a polyester bride
Do you want to hang your head and die
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here
Princess do you really wanna flap your wings and fly

'Cause you've got time
He keeps telling me, you've got time
But I don't believe him, you've got time
I keep on pushing harder
I keep on pushing farther away
But he keeps tellin' me, baby
He says baby, yeah

Do you want to be a polyester bride
Do you want to hang your head and die
Do you want to find alligator cowboy boots they just put on sale
Do you want to flap your wings and fly away from here
Do you want to be a polyester bride (away from here)
Do you want to be a polyester bride (away from here)
Do you want to be a polyester bride
Princess, do you really wanna flap your wings and fly away from hereEmbed
