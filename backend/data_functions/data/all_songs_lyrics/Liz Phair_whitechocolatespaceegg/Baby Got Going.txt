Baby Got Going LyricsBaby got goin' on a southern train
You know
Fired up pistons drivin' below
And the whole vibration
Seat upholstery
Silky underwear
Oh conductor let's roll
Let's roll!
Baby got goin but I can't complain
You know It knocks me out
When she acts so strange
Like a Big Mac truck cut across
Two lanes in my soul
Conductor, let's
Throw the pedal down, roll!
Let's roll!
Baby got goin
When the train kept a rollin
Baby got goin
When the train kept a rollin
Baby got goin
When the train kept a rollin
Baby got goin
When the train kept a rollin
Squeeze her knees underneath a book
You know a real good shakin is all it took
Cause my baby's hooked on me
And as you can see I'm wild about her!
She got goin' but I can't complain
You know it knocks me out
When she acts so strange
Like a Big Mac truck cut across two lanes in my soul
Conductor let's
Throw the pedal down, roll!
Let's roll!
She gets mad when it goes too slow
So I'm beggin you man
Keep a-shovelin' that coal
Let's roll!
Let's roll
Roll
Roll
Roll
Roll
Roll
RollEmbed
