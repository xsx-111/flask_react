Headache LyricsI can see the Russian Army
Rolling through my head
On one side of me lies the enemy
The other half is dead
I've got diamonds and I've got pearls
And I said
"Hey mister, won't you come for me?
You can take me home
But I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl"
That's the whole thing about it
I'm so in love today
I've been waiting at the bus stop
Come my way?
"Hey mister, won't you come for me?
I'm a psychosomatic sister
Running around without a leash
You can take me home
But I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl"
Then the Russian Army na dad da da da
The snow is falling
January's all across my head
I've got seven other men
In the ditches behind me
And I think I'm the last survivor
I said
"Hey mister, won't you come for me?"
I'm a psychosomatic sister
Running around without a leash
You can take me home
But I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl"Embed
