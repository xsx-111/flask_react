Love Is Nothing LyricsYou thought I was something from afar
You thought I'd totally excite you
I guess it's just another thing
To stand up close and ignite you
Love is nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Like they say
You gotta pick up
The little pieces everyday
You were telling me
The friends we have in common
By the time I figured it out
You were yawning
Love is nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Like they say
You gotta get up and work
The people everyday
And I thought, "Who am I?
Who's this guy?
Would I lie
To make the day blur into the night?"
Love is nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Like they say
You gotta pick up
The little pieces everyday
Love is nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Like they say
You gotta get up and work
The people everydayEmbed
