Ride LyricsAs I stumble into bed
I curse the devil in my head
And if I die before I wake
I hope the Lord won't hesitate to
Pluck my coffin from the ground
He need not heed the neighbors now
And throw me up for all to see
The flies of August swarming me
I get a ride
Right by your side
Under your skin
I'm digging in
I don't know, but I've been told
(been told)
The road to heaven is paved with gold
(with gold)
And if I die before I wake
I need a ride
I need a ride
I need a ride from you
I need a ride
(If I lay down to sleep to)
I need a ride
(Pray the lord myself to keep)
I need a ride
(And if I die before I wake)
From you
(I hope the lord won't hesitate)
Sticks and stones can break my bones
(my bones)
And boys can make me kick and moan
(we moan)
But when I want it auto-drive
I get a ride
I get a ride
I get a ride from you
I get a ride
I get a ride
I get a ride from you
Oo now, now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I hope the lord won't hesitate to
Pluck my coffin from the ground
(I ride)
He need not heed the neighbors now
(Right by your side)
And throw me up for all to see
(Under your skin)
The flies of August swarming me
(I'm digging in)
I get a ride
