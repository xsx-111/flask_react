Big Tall Man LyricsI'm a big, tall man
I cut the grass
My left eye hurts
I am waiting and reading parts
I can be a complicated communicator
Yes I'm winning
Spinning
I feel energy bein' pulled off from all sides
And it feels good
Like relieving a headache
Zeus and Athens
Florida driveway
Asphalt and tires
Sand and the beach
Rocker panel
Headlights in the dark
I'm drag racing
Drag
Yes I'm winning
Spinning
I feel energy bein' pulled off from all sides
And it feels good
Like relieving a headache
Yes I'm winning
Spinning
I feel energy bein' pulled off from all sides
And it feels good
Like relieving a headache
Fog and the distance beyond it
Boats and the quiet morning noises
I'm walking the shoreline
A beer and a cigarette
A bug with twitching antennae
A button up short-sleeved shirt
Yes I'm winning
Spinning
I feel energy bein' pulled off from all sides
And it feels good
Like relieving a headache
I'm a big tall man
I cut the grass
My left eye hurts
I can be a complicated communicator
Yes I'm winning
Spinning
I feel energy bein' pulled off from all sides
And it feels good
Like relieving a headache
(repeated several times in background:
Yes, I'm careening down!
Winding the canyons, now!
Yes, I am broadcasting myself!)
Yes I'm winning
Spinning
I feel energy bein' pulled off from all sides
And it feels good
Like relieving a headache
Yes I'm winning
Spinning
I feel energy bein' pulled off from all sides
And it feels good
Like relieving a headache

I'm a big, tall man
I cut the grass
My left eye hurts
I am waiting and reading parts
I can be a complicated communicator
Zeus and Athens
Florida driveway
Asphalt and tires
Sand and the beach, rocker panel
Headlights in the dark..
I am drag racing
Fog and the distance beyond it...
Boats and the quiet morning noises..
I'm walking the shoreline
A beer and a cigarette..
A bug with twitching antennae
A button-up short sleeved shirt..
Yes, I'm careening down!
Winding the canyons, now!
Yes, I am broadcasting myself!Embed
