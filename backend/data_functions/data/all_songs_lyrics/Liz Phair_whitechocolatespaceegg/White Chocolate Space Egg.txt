White Chocolate Space Egg LyricsOrange and blue, green and pink
I see you in everything
Don't need money, don't need wine
I've got better ways to spend my time
I'll see you around
Every hollow has its favorite sound
And my heart is holding on
Purple, yellow, reddish-brown
Once I felt you, I couldn't lay you down
Don't be shy, baby, don't be careful with me
Let it go, let it 'solve me down
I'll see you around
Every hollow has its favorite sound
Every rock and tree and leaf abound with your face
Don't tell me I've been wrong
Don't tell me all the magic's gone
I'll see you around
Every hollow has its favorite sound
I'll see you around
Every corner has its favorite clown
I'll see you around (I'll see you)
I'll see you around (I'll see you)
I'll see you around (I'll see you)
I'll see you around (I'll see you)
I'll see you
I'll see youEmbed
