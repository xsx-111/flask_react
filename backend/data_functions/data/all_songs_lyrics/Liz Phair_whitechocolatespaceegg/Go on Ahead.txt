Go on Ahead LyricsYou go on ahead, Honey
You have a good time there
You make me feel funny
I'm no ordinary lover or a friend
I believe we have things to do
I believe in myself
And I believe in you
I believe when I sleep
You are near to me
When you sleep
I am near to you
You walk out of the room
With your hands so deep
In your pockets
I don't recognize you
You say you're a ghost in our house
And I realize
I do think I see through you
So you go on ahead, Honey
You have a good time there
You make me feel funny
I'm no ordinary lover or a friend
It's a death in our love that has brought us here
It's a birth that has changed our lives
It's a place that I hope we'll be leaving soon
And I fear for the year in his eyes
And it goes round in circles
One night is lovely
The next is brutal
And you and me are in
Way over our heads with this one
It's hard to admit it
So you hold me and I can't feel you
We hurt but we smile
I promise I'll make it back
When the summer has warmed me awhile
You go on ahead, Honey
You have a good time there
You make me feel funny
I'm no ordinary lover or a friend
I believe we have things to do
I believe in myself
And I believe in you
I believe when I sleep
You are near to me
When you sleep
I am near to youEmbed
