What Makes You Happy Lyrics
But don't worry, mom, I met him in a restaurant
And all this time I've been getting to know him
He's got an ex-wife in Pasadena
And sometimes she's a mess to deal with
But mostly we've been living here uninjured

There's a silence and she says
"Listen here young lady, all that matters is what makes you happy, but you leave this house knowing my opinion, won't make you love me if you don't care"

I'm sending you this photograph, I swear this one is gonna last
And all those other bastards were only practice
I feel the sun on my back
I smell the earth in my skin
I see the sky above me like a full recovery

"Listen here young lady, all that matters is what makes you happy, but you leave this house knowing my opinion, won't make you love me if you don't care"
"Listen here young lady, all that matters is what makes you happy, but you leave this house knowing my opinion, won't make a difference if you're not ready"

"Listen here young lady, all that matters is what makes you happy, but you leave this house knowing my opinion, won't make you love me if you don't care"
"Listen here young lady, all that matters is what makes you happy, but you leave this house knowing my opinion, won't make you love me if you don't care"
Make you love me if you don't careEmbed
