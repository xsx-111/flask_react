Ribcage Lyrics
All hail the newborn sin
Reject the boundaries and soak the cancer in
Hope kills the filth you crave
So bleed the truth out and fall into that grave
Uphold the brand new skin
Accept the failure, refuse to rise above
Break through the ribcage
And tear the heart out from everyone that you love

Over and over again
(We'll bury the shame underneath the lies we breathe)
Over and over again
(We'll carry the blame for the hell that we can't leave)

(Show me) the path that leads into your mind
(Release) the thoughts you lock so deep inside
(Show me) I'm the one who knew this pain
(Release) before you fall into this again

Behold the loyal slave
His rotting shell now a tomb where death can play
See how his pride caves in
Alone he fights to stop this dark decay
Feed, feed the lust you need
And fainter grows each plea from skies above
Break through the ribcage
And tear the heart out from everyone that you love
Over and over again
(We'll bury the shame underneath the lies we breathe)
Over and over again
(We'll carry the blame for the hell that we can't leave)

(Show me) the path that leads into your mind
(Release) the thoughts you lock so deep inside
(Show me) I'm the one who knew this pain
(Release) before you fall into this again

Building a life out of all that you hate
We see through the front that you tried to create
The world that you had hoped for was only a fake
And just like the maggots that made you this way
I know

I know
I know

(Show me) the path that leads into your mind
(Release) the thoughts you lock so deep inside
(Show me) I'm the one who knew this pain
(Release) before you fall into this againEmbed
