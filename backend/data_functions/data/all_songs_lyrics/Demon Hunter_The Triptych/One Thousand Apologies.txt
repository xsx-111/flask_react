One Thousand Apologies LyricsThere you stood in disbelief
Trying all you could to see through these lies
And every word that I could breathe
Would you find more inclined to leave
But I tried, I tried
And knowing what I've done to you
With every thought you suffer through
My heart as black as evil can
And everything I could have been
Erased by what I wanted then
I couldn't think a lesser man
All the delicate ways that I deepened our graves
My apology pales
Oh, the pain in your eyes
My regrets have never known such sorrow
Oh, the shame that you hide
Resolutions are the same tomorrow
So now I reap what I have sewn
And any rapture I had shown has bled dry
And I walked the streets alone
Accepting pain I'd never known
As you died, you died
Then I hurt myself to see it too
To feel the knife I put in you
My heart as broken as my ways
I never should have let it pass
This fall was never meant to last
The reason gone and damage stays
All the delicate ways that I deepened our graves
My apology pales
Oh, the pain in your eyes
My regrets have never known such sorrow
Oh, the shame that you hide
Resolutions are the same tomorrow
Oh, the pain in your eyes
My regrets have never known such sorrow
Oh, the shame that you hide
Resolutions are the same tomorrow
"I am sorry
Just what do you think you are doing?
My mind is gone
Goodbye"
Count the cost of your vile means
Solace comes to less
Count the cost of your vile means
Solace comes to less
Count the cost of your vile means
Solace comes to less
Count the cost of your vile means
Solace comes to less
All the delicate ways that I deepened our graves
My apology pales
Oh, the pain in your eyes
My regrets have never known such sorrow
Oh, the shame that you hide
Resolutions are the same tomorrow
Oh, the pain in your eyes (the delicate ways)
My regrets have never known such sorrow (I deepened our graves)
Oh, the shame that you hide (the delicate ways)
Resolutions are the same tomorrow (I deepened our graves)
Deepened our graves1Embed
