Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck Lyrics
Nothing breeds more contempt for this world
Than memories now formed
Every moment a new seed
Is grown to no reason, the trouble unfolds
For the trials of today
I'm no jury, really don't care how you feel
The pleasant notion of miraculous change
Drifts into multiple jeers
Jeers, jeers

You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck

Seconds drip through my hands
Washed of moments unborn
All the spaces between bleed
A tribute to the sacrament never exposed
A message to the forces
I've no pity, don't know how thankful to feel
Expectations of my daily bread
Gives me the hunger to steal
You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck
You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck
You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck
You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck
You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck

Snap your fingers, snap your neck
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
Snap your fingers, snap your neck
Snap your fingers, snap your neck1Embed
