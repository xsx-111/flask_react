The Science of Lies LyricsBow down- before the god of cash
The philosophy of modern man is leaking fast
No foundation for the fram by which you set your mind
Just a legacy for the feeble to find
Desperation breeding faith unto a pitiful lie
"Give us your money and we'll open up your gullible eyes"
No redemption, not a reason, but a symbol of why
This digression of surrender is the science of lies
Believe the sacred blasphemy
They feed
That hollow voice inside your head
Recieve the fleeting fallacy
They breathe
Trace every step from where you were led
Look back and tell yourself what they said
(Now flee)
And now you feel it pulling you down
How can you buy into a faith that hasn't permanent ground?
Give me blood-soacked, sacrificial worth
Not the artificial product of a fraudulent birth
Give me selfless, consecrated reprise
Not a worthless contribution to the science of lies
Believe the sacred blasphemy
They feed
That hollow voice inside your head
Recieve the fleeting fallacy
They breathe
Trace every step from where you were led
Look back and tell yourself what they said
(Now flee)
Feel it pulling down
Believe the sacred blasphemy
They feed
That hollow voice inside your head
Recieve the fleeting fallacy
They breathe
Trace every step from where you were led
Look back and tell yourself what they said
(Now flee)Embed
