Deteriorate Lyrics
Time has had its way with me
My broken, tired hands can't build a thing
The wires that have held me still
Embedded now in flesh, define my will
The idle of my days has won
The empty I have fed has made me numb
Despite what you will find in me
The failures of my past still swell beneath

I need a heart that carries on through the pain
When the walls start collapsing again
Give me a soul that never ceases to follow
Despite the infection within

Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in
Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in

This is where I find my fall
The cares that held me life don't work at all
And every step away from here
Is closer to the plague I hold so dear
I need a heart that carries on through the pain
When the walls start collapsing again
Give me a soul that never ceases to follow
Despite the infection within

Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in
Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in

Awaiting my end
Breathing in the day that finds me new
Redemption begins
Bleeding out the flaws in place of you
Awaiting my end
Breathing in the day that finds me new
Redemption begins
Redemption begins

Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in
Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in
Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in
Our careless feet leaving trails
Never minding the fragile dirt we all land in3Embed
