Relentless Intolerance Lyrics
These eyes they will gaze and reflect
And gauge every thought I reject
No sway of stance in changing times
Just a narrow mind commanding respect
We stand on the words of the wise
And languish every call to despise
We know the hollow wound of their lies

(No reformed edition)
Never losing vision
Now into forever
Only getting better
(Ways of now, spiral down)
(How much more, we allow)

Keeping sight of the vow we made (Never changing)
Holding fast to the hope (Never losing ground)
So when we stand in the line of wrath (Never changing)
The true and righteous will know (Never losing ground)

The foundation that we used to uphold
Now regarded as the madness of old
Every alteration made to the standard of truth
Is a nail in the coffin we hold
We embody everything they despise
Because they see us through degenerate eyes
So when thay cast you down as intolerant filth
Stand firm, never bow to the lies
No reformed edition
Never losing vision
Now into forever
Only getting better
(Ways of now, spiral down)
(How much more, we allow)

Keeping sight of the vow we made (Never changing)
Holding fast to the hope (Never losing ground)
So when we stand in the line of wrath (Never changing)
The true and righteous will know (Never losing ground)

See the scorn inside my eyes
No reformed edition
Never losing vision
Now into forever
Only getting better

Keeping sight of the vow we made
Holding fast to the hope
So when we stand in the line of wrath (Never changing)
The true and righteous will know (Never losing ground)
Keeping sight of the vow we made (Never changing)
Holding fast to the hope (Never losing ground)
So when we stand in the line of wrath (Never changing)
The true and righteous will know (Never losing ground)Embed
