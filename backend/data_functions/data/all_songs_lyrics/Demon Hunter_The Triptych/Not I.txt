Not I LyricsNo!

So now you're suffering the fallacy of what you said
When you uncover the depression from where you've tread
Breathe over the glass you wrote on
Swallow all that you waste your throat on
You wear the mark and wave the banner they made with sin
Revealing every single lie that you've been breeding within
Wash over the skin you've broken
Think over the tone you spoke in

So lost in your affliction
The solemn comfort of your grave
(If you) Close your eyes the light can't take it away
So lost in your addiction
The solemn comfort of your grave
(If you) Close your eyes the light can't take it away

Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you
Not I - I won't surrender what I am
Not I - And even if it was a part of me
Not I - I'll never be that way again
Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you
Not I - I won't surrender what I am
Not I - And even if it was a part of me
Not I - I'll never be that way again
The blind will follow on the path that you created in vain
No guiding light, but just the shadow of the dead will remain
Dig open the pain you're hiding
Give your hand to the faith you're fighting
The void you suffer is a curse forever bleeding inside
Now you embrace the fatal sickness you should despise
Remember the day you lost that
Where is the shame that will bring your soul back

So lost in your affliction
The solemn comfort of your grave
(If you) Close your eyes the light can't take it away
So lost in your addiction
The solemn comfort of your grave
(If you) Close your eyes the light can't take it away

Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you
Not I - I won't surrender what I am
Not I - And even if it was a part of me
Not I - I'll never be that way again
Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you
Not I - I won't surrender what I am
Not I - And even if it was a part of me
Not I - I'll never be that way again
Reach back behind your pride
And pull the thorn from the burning pain in your side
(Sing now seraph, find the calm within your soul)
[Sing me a new song
A broken song of redemption and regret
Sing me a new song
And beg for all the mercy you can get
Sing me a new song
A broken song of redemption and regret
Sing me a new song
And beg for all the mercy you can get]

Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you
Not I - I won't surrender what I am
Not I - And even if it was a part of me
Not I - I'll never be that way again
Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you
Not I - I won't surrender what I am
Not I - And even if it was a part of me
Not I - I'll never be that way again1Embed
