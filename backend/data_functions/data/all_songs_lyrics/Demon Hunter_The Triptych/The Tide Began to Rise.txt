The Tide Began to Rise Lyrics
I don't belong here
I never saw this on the path I walk
The blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floor
It's getting so hard
I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise
I can't remember
The way it was when everything felt right
My mouth held shut and eyes sealed tight with control

So I remember on the inside
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
(Somehow) I won't stop feeding the pain, my heart's just the same as before
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
And somehow...

So now I'm stuck here
Between the guilty and the insincere
The words I've spoke have left me here all alone
I should have known this
I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise
I wish it all gone
I could have burned it when I had that choice
Now I'd die to kill this noise in my head
So I remember on the inside
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
(Somehow) I won't stop feeding the pain, my heart's just the same as before
(I found) A dark infernal place I don't want to face any more
And somehow...

So I remember on the inside, the inside

If this is all the love my spirit can give
There is not a reason more to live
If this is all the love my spirit can give
(Just take it back tonight)
There is not a reason more to live
If this is all the love my spirit can give
(Just take it back tonight)
There is not a reason more to live
If this is all the love my spirit can give
(Just take it back tonight)
There is not a reason more to live
If this is all the love my spirit can give
(Just take it back tonight)
There is not a reason more to live
If this is all the love my spirit can give
(Just take it back tonight)
There is not a reason more to live
If this is all the love my spirit can give
(Just take it back tonight)
There is not a reason more to live
If this is all the love my spirit can give
(Just take it back tonight)
There is not a reason more to liveEmbed
