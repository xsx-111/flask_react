Ticklish Warrior LyricsLoose your arrows
There's a hole in the sky
Bring your axes down
Though you know not why
Screaming forces
There's a hole in the Earth
Bring your horse around
Because they know not what life's worth
Arianna
There's a hole in your head
Roll your eyes around
One last glance before you're dead
Screaming forces
There's a hole in the Earth
Bring your horse around
Because they know not what life's worthEmbed
