The Axis LyricsDon't you know, how much I don't love you?
Don't you know, how much I don't care?
And can't you see, how much I don't need you?
Just like you were never really there
And when I see a lovely body
You're the last thing on my mind
So when we see each other, baby
Won't you please, walk on by?
I don't want to see you
In the morning
I will never lay by your side
And by the time, you hear these words
Your wicked face, will be gone from my mindEmbed
