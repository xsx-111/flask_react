Gelatinous Cube LyricsI see you standing there
With your cannibal's eyes
A meal is coming
It's wandering by
X-machine
A room a cube
Laid before me
Is a murderer's tools
What would you do?
X-machine
A room a cube
Laid before me
Is a murderer's tools
I see you standing there
With your cannibal's eyes
The clock is ticking
It's wandering by
What would you do?Embed
