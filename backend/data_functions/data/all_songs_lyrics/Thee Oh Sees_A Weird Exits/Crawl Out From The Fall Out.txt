How can we cease to be?
The air was fair and plenty to go around
But they will see what they want to see
No sun, no moon, no stars, no sky at all
Soon the fog will cover the world
The sea will be an empty placid lake
The flakes that settle on the ground
Are what's left of people who are
No longer aroundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
