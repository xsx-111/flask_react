Fluorescent Lyrics
You walk in and light up the room

You’ve been living in a looking glass scene
Since you were seventeen
I can’t deny you’ve made your mark
With the helicopters and the occasional oligarch

Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When you’re in this mood there’s no return
Life’s a gamble, throwing the dice
Every scandal has its price
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When you’re in this mood there’s no return
Fluorescent

You walk in
And light up the room
At midnight it’s time for business
But who will bear witness
To your beauty and your fame?
And how well… you’ve played the game?
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game
You’ve played the game, you’ve played the game
You’ve played the game

Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When you’re in this mood there’s no return
Life’s a gamble, throwing the dice
Every scandal has its price
Brighter and brighter and brighter you burn
When you’re in this mood there’s no return
