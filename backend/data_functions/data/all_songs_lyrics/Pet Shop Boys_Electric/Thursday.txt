Thursday Lyrics
Will you love me or leave me?
I'm here, retrieve me
Don't say it's over, over, over
Come on, don't fight it
The time's still right for it
Don't say it's over, over, over
I need some meaning
Expressed with feeling
It's not over, over, over
The way you look at me
Speaks of intimacy
And it's not over, over, over
C'mon! Why not?

Thursday then Friday
It's soon gonna be the weekend
Let's start it tonight, babe
Stay with me for the weekend
It's Thursday night
Let's get it right
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Starting tonight
Let's do it right
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Stay with me for the weekend
It could be now
Could be tomorrow
But it's not over, over, over
I'm lost in a dream
About you and me
And it's not over, over, over
And when I wake
I'll call it fate
That it's not over, over, over
Today, tomorrow
Just speak, I'll follow
And it's not over, over, over
C'mon! Why not?

Thursday then Friday
It's soon gonna be the weekend
Let's start it tonight, babe
Stay with me for the weekend
It's Thursday night
Let's get it right
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Starting tonight
Let's do it right
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I want to know uou're gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Stay with me for the weekend
Take that trip down memory lane
Where you’re never gonna feel the same
Where you’re never gonna take the blame
Change your name, now you out the game
So you head outside, feel the rain
Something in your brain can't break the chain
Same mistake again, fake the pain again
Day to day you prowl, wakey wakey now
Holy cow you’re in doubt
You left and now you feel down
Your heart lies back in that town
So creep back in, don’t make a sound
Or lose your crown again, sleep around again
Tell your friends that you're proud
Or ask yourself what you really want from life
Don’t follow that crowd!

I never tried to make you
Walk into the deep end
And now I find myself
Awake from all the weekend
I never tried to cause
That Sunday morning creep-in
I want to stay
But I must row that boat home
It's Thursday night
Let's get it right
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Starting tonight
Let's do it right
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
I want to know you're gonna stay for the weekend
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Stay with me for the weekend1Embed
