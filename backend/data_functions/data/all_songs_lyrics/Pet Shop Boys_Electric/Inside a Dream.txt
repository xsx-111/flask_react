Inside a Dream Lyrics
Taking a ride inside a dream
Living a world I've never seen
Wishes come true that should have been
Looks familiar, feels obscene

Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream
Inside a dream

"The land of dreams
Is better far
Above the light
Of the morning star"
"The land of dreams
Is better far
Above the light
Of the morning star"
Driving along a song will play
Something I only heard today
A new melody with such delay
The music will never fade away

"The land of dreams
Is better far
Above the light
Of the morning star"
"The land of dreams
Is better far
Above the light
Of the morning star"Embed
