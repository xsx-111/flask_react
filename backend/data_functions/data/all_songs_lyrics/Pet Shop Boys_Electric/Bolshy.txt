Bolshy Lyrics
Raise your voice
Start a feud
Spoilt for choice
I hesitate
To intrude
Oh

Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Where you lead my heart will go

Give me a sign, give me a smile
I'll wait if you say it will be worth my while
There you are, pretending you're lonely
I don't believe you don't know you could own me
Oh

Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Where you lead my heart will go
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Where you lead my heart will go

Oh
Where you lead my heart will go
There you are, pretending you love me
I don't believe you don't know you could love me
There you are, pretending you love me
I don't believe you don't know you could love me

I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love
I don't believe you don't know you could love me
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Where you lead my heart will go
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Where you lead my heart will go
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Bolshy, bolshy, bolshy, oh
Where you lead my heart will go
