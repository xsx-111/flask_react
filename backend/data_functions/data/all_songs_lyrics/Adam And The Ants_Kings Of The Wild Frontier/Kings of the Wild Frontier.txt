Kings of the Wild Frontier LyricsA new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family
A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family
A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family
I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming
I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming
No method in our madness (Yeah)
Just pride about our manner (Yeah)
Antpeople are the warriors (Yeah)
Antmusic is the banner (Yeah)
A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family (Yeah)
A new royal family, a wild nobility
We are the family
No method in our madness (Yeah)
Just pride about our manner (Yeah)
Antpeople are the warriors (Yeah)
Antmusic is the banner (Yeah)
And even when you're healthy
And your colour schemes delight
Down below those dandy clothes
You're just a shade too white
Shade too white
Shade too white
Shade too white
I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming
I feel beneath the white
There is a redskin suffering
From centuries of taming2Embed
