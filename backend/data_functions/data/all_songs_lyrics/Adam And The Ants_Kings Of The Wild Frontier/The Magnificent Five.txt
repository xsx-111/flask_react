The Magnificent Five LyricsLong ago in London town
A man called Ant sat deeply sighing
He was wondering
Which side of the fence he was on
Prick up your ears
Prick up your ears
Prick up your ears
Prick up your ears
Time went by and soon the one was five
Young hombres burning fire
They were in no doubt
Which side of the fence they were on
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He must be learned by heart
He must be learned by heart
He must be learned by heart
He must be learned by heart
They believed in sex and looking good
With their own brand of music
They weren't pandering
So which side of the fence are you on?
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He who writes in blood
Don't want to be read
He must be learned by heart (magnificent five)
He must be learned by heart (magnificent five)
He must be learned by heart (magnificent five)
He must be learned by heart (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)
Prick up your ears (magnificent five)Embed
