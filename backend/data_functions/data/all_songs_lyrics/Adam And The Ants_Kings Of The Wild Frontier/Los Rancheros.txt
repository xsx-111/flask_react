Los Rancheros LyricsOy, oy, oy
A few dollars more
They'll hang me high
But still my spirit
Will survive
There's money over there
But not for long
Soon my worries
Will be gone
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros
And there's a bullet with my name on it
Oy, oy, oy
Time's a-comin'
When a new breed say
Welcome tomorrow
Instead of yesterday
My time's a-comin'
When those despised
Take shelter from the power
Of my Kiowa eyes
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros (Eastwood)
Rancheros (Clint)
Rancheros
And there's a bullet with my name on it
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
