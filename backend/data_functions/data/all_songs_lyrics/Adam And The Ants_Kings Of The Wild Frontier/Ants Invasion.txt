Ants Invasion Lyrics10:35
And I hope I've made the right decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
My heart is beating, I'm alive
But I don't call this living, no, no, no, no, no-no
Rationalize till I'm blue in the face
You cannot lose if you throw the race
I'm still searching for the ants' invasion
10:36
And I hope I've made the right decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
Ninety-eight point four's the bore
With twenty-twenty vision, no, no, no, no, no-no
You want a thrill so you come and see me
A cheap line in fantasy
I'm still searching for the ants' invasion
If I'd the courage I would make my way home
Too many antics in the forbidden zone
10:38
And I think I've made the wrong decision, no, no, no, no, no-no
Another lifeless man
With a strange incision, no, no, no, no, no-no
I hope that insect doesn't see me
He's not renowned for his courtesy
I'm still searching for the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasion
Oh, no, no, the ants' invasionEmbed
