Killer in the Home LyricsI live the life that I've been left
I leave most things unspoken
But deep inside Geronimo
Is tearing me apart
I've seen him in the streets
And I've seen him in the pictures
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Now's the time I must digress
From going through the motions
Take my head out of its sling
Free the warrior
I'll fight him in my dreams
And I'll fight him till he kills me
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Ay yo yo (ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Ay yo yo (ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Ay yo yo
I live the life that I've been left
I leave most things unspoken
But deep inside Geronimo
Is tearing me apart
Seen him in the streets
And I've seen him in the picture
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Oh well, they cut you in half with a gun
They give you a band-aid
Yeah, they gut you in half with a gun
And they give you a band-aid
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Oh well, they cut you in half with a gun
And they give you a band-aid
Yeah, they gut you in half with a gun
And they give you a band-aid
Killer
Killer
Killer
Killer in the home (ay yo yo, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Killer in the home (ay yo yo, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Killer in the home (ay yo yo, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Killer in the home (ay yo yo, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Killer in the home (ay yo yo, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Killer in the home (ay yo yo, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Killer in the home (ay yo yo, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah)
Killer in the home
Killer in the home
Killer is the homeEmbed
