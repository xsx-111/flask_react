Dog Eat Dog LyricsYou may not like the things we do
Only idiots ignore the truth
It's easy to lay down and hide
Where's the warrior without his pride?
We're gonna move real good (Yeah, right)
We're gonna dress so fine (Okay)
It's dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog
Leapfrog the dog and brush me, daddy-o
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It's easy to lay down and hide
Where's the warrior without his pride?
You may not like the things we say
What's the difference, anyway?
We're gonna move real good (Yeah, right)
We're gonna dress so fine (Okay)
It's dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog eat dog
Leapfrog the dog and brush me, daddy-o
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It makes me proud, so proud of you
I see innocence shining through
It makes me proud, so proud of you
I see innocence shining through
It makes me proud, so proud of you
I see innocence shining through
It makes me proud, so proud of you
I see innocence shining through
It makes me proud, so proud of you
I see innocence shining through
It makes me proud, so proud of you
I see innocence shining through...1Embed
