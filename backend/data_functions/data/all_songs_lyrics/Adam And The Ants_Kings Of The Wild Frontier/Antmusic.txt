Antmusic LyricsWell, I'm standing here, looking at you
What do I see? I'm looking straight through
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun
So, unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste
So, try another flavor
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Well, I'm standing here, what do I see?
A big nothing threatening me
It's so sad when you're young
To be told you're having fun
So, unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste
So, try another flavor
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So, unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste
So, try another flavor
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't tread on an ant, he's done nothing to you
There might come a day when he's treading on you
Don't tread on an ant, you'll end up black and blue
You cut off his head, legs come looking for you
So, unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste
So, try another flavor
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So, unplug the jukebox
And do us all a favor
That music's lost it's taste
So, try another flavor
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ant music (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)Embed
