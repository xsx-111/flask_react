Makes Me Wanna Pray Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooh (Oh yeah)
Well, alright
Yeah, yeah, hey

What is this feelin' comin' over me?
I'm taken back in disbelief
Is this really me, ha! in the mirror I see?
Staring back at me, could it be?
A new reflection of a woman complete

All of a sudden I'm so care-free (Well, alright)
Your love is doin' somethin' strange to me (Well, alright)
Got a new flame, ha! haven't been the same
Something in me's changed, rearranged
And I feel that I've been saved

You got me feelin' like you're that somethin' I've been missin'
Everything's heaven cause life with you has been a blessing

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I got it bad in a serious way (Oh yeah)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Your love has brought me to a higher place (Oh yeah)
(Who knew? Who knew?)
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray
Yeah
I've kept some company I shouldn't have (Well, alright)
Made some mistakes, but that's in the past (Well, alright)
I'm confessin' here to you, proof that I am through
I'm coming clean, and I can breathe
And I finally believe, yeah

You got me thinkin' I'll be alright, and you're the reason
Ooh, I can feel it, we're movin' in a new direction

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I got it bad in a serious way (Oh yeah)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Your love has brought me to a higher place (Oh yeah)
(Who knew? Who knew?)
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
And it makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
Said it makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray
Yeah
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Without you by my side
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Without you standing by
Makes me wanna (Pray)
Makes me need to (Pray)
When I'm feeling low and all alone
You're the light in my day, yeah

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I got it bad in a serious way, oh yeah
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Your love has brought me to a higher place, oh yeah
(Who knew? Who knew?)
It'd be you to restore my faith
Everyday, I'm amazed
'Cause it makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
(C'mon) Makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
Makes me wanna get down and pray (Pray, pray)
(Pray, pray)

Woo! Thank you, father!
Wanna lift my hands up and praise
Every time I'm hearing your name
Wanna reach out and rejoice
At the mere sound of your voice, yeah
(Pray, pray)
Hey, hey
(Pray, pray)
Alright
That's it
Makes me wanna...3Embed
