Candyman Lyrics
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar, Candyman
Hey, hey yeah, uh

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really had me workin' up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothin' more dangerous than a boy with charm

He's a one-stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Ooh yeah, yeah-eah

He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (for a big surprise)
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline (oh oh, oh)
He's a one-stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (ooh yeah)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Oh, shoo-bi-doo-dwee-da-bap
Shoo-bap, ba-doo-da-dwee-da-dum-bow, bow-bow
Hey hey yeah!
(Sha-boo-ba-di-ba-doo-ba-di-da-bow)
Yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah, yeah!
(Sha-boo-ba-di-ba-doo-ba-di-da-bow)
Oh yeah, yeah, swee-dam-ba
(Sha-boo-ba-di-ba-doo-ba-di-da-bow)

He's a one-stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (oh!)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman

Oh whoa, yeah, yeah

Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane (oh!)
Good things come for boys who wait
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Candyman, Candyman
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candyman, Candyman

(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one-stop, gotcha hot, makin' all the panties drop
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one-stop, got me hot, making my (uh) pop
(Sweet sugar, Candyman)
He's a one-stop, get it while it's hot, baby, don't stop
(Sweet sugar)

He got those lips like sugar cane (hey!)
Good things come for boys who wait
He's a one-stop shop with a real big (uh)
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (say what?)
A sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (say!)
Sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (woo!)
Sweet-talkin', sugar-coated Candyman (hey!)

Candyman
Candyman
Candyman (hey, oh ooh, oh)
Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Candyman, Candyman
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
(Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine)
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine)
Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
(Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell)
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
(Squared herself away as she let out a yell)9Embed
