Slow Down Baby Lyrics
(Stop, slow down, baby)
(Slow down, baby)
(Slow down, baby)
(Slow down, baby)
(Stop, slow down, baby)
Oh, yeah (Slow down, baby)
Oh (Slow down, baby)
Hey (Slow down, baby)
Ooh, oh (Stop, slow down, baby)

I can tell that you're into me, uh
Baby, it's so plain to see
I can see it in your eyes
You're paralyzed every time I pass you by
You're the kind that gets your way, uh
Every minute, every single day
I can see it all in your face
You're blown away
'Cause I don't want you in my space

You're struttin' 'round here
Like you think that I can't do without you
You got some nerve to think that I would give up everything
Slow down, baby
And don't act crazy
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch (Just can't touch, no)
So slow down, baby (Hey)
I'm not your lady (Lady)
Boy, you're never gonna get it from me
'Cause I'm with someone
Slow it down (Slow down, baby)
Slow it down (Slow down, baby)
Ooh, slow, slow
(Stop, slow down, baby)

After all of the games you play
How's it feel to finally get a taste?
You can dish it out but can you take the bed you've made?
Go lie in it for a change
I'm not fallin' for your stupid lines
I know you've used 'em 'bout a thousand times
You say 'em like they were a nursery rhyme
But I won't buy it
Baby, don't you even try

You're comin' 'round here
Like you think that everything's about you
If you knew anything, you'd realize I wear a ring
Slow down, baby (Slow down)
And don't act crazy (Crazy)
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch (You just can't touch, no)
So slow down, baby (Slow down)
I'm not your lady (Your lady)
Boy, you're never gonna get it from me
'Cause I'm with someone (With someone)
(Stop, slow down, baby)

Do you really wanna waste your time?
Don't you have better things to do with life?
Hey, hey, whoa
Listen, I don't wanna get you down
But I ain't never gonna mess around
So how many ways do I have to say

Slow down, baby (Slow it down, yeah, yeah)
And don't act crazy
'Cause you know you can look all you want
(You know that you can't touch, no)
But you just can't touch
So slow down, baby (Slow down, baby)
I'm not your lady (Not your lady)
Boy, you're never gonna get it from me
'Cause I'm with someone
You better stop, slow down, baby (Stop, slow down, baby)
So slow down, baby (Slow down, baby)
And don't act crazy (And don't act crazy)
'Cause you know you can look all you want
But you just can't touch (You just can't touch, no)
(Stop, slow down, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, hey-ey-ey
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
(Stop, slow down, baby)3Embed
