Still Dirrty Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh

If you see me walkin' down the street
Or in the pages of your magazines
Lookin' just a little differently
Showin' off a softer side of me
They saying I'm looking like a lady
They say that love has gone and changed me
But don't be fooled by everythin' you see
I gotta let the naughty in me free, yeah

There's a woman inside of all of us
Who never quite seems to get enough (Get enough)
Tryin' to play by the rules is rough
'Cause sooner or later, somethin's gonna erupt us, 'cause...

I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (Still got it)
And if you want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me (Yeah)
I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (Oh, yeah)
And if ya want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me
No matter what you're thinkin' of me, still dirrty
And if ya still want it with me, still got it
No matter what you're thinkin' of me, still dirrty
Still got that freak in me

Why is a woman's sexuality
Always under so much scrutiny?
Why can't she do exactly as she please
Without bein' called a million things?
They say I'm not the girl they used to know (Used to know)
'Cause I don't always wear revealing clothes (Oh)
But don't be fooled the moment I get home (I get home)
I'm lettin' loose, givin' a private show (Don't you know?)

There's some women out there who talk and stare
Who never seem to let down their hair
Like to pass judgment, but they're just scared
And don't know what they're missing, so they better beware 'Cause...

I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree
And if ya want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me (Still got it in me)
I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (Ooh, yeah)
And if ya want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me (Oh, yeah)
No matter what you're thinkin' of me, still dirrty
And if ya still want it with me, still got it
No matter what you're thinkin' of me, still dirrty
Still got that freak in me

Don't tell me to behave
'Cause I'll never play that game (No)
Don't tell me what to do
'Cause I'll never be uptight like you
(Never gonna be uptight like you)
Don't look at me that way (No)
'Cause I ain't never gonna change (Hey, yeah)
And if you're talkin' 'bout my life (Ooh)
You're only wasting your own time
If I wanna wear lingerie outside of my clothes
If I wanna be erotic in my own videos
If I wanna be provocative, well, that ain't a sin
Maybe you're not comfortable in your own skin

I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (In me)
And if ya want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me (Yeah, yeah)
I still got the nasty in me
Still got that dirrty degree (In me)
And if ya want some more, sexy
Still got that freak in me
Ooh, yeah
Hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh3Embed
