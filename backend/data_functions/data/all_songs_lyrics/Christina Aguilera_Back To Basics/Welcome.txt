Welcome Lyrics
Woah, oh

Welcome to the greatest show
Greatest show on earth
You've never seen before
Hear the fairytale unfold

What's behind the smoke and glass?
Painted faces, everybody wears a mask
Are you selling them your soul?
Will you be left out in the cold?

Is it all blue skies?
Fun and games until you fall
Then you're left without anyone at all
You're ridin' on a shooting star
With a smile upon your face
But soon the shine fades

And you're left out all alone
Wonderin' "where did they all go?"
Oh
Been jaded, hated
Who'll be around when the limelight's faded?
Been shot down, pushed out
Made to smile when I wanted to frown

Always takin' a bow
Always workin' the crowd
Always breaking new ground
Always playin' the clown
Who'll be stickin' it out?
Who'll be stayin' around
When the lights go down?
