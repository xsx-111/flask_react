Here to Stay Lyrics
Hey, yeah, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, yeah

Well, everybody got an opinion now, don't they?
But it ain't no thing to me
It really don't make any difference now to me
If you don't like what you see
I pay no mind to the negative kind
'Cause that's just no way to be
I don't stop to please someone else's needs
Gonna live my life for me

I'm gonna keep on, Imma do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing (Yeah)
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't goin' no place, no
I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't goin' no place, no
I'm here to stay
Oh, whoa, yeah
I'm here to stay
Oh, yeah
I'm here to stay
I've never been the type to be shy
I know that some would say I'm too headstrong
But Iâ€™d rather be a woman who voices her mind
Whether you think I'm right or wrong
And I know some people wanna criticize
Makes 'em feel better about themselves
So say what you will, time will reveal
In the end that I will be here still

I'm gonna keep on, Imma do my own thing (Yeah)
We all got a song that we're meant to sing (Ah, meant to sing, yeah)
And no matter what people say or might think (Think)
I ain't goin' no place, no
I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing (I'm gonna keep on)
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me (Hatin' on me, babe)
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
'Cause I ain't goin' no place, no
I'm here to stay

Gotta get up, keep my head up
Gonna keep on turnin' it up, never let up
If I keep steppin' it up, Imma prove that
I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not
Gotta get up, keep my head up
Gonna keep on turnin' it up, never let up
If I keep steppin' it up, Imma prove that
I ain't never gonna be stopped, like it or not
Whoa, whoa, whoa
No matter the pressures that face me
I believe, I believe they will see
I'll never let anyone break me
All your doubt can do now is strengthen me
And life, it ain't always that easy
Gotta fight to see past the boundaries
Crossin' the lines, I will define every time that forever is mine

I'm gonna keep on, Imma do my own thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing (Yeah)
And no matter what people say or might think
(No matter what they)
I ain't goin' no place, no
I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me (They're hatin' on me)
I'll still be the same girl I used to be
(I'm still the same girl I used to be, and I ain't goin' no place)
'Cause I ain't goin' no place, no
I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing
We all got a song that we're meant to sing (So sing your song)
And no matter what people say or might think
I ain't goin' no place, no (I ain't goin' no place, yeah)
I'm here to stay
Gonna keep on doing my thing (Keep on doing my thing)
'Cause whether they love or they hatin' on me (Love or hate on me)
I'll still be the same girl I used to be (Same girl I used to be)
I ain't goin' no place, no
I'm here to stay, yeah1Embed
