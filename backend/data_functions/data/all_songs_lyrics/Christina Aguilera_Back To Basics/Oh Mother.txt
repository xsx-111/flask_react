Oh Mother Lyrics
Oh-oh, yeah

She was so young with such innocent eyes
She always dreamt of a fairytale life
And all the things that your money can't buy
She thought that he was a wonderful guy
Then suddenly, things seemed to change
It was the moment she took on his name
He took his anger out on her face
She kept all of her pain locked away

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed
Oh mother, don't look back
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you (Thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (Still do)
You got me, I got you
Together, we always pull through
We always pull through
We always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother
It was the day that he turned on the kids
That she knew she just had to leave him
So many voices inside of her head
Sayin' over and over and over
"You deserve much more than this"
She was so sick of believing the lies, and tryin' to hide
Covering the cuts and bruises (Cuts and bruises)
So tired of defending her life, she could have died
Fighting for the lives of her children

Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (All of the tears you have shed)
Oh mother, don't look back (Yeah)
'Cause he'll never hurt us again (He'll never hurt us again)
So mother, I thank you (Thank you)
For all that you've done and still do (Still do)
You got me, I got you ('Cause you got me and I got you)
Together, we always pull through
Oh mother, oh mother, oh mother (Yeah, yeah)

All of your life you have spent
Burying hurt and regret
But mama, he'll never touch us again
For every time he tried to break you down
Just remember who's still around
It's over, and we're stronger
And we'll never have to go back again
Oh mother, we're stronger
From all of the tears you have shed (Whoa)
Oh mother, don't look back again
'Cause he'll never hurt us again
So mother, I thank you (Thank you for all that you've done)
For all that you've done and still do
You got me, I got you
Together, we always pull through
Always pull through, yeah
We always pull through
Yeah

I love you, mom1Embed
