Nasty Naughty Boy Lyrics
Come here, big boy
Ah, mmmhmm, yeah

You've been a bad, bad boy
I'm gonna take my time, so enjoy
There's no need to feel no shame
Relax and sip upon my champagne
'Cause I wanna give you a little taste
Of the sugar below my waist, you nasty boy

I'll give you some ooh-la-la
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
I got you breakin' into a sweat
Got you hot, bothered, and wet
You nasty boy
(Nasty naughty boy)

Oh, baby for all it's worth
I swear I'll be the first to blow your mind
Now if you're ready, come and get me
I'll give you that hot, sweet, sexy lovin' (lovin')
Hush now, don't say a word
I'm gonna give you what you deserve
Now you better give me a little taste
Put your icing on my cake
You nasty boy
(Boy)

Oh no, ooh there I go again
I need a spankin', 'cause I've been bad
So let my body do the talkin'
I'll slip you that hot, sweet, sexy lovin' (lovin')

Ooh ha!
Come on daddy!
Oh oh, oh oh oh yeah
Oh yeah oh, come on, sugar
I got you breakin' into a sweat
Got you hot, bothered, and wet
You nasty boy
Nasty naughty boy
Naughty boy

Oh, baby for all it's worth
I swear I'll be the first to blow your mind
Now that you're ready, give it to me
Just give me that hot, sweet, sexy lovin'
Now give me a little spankin'
Ohh, ohh, is that all you've got?
Come on now, don't play with me
Oh, give me that hot, sweet, nasty
Boy, don't you make me wait
You better give me a little taste
Put your icing on my cake
You nasty boy (oh)
