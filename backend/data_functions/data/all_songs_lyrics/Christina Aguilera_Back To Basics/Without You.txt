Without You Lyrics
Oh, oh

Have I been blind?
For the first time in my life, I feel I've opened up my eyes
Since you've arrived like an angel from the sky
I'm on a spiritual high

So don't you ever go away
I could never face
Losing you would kill my faith
In a higher place

What kind of world would it be without you?
I couldn't breathe without you here
What kind of world would I see without you?
I can't dream without you here

Yeah, oh, yeah

Beautiful boy
How on earth did I do something worth deserving you?
My better half
How I cherish through and through every part of you
I do
Loving you's made me whole
Now I belong
I found my heart
(Promise me) Promise me we'll always stay
The way we are today

What kind of world would it be without you?
I couldn't breathe without you here
What kind of world would I see without you?
I can't dream without you here

Hey, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah

I can't ever imagine
If this never would happened (Happened, happened)
I thank God everyday
Almost lost you forever
But I always remember (Remember, remember)
Said you're my saving grace

What kind of world (What kind of world) would it be without you?
I couldn't breathe without you here
What kind of world (What kind of world) would I see without you?
(Ooh, see without you)
I can't dream without you here (Dream without you here)1Embed
