F.U.S.S. (Interlude) Lyrics
You know who you are
This is for you

I thought I knew who you were
I see now you were a lesson to learn
And all I am to you now is a bridge that's been burned
Now I was the first to believe
I made you part of my musical dream
And your thanks to me, came without an apology, yeah

We wrote Loving Me 4 Me, don't Walk Away
Can't Hold Us Down, all part of our history
Don't forget Infatuation, I'm a Fighter
Feeling Underappreciated
Yeah, this song is for you
To remind you that I moved on
Sang my songs
I've got no regrets

Hope it all was worth it, uh
Looks like I didn't need you
Still got the album out1Embed
