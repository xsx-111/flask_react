Applaud Lyrics
Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh, uh
Uh huh

I'll kill, shoot nice for my baby
I'll take a life for you, lady
She's telling me something so crazy
Rock and roll, baby

Just need you to hold me, girl
Just need you to love me, girl
Just need you to hold me, girl
Just need you to love me, girl

Mon rocher, ma roche
Je me suis décroché
Effondré, fragmenté, la surface de ta peau doucement disparaît
En physique, le dactylo-prédateur apparaît
C'est dans les pays hostiles que je pars te retrouver
La machine à graver, oh ma roche, mon dactylo-café
Tu graves ma vie, et maintenant tu l'as gravi sans s'aggraver
À mes deux extrémités, confessions autodafés
Perdu dans un ranch français, une communion 
Déguisés
I'm just too rock and roll, baby
Come and be my rock and roll lady
Top-shelf, driving me crazy
Like a Mercedes
Just need you to
I'm just too rock and roll, baby
Come and be my rock and roll lady
Top-shelf, driving me crazy
Like a Mercedes

Just need you fuck me, so crazy, boo
I just need you to spit on me the way you do
I just need you to love me the way I do
I just need you fuck me, so crazy, boo

When your life seems chaotic, when you feel like you don't like what's next, and you feel like your back is against the wall, when you feel like you don't have nobody to turn to, when you feel alone, discouraged, down, when stuff just isn't adding up and you have to subtract yourself, when you don't know where to turn just close your eyes wherever you're at and say "Lord, I don't know what to do but my eyes are on you."1Embed
