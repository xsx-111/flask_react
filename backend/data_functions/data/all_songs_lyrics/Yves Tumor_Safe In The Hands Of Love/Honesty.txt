Honesty Lyrics
I just met you
But I can't live without you, no
Why can I never
Ignore this feeling now?
I wanna wrap around you
But I can't be seen around you
Is this you or your persona?
Is this you or your persona?

Honesty, honesty, honesty, honesty
Honesty, honesty, honesty, honesty
Honesty, honesty, honesty, honesty
Honesty, honesty, honesty, honesty

I just met you
But I can't live without you, no
Why can I never
Ignore this feeling now?
I wanna wrap around you
But I can't be seen around you
Is this you or your persona?

Honesty, honesty, honestyEmbed
