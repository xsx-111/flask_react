Economy of Freedom LyricsWe need some time next to him
Need some time
Won't you cry next to me?
Through the fire
Weak and condescending
Need some truth
Won't you cry next to me?
Need some understanding
Need some time
Won't you lie next to me?
Through the fire
Weak and condescending
Need some truth
Won't you cry next to me?
We need some time next to him
Need some time
Won't you lie next to me?
Through the fire
Weak and condescending
Need some truth
Won't you cry next to me?1Embed
