All the Love We Have Now LyricsI'm so thankful
For the love
Should have last us
A whole life
A whole lifetime
It wasn't something
We ever had available
Our cards were laid out
I'm so thankful
For the love
I'm so thankful
For the love
I'm so thankful
Our cards were laid out
I'm so thankful
I'm saved now
Let's just focus on the love we have now
All the love that we have now
I'm so thankful
I'm saved now
I'm so thankful1Embed
