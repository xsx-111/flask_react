Noid Lyrics
Sister, mother, brother, father
Have you, have you looked outside?
I'm scared for my life
They don't trust us
I'm not part of the killing spree
A symptom, born loser, statistic

Sister, mother, brother, father
Have you, have you looked outside?
I'm scared for my life
They don't trust us
I'm not part of the killing spree
A symptom, born loser, statistic

They call it a sickness
PTSD, depression
Safe in the hands of love
That's where I feel the pressure of
911, 911, 911
Can't trust 'em

They call it a sickness
PTSD, depression
Safe in the hands of love
That's where I feel the pressure from
911, 911, 911
Can't trust 'em
911, 911, 911
911, 911, 911
I can't trust 'em

Sister, mother, brother, father
Have you, have you looked outside?
I'm scared for my life
They don't trust us
I'm not part of the killing spree
A symptom, born loser, statistic

Sister, mother, brother, father
Have you, have you looked outside?
I'm scared for my life
They don't trust us
I'm not part of the killing spree
A symptom, born loser, statistic

They call it a sickness
PTSD, depression
Safe in the hands of love
That's where I feel the pressure from
911, 911, 911
Can't trust 'em
911, 9114Embed
