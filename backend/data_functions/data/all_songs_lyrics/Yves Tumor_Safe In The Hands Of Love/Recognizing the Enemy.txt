Recognizing the Enemy Lyrics
You looked so different
You looked like somebody else
It hurt so much
Knowing that I couldn't help
Removed a part of me
Inside my own living hell
I look so different
I look so different

Inside my own living hell
Inside my own living hell
It means so much to me
When I can't recognize myself
Inside my own living hell
I can't recognize myself
I can't recognize myself
When I can't recognize myself

You looked so different
You looked like somebody else
It hurt so much
Knowing that I couldn't help
Removed a part of me
Inside my own living hell
I look so different
I look so different
Inside my own living hell
It means so much to me
When I can't recognize myself
When I can't recognize myself
Inside my own living hell
It means so much to me
When I can't recognize myself
When I can't recognize myself
When I can't recognize myself1Embed
