Lifetime Lyrics
She said, she said you don't have to relate, ooh
Got a love around you, baby, that I haven't seen in days

Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture

Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture

And I miss my brothers
Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
And I miss my brothers

Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
And I miss my brothers
Gloria can't hold me back from her
I swear it's torture
I miss the days out in Biscayne
I miss my brothers
Give me three more weeks to sort this out
I swear I'll prosper
Out in Biscayne, man, I miss my brothers

Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture

Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
I miss the good old days back in Biscayne
Man, I miss my brothers

Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
Gloria can't hold me back from her
I swear it's torture
And I miss my brothers
I miss the days out in Biscayne
I miss my brothers
Scorpio can't hold me back
I cannot breathe, I swear
It's torture
Give me three more weeks to sort this out
I swear I'll prosper
Out in Biscayne, man, I miss my brothers

And I miss my brothers
She said, she said you don't have to relate, ooh
And I miss my brothers
Got a love around you, baby, that I haven't seen in days2Embed
