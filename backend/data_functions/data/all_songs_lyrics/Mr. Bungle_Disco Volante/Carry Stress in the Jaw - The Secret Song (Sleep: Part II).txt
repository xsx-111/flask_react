Carry Stress in the Jaw / The Secret Song (Sleep: Part II) Lyrics
Powder grinding
Mouthful

Pull the day
From the nocturn

Somniloquist is the
Nightmare's song
"In the multiplied objects of the external world
I had no thoughts, but for the teeth...
And of Bernice I more seriously believed
That all her teeth were thoughts...
The white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth...
Meditations were never pleasurable...
The phantasma of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendency..."

Lock into bitten dreams

Perfectionist break like
A child's mouth

Quiet, don't tell anybody
Don't let 'em know
This is secret!

Ooh

I know the secret song now
They wouldn't tell me
But somehow I found out
Yeah

Wah wah wah!
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah!

Goddammit, I'm pissed off
I didn't get to play on it at all, no way!
Wah wah wah!

Wah wah wah wah!
They kicked me out of the band!
Ah!Embed
