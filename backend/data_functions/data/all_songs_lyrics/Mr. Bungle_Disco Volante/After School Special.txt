After School Special Lyrics(One, two, three, four
One, two, three)
My mom is better than
Your mom and your dad too
She knows nutrition well
That's why I'm trim and lean
Because she cooks, she cleans
She lies, she says
I'm handsome
Once dad hit me so hard
Mom felt it on her cheek
Because she cooks, she cleans
She lies, she says
I am handsome (that's right)
My mom is better than
Your mom and your dad too
She's there when she needs to be there
That's why I'm here today
Because she cooks, she cleans
She lies, she says
You fuckin' lied to meEmbed
