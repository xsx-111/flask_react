Merry Go Bye Bye LyricsThey're shining searchlights in the sky
Cause there's a new god in the sign
It said their map is not their terrier work
And then I broke my telescope
But that's the nature of the game and you have to play
Bring back the pain of a god that's never blue
You're in control of the whole damn universe
Bring back the fame and the bright lights on a few
It keeps me coming back to you
The deaths were faked, the laughs were cries
But resurrections are doing fine
You got me walking into suicide
And I'll be there right by your side
A reproduction of your merry go BYE-BYE!
“Here to paradise they go
Brighter made is their woe”
AS ABOVE, SO BELOW...
We reached for an outside point of view
But it's out of touch with me and you
I feel I'm walking into suicide
And you'll be right there by my side
To beam my message into space as I die
Bring back the shame of the many for the few
Get on your knees cause I'll be coming back to you
Bring back the pain of an inverse world for two
It keeps me coming back to you!Embed
