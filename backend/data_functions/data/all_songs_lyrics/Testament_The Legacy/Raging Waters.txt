Raging Waters Lyrics
Our ship sailed on through the violent, burning sea
Not knowing of the danger waiting in store for me
We wound up all in mayhem, the vessel tossed and turned
The compass that had led us, we watched it slowly burn
We'll never see our homeland, we knew it all right then
That fate was on the second hand of borrowed time again
For the evil pathed our way
The men were being thrown, from left and right they fell
The water was as hot as Satan's forge from Hell
The questions that arose like: "Where the hell are we?"
I had a good idea: we're in the Devil's Sea
The Triangle! The Devil's Triangle!

See what's become of your life left to live
No hope from this land of trust
Hell's winds scream sacrilege, death from above
The great white closes in
The corpses afloat all shattered in rage
No hope for our peace of mind
Satan's vessels come closer and closer
He holds the sea's fate in his hand

Violence, terror, raging waters
Dying has scared us, nowhere to go now
Darkness prevails, no one to save us
Every one man for himself

The red gem of Hades is shining too hot
Satan's power becomes strong
His armies have killed so many before
A sacrifice must be done
The door of the chosen has opened for us
What sanctuary will we see?
See him panic, crying in lust
Screaming: "He'll get me!"

Violence, terror, raging waters
Dying has scared us, nowhere to go now
Darkness prevails, no one to save us
Every one man for himself

Our ship sailed on through the violent, burning sea
Not knowing of the danger waiting in store for me
We wound up all in mayhem, the vessel tossed and turned
The compass that had led us, we watched it slowly burn
We'll never see our homeland, we knew it all right then
That fate was on the second hand of borrowed time again
For the evil pathed our way

Every one man for himselfEmbed
