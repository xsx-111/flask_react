C.O.T.L.O.D. LyricsCome on and fight!
Witches grow restless, the priests are impatient
My legions scream, "The doors must be open!
Our Master repels a message of hope
On through the gates we march
The sentinels await with their sabers in grasp
A vast group, a locust attack!
A vast group, a locust attack!
Attacking with force as we show no remorse
Obstructing our victims fate
The blood in the chalice saluting the fight
All virgins must die on this night
Psychotic reaction from a serpents kiss
Is taking the life from your soul
And leading a train of destruction from Hell
Finding our way through Hell's Hole!
Curse of the Legions of Death!
Curse of the Legions of Death!
Curse of the Legions of Death!
Curse of the Legions of Death!
Provoke the Dead!
Curse of the Legions of Death!
Provoke the Dead!
Curse of the Legions of Death!
Curse of the Legions of Death!1Embed
