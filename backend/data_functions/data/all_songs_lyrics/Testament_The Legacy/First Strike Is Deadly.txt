First Strike Is Deadly Lyrics
Prisoners of the venom master
Guilty for what you've been charged
Sit in cells condemned to face
The deadly snap of their jaws
Terror stricken you lie and wait
In the final hour
Knowing of your wretched fate
And the serpent power!

First strike is deadly

The evil path that you must take
Is filled with the slither of snakes
Their hiding and waiting for the time to lunge
For your flesh and your fate
No one escapes or comes out alive
For the snakes they'll never lose
For if they hit you just one time
You have just faced your doom

First strike is deadly
Deadly strike bred to kill
The venom's howling in your veins
Psychotic spell a gift from hell
The sound of a deadly lead remainsEmbed
