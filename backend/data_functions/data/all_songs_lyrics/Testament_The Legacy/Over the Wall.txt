Over the Wall Lyrics
I've been a prisoner
Trapped in by fear
Ordered for the rest of my life
Condemned in a jail cell
Ain't seen life in years
Escape is the only way out

Restart my life
Or self destruction
To climb this wall
Of dark construction
Holding the quest for freedom
That beckons me

My sanity is all but gone
My patience is growing very weak
I need to get a hold of myself
I stare at the wall
For the right time to come
Escape must occur on this night

Restart my life
Or self destruction
To climb this wall
Of dark construction
Holding the quest for freedom
That beckons me
Stand in my way
And I'll run you straight through
There's no one to stop me now
For I'm on the loose
And I'm ready to start
Torture and hell on this town

Over the wall

The search will not stop
And the hounds will not rest
Till I am back in my cell
For if I am caught, I will try it again
Over the wall I will go, I will go

Restart my life
Or self destruction
To climb this wall
Of dark construction
Holding the quest for freedom
That beckons me
Over the wallEmbed
