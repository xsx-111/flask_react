Alone in the Dark LyricsWhen I was but very young
Sorcerers came to claim my mind
Leaving death and hatred to unmask
The master of the game had won
And let his final sin be known
Killing those who stand in his path
Alone in the dark
Where the demons are torturing me
The dark passages of revenge
Is all that I see
Armies of witches
Are called in from the north
Murders of elders occur
The high priest of evil
Has lowered his iron fist
Thousands of people will die
The slaughter of the innocent
The house that burns
That lights the sky
My nightmare has begun to unfold
The hissing of the cobra's tongue
Sound and feel of ripping flesh
Fall two thousand feet from the sky
My terror has controlled my life
And let my only weakness know
I've got to rid this hell from my head
I fight off evil sorcerers
Rid my mind of his torture
And meet the falling angel in his realm
Alone in the dark
Where the demons are torturing me
The dark passages of revenge
Is all that I see
Faustus prepares the legions of the night
Diviners from the far north arrive
Aimlessly people they're huddled in a pack
Wreaking deadly havoc on mankind
I've fallen in my deepest sleep
To meet the evil Asteroth
His title is the Grand Duke of Hell
I fight until the end is near
To rid my mind of hopes and fears
My destination lies in my dreams
Set me free
When I was but very young
Sorcerers came to claim my mind
Leaving death and hatred to unmask
The master of the game had won
And let his final sin be known
Killing those who stand in his path
Alone in the dark
Where the demons are torturing me
The dark passages of revenge
Is all that I see
Armies of witches
Are called in from the north
Murders of elders occur
The high priest of evil
Has lowered his iron fist
Thousands of people will dieEmbed
