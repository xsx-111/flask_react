Sunday Morning Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Sappy pathetic little me
That was the girl I used to be
You had me on my knees

I'd trade you places any day
I'd never thought you could be that way
But you looked like me on Sunday

Well, you came in with the breeze
On Sunday Morning
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning

I thought I knew you (woh-oh)
I thought I knew you (woh-oh)
I thought I knew you well
So well

You're trying my shoes on for a change
They look so good but fit so strange
Out of fashion, so I can complain
Well, you came in with the breeze
On Sunday Morning
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning

I thought I knew you (woh-oh)
I thought I knew you (woh-oh)
I thought I knew you well
So well

I know who I am, but who are you?
You're not looking like you used to
You're on the other side of the mirror
So nothing's looking quite as clear
Thank you, for turning on the light
Thank you, now you're the parasite
I didn't think you had it in you
And now, you're looking like I used to

You came in with the breeze
On Sunday Morning
You sure have changed since yesterday
Without any warning
And you want me badly
Because you cannot have me
I thought I knew you (woh-oh)
Now I've got a new view (woh-oh)
I thought I knew you well
Oh well

Ooh, on Sunday morning
Without a warning
On Sunday morning
I thought I knew you (Sunday morning)
Ohh, you want me badly
You cannot have me
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning8Embed
