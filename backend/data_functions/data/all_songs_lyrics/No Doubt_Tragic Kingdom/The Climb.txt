The Climb Lyrics
Step by step, I come closer to reaching the top
Every step must be placed so that I don't fall off
Looking down to see about how much higher I am
Another cool wind comes through, brushes my skin

Oh, the harder I push, the tension does grow
I gather my thoughts the further and further I go
With some luck, I just might keep on climbing (Climbing)
So better to climb than to face a fall (To face a fall)

So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now (Can't turn back now)
Must keep climbing up to the clouds (Climb to the clouds)
So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now (Can't turn back now)
Must keep climbing up to the clouds (Climb to the clouds)

Whoa, pulling myself up by a rope, I better my view, oh
The only thing in sight is what I must do
As I turned, I could see myself falling, falling, falling (Falling)
Which in return, gave me strength for the climb
(Strength for the climb)
So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now (Can't turn back now)
Must keep climbing up to the clouds (Climb to the clouds)
So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now (Can't turn back now)
Must keep climbing up and up to the clouds (Climb to the clouds)

Although many failed, I must now prevail
With no questions
Have no time to stop, onward to the top
Of the mountain
Oh, and I, I can't turn back now
It's so very high, but I can't turn back now
If I keep it up, I'm gonna make it
I'm so very close, can't you see?

So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now (Can't turn back now)
Must keep climbing up to the clouds (Climb to the clouds)
So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now (Can't turn back now)
Must keep climbing up and up to the clouds (Climb to the clouds)
Oh, hey
So high the climb (So high the climb)
I can't turn back now (Can't turn back now)
Must keep climbing up and up to the clouds (Climb to the clouds)
Getting closer, getting closer, coming closer
Getting closer
Ooh
Looking back to you
Looking back to you
Looking back to you
Looking back to you
Looking back to you
Looking back to you
Looking back to you
To the top, to the top, to the top
To the top, to the top, to the top
To the top, to the top, to the top
Climb up to the top, to the top, to the top
To the top, to the top, to the top
Oh, looking back to you
Looking back to you
Looking back to you1Embed
