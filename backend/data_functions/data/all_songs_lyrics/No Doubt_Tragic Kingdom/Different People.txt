Different People Lyrics
Well things can be broken down in this world of ours
You don't have to be a famous person just to make your mark
A mother can be an inspiration to her little son
And change his thoughts, his mind, his life
Just with her gentle hum, hum
So different, yet so the same
Two sisters only have their parents to blame
It's rare that two can get along
But when they do, they're inseparable
Such a blessing comes to few, few

The sky is full of clouds
And my world's full of people

You got the different kinds
With different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's the same (Eee)

He and she, two different people with two separate lives
Then you put the two together, you get a spectacular surprise
'Cause one can teach the other one what she doesn't know
While still the other fills a place inside
He never knew had room to grow, grow, grow
Grow, grow
The sky is full of clouds
And my world's full of people

You got the different kinds
With different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's the same, hey

Oh, yeah, once in a while, I sit back
And think about the planet
And most of the time, I trip on it
To kick back and think about how massive it all is
And how many others are on it, yeah


I often think about the world in which I live today
Of animals and plants and nature's gifts set on display
But the most amazing thing that I've seen in my time
Are all the different people
And all their different minds, minds, minds, minds
And different ways
It would take a lifetime to explain
Not one's exactly the same
So many different people
So many different kinds
So many, many, many different people
So many differentâ€”

Look at me, I'm a person
Look at me, I'm my own person
So many different people
So many different kinds
For better or for worse, different peopleEmbed
