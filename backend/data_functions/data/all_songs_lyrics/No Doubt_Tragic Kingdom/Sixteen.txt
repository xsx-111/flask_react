Sixteen Lyrics
(One, two, three, four)
Yeah

You've been a juvenile
With a dolphin smile
With no elbow room
With your body in bloom
You've had your little backyard
Protected by big walls
You didn't dare look over
'Cause you've been too small

Now you're finally sixteen
And you're feelin' old
But they, they won't believe
That you got a soul
No, whoa, oh, no
'Cause you're only sixteen
And you're feeling real
But you, you can't seem to cop a feel
No, whoa, oh, no

Why do they have to force us
Through this metamorphose?
Oh, little butterfly
No matter how you try
You'll be segregated
You're gonna be closed off
You're callow and you're green
'Cause you're caught between
Yeah, you're only sixteen
Try to cross the line
But your, your little wings are intertwined
Oh, whoa, oh, no
Well you're only sixteen
And you're such a tease
And there's nothing you do
That can really please
Whoa, oh, no

These children, they're not really bad, most of them
Just products of rough neighborhoods and bad family situations


You know you can't forsake it
So sit back and take it
You see, you're not just ripe
So don't try and fight

That you're only sixteen
Wanna catch a peek
But they, they look at you
Like you're such a freak
Whoa, oh, no
Well you're only sixteen
With a lot to say
But they, they won't give you
The time of day
Whoa, oh, no
Well you're only sixteen (You're only sixteen)
Yeah, you're only sixteen (You're only sixteen)
Well you're just sixteen (You're only sixteen)
Oh, you poor little thing1Embed
