Excuse Me Mr. Lyrics
Oh, I'm like a beggar with no luck
I'm holding signs up on your street corner stops
Like most, you try not to see me
Stare straight ahead, ignore the responsibility

Excuse me (Excuse me, mister)
Well I've been waiting in line
And I'd like to buy some of your time
I'm very anxious, eager, willing
What's your billing? (Anxious, eager, willing)

So please excuse me, mister
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me, mister
I've known you too long
All I need is a little of your time

Oh, for most, love comes for free
They don't pay the high cost of mental custody
I'll pay bail for a guarantee
Make space for me in the time yet to be
Excuse me (Excuse me, mister)
Well I've been waiting in line
And I'd like to buy some of your time
And I've been saving up my life
What's your price? (Saving up my life)

So please excuse me, mister
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me, mister
I've known you way too long, boy
All I need is a little of your time

What should I do? I'm about to crack
And there's a force that comes over me
It's almost as if I'm tied to the tracks
I'm waiting for him to rescue me
The funny thing is, he's not going to come
He's not going to find me
This is a matter of fact, the desire you lack
This is the way I guess it has to be
A little of your time
I need a little of your time
Please, a little of your time, yeah
So please excuse me, mister
You've got things all wrong
You make it feel like a crime
So don't confuse me, mister
I've known you way too long, boy
All I need is a little of your time

Ooh, I'm in line to buy time
I'm in line to buy time
I'm in line to—
I'm in line to—
Excuse me
Well I've been waiting in line
Excuse me
Excuse me, misterEmbed
