Hey You Lyrics
Hey you, with the wedding dress on
Made of white chiffon blowing in the wind
Well hey you, with the dreams in your head
You've been so misled by your heart's pull

I know you're waiting for your ship to come in
You anxiously wait for such a long time

You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
You dress up, you play the game
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
Your name will never change (Your name will never change)

Well hey you, with the eyes full of hope
You think you can rope your desires
Well hey you, you na√Øve thing
Your patience, in time, will tire

I know you're thinking that your tide will roll in
How did you ever get such high hopes?
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
You dress up, you play the game
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
Your name will never change (Your name will never change)
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
In a plastic world of make-believe
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
You know he's just gonna leave (Gonna leave)

Hey you
Hey you
Hey you

I know you're waiting for your life to begin
Well wake up, girl, you've got it all wrong
You want a prize that you're not gonna win
So face it, girl, you've got it all wrong

You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
You dress up, you play the game
Oh, you're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
Your name will never change (Your name will never change)
Oh, you're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
In a plastic world of make-believe
You're just like my Ken and Barbie Doll
You know he's just gonna leave1Embed
