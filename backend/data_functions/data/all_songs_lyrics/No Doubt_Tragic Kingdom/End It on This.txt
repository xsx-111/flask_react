End It on This Lyrics
You see in the past
I had a dream, a fantasy
I thought that we would last
Become a little family
Then one, two, three, four
The years were flying by, they soared
And it's my gut feeling
It's not happening for me, so

Let's end it on this
Give me one last kiss
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this

You see it's hard to face
The addict that's inside of me
I want to fill my glass up
With you constantly
I've been here before
But I've never ever felt this sure
And now I know I've been dreaming
And your actions
Have inspired me, so
Let's end it on this
Give me one last kiss
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this

I open up, you ignore me
You're not the same at all
And if I could turn back
The pages of time I'd rewrite your point of view
Washed up on to the shore
Given one last chance
To try some more
But I'm tired, I'm freezing
Let's stop and call it history

Let's end it on this
Give me one last kiss
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
Give me one last kiss
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
Give me one last kiss
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on this
Give me one last kiss
Let's end it on this
Let's end it on thisEmbed
