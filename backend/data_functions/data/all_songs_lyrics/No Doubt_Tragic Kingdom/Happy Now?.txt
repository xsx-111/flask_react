Happy Now? Lyrics
You had the best, but you gave her up
'Cause dependency might interrupt
Idealistic will, so hard to please
Put your indecisive mind at ease

You broke the set
Now there's, there's only singles
There's no looking back
And this time I mean it

Are you happy now?
Oh, tell me how you're happy now
Are you happy?

The uncertainty you had of me
Brought clouded, shady company
The tenderness habitual
A seldom-fading ritual

You killed the pair
Now only one is breathing
There's no looking back
This time I mean it
Are you happy now?
Oh, tell me how you're happy now
Are you happy?
Are you happy now?
How is it now? Are you happy now?
Are you happy?

No more leaning on your shoulder
I won't be there, no more bother
If you feel you just might want me
That's too bad, I'm not that easy

The contemplator all those years
Now you must adhere to your new career
Of liberation, you've been cast
All by yourself, you're free at last

You broke the set
Now there's, there's only singles
There's no looking back
This time I mean it
Are you happy now?
Tell me how you're happy now
Are you happy?
Are you happy now?
How is it now? Are you happy now?
Are you happy?

Oh, you're by yourself
All by yourself
You got no one else
You're by yourself
All by yourself, all by yourself
All by yourself, all by yourself
No one else, no one else
By yourself, by yourself2Embed
