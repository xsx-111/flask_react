World Upon Your Shoulders Lyrics
All the bridges in the world
Won't save you
If there is no
Other side to cross to

When you're not feeling ugly
And the world's not too much

Take the world upon your shoulders
Take the world upon your shoulders
And burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Take the world upon your shoulders

Half full glasses
Lost in empty houses

When you're not feeling ugly
And the world's not too much

Take the world upon your shoulders
Take the world upon your shoulders
Take the world upon your shoulders
And burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Take the world upon your shoulders
Violent, big and violent
Like a thing that's big
Big and violent
A world that's big and violent


When you're not feeling ugly
And the world's not too much

Take the world upon your shoulders
Take the world upon your shoulders
And burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Take the world upon your shoulders
Take the world upon your shoulders
Take the world upon your shoulders1Embed
