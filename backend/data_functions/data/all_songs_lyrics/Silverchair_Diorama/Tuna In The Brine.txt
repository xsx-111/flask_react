Tuna In The Brine Lyrics
I fondle keys to my heart
When everyone's heart seems so calm
And you found the lock to my dorm
And opened the door to my trust fund, my vestry

The light in my darkest hour is fear
Denies me of anything good
So don't lose your heart, you'll need it

And to lose your heart
You'll have to take another pill
And tell another lie
And lie amongst your lies
Like tuna in the brine

Take everything that you're not
And don't be so scared to tamper with
Tampered with evidence
Cause you'll come along for the sun
If you come at all

The light in your darkest hour is fear
Denies me of anything good
So don't lose your heart, you'll need it
And to lose your heart
You'll have to lie amongst your lies
Like tuna in the brine
And to lose your heart
And don't lose your
Don't lose your heart
To lose your heart you'll have to take, take, take

Painting a lie, seeing the colours
But you seem closer to everything
Painting a lie, seeing the colours
But you seem closer to everything
Painting a lie, seeing the colours
But you seem closer to everything

Closer now than we ever have been
We're closer now than we ever should be
We're closer now than we've ever been before
Closer to everything
Busking for change and changing everything
Feeble fables aren't changing many things
It's my time to shine like a tuna in the brine
For my pregnant paws aren't changing anything
To all of the animals who
Keep sipping the sweat from my back
You're making me ill and I can't get enough

So take another pill and tell another lie
And lie amongst your lies like tuna in the brine1Embed
