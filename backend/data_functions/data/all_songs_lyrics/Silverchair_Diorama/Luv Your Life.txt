Luv Your Life Lyrics
You don't know the truth and I love your life
You don't know the truth and I love your life

Thrust the candle to the dark of your disease
Burn the fish plate execute ill memories
Labyrinth of sympathy in which I'm lost and can't leave
And too much truth overshadows the lime lies
Cause what lies beneath the clouds is an altered perception
And I'll pay for sanity but sanity don't come cheap

You don't know the truth and I love your life
You don't know the truth and I love your life
Cause you don't know the truth and I love your life
You don't know the truth and I love your life
You don't know the truth and I love your life
And you don't know the truth I love your life

Flinch against the fire but this ain't winter
And I'm all by myself
The way I wanna be, where I'm content to be
To be all by myself
And frozen eyes are bound to melt
You don't know the truth and I love your life
And you don't know the truth and I love your life
And you don't know the truth and I love your life

You don't know the truth
You don't know the truth
You don't know the truth and I love your life

And you don't know the truth
You don't know the truth
And you don't know the truth2Embed
