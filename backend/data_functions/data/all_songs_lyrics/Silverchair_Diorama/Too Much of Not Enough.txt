Too Much of Not Enough Lyrics
She tripped on a hole
That I'd dug in the soil
To be part of a human garden
I couldn't stand
In the straight postured sun
But you stood in the mud
Which came unsoiled

When I came along
When I came along
When I came along
You see you never stop needing
You never stop needing

A close look at something so close
Too much of not enough
A close look at something so close
Too much of not enough
All we need is just a taste

I strapped myself in
For a safe saccharide
Before it started I tried
To be anything I saw fit
And it all seemed to fit
But you came undone
When I came along
When I came along
When I came along
You see you never stop needing
You never stop needing

A close look at something so close
Too much of not enough
A close look at something so close
Too much of not enough
All we need is just a taste


Blind white lies
And shallow truth
Broken strings
And stolen youth
I've seen too much
Of not enough

You came much closer than they had before
Too much of not enough
You came much closer than they had before
Too much of not enough
You came much closer than they had before
You never stop needing
You never stop needing
You never stop needing
And it's good for nothing1Embed
