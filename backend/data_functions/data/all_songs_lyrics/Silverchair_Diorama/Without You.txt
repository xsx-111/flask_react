Without You Lyrics
Miles away
There's hopeless smiles brighter than mine
And I need for you to come and go
Without the truth falling out

Old incisions refusing to stay
Like the sun through the trees on a clouded day

You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat
But it melts in the sun like a life without love
And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on without you
Without you...

Telephone
Socially scared and impaired
If the trees will bloom, the wind can blow
Without the fruit falling out

Old incisions refusing to stay
Like the sun through the trees on a clouded day
You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat
But it melts in the sun like a life without love
And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on without you
Without you...

Feels like the wind blows
Holding you with us
She takes no other
False light and ashes
Blooming like winter...

You brighten my life like a polystyrene hat
But it melts in the sun like a life without love
And I've waited for you so I'll keep holding on without you
Without you...
Without you...
