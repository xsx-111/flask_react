After All These Years Lyrics
Breathe in the night that crushed a tired sunrise
Born again, the day brings young naivety
A laptop souvenir is worth the weight in silver and gold
And son, you'll be home again and I'll be whole again
Mend in my sleep, I'm boxing underwater
Waddle on the wake
Waking on a summer day
A summer day

And after all these years forget about all the troubled times
And after all these years forget about all the troubled times

And every father's pain casts a shadow over a broken son
You'll be whole again and I'll be whole again
Munificent, artless and ascetic
Playing like a scared enthusiastic pawn

After all these years forget about all the troubled times
And after all these years forget about all the troubled times
The troubled times, all those years I was hurting to feel something more than life
All those years
After all these years forget about all the troubled times
And after all these years forget about all the troubled times
And after all these years forget about all the troubled times
The troubled times, all those years I was hurting to feel something more than life
