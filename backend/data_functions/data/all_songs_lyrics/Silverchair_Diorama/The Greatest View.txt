The Greatest View Lyrics
You're the analyst, the fungus in my milk
When you want no one and you got someone
Through the wind you crawl, and laugh at burning dunes
When no one else will ever see

Now that you know why you feel like you do
They're turning their head whilst they wait for no one
And finally I know why you feel like letting go

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got the greatest view from here
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got the greatest view from here

Mistakes don't mean a thing if you don't regret them
So pack your tactic toes for the winter
Chain a waterfall to burned and withered skin
No one else will ever see

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got the greatest view from here
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got the greatest view from here

Now that you know why you feel like you do
They're turning their head whilst they wait for no one
And finally I know why I feel like you're letting me go

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got the greatest view from here
I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got the greatest view from here

The greatest view from here
