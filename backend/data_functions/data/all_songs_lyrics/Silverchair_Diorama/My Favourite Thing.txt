My Favourite Thing Lyrics
Got my fever down
Then weighed it up
And I know the sounds remaining
Won't strain all the silt from my eyes
Bleach the green from the pastures
Feast on the grey of the night
Straight from the vines refusal to shine

You're my favourite thing
You're my favourite
The one that I love
You're the one so I'd die for your love

Blind the deafened moon
Stimulate the tombs of angels
I'll open my heart, won't fall apart
So don't fall apart

You're my favourite thing
You're my favourite
The one that I love
You're the one so I'd die for your love
And I feel like letting go
And I feel like letting go

You're my favourite thing
You're my favourite thing
You're my favourite
The one that I love
You're the one so I'd die for your
Die for your love1Embed
