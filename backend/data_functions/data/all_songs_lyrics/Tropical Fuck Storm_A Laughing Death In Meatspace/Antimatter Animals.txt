Antimatter Animals Lyrics
You only oughta be remembered
If you have been forgotten first
It’s like you oughta be misplaced
By simply taking up too much space

Everywhere and nowhere like a needle in a haystack
Everywhere and nowhere like an aeon or a curse
If you wanna be remembered
You’re only making everything much worse

Burn me on an endless beach
Or bury me at night
Don’t take yourself so personally
Just give me peace and quiet

Everywhere and nowhere like a needle in a haystack
Everywhere and nowhere like an aeon or a curse
If you wanna be remembered
You’re only making everything much worse

Something’s changed in recent days
Whenever we hang out
There’s these subtle shifts in temperature
That we don’t talk about
And every quantum fluctuation has the sting of indignation
And I’m a real test of your patience without opening my mouth
And right there in the room
Another antimatter elephant has wrecked the afternoon
Your politics ain’t nothing but a fond fuck you
Your politics ain’t nothing but a fond fuck you
No one sees the window they are waving through
It’s very, very simple
Your politics ain’t nothing but a fond fuck you
Your politics ain’t nothing but a fond fuck you
No one sees the window they are waving through
It’s very, very simple
Your politics ain’t nothing but a fond fuck you
Your politics ain’t nothing but a fond fuck you
No one sees the window they are waving through
It’s very, very simpleEmbed
