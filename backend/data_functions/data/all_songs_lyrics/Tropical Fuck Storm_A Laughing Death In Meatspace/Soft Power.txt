Soft Power Lyrics
Yeah hold your fire man don't shoot
Here come the Oompa Loompa with the nukes
Riding his fly blown drone, like there ain't no one home
With no particular cause except what's here now is his
Comin' like a T-rex with all the confederates
Lined us all up like the alphabet
Refresh my memory again, I can't remember anymore
The plan's we're either going to Mars or war
I heard a lot of promises
(Promises, promises...)

Ahhh no no no no
This ain't the way it has to go
I heard how the deserters made the bush their home
With coffee coloured skin, naked, green eyed
Prone to flight, fight, stay hid
They'd pick the fights they win
Saying fuck soft power
No one's comin' in
And no one's gonna lie to me
(Lie to me, lie to me...)

Ahhh no no no no
This ain't the way it has to go
Now there's the siege of the survivors in a pock marked bank
Pizza boys and postmen charging at its flanks
A junior exec under a walnut desk
Calls the local news to tell the world whats comin' next
"they're takin pot shots 'cross the lawn with the curtains drawn
But its like shooting at the Chinese Wall"
SOFT POWER
(soft power, soft power...)
Oh no no no no fuck
They got surrounded by the hot stuffed crust
While the billboard jolly roger drove 'em beige with rage
To glory hole shaped graves in their shopping carts
And now they’re all in heaven with their BeeGees Christ
Their souls are set free yet somebody’s already buying ‘em
Look up there! …it’s a multiplex hex of Tom Cruise
At the end of a rainbow all our eyeballs roll through
He’s picked up the option, he’s gonna film the failed coup
Right after he makes Top Gun 2
SOFT POWER!!! soft pedalled
Everything was going so swell
But now we need to play our weak hand well
(Soft power, soft power…)

Bye bye Scarecrow, hello old world
I’m moving back into your shitty dump
It leaks every time it rains
And I’m in here wracking my brains
And I’m drinking vodka from a dirty coffee cup
I always thought I knew
Once I shot through
That I’d  be sure of what I was giving up
And the feeling of relief I’d get
From getting up to leave was never meant to be
Coz now you’ve gone and fucked everything up
And to hear me talk you’d guess I’d be the first to walk
And that I never dreamt that I’d be missing you so much
Everyone here gets the joke
Everybody except you
It must be lonely at the top
So let me lighten up your mood
The down side is we’re all about to get royally fucked
And the upside is we’re all about to get screwed
But in spite of it all we’ll miss you more than you miss us
And I’m gonna miss you so much
So much
Bye bye Richie, Chachi, Fonzie, Ralphy, and Joanie Cunningham…
But when you go I’m gonna miss you most Scarecrow
Scarecrow I’m gonna miss you most
When you go I’m gonna miss you most Scarecrow
Scarecrow I’m gonna miss you most
When you go I’m gonna miss you most Scarecrow
Scarecrow I’m gonna miss you most1Embed
