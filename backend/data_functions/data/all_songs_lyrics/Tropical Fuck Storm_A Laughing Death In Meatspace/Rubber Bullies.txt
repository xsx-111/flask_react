Rubber Bullies Lyrics
This supermarket aircon’s freezing man
I'm feeling like I’m dying
It’s a half hour after midnight
And all the fluoros zapped my appetite
It don’t make choosing easy
I’m waiting for a sign
Some miracle of marketing
To save me from these aisles
Then it’s omega man amnesia
In the narrow night time streets
That capsize in their puddles
With their storm clouds and their sleeps
Discreet wet dreams and nightmares
Seclusion, side by side
The world’s way too connected
And all anybody does is fight
Staging their crypto inquisitions
All in multiple choice, like:
Anything that screws you's
Surely sured up by its bulk and...
A: better organised?
B: better mobilised?
C: getting monetised?
D: can’t be criticised?
You better hold on
And get it right
You better hold on
The whole world’s gonna pass you by

Oh how why
Time seems to fly
Oh how why
Life passed me by

Take me on a holiday
Put me on an aeroplane
I wanna BMW
I wanna be immortal in my lifetime too

There's a stone wall ‘round a citadel
There's a city made of glass
Certain pasts want certain futures
Certain futures certain pasts
And there’s a building site on Sesame Street
All party donor-backed
It’s all footlong sub divisions
Built so cheap they won’t outlast
Your disapproval or their doormats
Built by the sycophants
Of plutocrats and idiots big on
Firm handshakes and eye contact
The water pressure’s pitiless and all the restaurants shut by eight
The walls are made of plywood
When they should be armour plate
You better hold on
Its gonna fly
Here comes a letter to the occupant
Here comes the caveat - an eye for an eye

Oh how why
You know the end is nigh

So take me on a holiday
Put me on an aeroplane
Just take me on a holiday
And put me on an aeroplane

Oh how time
Where we going now?

To that terrace over Rio
With a bougainvillea vines
Where the heat finally nailed me
So we stayed the extra night
And then the guard up in the watchtower
Charged with keeping out the fighting
Joked the difference between sexes
All boils down to their handwriting
And when we checked out the next morning
We were on a first name basis
But then he had the kind of features
Where you can’t recall his face
But it wouldn’t have been that much later he saw God’s
‘Cause he died staring up the nostrils
Of a UPP shotgun
He couldn’t hold on
He couldn’t fly
Wrong place wrong time is something of an understatement
The world went passed him by

Oh how why
Time seems to fly
Oh how why
Where we going now?Embed
