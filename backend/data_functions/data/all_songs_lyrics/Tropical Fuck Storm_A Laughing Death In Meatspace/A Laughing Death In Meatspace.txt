A Laughing Death In Meatspace Lyrics
The valley engineers called the end times Meatspace
When kuru was the Papuan Laughing Death
And we broke ties, atomised
And brought the Schism on
How can you condemn someone
For simply being someone else?
How can you condemn someone
For simply being someone else?
I remember when being at home
Meant not to live or die alone
But now there’s hardly anybody left
Now there’s hardly anybody left

And then I remember
A bright funny day
Then I remember
My run away
And then I remember
A bright funny day
Then I remember
My run away

Town was more hallucination than a feast for the eyes
It got pretty bad for most yet good for some
And they all preached live and let live
And yet forgot how to forgive
An ideal don’t make the world worth living on
An ideal don’t make the world worth living on
Now it’s pyramids and dams
And German pill boxes in France
That is all there is that’s left of everyone
That is all there is that’s left of everyone
And then I remember
A bright funny day
Then I remember
My run away
And then I remember
A bright funny day
And then I remember

The panic and sweat
Rolling down off the high ground
You reclaimed from the sea
Well we have hardly any time
And there ain’t no wrong or right
And your home is down here with me

Oh yes I forgive you
My sunny day
Oh yes I believe you
My run away
Oh yes I forgive you
My sunny day
Oh yes I believe you
My run away
My run away
My run away
My run away
My run away
Oh yes I forgive you
My sunny day
Oh yes I believe you
My run away
My run away
My run away
My run away
My run awayEmbed
