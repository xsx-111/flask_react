Chameleon Paint Lyrics
These are only my impressions
All of which are false
The day you’ve got nothing to say’s
The day I check your pulse
Your ravings and your disses
Your cruel cruel cruel cool
You never did nothing you hid
Except water down the truth

FYI a POV
Don’t make an NGO
This scorn porn’s just the showboat spawn
Of lying in an exit poll
Who’s screwing who, what, where, how? (Wow!)
Power gets let off every time
And all this scot-free moralising’s got
Me quite demoralised

You phone it in
All shame and sin
You’re coming out swinging, ohh
Those who can’t, teach
Those who don’t, speech
Cause we’d never see the light on our own
(Ohh) So why do I feel like I’m dying?

Shame and sin
Where you been
I don’t ever miss you being on my own
Then you come in
All knowing
Like you’ve never made mistakes of your own

Kneel down by the advertising
Don’t you make a single false move
We’ve got spies and rabble rousing
Seems like you could use a little sagely abuse

Where you been?
Shame and sin
I see everyone’s joining in like they know
Then you come in
All shame and sin
Like you’ve never made mistakes of your own
Life’s beautiful
(Ohh) So why do I feel like I’m dying?2Embed
