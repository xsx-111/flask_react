The Future of History Lyrics
Yeah you know that algorithm weren’t relying on chance
(Walking, walking)
When Deep Blue eyed the champion like a charlatan
(Walking, walking)
His name was Kasparov, the one that all the girls loved
(Walking, walking)
And in the U.S.S.S.S.S.S.S.R. he was a god
(Walking the Valley of Death)
Deep Blue was a 64 bit lightning war
(Walking, walking)
He was a data crushing Viking of a Commodore
(Walking, walking)
He was the Mongol horde of the checker board (Walking, walking)
He was shock and awe with an Intel core
And a thing for the extinction of the dinosaurs
(Walking the Valley of Death)

30 RS 6000 SP thin
One-Twenty Mega Hertz P2SC
VLSI Running AIX
Chuck Norris vs Boris in the Valley of Death

A sky without a world
A shore without a sea
A sun without heat
Shining light you can’t see
I used to worry one day they’d have feelings too
But these days I’m more worried that that is not true
Kasparov staked his prowess on his claim to life (Walking, walking)
And he wasn’t about to lose it to a traffic light (Walking, walking)
But machines don’t cry, they don’t concede (Walking, walking)
Like the shogun with the grogan you’re about to eat
(Walking the Valley of Death)

A sky without a world
A shore without a sea
A sun without heat
Shining a light you can’t see
If silicon is prone to make your dreams come true
You could probably say the same thing about nightmares too

Programmed for the pogrom, RAM set to shock
(Walking, walking)
All the veins in Garry’s forehead went pop, pop, pop
(Walking, walking)
If IBM is here to make your dreams come true (Walking, walking)
Well, it can probably do the same thing for your nightmares too

A sky without a world
A shore without a sea
A sun without heat
Shining a light you can’t see
If you ain’t worried they’re gonna to do your work for you
You’ll recall they said the same thing about farming too

Kasparov saw our fate and cried out in despair
“We are commanded by the monsters we have brought to bear!
And nobody does the dishes, the turkeys vote for Christmas
Gaslighted by the telephone that put Steve Jobs in business
And no one in the future plays chess, or cares!”
