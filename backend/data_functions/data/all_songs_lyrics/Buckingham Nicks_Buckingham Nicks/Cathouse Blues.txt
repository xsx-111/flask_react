Cathouse Blues LyricsI got the cathouse blues
I wear the highest of high heel shoes
Whoa…
Whoa, darling
It’s hard to be surrounded
Where the women are lazy
And the men are rude
I got the can’t walk, don’t talk blues
I creep on cat’s feet
I don’t speak loose
Your…self in velvet
Forget we ever met
I got the closed-in, the cathouse blues
Blue-grey…
Eyes that say
I guess you don’t remember
I guess that I was younger
Touché…
The cat sleeps alone
Sleeps only in the sun
But she’ll awake the night and she’ll be gone
Singing the cathouse blues
I need some new red velvet shoes
I’m still a dreamer’s fancy
They say I’m pretty classy
I’m just a feline silky cat come true
I’m just a feline silky cat come true…
I’m just a feline silky cat come…true…
Yeah…Embed
