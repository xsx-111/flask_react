Without a Leg to Stand On LyricsI got nothing but time no time for living
I've been everywhere it's all the same
I just need somebody that I can lean on
Nobody wants to keep you when you're in love with the game
But you know that I can't let go
And there ain't nothing left to show
Got the feeling I can't say no
Without a leg to stand on
There's so many fine people that I believe in
They don't care where I'm going it's not their show
I got nothing but time bo time for living
I used to be somebody but that was so long ago
Look around but you won't see me
Just a picture of what I used to be
There ain't nothing to set me free
Without a leg to stand on
But you know that I can't let go
And there ain't nothing left to show
Got the feeling I can't say no
Without a leg to stand onEmbed
