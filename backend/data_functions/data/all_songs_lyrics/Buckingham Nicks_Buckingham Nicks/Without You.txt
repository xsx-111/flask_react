Without You LyricsIn my life
There's been a few things worth singing
'Bout you
Well, I never even dreamed
That I'd know you
Strange are the ways
Of a very complicated world
And there you are
Come to me now
And I'll never know another
You are song for me, melody
Ingrained in my soul
Sing, sing your song
For my ears, they only hear you
If I never knew the likes of you
Where would I be without you?
Without you
Without you
Without you, yeah
If I'd not heard your laughter
Maybe I wouldn't love you
If I'd not sung your music
If I'd not come rolling after you
Woah, yeah
Cryin' out loud
The time had come and gone without you
Inside me
Love to be written about you
Strange are the ways
Of a very complicated world
And there you are
Come to me now
And I'll never know another
You are song for me, melody
Ingrained in my soul
Sing, sing your song
For my ears, they only hear you
If I never knew the likes of you
Where would I be without you?
Without you
Without you, yeah
Without you, yeahEmbed
