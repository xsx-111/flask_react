Sorcerer LyricsI'm tired
I'm thirsty
I'm wild-eyed
In my misery
Timeless in your finery
It's a high price
For your luxury
Sorcerer
Who is the master
A man and woman on a star stream
In the middle of a snow dream
Sorcerer
Show me the high life
Come over
Let me put you on ice
All around black ink darkness
And who found lady from the mountains
All around black ink darkness
And who found lady from the mountains
Lady from the mountains
I'm tired
I need you badly
I'm wild-eyed
In my misery
Timeless in your finery
It's a high price
For your luxury
Sorcerer
Who is the master
A man and woman on a star stream
In the middle of a snow dream
Sorcerer
Show me the high life
Come over
Let me put you on iceEmbed
