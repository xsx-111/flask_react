Crystal LyricsDo you always trust your first initial feeling
Special knowledge holds true, bears believing
I turned around and the water was closing all around like a glove
Like the love that had finally, finally found me
Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like and clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet
To the sea
How the faces of love have changed turning the pages
And I have changed, oh, but you, you remain ageless
I turned around and the water was closing all around like a glove
Like the love that had finally, finally found me
Then I knew in the crystalline knowledge of you
Drove me through the mountains
Through the crystal like and clear water fountain
Drove me like a magnet
To the seaEmbed
