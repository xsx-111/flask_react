Crying in the Night LyricsShe was that kind of lady
Times were hard
But she could come curling 'round you
Like fingers
But she'll leave you
Crying in the night
She will leave you
Crying in the night
She's going to leave you
Crying in the night
She's back in town
And she's looking around
Say you needed someone to depend on
You're all alone
She's the only one
Who can come take you far away
Take your breath away
Come on baby
She's the wrong kind a' girl
She's a come-on lady
She's a tarnished pearl
She'll take your money
She'll wreck your world
Wreck your world
She's a come-on baby
Come-on girl
A come-on girl
Come on ... girl
She's back
And she's looking around
And she's looking around
And she's looking aroundEmbed
