Candlebright (aka Nomad) LyricsFor no special reason
I am leaving you for a while tonight
I'm flying far above you
Still I love you
You make things right
I've been with you before
I'll be with you again
I'll come back for more, yeah
The story has a strange ending
Well, you know me, I'm a nomad
I can't feel bad
About the way I am
I've been rolling around
My whole life
You're my candlebright in the window
I've been with you before
I'll be with you again
I'll come back for more, yeah
The story has a strange ending
You guide me back again
And I come when you shine
You are not my friend, no
But I am something of a dreamer
I am something of a dreamer
I am something of a dreamer
I've been with you before
I'll be with you again
I'll come back for more, yeah
The story has a strange ending
Still I love you
My candlebright
You are not my friend
But still I love you
You're my candlebright
Still I love you
But you are not my friend
But still I love you
I can't feel badEmbed
