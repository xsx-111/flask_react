Races are Run LyricsSo many different kind of people
Trying to be the same
No way baby
He said
Baby, baby there's no way
If we could start again
Well who knows
Have we really changed
Some say we have
Reflecting our past
Who can say
Who can say
Races are run
Some people win
Some people always have to lose
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Tell me I'm wrong
I can't believe you
We tried a thousand times before
Rained on reasons
Kept us believing
That there might still be more
Races are run
Some people win
Some people always have to lose
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Races are run
Some people win
Some people always have to lose
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Races are run
Some people win
Some people always have to lose
Oh, oh, oh, yeahEmbed
