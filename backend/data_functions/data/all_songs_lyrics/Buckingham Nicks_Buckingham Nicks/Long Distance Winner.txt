Long Distance Winner LyricsSunflowers and your face fascinate me
You love only the tallest trees
I come running down the hill
But you're fast
You're the winner
Long distance winner
Not unlike the blue white fire
You burn brightly in spite of yourself
I bring the water down to you
But you're too hot to touch
You're too hot to touch
Love somebody save their soul
Tie them to your heaven erase their hell
Love their lifestyle if you feel it
Don't try to change them you never will
Sunflowers and your face fascinate me
You go into the dusty pink day
I come a calling unto you
But you run
You're the winner
Long distance winner
Oh yeah, you're the winner
Long distance winner, ah yeah
Love somebody save their soul
Tie them to your heaven erase their hell
Love their lifestyle if you feel it
Don't try to change them you never will
Sunflowers and your face fascinate me
You love only the tallest trees
I come running down the hill
But you're fast
You're the winner
Long distance winner
Oh yeah, you're the winner
Long distance winner, ah ah yeah
You're the winner, ah ah yeahEmbed
