Valhalla LyricsWinds of Odin guide us
Over violent seas, the silent grave
Gods of thunder
Roaring, crackling power
In flashing light, they pound the night
Rising winds and howling fury
Towering shadows crashing down
As we awaken and behold
The crystal seas and ships of gold
To the colored winds our sails arise
The distant shore before us lies
Winds of Odin whisper
Over silent waves, no trace remains
We have found a new horizon
Far beyond the stars that shine above
Thrashing wings valkyries rising
To the hallowed halls of Valhalla
Valhalla, Valhalla
Valhalla, Valhalla
Valhalla, ValhallaEmbed
