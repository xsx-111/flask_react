Queen of the Masquerade LyricsWoman - madame of mystery
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter
Lady - black widow strange and cruel
Is it true?
Do you still need hearts to bleed
To be satisfied?
Gathering prey, deadly webs
Hang in dark disguise
Showing no mercy, insatiable appetite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Look out
Slowly, crawling feeding on your heart
So many kings with broken dreams
The tyrants rule, the dragon pleads
Tell you man she'll tear you all apart
In chambers of the wicked queen
The silence falls, the feast begins
Moon-shining eyes, clinging cobwebs
Above her bed
Spider smooth legs across faces
On silken web
Feeling the sting of her venomous
Clinching bite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Her majesty queen
Do you still need hearts to bleed
To be satisfied?
Gathering prey, deadly webs
Hang in dark disguise
Showing no mercy, insatiable appetite
Down, down to your knees
Bow before her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Deep in your heart she feeds
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Bow to her majesty
Hail - to the queen of the masquerade
Hard in your heart that bleeds
Hail...Embed
