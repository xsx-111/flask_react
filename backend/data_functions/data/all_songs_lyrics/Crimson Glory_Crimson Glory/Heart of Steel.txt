Heart of Steel LyricsYour love hides like a dark star
Shining, hidden in fear
Strangers feeding upon your soul
Call me on through the darkness
Hold me deep in your heaven
Touch me with fingers of velvet blue
Fingers of misty blue...
Feelings deep as the ocean
Cold waves whisper their warning
Danger walks with a fragile heart
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Yeah, heart of steel
You journey through my mind
Over the walls of pain
Angels of lust guard my domain
While dark eyes shine in the mirror
Searching for someone
Strangers, cold as the winter wind
Fade away
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Lonely freedom, eyes on pain
Tears will fall like silent rain
Hearts will shatter, feelings fade
Somehow it always seems the same
My love hides like a dark star
Laughing, hidden in silence
Strangers cold as the winter wind
Fade away
Feelings deep as the ocean
Cold waves whisper their warning
Danger walks with a fragile heart
Walks with a fragile heart
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Got to have a heart of steel
Heart of steel
Cause the feelings come and go
And you never really know
If the feeling's ever real
So you got to have a heart of steel
You got to have a heart of steelEmbed
