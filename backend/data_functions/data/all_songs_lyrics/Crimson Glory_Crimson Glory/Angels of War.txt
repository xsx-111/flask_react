Angels of War LyricsWe fly without fear
Through the valley of shadows
Waging our war against evil
In your world
We rule the heavens and earth
From kingdoms of light
We are the holy
Holy angels of war
Angels of war
We are the holy angels of war
Angels of war
Gleaming white angels of war
Descending in glory
With the sound of an army of wings
We enter your world
We rule the earth and the sky
From kingdoms of light
We are the holy
Holy angels of war
Angels of war
We are the holy angels of war
Angels of war
Thick red mouthful of evil
Will you swallow?
Angels of darkness will tempt you
Will you follow?
Spit in the face of evil
Never fear
Fly on the wings of glory
Join us here
We are the holy angels of war
Angels of war
We are the holy angels of war
Angels of war
We are the holy angels of war
Angels of war
We are the holy angels of war
Angels of warEmbed
