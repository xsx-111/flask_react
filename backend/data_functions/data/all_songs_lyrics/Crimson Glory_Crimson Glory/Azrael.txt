Azrael LyricsNever been in the hell before
Now I'm falling, falling
Heaven's behind the door
And they're calling me again
Hidden beyond the light
And the darkness finds me
Help me escape tonight
Oh, I must find Azrael...
I am the darkness
Hiding within your mind
Walking beside you
I lock the gates to hell
I toll the final bell
I am forever
I am the blinding light
Probing the endless night
There's no escaping me
Wake in your darkest dreams
Go ahead and try to scream
No one can hear you now
Stare in the raven's eye
Your time has come to die
Welcome to my world
Stand at the end of space
Reach out to touch my face
I am omega
Azrael
I hold the lion's mane
I come in crimson rain
Purging the dark sky
I am the master
Guide to your chosen fate
I am Valhalla
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Yeah
Beware my eyes'll find you
And see into your heart
And if you hold the evil
I'll rip you all apart
I'll cast your soul to Satan
Die by holy fire
Rise and stand before me
Burning on the pyre. Burn
Fly on the wings of glory
Burn in the depths of hell
Your life creates the doorway
Death holds the key
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
Azrael, angel of mercy
