Dragon Lady LyricsThe full moon is burning
In the crimson sky
A wicked witches laughter
Echoes in the night
The wolves of doom howl
A warning to the wind
Red eyes of fire
Haunting your dreams again
Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!
Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say good-bye!
Dragon lady wants to meet you
Step into her lair
Death waits in the shadows
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
No, no, no, no
Watch out her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
You shall die!
She's a dragon lady
Watch out
Dragon lady wants to meet youEmbed
