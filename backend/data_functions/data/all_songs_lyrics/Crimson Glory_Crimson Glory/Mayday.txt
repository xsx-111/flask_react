Mayday LyricsCountdown to zero, ignition
Warning
Rising in smoke, glowing fire
Thrusting into the sky of the morning
Warning
All systems down
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
In search of the glory
They reach for the stars
With honor and courage
They die!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Thunderous roar of the engine
Screaming
They fill the sky, burning trails
Down through the clouds falling faster
Disaster
Taking their lives
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Mayday!Embed
