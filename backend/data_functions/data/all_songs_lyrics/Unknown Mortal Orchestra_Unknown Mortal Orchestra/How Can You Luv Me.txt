How Can You Luv Me Lyrics
How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?

And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?

And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground


How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?
And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground

How can you love me
When you don’t like me, baby?
How can you look at me
And not see the lonely tears?

And I don’t know know what went wrong
Or why I'm singing this song
Lonely tears on the ground2Embed
