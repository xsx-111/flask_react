Little Blu House Lyrics
Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while

Little safe houses sitting high on the mountainside
Little safe houses sitting high on the mountainside
Oh, to be safe on the mountainside
Oh, to be safe on the mountainside

Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while

Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Little blue houses sitting high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside
Oh, to be high on the mountainside
Maybe all the wolves could lose my scent
And I could stay here for a while1Embed
