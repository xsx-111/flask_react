Nerve Damage! Lyrics
We got pistachio riflemen
We got a leopard skin motorcade
We gotta wipe the wipers and dodge the snipers
And try to keep the rattlesnakes from fucking it up

We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you down

Now tell you donâ€™t breathe the cellophane
P-p-p-piss on the window pane
We gotta wipe the wipers and dodge the snipers
And try to keep the rattlesnakes from fucking it up

We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
We got nerve damage
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you down
The cops musta took you downEmbed
