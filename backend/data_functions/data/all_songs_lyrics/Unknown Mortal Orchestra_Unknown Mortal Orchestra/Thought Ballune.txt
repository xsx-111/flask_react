Thought Ballune Lyrics
Building islands in the sky
While I'm a prisoner in my mind
Will my mommy tell me why?
Sometimes, a wrong is a right

I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune

Flying out into the night
Why do I feel so uptight?
Is it darkness or the light?
Sometimes, a wrong is a right

I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought ballune
I'm a smiling alligator
And I tell lies that ring true later
So much air when we inflate a thought balluneEmbed
