Strangers Are Strange Lyrics
Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we’re not in love
So we can fall into love again
Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we’re not in love
So we can fall into love again

Love is quite easy to find
When you’re unsleazy and kind
There’s a madness in your mind

Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we are strangers
So we can be strange, like strangers are strange
Jenny, my friend, Jenny, my friend
It’s fun to pretend that we are strangers
So we can be strange, like strangers are strange

Love is quite easy to find
When you’re unsleazy and kind
There’s a madness in your mindEmbed
