Boy Witch Lyrics
If he was a girl, could she be as evil as a boy?
Would she scramble in the dark for his eyes?

If she finds that his eyes give out nothing that she likes
Like a candle in the dark, she makes light
He is alone in the, in the cold void

Make him shout
Make him shout
Make him shout2Embed
