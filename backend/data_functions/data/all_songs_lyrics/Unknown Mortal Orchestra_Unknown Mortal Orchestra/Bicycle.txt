Bicycle Lyrics
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust

Can I start with a goodbye?
Do I dare revisit visions
That unfolded that wretched night?
Disassociated by
Combinations that were ill-advised
And a dosage quite unwise

My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust

Oh, it cut me down to size
What a difference between what I saw
And what was before my eyes
Was that criminal disease
That will get you taken via squad car
Right to the A&E
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust

La-la la, la-la la la
La-la la la la-la la la la la
La-la la la-la la
La-la la, la-la la la
La-la la la la-la la la la la
La-la la la-la la

My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust
My bicycle rode so smooth
Under the cars, over the stars
All of you can eat my dust2Embed
