FFunny FFrends Lyrics
Don't be surprised if we try to be wise
Well, love is much more than good advice

Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends

Who gives a damn if we throw the dice?
Well, love is much more than good advice

Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends

Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends3Embed
