Crazy LyricsHere's a little song to make you feel good
Put a little light in your day
These are crazy times
And it's all been getting pretty serious
Here's a little song to make you feel right
Send the blues away
Well it's a crazy game
Tell me who's to blame I'm kinda curious
Right if you win, wrong if you lose
Nobody listens when you're singin' the blues
Well something's the matter but nothing gets done
Oh everyone's waiting for a place in the sun
Well something is wrong now, can something be wrong with me
Oh brother, why's it gotta be so crazy
Crazy yeah
Gimme little left, gimme little right
Gimme little black, gimme little white
Gimme little peace, gimme little hope
Gimme little light
'Cause you know it seems that the situation's getting serious
Right if you win, wrong if you lose
Nobody listens when you're singin' the blues
Well something's the matter but nothing gets done
There's no use in waiting for a place in the sun
'Cause something is wrong now, can something be wrong with me
Oh brother, why's it gotta be so crazy
Crazy yeah
Oh something is wrong with me
Oh brother, why's it gotta be so crazyEmbed
