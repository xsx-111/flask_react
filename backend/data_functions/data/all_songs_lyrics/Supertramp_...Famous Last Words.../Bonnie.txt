Bonnie LyricsYour silver nights and golden days
I try to reach you in a million ways
I'm crazy 'bout you Bonnie
Can you tell?
Your diamond rings and fancy clothes
Do I want you babe, well heaven knows
Im wild about you Bonnie
Can't you see, hey Bonnie
I've loved you oh so long
I know we'd get along
Hey Bonnie will you ever notice me
Yes I know you oh so well
Just one look and I fell
Please tell me that our love will always be
I've seen your films and all your plays
I read about you every single day
I'd like to get my lovin'arms 'round you
From rags to which you've got it made
How does it feel to be a famous name
Well Bonnie can you do the same for me
Oh Bonnie
I feel you in my soul
To love you is my role
Oh Bonnie you're the only one for me
Yes i got my fortune read
And here's what the gypsy said
That we'll live and love and share eternity
Bonnie please be nice
We'll find paradise
Beneath the golden skies
Bonnie you're good
Make me if you could
The toast of Hollywood
I'll give you all my love
We'll really live it up
Beneath the stars above
Your silver nights and golden days
I try to reach you in a million ways
I'm crazy 'bout you Bonnie
Can you tell?Embed
