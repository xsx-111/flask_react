Silence Lyrics
Sanctus {Holy}
Exaudi orationem meam {Hear My Prayer}
Ad te omnis {To you all}
Gloria in excelsis Deo {Glory to God in the highest}
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Ad te omnis caro?veniet? {To you all flesh will come}

Et In Terra Pax Hominibus {Peace on earth to all mankind}
Et In Terra Pax Hominibus
Et In Terra Pax Hominibus
Et In Terra Pax Hominibus

Gloria in excelsis Deo {Glory to God in the highest}
Gloria in excelsis DeoÂ…

Give me release, witness me
I am outside, give me peace
Heaven holds a sense of wonder, and I wanted to believe
That I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides
Passion chokes the flower, 'till she cries no more
Possessing all the beauty, hungry still for more
Heaven holds a sense of wonder, and I wanted to believe
That I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides
In this white wave I am sinking, in this silence
In this white wave, in this silence, I believe

Gloria in excelsis Deo {Glory to God in the highest}
Gloria in excelsis Deo
I can't help this longing comfort me
I can't hold it all in, if you won't let me
Heaven holds a sense of wonder, and I wanted to believe
That I'd get caught up when the rage in me subsides
In this white wave I am sinking, in this silence
In this white wave, in this silence, I believe
I have seen you in this white wave you are silent
You are breathing, in this white wave I am free3Embed
