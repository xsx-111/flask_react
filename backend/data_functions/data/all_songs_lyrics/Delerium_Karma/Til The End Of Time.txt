Til The End Of Time Lyrics
The lessons were all learned
My soul has charred, what they burned
'Til the end of time, 'til the end of time
So silence shamed me shame
She brought with her doubt and blame
'Til the end of time, 'til the end of time
'Til the end of time, 'til the end of time

Now it's your turn, to cry spend your life
Wondering, why you knew, you knew
'Til the end of time, 'til the end of time
'Til the end of time, 'til the end of time
