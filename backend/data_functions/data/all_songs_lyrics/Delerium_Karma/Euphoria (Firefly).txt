Euphoria (Firefly) LyricsAnd how I've loved and I have served
And I have sinned but I have learnt
As long as you are true to the life that you live
This is the time to feel love
I feel a stirring deep within, slowly picking up momentum
Like the tide coming in to shore, over and under in its course
This feeling emblazed inside
Every nerve like a firefly
Hovering above me
Glow, glow, glowing, divine
Every nerve like a firefly
Every nerve like a firefly
This feeling emblazed inside
Every nerve like a firefly
I never want to lose what I have finally found
There's a requiem, a new congregation
And it's telling me: Go forward and walk under a brighter sky
Every nerve glowing like a firefly
Every nerve like a firefly
Every nerve like a firefly glowing
I feel a stirring deep within, slowly picking up momentum
Like the tide coming in to shore, over and under in its course
I never want to lose what I have finally found
There's a requiem, a new congregation
And it's telling me: Go forward and walk under a brighter sky
Every nerve glowing like a firefly
Glow, glow, divine
Glow, glow, divine
Every nerve like a firefly glowing
Every nerve like a firefly
Glow, glowEmbed
