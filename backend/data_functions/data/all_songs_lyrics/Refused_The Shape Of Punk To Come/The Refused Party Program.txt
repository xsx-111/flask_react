The Refused Party Program Lyrics
In the wake of our existence, in our parades and in our dances. Touch, see and behold the wisdom of the party program, essential in our lifetime and irresistible in our touch. The great spirits proclaim that capitalism is indeed organised crime and we are all the victims. This next one is called "Refused Party Program"

This is the pulse, this is the sound
This is the beat of a new generation

This is the movement, this is the rhythm
This is the noise of revolution
Yeah, yeah!

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Refused party program
Refused party program
Refused party program
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah!Embed
