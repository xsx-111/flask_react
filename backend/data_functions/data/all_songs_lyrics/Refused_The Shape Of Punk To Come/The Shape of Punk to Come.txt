The Shape of Punk to Come LyricsHey baby, never felt this good
Freedom through the stereo and you wish you could
Take a bite, do a dance, get lost on a crusade
Jump on this soul train for destination unknown
We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I told you so
I told you so
We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
Hey baby, never felt this free
A pair of new shoes and a punk rock show to see
Give acclamation to these blue ribbon babies
And check the calendar for the expiration date
We've all been bitten
We've all been underground
We've all been beaten, battered, bruised
Told to get down
We all been bitten
We all been shut down
We all been beaten, battered, bruised
Told to get down
Down, down, down, down
We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I told you so
I told you so
We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
Adolescent beats with a new thing to see
Smashed guitars just like you've seen on TV
With burning speakers and with flaming hair
We'll have a riot right here
We'll have a riot right hereEmbed
