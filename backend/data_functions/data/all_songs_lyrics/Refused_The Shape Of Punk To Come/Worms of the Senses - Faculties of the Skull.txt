Worms of the Senses / Faculties of the Skull Lyrics
"They told me that the classics never go out of style, but... they do, they do. Somehow, baby? I never thought that... we do too."

I got a bone to pick with capitalism
And a few to break
Grab us by the throat
And shake the life away
Human life is not commodity, figures, statistics or make-believe

And yeah, I like eating excrement, not getting paid for it
Play the guilt, play the fears and play the anxiety
And yeah, I like eating excrement, not getting paid for it
Play the guilt, play the fears and play the anxiety

Seduced by the opportunity and robbed of hope
Alienation is not commodity, figures, statistics or make-believe
Yeah! One more time, oww!
Marginalize away the joy and sell us boredom

And yeah, I like working doing nothing, not making anything
Blame the poor, blame the uneducated and blame the sick
And yeah, I like working doing nothing, not making anything
Blame the poor, blame the uneducated and blame the sick
I got a bone to pick
And a few to break
I got a bone to pick, baby
Yeah!

I took the first bus out of Coca-Cola city
It made me feel all nauseous and shitty
I took the first bus out of Shell town
'Cause they didn't want me hanging around
Yeah! Yeah! I took the first bus
Yeah baby, I took the first bus
I took the first bus out of Coca-Cola city
It made me feel all nauseous and shitty
I took the first bus out of Shell town
'Cause they didn't want me hanging around
Yeah! Yeah! I took the first bus
Let's take the first bus outta here!
Let's take the first bus outta here!
Let's take the first bus outta here!
Let's take the first bus outta here!
Let's take the first bus outta here!
Let's take the first bus outta here!
Let's go!
Yeah!Embed
