The Apollo Programme Was a Hoax Lyrics
Petrol bombs and barricades
Anything to have our say
Consequence of no choice at all
Empires rise and empires fall
Now its time to flip some coins
And it's time to turn some tables

Cause if we have the vision I know that we are able
Suck on my words for a while, choke in the truth of a million dead
There is no prestige in your title, we are after your head
The destruction of everything is the beginning of something new
Your new world is on fire and soon you'll be too

Sabotage will set us free
Throw a rock in the machine
Sabotage will set us free
Throw a rock in the machine
Throw a rock in the machine
Throw a rock in the machineEmbed
