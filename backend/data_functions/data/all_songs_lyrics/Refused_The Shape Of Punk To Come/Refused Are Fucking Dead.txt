Refused Are Fucking Dead LyricsBeyond ability and control
We could be weekend lovers
Steal a sentence and make a catch phrase
Parole for our revolution
Whispered all across the street about the-
About the new cool call
Or screamed at your face
Like a scab's payroll
Faces like angels
Lick our fingertips
We don't have the patience
To deal with it
With battered bodies
And puckered lips
We don't have the patience
To deal with it
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
Faces like angels
Lick our fingertips
We don't have the patience
To deal with it
With battered bodies
And puckered lips
We don't have the patience
To deal with it
Yeah!
Can I get a witness?
Go, this I gotta see
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
One more time for me, go
Can I get a witness?
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
One more time for me, go
We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience
We don't have the patience
Get down
Get down
Listen to him
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable way
A naive young secret for the new romantics
We express ourselves in a loud and fashionable wayEmbed
