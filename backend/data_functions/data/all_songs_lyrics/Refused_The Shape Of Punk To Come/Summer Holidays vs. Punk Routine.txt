Summer Holidays vs. Punk Routine LyricsI'm tired of losing myself to some
Stupid childhood dream of what I could have been
Money proves the point and I'm stuck between
Summer holidays and punk routine
I shoot off a 100 things to remain more sorry than safe, you see
I only get this fucking chance once and I just can't let it be
Well, I'm still certain that what motivates me is more rewarding than any piece of paper could be
Well adjusted and corrupt
All those icons that stole our teenage lust
A scenario of simplicity
A scenario of you and me
A scenario of simplicity
A scenario of you and me
Rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in
Rather be forgotten than remembered
(Than remembered)
For giving in
Rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in
Rather be forgotten than remembered
(Than remembered)
For giving in
We're all tired of dying
So sick of not trying
Scared that we might fail
We'll accomplish nothing
We're all tired of dying
So sick of not trying
Scared that we might fail
We'll accomplish nothing
Not even failure
Not even failure
Not even failure
Not even failure
Rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in
Rather be forgotten than remembered
(Than remembered)
For giving in
Rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in
Rather be forgotten than remembered
(Than remembered)
For giving in
Giving in
Giving in
