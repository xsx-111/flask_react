The Deadly Rhythm LyricsThis union that made us powerless is talking over our heads
Claiming prosperity in a downward spiral plan
Stuck by the deadly rhythm of the production line
Stuck by the deadly rhythm of the production line
This power that made us unionless is taking out of our hands
Cheapest labor at expensive cost, auctioned our lives away
Stuck by the deadly rhythm of the production line
Stuck by the deadly rhythm of the production line
We consume our lives like we are thankful
For what we are being forced into
Is it our duty to die for governments and for gods?
Is it our privilege to slave for market and for industry?
Is it our right to follow laws, set to scare and to oppress?
Is it a gift to stay in line and will it take away the blame?
Can no longer pay the price
We'll get organized!
We'll no longer believe working for you will set us free!
Can no longer pay the price
We'll get organized!
We'll no longer believe working for you will set us free!Embed
