White Whale Lyrics
My mind is on the bad things
Your mind is on the good things
These shadows fall on all things
But your love, it is the lightning
And I need it
And I need it

Your love is like the white whale
My finger's on the third rail
I want you to be okay
I want us to be okay
And I need it
Oh, I need it

Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further


I want us to be okay, okay
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further (And I need it)
Never tell me that we can't go further (Oh, I need it)

Your love is like the white whale
Your love is like the white whale

Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further
Never tell me that we can't go further3Embed
