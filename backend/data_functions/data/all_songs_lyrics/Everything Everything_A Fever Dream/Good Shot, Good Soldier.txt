Good Shot, Good Soldier Lyrics
You're a grown man, you're a good leader
Don't everybody know
What's the right thing, what's the right thing to do?
I'm a police, I'm a policeman
And you're a criminal
We decided, we decided that's that
Do the golf clap for all the right people
They don't know that you laugh
It's a secret, this is why I'm telling you it's all gone
It's all done

If I'm wrong then strike me down
With a bolt from the heavens
With a breath from a holy sigh
If I'm right then light my way
Can you tell me the difference?
Can you see it through all our eyes?
(Wrong then strike me down)

You're a good shot, you're a good soldier
Of all the things to be
We deleted, we deleted your kin
I'mma collect all of these papers
And put them in one place
I'm the richest, I'm the best of the apes
Tell me your truth, tell me a story
And I will follow you
It's a nonsense, this is what I'm telling you, I'm all good
I'm alright, alright?
If I'm wrong then strike me down
With a bolt from the heavens
With a breath from a holy sigh
If I'm right then light my way
Can you tell me the difference?
Can you see it through all our eyes?
If I promise to be good
And split open the grave mouth
Would you take me to paradise?

Maybe the worst is over
Maybe the worst is over
Maybe the worst is over

If I'm wrong then strike me down
With a bolt from the heavens
With a breath from a holy sigh
If I'm right then light my way
Can you tell me the difference?
Can you see it through all our eyes?
If I promise to be good
And split open the grave mouth
Would you take me to paradise?
If my bones just fall away
And my skin is a dust cloud
Would you siphon my soul from air?4Embed
