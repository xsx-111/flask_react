Desire Lyrics
I want this planet and I want it now
To beat like an anvil 'til the poison's out
I am a pencil pusher with the pencil pusher blues
What the hell do I have left to lose?

And I can't stop now
(Can you do the things you dream about?)
I don't know how
(Do you wish to see fire in the clouds?)
It's too late!

Desire, desire, desire
I can't stop now
Desire, desire, desire

I want disaster, I don't want to sleep
It fills my vision, I can hardly speak
I'm just a knuckle-dragger with the knuckle-dragger grin
You took my mind and left a hollow twin

But I'm almost there
(They have different colours of blood)
I don't think so
(They have power like you never could)
It's too late!
Desire, desire, desire
I can't stop now
Desire, desire, desire

Can I tell you that I'm empty?
This is all that I see clearly
Can I tell you that I'm empty?
This is all that I see clearly

Desire, desire, desire
I can't stop now
Desire, desire, desire
I said it's too late!
Desire, desire, desire
I don't know how
Desire, desire, desire

Just let, just let me go
Just let, let me go
Can I tell you that I'm empty?
This is all that I see clear1Embed
