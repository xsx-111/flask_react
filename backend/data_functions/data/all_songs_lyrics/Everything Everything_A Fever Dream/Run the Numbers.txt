Run the Numbers Lyrics
Some folks sleep with their heads on the railway track
Talk about a rat king, talk about slipping through the crack
The corridors of power are echoing with, "Something for everyone!"
Nothing there for you, and there’s nothing there for me
Some fish swim when they don’t know the water from the air
Talk about a dreadnought, talk about a multi-millionaire
You tell me it’ll never work
And I can’t have my cake and be eating it
Well, I don’t want your cake, I never ate it anyway

I don’t need to run the numbers
I don’t care about your numbers
I don’t read the numbers, numbers
I don’t need to run the numbers

'Cause I can feel, 'cause I can feel it and I don’t care
I’ll never care
'Cause I can feel, 'cause I can feel it and I don’t care
I’ll never care about your numbers

Hear that professor? Less of your lip
Give me what I asked for, I don't like the cut of your jib
Tell yourself it’s over soon, and
Something’s gonna drag you away from me
I was in the background, now I'm in your bed
I don’t need to run the numbers
I don’t care about your numbers
I don’t read the numbers, numbers
I don’t need to run the numbers

'Cause I can feel, 'cause I can feel it and I don’t care
I’ll never care
'Cause I can feel, 'cause I can feel it and I don’t care
I’ll never care about your numbers

And I wait, and I wait and it never comes
And I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait and it never comes
And I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait and it never comes
And I wait, and I wait
And I wait, and I wait and it never comes
And I wait, and I wait

I don’t need to run the numbers
I don’t care about your numbers
I don’t read the numbers, numbers
I don't care about your numbers

'Cause I can feel, 'cause I can feel it and I don’t care
I’ll never care
'Cause I can feel, 'cause I can feel it and I don’t care
I’ll never care about your numbers

I don’t need to run the numbers
I don’t care about your numbers
I don’t read the numbers, numbers
I don’t need to run the numbers
I don’t need to run the numbers
I don’t care about your numbers
I don’t read the numbers, numbers
I don’t need to run the numbersEmbed
