Ivory Tower Lyrics
Pin the bunting on the gallows
Dance around it with your blackface on
And we all make a vacuum, we all make a vacuum for this
Throw your keys into the water
Come and crush me in the Waitrose aisle
You can strain 'til your tongue splits, pounding me under your fist

We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
Yeah, I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine
I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine

I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my ivory, ivory, I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory tower

Hey! They did, Joanne
Unscrambling the brain of just a man
It didn't mean a thing, not a thing
All I learned from this
Was how much I can hate the state we're in
Come find me in my tower
Do you know what makes me happy?
When I clothe you in a swarm of bees
And the world is my ashtray, the world is my ashtray tonight
Shave my head and call me monkey
Let me see you with the caps lock on
If we're all apoplectic then I'll be the neckbeard, alright?

We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
We didn't think that it would happen and we never will
Yeah I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine
I can think of nothing else but this, but this machine

I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my ivory, ivory, I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory tower

Hey! They did, Joanne
Unscrambling the brain of just a man
It didn't mean a thing, not a thing
All I learned from this
Was how much I can hate the state we're in
Come find me in my tower
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my ivory, ivory, I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my, ivory, ivory, I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my, ivory, ivory, I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my, ivory, ivory, I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my, ivory, ivory, I'm in
I'm in my ivory tower, I'm in my ivory, ivory
I'm in my, I'm in my, ivory, ivory, I'm inEmbed
