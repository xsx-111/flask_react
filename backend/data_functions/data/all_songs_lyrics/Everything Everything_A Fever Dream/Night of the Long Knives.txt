Night of the Long Knives Lyrics
Hold me on this night of the long knives
Hold me on this night of the long knives

It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood
It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood

There's a flood on the street, there's a tide and it's coming in now
Yet the concrete burns at the back of your skull
And they say it's a wave but it feels like a dribbling mouth
There's a light bulb flicker but it never goes on
Yes, the bomb may be falling, if it lands where you're stood
Man, I know it's a real big shame about your neighbourhood
I'm the wrong kind of people, why'd you listen to me?
Just the island a-breathing in and out and

It was a long time coming
It was a long time coming

It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood
It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood
There's a car overturned and it isn't stopping any time soon
But the front seat sure beats lickin' some toads
And the sparks make the dark uncanny like a living cartoon
What the hell do you mean when you talk about roads?
Yes, the bomb may be falling, if it lands where you're stood
Man, I know it's a real big shame about your neighbourhood
I'm the wrong kind of people, why'd you listen to me?
Just the island a-breathing in and out and

It was a long time coming
It was a long time coming
Shame about your neighbourhood

It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood
It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood

Hold me on this night of the long knives
Hold me on this night of the long knives
(Are you my enemy now?)
I've been dying all my life
I've been dying all my life
I've been dying all my life
I've been dying all my life
It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood
It's coming
Shame about your neighbourhood
It's coming (It was a long time coming)
Shame about your neighbourhood
It's coming (It was a long time coming)
Shame about your neighbourhood
It's comingEmbed
