Merge Lyrics
Stuck
On the fence with you
This I'm always prone to do
Forge something new
And leave it all behind with you
And leave it all behind with you
Back at the front of the lane
I see all those boys again
I shift through you

And leave it all behind, it's true
And leave it all behind, it's trueEmbed
