Shift Lyrics
Baby, I've got silver and I've got gold
But when push comes to shove, this is getting old
I wouldn't have it any other way
No, I wouldn't have it any other way
No, I wouldn't have it any other way
And when you call I'll be there
There
I wouldn't have it any other way
No, I wouldn't have it any other way
No, I wouldn't have it any other way1Embed
