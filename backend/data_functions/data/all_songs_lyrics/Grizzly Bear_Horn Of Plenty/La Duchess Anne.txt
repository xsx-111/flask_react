La Duchess Anne LyricsThe war broke out, and I dropped my camera
Causing the flash to jam
The leopard print, at La Duchess Anne
The fat ten-year old, we had
Serve us dinner, at the caf√© downstairs
The TV was on, we got lots of cold glares
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Even the sex couldn't make up for all the rest
And when we opted to fuck, over watching
Filtered smut on the TV set
I realized I've had it so good
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
And after all the mess I've made this far
I broke the latch inside your favorite, favorite car
And now you have to crawl across the passenger's seat
(Just to get out)
Don't you realize, how good you've had it?
How good I've had it?
How good you've had it?Embed
