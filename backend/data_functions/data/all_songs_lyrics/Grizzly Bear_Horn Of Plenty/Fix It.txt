Fix It Lyrics
My chest hurts a lot tonight
Maybe you can fix that
My chest hurts a lot tonight
I fell on a car again
Maybe you can fix that
I fell on a car again
And when I walk on by, I see you waving

Nothing ever feels the same
Maybe you can fix that
Nothing ever feels the same

Come again all over me
I swear I’ll change just wait and see
And if I don’t please make amends
With everything we had again

I swear it was just a game
I have to fix that
I swear it was just a game

Come again all over me
I swear I’ll change just wait and see
And if I don’t please make amends
With everything we had again
Just fix it for me
Just fix it for me
Just fix it for me3Embed
