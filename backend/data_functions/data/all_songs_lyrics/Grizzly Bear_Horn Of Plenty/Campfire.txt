Campfire LyricsYou made a campfire, I put it out I put it out
Let the long johns, fall down
Around your ankles and your toes
I know what I want to see
Lay there by the fire
By the fire
By the fire
There's a touch of you I think I can see
There's a touch of you I think I can see
By, the campfireEmbed
