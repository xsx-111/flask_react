Deep Sea Diver Lyrics
I'm a deep sea diver with my fins
And underneath your current I do swim
A baker's dozen thirteen pearls
And when I try them on my toes do curl
'Cause you, you got everything that I want
A car, the house, the dog
You got everything that I want

Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while

I'm a deep sea diver losing air
And around you laps I swim but you don't care3Embed
