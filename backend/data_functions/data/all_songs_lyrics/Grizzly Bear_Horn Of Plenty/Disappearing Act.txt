Disappearing Act Lyrics
My lord, the devil carried off my donkey
Deeply, affected by the girl's beauty
Sleeping, dew on the meadows I'm dreaming
This is everything I see
Flight

Nightfall, sunrise is already upon us
Searching, the palace is our only harbor
I have begun to see just what the dream means
And it's everything
Inside


We have seen the end and it's coming
The cave did lead us clearly to something
It is the time to rest our heads downward
To end this quest
