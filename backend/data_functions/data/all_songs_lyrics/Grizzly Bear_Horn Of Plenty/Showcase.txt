Showcase LyricsWhen I came to you I, saw a light of understanding
Maybe, you are only, left with that tree
That tree
Bum, bum, bum, bum
Oh
I have, a lot of things to
Share with you
You
Tonight, tonight, ahh
When you, were the showcase
There was action, all over me
Now that, we are backstage
There's a lot, a lot, a lot of things to referee
To referee
To referee
