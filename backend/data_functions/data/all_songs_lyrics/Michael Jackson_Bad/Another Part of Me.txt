Another Part of Me Lyrics
We're takin' over, we have the truth
This is the mission, to see it through
Don't point your finger, not dangerous
This is our planet, you're one of us

We're sendin' out, a major love
And this is our, message to you (Message to you)
The planets are linin' up, we're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line, waitin' for you, can't you see?
You're just another part of me
Hee-hee!
Ooh!

A revelation, fulfill the truth
The final message, we'll bring to you
There is no danger, fulfill the truth
So come together, we need you

We're sendin' out, a major love
And this is our, message to you (Message to you)
The planets are linin' up, we're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line, waitin' for you, so know the truth
You're just another part of me
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Ooh!
Shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo
Ooh!
Hee-hee-hee!
Ooh!

We're sendin' out, a major love
And this is our, message to you (Message to you)
The planets are linin' up, we're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line, waitin' for you, can't you see?
You're just another part of me
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Another part of me
Ooh!

We're takin' over, hee-hee!
Ooh!
This is the truth, baby, hee!
Another part of me
