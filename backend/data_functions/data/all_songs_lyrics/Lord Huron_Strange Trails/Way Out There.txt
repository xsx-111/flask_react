Way Out There Lyrics
I'm a long way from the land that I left
I've been running through life and cruising toward death
If you think that I'm scared you've got me wrong
If you don't know my name, you'll know it now
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs

I'm a long way from the one that I loved
I've been tending old flames, lamenting what was
Drifting in a land that time forgot
If you think that I've changed, you know me not
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
I been unraveling since my birth
Gonna wander out there and see what I'm worth

Follow me  way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you to who knows where
If I found a way to stay with you tonight
It would only make me late, for a date I can't escape
Follow me way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you to who knows where
If I found a way to stay with you tonight
It would only make me late, for a date I can't escape1Embed
