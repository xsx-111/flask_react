The World Ender Lyrics
I had a name, but they took it from me
I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place where I lay my head
They burnt it to the ground and the sky turned red
I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet-talkin’ wife and a beautiful girl
I know I’m never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up until I have my revenge
They took my life, but it isn’t the end
They put me in the ground, but I’m back from the dead
I'm the World Ender, baby, and I'm coming for them
They put me in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
I'm the World Ender, baby, and I'm coming for them
They put me in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
You'll hear me howl by the light of the moon
That's how you'll know that I'm coming for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
When the World Ender comes, better run for your life
I’ll never bleed and I won’t ever age
I’ll never feel the embrace of the grave
The fair and the brave and the good must die
I seen the other side of living, I know heaven's a lie
I’ll tear through the night and I'll raise some hell
Cause I'm the World Ender, baby, and I'm back from the dead
Lord knows I should be pushing up daisies
I was six feet down, but something raised me up
Sent back for to lift my curse
I’m gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Untied, gonna get little wild
Go screaming through the dark like a demon child
Close your eyes now, the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder, baby
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m back from the grave
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m coming for them
They put me in the ground, but I’m back from the dead
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m back from the dead
They can run for their lives but they cannot be saved
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m coming for them
They put me in the ground, but I’m back from the dead
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m back from the dead
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I’m the World Ender, baby, and I’m coming for them
They put me in the ground, but I’m back from the dead3Embed
