Frozen Pines Lyrics
Deep into the night
With the moonlight as my guide
I will wander through the pines
And make my way to nature's shrines
And I look up to the sky
And I know you're still alive
But I wonder where you are
I call your name into the dark

I wake up in the morning, oh, and I don't know where I've been
All alone on a mountainside and huddled in the wind

And it feels like I've been away for an era
But nothing has changed at all
And it feels like I've been with you
But, oh, what did you you do and where have you gone?

On the night you disappeared
Oh, if I had seen you clear
But the strange light in the sky
Was shining right into my eyes
There was no one else in sight
Just the endless frozen pines
But I wonder how they know
'Cause they don't die, if they don't grow

I am ready to follow you even though I don't know where
I've been waiting the night until you decide to take me there

'Cause I know I don't wanna stay here forever
It's gotta be moving on
Oh, I don't wanna be the only one living
If all of my friends are gone

I will be waiting for you on the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through, there's another light beyond the lie
I will be waiting for you on the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through, there's another life beyond the lie4Embed
