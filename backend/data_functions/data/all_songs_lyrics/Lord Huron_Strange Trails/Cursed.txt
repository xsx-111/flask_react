Cursed Lyrics
What I remember the most is hollering her name
And the sirens wail as we ran like hell down a strange trail
Oh, I wanna know what I did, I wanna know her game
I wanna learn her wits and how she plays her tricks
Oh, I gotta know

Lots of booze and her kiss, these are drugs that do not mix
I was under her spell and today I feel like hell
She got me going, I guess, but who knew love would be like this?
Don't know what I'm gonna do, but I guess I gotta see it through

'Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
Don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
Don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
Don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me

I gotta find me a cure
I gotta clear my name
There's gotta be some way
I hope it's not too late
To break the spell
Yeah
I want to get her alone
I want to ask her why
And look into those eyes
And see the endless night
Staring back

What kind of magic is this? I was doomed by our first kiss
Just a pawn in her game, I've done things that have no name
And she'll make me do worse, if the law doesn't get me first
She has turned my heart black and I know I can't turn back

There are runes on my skin, they appear when she walks in
I am bound by her spell, I am chained to do her will
I'm a goner, I guess, who knew love was gonna be like this?
She has cloaked me in black and there ain't no turning back

I don't know how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
I don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
I don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
I don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me
That girl has laid a curse on me7Embed
