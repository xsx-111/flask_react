The Yawning Grave Lyrics
I know the rain like the clouds know the sky
I speak to birds and tell them where to fly
I sing the songs that you hear on the breeze
I write the names of the rocks and the trees

Oh, you fool, there are rules I am coming for you
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins

I tried to warn you when you were a child
I told you not to get lost in the wild
I sent you omens and all kinds of signs
I taught you melodies, poems, and rhymes

Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
(You can run but you can't escape)
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins
(You will open the yawning grave)

Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
(You can run but you can't escape)
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins
(You will open the yawning grave)1Embed
