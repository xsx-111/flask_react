Until the Night Turns Lyrics
I had a vision tonight that the world was ending
Yeah, the sky was falling and time was bending
I watched the heavens collide right before my eyes

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

I had a visitor come from the great beyond
And telling me our time that the world is done
And to watch for a sign in the midnight sky

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

We wait for the sunrise
We watch as the world dies
We howl in the moonlight
When the World Ender comes, baby, don't close your eyes
We wait for the sunrise
We wait for the sunrise

I had a vision tonight that the world was ending
Yeah the sky was falling and time was bending
We spent our last night in the moonlight
Baby, it's so bright— we'll be up all night

I got a helluva view for the end of the world
I've got a bottle of booze and a beautiful girl
If I'm a-goin' to die, I'm gonna go in style

Yeah, what if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day
What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby, it's all right— we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going till the night turns into the day

Yeah, we going till the night turns into the day
Yeah, we going till the night turns into the day
Yeah, we going till the night turns into the day
Yeah, we keep it going till the night turns into the day4Embed
