Bye Bye Blues LyricsBye, bye blues, bye, bye blues
Bells ring, birds sing
That old sun is shining
Ain't gonna be no more pining
Just, just sweet tune, smiling through
Don't sigh, honey don't cry, bye, bye blues
Just we two, I said
We're gonna be smiling through
Aah don't sigh, honey don't you dare cry
Just say bye, say bye blues, byeeeee bluesEmbed
