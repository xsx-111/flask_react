Master Of My Craft Lyrics
I got a gold medal, record time, gold record, diamond mines
Name's in print, tongue, t-shirts and minds
Thread counts high and commissions high
Hourly rates high, a minute of your time?
Forget about it
I didn't come here to dream or teach the world things
Define paradigms or curate no living days
With high thread counts and staircases high
Hourly rates high, a minute of your time?
Forget about it

I mastered my craft
I mastered my craft

The thread counts high and commissions high
Hourly rates high, a minute of your time?
Forget about it
Yeah, people die, I don't care
You should see the wall of ambivalence I'm building
I got no love for the living
With my thread counts high and commissions high
Hourly rates high, a minute of your time?
Forget about it
Death to all false profits
Around here we praise a dollar, you fuckin' hippie
Wanna walk around in my shoes and tell me how it feels?
So I have thread counts high and commissions high
Hourly rates high, a minute of your time?
Forget about it
I mastered my craft
From the hands of my mother, said I mastered my craft

The thread counts high and commissions high
Hourly rates high, a minute of your time?
Socrates died in the fucking gutter
