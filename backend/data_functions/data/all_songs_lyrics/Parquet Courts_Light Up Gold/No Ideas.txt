No Ideas Lyrics
What could I even say to you, René?
I could stop reacting then
I'd be acting like your fool because
What could I even say to you, René?
I could follow you but then you'd
Never see me right behind you

I went to a shrink
And he found my brain
And I had no ideas is what he found
I went to a shrink
And he found my brain
And I had no ideas is what he found
No ideas is what he found
No ideas, shh

What could I even say to you, René?
I could meditate and sleep all day but
I'd never know what the first step to take was
What could I even say to you, René?
Are we candles, or are we wax?
And with facts like that, I'll never know how to relax
I went to a shrink
And he found my brain
And I had no ideas is what he found
I went to a shrink
And he found my brain
And I had no ideas is what he found
No ideas is what he found
No ideas, shhEmbed
