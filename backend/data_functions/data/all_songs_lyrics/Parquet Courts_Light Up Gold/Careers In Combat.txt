Careers In Combat Lyrics
There are no more summer lifeguard jobs
There are no more art museums to guard
The lab is out of white lab coats
'Cause there are no more slides and microscopes

But there are still careers in combat, my son
There are still careers in combat, my son

There are no more roles on TV shows
There are no road-cone dispensing jobs
There are no spots left for park ranger
'Cause there are no bears left to save you from

But there are still careers in combat, my son
There are still careers in combat, my sonEmbed
