Yr No Stoner Lyrics
Two young fingers in wet cement
New impression built in front of my apartment
B.G. and E.E., that's so sweet
I wonder what E's gonna say when she sees
It's a pretty far walk to the DMV

Storm-chasin' hippies at a discount mall
Megaphone muppet poster on the wall
Speaking in stones like we've never heard before
You take the risk, I'll get the reward
I don't know too much, I just got the keys

There's billionaire buses on my unlit street
Hey, who's that walkin' up? That looks like E
Let's hide in the bushes so that we can hear her say
"Who would build a monument for me anyway?"
That's B, B.G., he'll build it for you, babe
You know B.G., he'll give you what you needEmbed
