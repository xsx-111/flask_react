Borrowed Time Lyrics
I was feeling nostalgic
For the days when my thoughts dripped
On to my head from the ceiling
I remember the feeling
Of the museless existence
Of the drunk, bored, and listless
Endless waiting for something
That I knew wasn't coming

And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this

I was up to my neck in
Motivation neglect when
I felt soft waves of purpose
Crashing onto the surface
I was feeling nostalgic
For the days when my thoughts dripped
On to my head from the ceiling
I remember the feeling
And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this


And it seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this borrowed time
Seems these days I'm captive in this4Embed
