Yonder Is Closer to the Heart Lyrics
Pocket contents: Rizla pack
Spare change, receipts in wads
Stacked in camps across my desk
Each day, another pile
Time was measured in balls of lint
Laundry claim tags and number of cents
It takes to drown your brain into
A just-dowsed former fire

Coffee breaks and lamb's tail shakes
Aren't arbitrary marks
Paycheck stubs, good sex and drugs
Can fade away distraction of the
Mantras of "Keep going" that
Are lodged into my thoughts
They replay on days when
Yonder is closer to the heart

This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
Pocket contents: Rizla pack
Spare change, receipts in wads
Stacked in camps across my desk
Each day, another pile
Time was measured in balls of lint
Laundry claim tags and number of cents
It takes to drown your brain into
A just-dowsed former fire

This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
This thickness is just
Enough to wade through

Coffee breaks and lamb's tail shakes
Aren't arbitrary marks
Paycheck stubs, good sex and drugs
Can fade away distraction of the
Mantras of "Keep going" that
Are lodged into my thoughts
They replay on days when
Yonder is closer to the heart
This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
This thickness is just
Enough to wade through
This thickness was just
Enough to wade throughEmbed
