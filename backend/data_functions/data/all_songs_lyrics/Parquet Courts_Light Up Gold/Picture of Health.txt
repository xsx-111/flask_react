Picture of Health Lyrics
My last guilt-themed solicitation
Delivered slowly in hesitation
It could not soothe me, could not seduce me
Into repainting each stroke so loosely
How I remember my ex-blue t-shirt
Where the hole in it fell

Plain-dressed, wilting and wired
You were the picture of health

Wine glass drowning, postponed narration
Make every new drag no mere frustration
I fell in debt to those country crooners
Mourning lost love like Spanish funerals
Dye the gray hair you grew in secret
To a root-colored shell

Frozen mid-sentenced smile
You were the picture of health
No prognosis implied
You were the picture of health
Plain-dressed, wilting and wired
You were the picture of healthEmbed
