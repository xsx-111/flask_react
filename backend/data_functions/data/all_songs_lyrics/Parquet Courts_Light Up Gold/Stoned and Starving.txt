Stoned and Starving Lyrics
I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
I was flipping through magazines
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving
Well, I was reading ingredients
Asking myself, "Should I eat this?"
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving
I was scratching off silver ink
I was deciding what to drink
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving
And I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
And I was flipping through magazines
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving

Well, I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
I was flipping through magazines
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving
But I was debating Swedish Fish
Roasted peanuts or licorice
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving
But I was holding some wadded bills
I was reading that smoking kills
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving
And I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens
But I was flipping through magazines
I was so (Stoned and starving)
So stoned and starving4Embed
