Light Up Gold II Lyrics
Twice an era comes a knock at my door
Suspended in a window-crashing gaze of a poor
Spark of recognition, it's the thrill that dies first but
I can think of something worse: the curse, because

Light up gold was the colour of something I
Was looking for
Light up gold was the colour of something I
Was looking for

Steady was the pace kept in that tear-leaking sway
Sifting like a miner in the conscience debris
Hunched down, gleaning embers from a burning field
Trying to find something warm and real because

Light up gold was the colour of something I
Was looking for
Light up gold was the colour of something I
Was looking for

Yeah, light up gold was the colour of something I
Was looking for
Light up gold was the colour of something I
Was looking forEmbed
