Tears O Plenty Lyrics
I drank right from your tears of plenty and
I exchanged all the gifts you sent me
Dreary beats over fast-rapped verses
Leaked through windows in hatchback hearses

Snackers conference at the buffet table
Double dip in the goose pâté mould
Posthumous pranks left in the casket
Plain Jane shining in her spotlight moment

She lived for the same moments we did
Morning coffee, refilled and endless
He stumbled into some dinero
Weeping at the wake like a Catholic heroEmbed
