Caster of Worthless Spells Lyrics
We measured the distance
Of the space between islands
Gazing out into the River Styx, she said
"It's no river at all, it's a tidal estuary"
Was her only line, she delivered it well

Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells

They called it the pyrex age
The glass dawn of our thought process
Later to be chronicled in violent history books
"You Suffer" on karaoke
'Cause there was no English translation for hell

Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells2Embed
