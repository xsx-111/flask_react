Disney P.T. Lyrics
My girl is a bowl of hash
A familiar looking rash
My girl's my secret stash
A shampooed pile of trash
My girl's a borealis-lit fjord
My girl's a summons ignored
My girl's a beer, freshly poured
A lost tribe's library stored

You've been getting lots of similes
But I want your disease
I want your disease
I want your disease

My girl is off-track betting
My girl is a traffic light
My girl is an unmade bed
My girl is a moonless night
My girl is choppy air
My girl is a Golden Corral
My girl is a curse word screamed
My girl is not their scene
You've been getting lots of similes
And I want your disease
I want your disease
I want your1Embed
