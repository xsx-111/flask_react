Positivity Lyrics
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?

Is that a good man
Walking down that street with that money in his hand
Is that a good man?
Why do you dog him
If that was your father, tell me, would you dog him then
Would you dog him?

Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?

Is that all your gold?
Where did it come from? What did you have to do?
Can you sleep nights?
Do you dream straight up or do you dream in W's?
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you lat

Na na na na na na, so slow
Positivity (Yes)
Na na na na na na, so slow

Can a boy who drops out at school
At 13 years of age
Answer to of life and death
When it slaps him in the face?
Who's to blame when he's got no place to go
And all he's got is the sense to know
That a life of crime'll help him beat You in the race
Help him beat you in the race (Help him beat you in the race)
Positivity

Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?
Na na na na na na, so slow
Positivity (Yes!)
Na na na na na na, so slow

Wave your hands for positivity y'all!
All the boys and all the girls
You are the new kings of the world!
Shall the court sing together
"In every man's life there will be a hang-up
A whirlwind designed to slow you down
It cuts like a knife and tries to get in you
This Spooky Electric sound
Give up if you want to and all is lost
Spooky Electric will be your boss"

Call People magazine, Rolling Stone
Call your next of kin, cause your ass is gone
He's got a 57 mag with the price tag still on the side
Cuzzin when Spooky say dead, you better say died
Or you can fly high right by Spooky and all that he crawls for
Spooky and all that he crawls for
Don't kiss the beast
We need love and honesty, peace and harmony
Positivity
Love and honesty, peace and harmony
I said, hold on to your soul, you got a long way to go
Don't kiss the beast
Be superior at least
Hold on to your soul, y'all, court, sing
Hold on to your soul, we got a long way to go
Hold on to your soulEmbed
