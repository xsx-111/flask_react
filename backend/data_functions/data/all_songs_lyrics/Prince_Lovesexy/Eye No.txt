Eye No Lyrics
Rain is wet, and sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, and stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows
When love calls, you got to go

Listen, the soul of this song belongs to God
Welcome to the New Power Generation
The reason my voice is so clear
Is there's no smack in my brain
Hundalasiliah

I know there is a heaven, I know there is a hell
Listen to me people, I got a story to tell
I know there was confusion lightning all around me
That's when I called his name don't you know he found me

No! Is what Spooky Electric say, it's not OK
But I know love is the only way till my dying day
No - 'til my dying day I'll be OK
Cause Lovesexy is the one til my day is done
Hundalasiliah
I know there is a devil because he talks so loud
He makes you do things that your friends do, hang out with the crowd
But my Lord he is so quiet when He calls your name
When you hear it your heart will thunder
You will wan'na hear it every day

No! Is what Spooky Electric say, it's not OK
But I know love is the only way till my dying day
No - til my dying day I'll be OK
Cause Lovesexy is the one til my day is done
Hundalasiliah

Alright y'all, everybody in the house (serve it up, Frankie)
Here's what I want you to do
Raise your hand up, straight in the air
Swing it to the right, savoir faire
Up on the two, swing on the four
Everybody on the dancefloor

Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho
Sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho, sha-ho
Y'all ain't got it together
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead
Raise your hand up, straight in the air
(Let's get it up)
(Let's get it up)
Say no
(say no) No - if you can't find your way - everybody say
(say no) No - if you're afraid, everybody ain't got it made
(Say no) - if you want a drug other than the God above
No - if you need a drink every single day
Blow that devil away!

Say yes
Yes - if you want this feeling called love
Yes - if you want it now raise your hand you the man above
(Yes) Up on the two, swing right on the four
We want everybody to open this door!

Say no - if you don't want to live life under the gun
(I know) We know a better way to have some fun
(I know) I know - there is a heaven and a hell
I know there is a heaven and a hell

Tell you what
Man, are we on the guest list?
Guest list? Guest list?
I don't see no 5 dollars you owe
I'm going to go to the car
I'm going home
I'm going to have one of them sandwiches
Sandwich, that's right
I need the green three sheets
That's right. (that's what I'm talking about)
A peanut-butter sandwich (her and her girlfriend)
The one that was standing
Right next to my woman
Right next to my woman
Let us praise God
With the fruit of the vine (My name's Andre Crabtree III)
Our  symbol of glory (I've got more holes than a golf course)
And thank him for lessons
Of the past, for life, prince
I said who popped the question?1Embed
