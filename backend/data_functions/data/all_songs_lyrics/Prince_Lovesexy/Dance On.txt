Dance On Lyrics
Oh, pick it up!
There's a bass guitar in this
Grenade Launcher roars in a television sky
Tell me how many young brothers must die

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

Little Talk Johnny blew the big score
The gang nailed his feet to a wooden floor
Nuclear Ban never stays in tune
They all know the words but the music is doomed

Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

A bass guitar in spider webs, longing for the funk
Uzi gun takes his place in a wagon trunk
(get off me, punk, you ain't sexy)
Stealing ladies purses then setting them a'flame
M&M killers playing Mickey Mouse games
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

It's time for new education
The former rules don't apply
We need a power structure that breeds production
Instead of jacks who vandalize
Detroit - what's happening?

What color is your money today?
Get your money straight
Everybody dance onEmbed
