Alphabet St. Lyrics
I'm going down
To Alphabet Street
I'm gonna crown
The first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Yes, she will
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird
(My daddy's Thunderbird)
A white rad ride, '66 ('67)
So glam, it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Mmm-mmm
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Tennessee
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Drive her
Excuse me, baby
I don't mean to be rude
But I guess tonight, I'm just not
I'm just not in the mood
So if you don't mind (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I would like to watch

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Ow!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Ow!
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

We're going down, down, down
If that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world
Hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together
And make a better day

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Better days
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, it's the only way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cat, we need you to rap
Cat, we need you to rap
Don't give it to us slow
'Cause if we know, you know
New Power Soul
Got to, got to, got to go!

Talk to me, lover
Come on, tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you
Life is too good to waste? (Put your love down)
Did she tell you Lovesexy
Was the glam of them all?
You can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall (Put your love down)
No side effects, the feeling lasts forever
Straight up, it tastes good
It makes you feel clever (Put your love down)
You kiss your enemies
Like you know you should
Then you jerk your body like
A horny pony would (Put your love down)
You jerk your body like
A horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!
And while you're at it
Tell your papa about this!
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there

Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love, Lovesexy
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
A, B, C, D, E, F, H
I love youEmbed
