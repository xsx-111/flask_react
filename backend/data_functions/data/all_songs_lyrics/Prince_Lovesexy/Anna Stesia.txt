Anna Stesia Lyrics
Have you ever been so lonely
That you felt like you were the only one in this world?
Have you ever wanted to play with someone so much
You'd take any one boy or girl?

Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Between white and black, night and day
Black night seemed like the only way
So I danced
Music late, nothing great
No way to differentiate
I took a chance

Gregory looks just like a ghost
And then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips to say
"We could live for a little while
If you could just learn to smile
You and I could fly away, fly away"
Yeah...
Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn to love
I mean the right way, I mean the only way
Perhaps  could show me, baby


Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind

You
Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn to love
Ah, if I was just closer to somethin'
Closer to your higher self? I don't know
Closer to heaven? Maybe
Closer to God, yeah, closer to God

Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
How could I forget you are the rule
You are my God
I am Your child, oh yes I am your child
From now on, I shall be wild
I shall be quick, I shall be strong
I'll tell Your story no matter how long
No matter, no matter, yeah
We're just a play in your master plan
Now, my Lord, I understand

Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above1Embed
