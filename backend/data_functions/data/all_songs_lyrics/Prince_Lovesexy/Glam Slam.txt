Glam Slam Lyrics
This thing we got, it's alive
It seems to transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

I know I hold you too tight
(Too tight)
But I just can't seem to get close enough
(I want to hold you)
I want to hold you every night
I'm so horny and you're the stuff

Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay
Heavy feather, flicka nipple
Baby scram water ripple
(I don't understand)
It means I love you
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
You go for me and I come again
Glam Slam, thank you ma'am
Sun is risen, moon is gone
Soda fizzing on the lawn
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
Glam Slam

Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

This thing we got, it's alive
It seems to transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay
Glam Slam
You will always stay
You will always stay
It's all right, it's OK3Embed
