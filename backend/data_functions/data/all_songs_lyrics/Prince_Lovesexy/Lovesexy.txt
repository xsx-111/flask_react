Lovesexy Lyrics
New Power, New Power, give it to me
Oh, it need some bottom in here
Lay it on me

Everybody on the block say it is the best
The most vital is what they say, more or less
It put my name upon my thigh
It makes me dance, It makes me cry
And when I touch it race cars burn rubber in my pants

This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it, I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Dig me now
Anyone that's ever touched it
They don't want anything else (no they don't)
And I got to tell the world
I just can't keep it to myself
All in life becomes easier
No question is unresolved
And I'm not afraid
Come on and touch it, I know you will love it
With it I know that heaven's a butterfly kiss away
This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it - I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

Lovesexy
Lovesexy
Rain is wet, sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows (Lovesexy)
When love calls, you got to go
Lovesexy

Tonight we make love with only words
Girls first, girls first
OK so like first I would start by telling you how
Smart and intelligent the curve your behind is
And then I can tell you that I can just smell you
And race cars burn rubber in my pants
But I really dig tripping on the thought of
Being caught by someone with your beauty, style, and grace
Baby I don't care I would rip out my hair
For just two nights with your face
I don't want to make love to you
I just want to look at you
I just want to listen to you
Oh, pretty little whip, you got me dripping
Dripping all over the floor, the floor
If I come back as a woman, I want a body like yours
A body like yours
Living rooms
I think, I think you would
I think you want to play house
Yeah, I think you want to play house
(Lovesexy)

You don't mind
I think you
I think you want me to (beep) inside of you
You want (Lovesexy) me to suck around your living room
Ha Ha
Yeah, you
You want me to walk right down your halls
Mmm hmmm
(Lovesexy)

You want me to swivel in your love seat
Don't you baby?
You want me to write my name on your walls
You want me to write my name
Lovesexy
We make love with only words
I'll make love to you, tomorrow
Sweet dreamsEmbed
