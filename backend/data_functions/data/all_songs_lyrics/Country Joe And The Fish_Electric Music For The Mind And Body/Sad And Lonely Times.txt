Sad And Lonely Times LyricsMcDonald
My love stands beside me
Through the rain, through the wind and the snow
Through the bad and the good you know it's I love the girl
Always understood that she's my love Always understood
This I know, this I know. Now this I know, this I know
So long sad and lonesome times
So long lonely days
So long sad and lonesome times
Got my love here to show me the way
My love stands beside me I can't seem to find the words
Through the rain, through the wind and the snow To tell you how I care
Through the bad and the good you know it's But I want you and I
Always understood that she's my love, this I know. Trust you and I love you, this I know
And I want you and it's
And I want you and I
Always understood that she's my love
Trust you and I love you, this I know
This I know, this I knowEmbed
