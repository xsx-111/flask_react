Love LyricsOh, c'mon
Well, now deep in my heart baby I know that you care
Deep in my heart, babe, the feeling is there
'Cause I got something money can't buy
I got something that you oughta try
I got love, love, I said love, sweet love
I got love, baby, yeah!
Well I can tell by your smile what you want to do
See it in your eyes you got the feeling, too
Come on, baby, it's time to move
'Cause I've got something that's a stone groove
I got love, love, I said love,sweet love
I got love baby
Well, now deep in my heart baby I know that you care
Deep in my heart, babe, the feeling is there
'Cause I got something money can't buy
I got something that you oughta try
I got love, love, I said love, sweet love
I got love, baby, yeah!Embed
