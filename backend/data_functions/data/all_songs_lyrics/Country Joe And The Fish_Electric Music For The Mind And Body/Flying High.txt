Flying High LyricsI was stuck on an LA freeway
Got rainwater in my boots
My thumbs done froze, can't feel my toes
I'm feeling a little thirsty, too
Wheels throwin' water all over my axe
And Mr. Jones won't lend me a hand
Up come two cats in a Cadillac
And they say won't you hop in, man
I went flying high
All the way
All the way
The one that's driving has got a Bowler hat
The other's got a Fez on his head
They turn around and grin and I grin back
But not a word was said
So I took out my harp and I played 'em a tune
I could see they were diggin' it
Then the one with the Fez, well he turns and he says
We'd like to help you make your trip
And I went flying high
All the way
All the way
He said we can't leave him out in the rain
He just might freeze and die
So, why not put him on a plane
And send him home in the sky
So, they took me to the LA airport
Laid twenty dollars in my hand
Well, I paid my fare, I'm in the air
Flyin' back home again
And I went flying high
All the way
Yah, all the way
All the way
You know I went flying high
All the way1Embed
