Grace LyricsMcDonald
One, two, three, four
Cold rain to splash water diamonds colored green and
Flash the sun to paint green her hair
Cold rain to splash water diamonds colored green and
Flash the sun to paint green her hair
Your silver streak flash
Your silver streak flash
Your silver streak flash
Across the tiny door of my eye
Across the tiny door of my eye
Warm wind to touch the trees colored blue and
Flash the moon to paint blue my heart
Warm wind to touch the trees colored blue and
Flash the moon to paint blue my heart
Your silver streak flash
Your silver streak flash
Your silver streak flash
Across the tiny door of my eye
Across the tiny door of my eye
Soft skin to spend the every day colored gold and
Flash the sea to paint gold our love
Soft skin to spend the every day colored gold and
Flash the sea to paint gold our love
Your silver streak flash
Your silver streak flash
Your silver streak flash
Across the tiny door of my eye
Across the tiny door of my eye
I love you
I love you
I love youEmbed
