Bass Strings LyricsHey partner, won't you pass that reefer round
My world is spinnin', yeah, just got to slow it down
Oh, yes you know I've sure got to slow it down
Get so high this time that you know
I'll never come down, I'll never come down
I believe I'll go out to the seashore, let the waves wash my mind
Open up my head now just to see what I can find
Oh, yes you know I'm gonna see what I can find
Just one more trip now, you know I'll stay high
All the time, all the time
Yes, I'll go out to the desert just to try and find my past
Truth lives all around me, but it's just beyond my grasp
Oh, yes you know it's just beyond my grasp
I'll let the sand and the stars and the wind
Carry me back, oh carry me back
