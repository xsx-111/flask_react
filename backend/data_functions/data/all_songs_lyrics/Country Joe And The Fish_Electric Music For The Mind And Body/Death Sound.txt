Death Sound LyricsI hear that death sound, baby
Oh, like an echo in my brain
I hear that death sound, baby
Oh, like an echo in my brain, brain
Well, there's a part of us dying
You know that things will never be the same
Ah, never be the same!
I feel the black nails a-poundin' now
Yes, into the coffin of our love
Hear the black nails a-poundin' now
Yes, into the coffin of our love
Well, like a black shrouded hunter now
Don't you know that I have killed a snow white dove
Oh, I've killed the dove
Well, the time sands keep a-fallin' now
On towards our ending day
Yeah, the time sands keep a-fallin'
Towards our ending day
I see the minutes chasing the hours
Yes, to the words that we should say
Ah we should sayEmbed
