Superbird LyricsLook, up yonder in the sky, now, what is that I pray?
It's a bird it's a plane, it's a man insane, it's my President LBJ
He's flying high way up in the sky just like Superman
But I have got a little piece of kryptonite
Yes, I'll bring him back to land
Said come out Lyndon with your hands held high
Drop your guns, baby, and reach for the sky
I've got you surrounded and you ain't got a chance
Gonna send you back to Texas, make you work on your ranch
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
He can call Super Woman and his Super Dogs
But it sure won't do him no good
Yeah, I found out why from a Russian spy
That he ain't nothing but a comic book
We'll pull him off the stands and clean up the land
Yes, we'll have us a brand new day
What is more I got the Fantastic Four
And Doctor Strange to help him on his way
Said come out Lyndon with your hands held high
Drop your guns, baby, and reach for the sky
We got you surrounded and you ain't got a chance
Gonna send you back to Texas make you work on your ranch
Yeah yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, gonna make him eat flowers
Yeah, make him drop some acid ...1Embed
