Supremacy Lyrics

Wake to see - your true emancipation is a fantasy
Policies have risen up and overcome the brave
Greatness dies, unsung and lost, invisible to history
Embedded spies brainwashing our children to be mean

You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy...
Your supremacy


You don't have long
I am on to you
The time, it has come to destroy...
Your supremacy
