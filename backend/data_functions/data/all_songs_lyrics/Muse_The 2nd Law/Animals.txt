Animals Lyrics
Animal
You’re an animal
Don’t take anything less
Out of control
You’re out of control
Strike those in distress

Advertise
Expand
Bend more rules
Buy yourself an island

Animals
We’re animals
Buy when blood is on the street
Out of control
We’re out of control
Crush those who beg at your feet

Analyse
Franchise
Spread out
Kill the competition
And buy yourself an ocean
Amortise
Downsize
Lay off
Kill yourself
Come on and do us all a favour
