Follow Me Lyrics
When darkness falls
And surrounds you
When you fall down
When you're scared and you're lost
Be brave
I'm coming to hold you now
When all your strength has gone
And you feel wrong
Like your life has slipped away
Follow me
You can follow me
And I, I will not desert you now
When your fire has died out
No one's there
They have left you for dead

Follow me
You can follow me
I will keep you safe
Follow me, you can follow me
I will protect you

Oh, I won't let them hurt
Hurting you, oh yeah
When your heart is breaking
You can follow me
You can follow me
I will always keep you safe
Follow me, you can trust in me
I will always protect you my love

Oh, feel my love
Oh, feel my love
Ohhh8Embed
