Big Freeze Lyrics
Healed (healed), or are you still just reeling?
Are you fine (fine), have you found a way to escape?
Are you here (here) just because I need you?
Can we hole up? A big freeze is heading our way

We are hiding to nowhere
We still hope (hope), but our dreams are not the same, no
And I, I lost before I started
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Heal me - what words just can't convey
Feel me - don't let the sun in your heart decay

Fight (fight), or will you show me mercy? (mercy)
We've expelled (expelled) the goodness from our hearts (hearts)
Are you here (here) just to prove you're winning? (winning)
Can you hole up, and ride out this electrical storm?

We destroyed something beautiful
We have faith (faith), but our truths are not the same, no
Don't give up (up), don't let the magic leave us (leave us)
Stop the loneliest force becoming king of the universe
Heal me - what words just can't convey
Feel me - don't let the sun in your heart decay


Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas

Heal me - what words just can't convey
Feel me - don't let the sun in our hearts decay4Embed
