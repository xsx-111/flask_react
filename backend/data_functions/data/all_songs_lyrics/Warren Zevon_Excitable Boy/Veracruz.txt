Veracruz Lyrics
I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns
I heard Maria crying
Late last night I heard the news
That Veracruz was dying
Veracruz was dying

Someone called Maria's name
I swear it was my father's voice
Saying, "If you stay you'll all be slain
You must leave now, you have no choice"
Take the servants and ride west
Keep the child close to your chest
When the American troops withdraw
Let Zapata take the rest

I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns
I heard Maria calling
Veracruz is dying
And Cuernavaca's fallen

Aquel día yo jure
Hacia el puerto volveré
Aunque el destino cambio mi vida
En Veracruz moriré
Aquel día yo jure
I heard Woodrow Wilson's guns
I heard them in the harbor
Saying Veracruz was dying1Embed
