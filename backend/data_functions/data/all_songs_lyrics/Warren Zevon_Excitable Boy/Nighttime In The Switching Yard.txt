Nighttime In The Switching Yard Lyrics
Nighttime in the switching yard
Nighttime in the switching yard
Nighttime in the switching yard
Nighttime in the switching yard

Get it out on the mainline
Listen to the rhythm of the train go by
Get it out on the mainline
Listen to the rhythm of the train go by
Listen to the train whistle whine
Listen to the train whistle whine

Nighttime in the switching yard
Nighttime in the switching yard
Nighttime in the switching yard
Nighttime in the switching yard


See that train
See that train
See that train
See that train
See that train, the midnight train runs both ways
See that train, the midnight train runs both ways
See that train, the midnight train runs both ways
See that train, the midnight train runs both ways
Nighttime in the switching yard
Nighttime in the switching yard

Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada
Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada
Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada
Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada
Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada
Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada
Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada
Doot dat, doot dat, doot dada

Listen to the train whistle whine
Listen to the train whistle whine
Listen to the train whistle whine
Listen to the train whistle whine
Listen to the train
Listen to the train
Listen to the train
Listen to the trackEmbed
