Johnny Strikes Up the Band Lyrics
Dry your eyes, my little friend
Let me take you by the hand
Freddie gettin' ready, rock steady
When Johnny strikes up the band
They'll be rockin' in the projects
Walkin' down along the Strand
Freddie gettin' ready, rock steady
When Johnny strikes up the band

Johnny strikes up the band
When Johnny strikes up the—
When Johnny strikes up the—
When Johnny strikes up the band


And Johnny is my main man
He's the keeper of the keys
He'll put your mind at ease
He's guaranteed to please
Back by popular demand
Look around, my little friend
Jubilation in the land
Freddie gettin' ready, rock steady
When Johnny strikes up the band
Johnny strikes up the band
When Johnny strikes up the—
When Johnny strikes up the—
When Johnny strikes up the band, yeah
Johnny strikes up the band
Johnny strikes up the band
When Johnny strikes up the—
When Johnny strikes up the—
When Johnny strikes up the band, yeah
