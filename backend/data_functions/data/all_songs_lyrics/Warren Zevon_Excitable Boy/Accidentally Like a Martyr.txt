Accidentally Like a Martyr Lyrics
The phone don't ring, no, no
And the sun refused to shine
Never thought I'd have to pay so dearly
For what was already mine
For such a long, long time

We made mad love, shadow love
Random love and abandoned love
(Ooh) Accidentally like a martyr
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder
We made mad love, shadow love
Random love and abandoned love
(Ooh) Accidentally like a martyr
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder


The days slide by, should've done
Should've done, we all sigh
Never thought I'd ever be so lonely
After such a long, long time
Time out of mind
We made mad love, shadow love
Random love and abandoned love
(Ooh) Accidentally like a martyr
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder
We made mad love, shadow love
Random love and abandoned love
(Ooh) Accidentally like a martyr
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder
