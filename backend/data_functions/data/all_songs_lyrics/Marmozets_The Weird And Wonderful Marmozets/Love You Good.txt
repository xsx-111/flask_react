Love You Good Lyrics
Gonna love you, gonna love you, love you good

I'm gonna say the first thing that comes into my mind
It's not impressive but I've got you by my first line
Your explosive hypnosis gets me every time
It gets me every time

Cos you know that I could help you out and I would
This isn't a joke
I like the way that you look
I like the way that you look
I like the way you look

Gonna love you, gonna love you good
(Better than anyone)
Gonna love you, gonna love you good
(Cos you are my only one)
Gonna love you, gonna love you good
Gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love you good

I got to give it up to you for being up for it
It's not easy, it's not easy, no it's not a bit
It's not easy, it's not easy, no it's not a bit
But I got you by my first line (one two three)
I'm gonna say the first thing that comes into my mind
It's not impressive but I've got you by my first line
Your explosive hypnosis gets me every time
It gets me every time

Cos you know that I could help you out and I would
This isn't a joke
I like the way that you look
I like the way that you look
I like the way you look

Gonna love you, gonna love you good
(Better than anyone)
Gonna love you, gonna love you good
(Cos you are my only one)
Gonna love you, gonna love you good
Gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love you good

Cos you know that I could help you out and I would
This isn't a joke
I like the way that you look
I like the way that you look
I like the way you look
Cos you know that I could help you out and I would
This isn't a joke
I like the way that you look
I like the way that you look
I like the way you look
Cos you know that I could help you out and I would
This isn't a joke
I like the way that you look
I like the way that you look
I like the way you look

Gonna love you, gonna love you good
(Better than anyone)
Gonna love you, gonna love you good
(Cos you are my only one)
Gonna love you, gonna love you good
Gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love you good

Gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love you good
Gonna love you, gonna love you, gonna love you good
Gonna love you, love you, love you goodEmbed
