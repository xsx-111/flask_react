Why Do You Hate Me? Lyrics
Why do you hate me?

Take my money
Take my heart and soul
Break my boundaries
Daylight robbery taking, taking everything
Take my sickness
Take my list of things
I had planned
Is there anything you didn't see worth taking from me?

Oh boy here we go again
Do you still wanna stay
I ask the same thing every day
Why do you hate me? Why do you hate me?

Why do you hate me so much?
I'm confused with every little word you say
Do you feel like a fool?
I hate every little word you say
Every little word you say
Take my legs and tongue
So I can't talk or run
Burn my body
Daylight robbery taking, taking everything
Take my honey
Break the hive of my despair
I'm an empty vessel
Is there anything you didn't see worth taking from me?

Why do you hate me so much?
I'm confused with every little word you say
Do you feel like a fool?
I hate every little word you say
Why do you hate me so much?
I'm confused with every little word you say
Do you feel like a fool?
I hate every little word you say

Why do you hate me?
Why do you hate me?
Why do you hate me so much?
I'm confused with every little word you say
Do you feel like a fool?
I hate every little word you say
Why do you hate me so much?
I'm confused with every little word you say
Do you feel like a fool?
I hate every little word you say
Every little word you say

Every little word you say
Every little word you sayEmbed
