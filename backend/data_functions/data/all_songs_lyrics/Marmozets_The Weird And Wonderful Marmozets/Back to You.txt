Back to You Lyrics
I'm crawling to a place
Where I'm not kept to suffer
White like surrender
All my hope will muster
I don't belong in hell
Itâ€™s hard enough in my own world
The glass won't cut my feet
I float freely

And I, I'm calling back to you
I'm crawling back to you
I'm coming back to you

I free fall I'm letting gravity
Pull me back to my knees

And I, I'm calling back to you
I'm crawling back to you
I'm coming back to you
And I, I'm coming back to you
The tide will guide me through
I'm coming back to you

And I, I'm calling back to you
I'm crawling back to you
I'm coming back to you
And I, I'm calling back to you
The tide will guide me through
I'm coming back to youEmbed
