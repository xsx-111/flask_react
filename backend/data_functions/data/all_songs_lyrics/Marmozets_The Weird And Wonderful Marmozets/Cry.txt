Cry Lyrics
You are invincible
Shining like a heart of gold
Your timing is incredible
It's just
Show mercy to the pitiful
Show mercy for a miracle
Tell the poor that there is enough
And tell the rich that there isn't much

I'm fighting, I'm fighting on my own
I'm fighting, I'm fighting on my own
I'm fighting, I'm fighting on my own
On my own

Lost in life, feeling free
Why we cry unity
Holding on what has gone
When we blame ones at home
Hand in hand you will see
You can stand truthfully
Pushing on is so good
Fight your wars, don't leave blood
Justice flows in your veins
Cut your shame from the vane
Now you know in your heart
Life's too short to fall apart
Still fighting, still fighting, still fighting on my own
Still fighting, still fighting on my own, on my own
Still fighting on my own
Still fighting, still fighting on my own, on my ownEmbed
