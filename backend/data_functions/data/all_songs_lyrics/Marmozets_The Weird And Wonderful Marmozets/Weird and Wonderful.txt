Weird and Wonderful Lyrics
I can see it in your right mind
Ever thought to wonder you're not typical
You're weird and wonderful
But you will never know, no
Our personalities sometimes collide
With an open mind, I need it physical
I want it weird and wonderful

We will always fall just short
Remember what we were taught

Hold on tightly
I will not come down
Making memories last

Stay inside the family kill circle
You'll be safe, you'll be untouchable
You will always know you're weird and wonderful
You will always know you're weird and wonderful

Hold on tightly
I will not come down
Making memories last
Feel this energy
Pour my heart out
Making memories last

I can see it in your right mind
Ever thought to wonder you're not typical
You're weird and wonderful

Hold on tightly (I can see it in your right mind)
I will not come down (ever thought to wonder)
Making memories last (you're not typical, you're weird and wonderful)
Feel this energy (I can see it in your right mind)
Pour my heart out (ever thought to wonder)
Making memories last (you're not typical, you're weird and wonderful)Embed
