Move, Shake, Hide Lyrics
Move shake move shake and hide (Alright)
Stop trying to pressure me (Alright)
Everything is gonna be (Alright)
I know it doesn't say vacancy
But I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind us
Can you really see everything? (Alright)
Like my fingers and in between? (Alright)
A lonely heart equals a lonely mind
But that means nothing, nothing to me

Easy on the eyes, my friend
You don't wanna mess with this
Sometimes the bleeding sun bleeds red and thick
Colour in my only way to find it
So come at me, son
You pull the trigger on the gun
I'm alive, I'm alive, I’m alive, yeah, I'm alive (And it's alright)

Now I've got you where you need to be (Alright)
And the dark has left your eyes
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Easy on the eyes, my friend
You don't wanna mess with this
Sometimes the bleeding sun bleeds red and thick
Colour in my only way to find it
So come at me, son
You pull the trigger on the gun
I'm alive, I'm alive, I’m alive, yeah, I'm alive (And it's alright)
I'm alive, I'm alive, I’m alive, yeah, I'm alive (And it's alright)

Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake move shake and hide
Move shake hide, move shake hide, move shake hide

Easy on the eyes, my friend
You don't wanna mess with this
Sometimes the bleeding sun bleeds red and thick
Colour in my only way to find it
So come at me, son
You pull the trigger on the gun
I'm alive,yeah, I'm aliveEmbed
