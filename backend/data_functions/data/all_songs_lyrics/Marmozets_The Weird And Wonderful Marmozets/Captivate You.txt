Captivate You Lyrics
Come with me, feel this pain
Bleed like you never have before
Like you never have before
The seasons changed, you will remain
Like you never have before
Like you never have before

And I will captivate you
With everything I've got
To bring the best out to you
One strength one heart
Is all you need tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Leaving one city for another making people sick
To their stomach but sick in a good way
Cause I'm pushing myself to be more outrageous
And I'm on my way to find it

And I will captivate you
With everything I've got
To bring the best out to you
One strength one heart
Is all you need tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
And I will find the time
To help a soul and heal a bitter mind
To help a soul and heal a bitter mind

And I will captivate you
With everything I've got
To bring the best out in you
One strength one heart
Is all you need tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonightEmbed
