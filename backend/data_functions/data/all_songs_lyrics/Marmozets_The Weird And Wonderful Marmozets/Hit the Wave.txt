Hit the Wave Lyrics
Hit the wave, pull me under
Cleanse this soul and make it better
'Cause I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it something

Far too many times
We let important things into our minds
Then it's usually too late
To see what made us blind
So be sure that you let people know
How much they mean to you
Take the time to say the words
Before your time is through

Hit the wave, pull me under
Cleanse this soul and make it better
'Cause I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it something

We don't realize what we have until it's gone
We wait too late to say I'm sorry I was wrong
Sometimes it seems we hurt the ones
We hold dearest to our hearts
And we allow foolish things to tear our lives apart
Hit the wave, pull me under
Cleanse this soul and make it better
'Cause I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it something
Hit the wave, pull me under
Cleanse this soul and make it better
'Cause I'm afraid of being nothing
So take this life and make it somethingEmbed
