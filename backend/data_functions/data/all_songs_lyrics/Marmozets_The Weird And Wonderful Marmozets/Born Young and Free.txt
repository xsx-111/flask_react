Born Young and Free Lyrics
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free

Come with me to a quiet place and get some rest
Cos you’re tired and hungry, unlike all the other guests
Shake the dust off your feet and show them who’s best
Make or break on a long road, let’s go west

We can go wherever we want cos we’re free yeah we’re free
We can do whatever we want cos we’re born young and free
We’re born young and free

Now I know where we’re going, let’s get dressed
I didn't even realise we could be this blessed
Shake the dust off your feet and show them who’s best
Make or break on a long road, let’s go west
We can go wherever we want cos we’re free yeah we’re free
We can do whatever we want cos we’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We can go wherever we want cos we’re free yeah we’re free
We can do whatever we want cos we’re born young and free
We’re born young and free

We don't care, we don't care, we don't give a rip
We don't care, we don't care, we don't give a rip
We don't care, we don't care, we don't give a rip
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We can go wherever we want cos we’re free yeah we’re free
We can do whatever we want cos we’re born young and free
We’re born young and free
We can go wherever we want cos we’re free yeah we’re free
We can do whatever we want cos we’re free
We’re born young and freeEmbed
