Particle Lyrics
Lost, lost in something so complex
Time itself stops, it’s useless
When I'm in my own world
Mirroring self-delusion
Delirious poison fusion
Take me home, take me home
The particle that tricks me into your hands
Cold but now I understand why I am

Like music to my ears
The way that it flows, oh
Particle, I'm here
Please don't go

Satisfy, blink my eyes visions day by night
They’re brother, sister, dark and the light
Holding hands petrified
We are the catastrophic system
We are crystal children
Far from distance

Like music to my ears
The way that it flows, oh
Particle, I'm here
Please don't go, please don't go
Like music to my ears
The way that it flows, oh
Particle, I'm here
Please don't go, please don't go


Like music to my ears
The way that it flows, oh
Particle, I'm here
Please don't go
Like music to my ears
The way that it flows, oh
Particle, I'm here
Please don't go, please don't go1Embed
