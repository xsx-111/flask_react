Cover Up Lyrics
Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up your

We're gonna live long
Cos my heart knows and my dancing bones told me so
They laughed and told me so
They laughed and told me so
So I left it all behind
Cos I got a second chance
From a covered up life
But I did so much in the mean time, yeah

Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up yourself
Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up your

With a hand on my heart
Your words taste good
But your mind is truly burnt
Your holding on to bold
Your holding on to bold
So I left it all behind
Cos I got a second chance
From a covered up life
But I did so much in the mean time
Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up yourself
Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up youself

And I was always there for you
But you could never tell, so
Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up your
But now its time to wake up
From your covered up self
But now its time to wake up
From your covered up self
And I was always there for you
But you could never tell, so

Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up yourself
Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover up yourself
Cover up, cover up, cover up, cover upEmbed
