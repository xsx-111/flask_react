Is It Horrible Lyrics
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it bearable?
Is it bearable?
Is it bearable, yeah
Is it horrible?

Seems like you had a rough one last night
Since you slept dirty on my bathroom floor
What if I told you
What if I told you
Something terrible happened last night?
(Can you remember?
Can you remember?
Can you remember?)
Would you remember?
Could you remember?
Would you remember?
Could you remember?
(Would you remember?
Would you remember?)

Seems like you had a good night
You don't know when to stop, drinking 'till you drop
And the morning don't feel too bright
Your head’s on fire and the pain don't feel too nice
Your eyes were all over the joint
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it bearable?
Is it bearable?
Is it bearable yeah

Could you believe
Would you believe
You're worth fighting for
You're worth fighting for
(Can you remember?
Can you remember?
Can you remember?)
Let's just stick by that
Know that I care
Because that's not what they told you
(Would you remember?
Would you remember?)

Seems like you had a good night
You don't know when to stop, drinking 'till you drop
And the morning don't feel too bright
Your head’s on fire and the pain don't feel too nice
Your eyes were all over the joint
But I got your back buddy

Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?
Is it horrible?

Seems like you had a good night
You don't know when to stop drinking till you drop
And the morning don't feel too bright
Your head’s on fire and the pain don't feel too nice
Your eyes were all over the joint
But I got your back buddy

God help me
God help me
God help me
God help me
God help me
God help meEmbed
