Give Me That Sound LyricsI need a song now
But there is no sound
Give me that sound
Now
I have a mouth
And I want to sing like a face that is split open
I want to sing like a continuous echo of splitting hymens
I have a mouth and it opens
It continues to open
It is still opening
A new, smaller mouth opens inside my mouth
One takes over and splits the face open
From the new mouth a new face appears
And then a new smaller mouth opens inside
I could be anybody
Give me that soundEmbed
