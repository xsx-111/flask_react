Innocence Is Kinky LyricsThat night, I watched people fucking on my computer
Nobody can see me looking anyway
It's late
And everything turns into a kind of dirty
My skin starts breaking like LCD
I feel a desire
One I don't know, one I don't own
I'm free
I turn off the lights and dress myself in silver and gold
I go out into the edge of the city
Tread on my twigs that are not yet burning
The weight of my boots makes them break
And smoke comes out from be-be-be-ne-ne-neath the ba-ba-bark
Like a burnt-out match!
Like sex without the body!
Like smoke rings, smoke rings from my pussy!
A night vision, and bodies turned soft like newborn jellyfish
Mushrooms, white MacBooks, blind bodies with empty sockets
I stare back at my gaze that belongs to your body
I ask "is there nothing but seen or seen
Is there nothing to serve nothing
And nothing and nothing?"
I'm free
I take off my face and torso
Live bare and barely
I go out into the haze of the city
Tread on my twigs and feel them break, yeah
But I'm looking for something else
There has to be more to burning
I'm losing myself
More to burning and then sex and God
I tear off the ties
Oslo Oedipus, Oslo Oedipus
I am Oslo Oedipus
Tearing my eyes in and out
And in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
And in and out of face!Embed
