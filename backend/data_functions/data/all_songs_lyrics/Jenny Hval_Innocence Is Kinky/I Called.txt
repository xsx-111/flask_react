I Called LyricsI called you, but only in my mind
What I really did was to
Undress not the body but me and you
Word by word 'til we almost touched, touched
I wanted to say everything
But instead I gave up writing
I gave up sublimation
I gave up trying
But I promise you that I
Didn't give in
I didn't give in
I didn't give in
I just give
So everything cut and flickered
And ever feel a pillow, a seat, Foucault, a tampon?
Yes
Is there a difference that you're so like you
Desire, can you fragment?
It's like a sentence, hidden, broken down
Into letters
I send you those letters
L-O-V-E
They are little prisms on your lip
Oh, I'm so in love
Oh, I'm so endlessly in love
I am a sugar-giver
(Lights open and close)
(Like a clam, you know?)
I am a sugar-giver
I am so in love
Oh, I'm so helplessly in L-O-V-EEmbed
