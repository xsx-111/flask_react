Oslo Oedipus LyricsIn Oslo it's swamp and people walk through the city quietly like friendly zombies, like a sleeping army, a secret rhythm. A sudden sticks. A slow burning flame of safety lies at the heart, we can feel it, but we cannot find it. In and out between us a thin silver trail of broken glass stitches us to the ground reflecting us cut and run. The city windows covered with cardboards and wood panels. Oslo Oedipus, Oslo Oedipus, Oslo Oedipus, I am Oslo OedipusEmbed
