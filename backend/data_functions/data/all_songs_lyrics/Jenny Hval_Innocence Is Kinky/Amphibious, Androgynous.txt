Amphibious, Androgynous LyricsIn my dream you are slippery
My interest grows immediately
You have seaweed between your fingers, lips and limbs
Amphibious, androgynous
Amphibious, ninety-eight percent water
I try to write love songs
But my words remain in my hands
And my hands fall to the floor
Somewhere in the distance something hurts
I dream I have a lover made out of twigs
I snap his legs, and snap his lips when we kiss
Yes you're him!
The way it goes, this worries me
The dream doesn't fade, it keeps worrying me
I try not to hurt you, but in my dream the twigs keep breaking
I tug so gently but they snap
And when you open your mouth to speak, you make no sound
Silently coughing up black sap
In real life I haven't even seen you up close, only from below
In the dream you are silent and I am ??
I try to write love songs
But with every word I can hear the twigs breaking
Somewhere in the distance something hurts
The next day it is I who break
It's a clear spring day and I fill with sky
Ninety-eight percent blue
The day I find myself downing black things:
Coffee, raisins, raw chocolate
I can feel my bones burn to coal
My blood burns to oil
Black soap, I'm becoming you1Embed
