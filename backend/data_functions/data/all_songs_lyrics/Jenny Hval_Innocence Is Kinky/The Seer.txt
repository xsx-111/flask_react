The Seer LyricsWhat is human? Is there really nothing but seeing or seen?
The voice is wordless tissue
The fog from Heart of Glass
Listen to the lips that feed you
The voice is a second flesh that cannot be seen
This body is not for vision
The seer cannot go there
But the tongue is a pawn for the restless
An indecipherable alphabet
Each word an eye, lidless
And we speak in tongues from part to part
Broke, broke part to part
From invisible state to invisible state to invisible state
To invisible state
Where do I end? In the flames or in the ashes?
Where do I end?
My body is the end
My body is the end
My body is the endEmbed
