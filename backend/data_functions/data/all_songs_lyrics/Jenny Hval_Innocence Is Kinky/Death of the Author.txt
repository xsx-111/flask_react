Death of the Author LyricsMe by your eye
Me by your hand
Me by the manosphere
Me in your private time
Me by ankle
Me where no one is watching you
Me in your very own right
Me by your very own boner
Where do you think I'm hiding?
Me by your hand
Me by your fingers
Me by your keyboard
Me and the sound of tapping
Me and other words
Me and other words
Me by your anger
Me that can't be
That can't be saiâ€”
Me as anyone
Me bare and barely
Me by siamese
Me by night vision
Me by cause of me
Me in this mirror
Me without a face
Me without your body
Who do you think you're killing?Embed
