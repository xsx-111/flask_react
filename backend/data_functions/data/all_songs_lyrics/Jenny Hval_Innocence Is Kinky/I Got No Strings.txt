I Got No Strings LyricsWhat is a woman?
I guess I'd burn
I dreamt I was a real boy
I got no strings
How you said (?)
How you said (?)
I don't know why
It helps (?)
(?)
You feel it does
I take it in your mouth
I place it on my tongue and whirl it around
I make new words, words that I can use
Alternative strategies
I want a (?)
Gimme
That hollow echoes out
(?)
And my own (?)
All ecstasy I want to be
All there is to a fire
What do you mean you don't understand?
What do you mean you don't understand?
What... do... you... mean... you don't understand?
But do you understand
Fire, fire, do you understand fire, fire
What is a woman?
Fire walk with me
Dreamt that I was a real boy
I got no strings
Walk with the flagrant
Between my teeth
It was a beautiful song
To them everything
I got no stringsEmbed
