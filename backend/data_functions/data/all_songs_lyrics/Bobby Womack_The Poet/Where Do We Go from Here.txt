Where Do We Go from Here LyricsHere we are, 2 shining stars, came together
Seems like it was only yesterday we were only twinkles
In some far off galaxy (gality)
And oh one silent night, one silent night, one silent
Night
A guiding light brought your love to me, brought your
Love to me
All this ecstasy, for all eternity
(Bridge)
A burning flame melted our 2 hearts into one
A burning desire could only take us higher, higher
Higher, higher. higher, higher, higher, higher
And what I want to know is where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
You tell me, Oh I'd like to know
Where Where Where
Ooh, Baby
Lord I wonder would you mind if I just talked to you
For a minute
You see, you see we been together too long baby for
Backin' up now
Let's go to Mars, where children play, and live on
Candy bars
Where spirit souls run free, there's no night or day
And all is harmony
That burning desire would always be a part of me
It brought us to this, and oh baby
This is our final destiny
(Bridge)
Ooh, a burning flame, it melted our 2 hearts into one
Oh no
A burning desire, all it could ever do is take us
Higher higher higher higher higher higher
And what I want to know is where do we go from here?
Ooh, where do we go from here?
I wonder can you tell me, and ooh I'd like know, baby
Break it on down, Let me, let me talk awhile
(Where do we go from here?)
You See baby I'm sort of confused
You see I've been on the mountain top, (where do we go
From here?)
And I knew, I knew one day my choice would come around
(Where do we go from here?)
Excuse me while I take my time and sing this song
Where, ooh I'd like to know
Some times you build me up, sometimes you build me up
You build me up just to let me down, girl
I give you what you want, when you want it, where you
Want it
Every dogonne time you feel that you need my love
You see I realize baby that, I need you, you need me
You see, God had a plan and that's the way our love was
Supposed to be
Now tell me where do we go from here
(Where do we go from here) (where do we go from here)
You see baby baby I'm just so tired
So tired of going through changes
I'm tired of your building me up just to let me down
Make up your mind
Oh I'd like to know
(Where do we go from here?) (where do we go from here)
(Where do we go from here)
(Where do we go from here)
Ooh, where, where do we go, where do we go, where do we
Go
(Where do we go from here)
And that's the way our love's supposed to be
(Where do we go from here)
(Where do we go from here)Embed
