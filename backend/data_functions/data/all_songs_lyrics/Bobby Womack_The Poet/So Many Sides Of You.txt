So Many Sides Of You LyricsWorking my heart out of teardrops
Out of my mind over you
Girl, you're so hard to get next to
Am I supposed to see through?
So, when the doors are opened
Oh, I might get lost in you
So keep your heart open, baby
Just in case I do
Cause there's so many sides of you
So many sides of you, I know
Just in case I might make the connection, baby
And my girl might just
Have a chance to come shining through
So many sides of you
So many sides of you
Say, girl
I got my limitations
Oh, girl so do you
You see, I've got my education
Livin next door to
The school of rules
So, when doors are opened
Oh, I might get lost in you
So keep your heart open, baby
Just in case I do
There's so many sides of you
So many sides of you, and I know
Aw, baby, Just in case I might make the connection, baby
And let the love - let the love come shining through
So many sides of you
So many sides of you
Awww! I'm Working my heart out of teardrops
Out of my mind over you
There's so many doors to open
I just might get lost in you, well, well, well
There's so many sides of you
There's so many sides of you (There's so many sides of you)
So many sides of you, of you (I might get lost in you)
So keep - keep your heart open (So Many sides of you)
Just in case I do
There's so many sides of you
(So many sides of you - of you) Tryin' to see 'em all, baby
(There's so many sides of you) So many sides - of you
(So many sides of you) Tryin' to see 'em all, baby - Tryin' to see em all, baby
(There's so many sides of you - of you) Tryin' to see 'em all, baby
You gotta, Got me lookin' baby (So many sides of you)
Hey, Hey (There's so many sides of you)
Awww, Baby (There's so many sides of you)
So many sides of youEmbed
