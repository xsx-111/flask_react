Just My Imagination LyricsI just can't seem to face the truth
Since you said that we were through on a summer night... yes sir
I lost the other half of my best friend
(Those who lost you most will will you, for my life) sic
Baby, I'm still right there holding you
Summer breeze brought some love for me and you
You've got me burning all love inside
But I always fantasize in my mind, baby
Just my imagination
Playing tricks on me again y'all....
Just my Imagination
Playing tricks on me again
Feel your body I'm touching you
Love me good like you used to do on a summer night, (summer night)
I lost the other half of my best friend
Those who lost you most will (sic)will you for my life
Baby! I'm still right here holding you
You can tell I'm about to get next to you
You've got me burning all love inside
But I always fantasize in my mind
Just my imagination
Playing tricks on me again y'all....
Just my Imagination
Playing tricks on me again
Love, love love love love woo hoo ho hoooo loveEmbed
