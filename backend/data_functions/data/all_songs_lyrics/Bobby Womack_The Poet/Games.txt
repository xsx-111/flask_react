Games LyricsLa La Laa
You say you like all kinds of music
No favourites
But then its got to happen in its own space and time
The Games
That people play
They're so afraid to face the time of day
So they run away
You see
They're afraid to live
Afraid to let
They don't wanna give unless they get
Unless they get
The Games
That we begin
Once they start they never never, cease to end
I know you heard what I said my friend
You see
Cos as the start
Of every every every game
Theres a part of you that gonna never never change
Time oh
Time has a story
It has a story
And the games oh
Did you see us goin up to you
Nobody but you
You gotta make your moves
Make your moves whilst you still can win em, win em
But you can't never never let the game close in on you
OH
Moves
To stay ahead
Well, I'm sick and tired of them yessin' me
Just for my bread
I know y'all heard what I said
See
Cos at the start
Just like they play your favourite song
They play it over and over and over again 'til the grooves are gone
Time oh
Time has a story
It has a story, story, story, story
And how you play the game
Can't you see that its all up to you
Nobody but you
You gotta make your moves
Make your moves whilst you still can win em
Still got a chance brother
But you can't never let the moves close in
Close in on you
Woooo!
