She Works Out Too Much Lyrics
Get ready to have some fun!
Alright, here we go!
Five, four, three, two, and one
Are you ready to work out?

Don't take it the wrong way
I can never keep up
Sick of liking your selfies
Should've gone with my gut
Maybe I'm in a movie
Maybe I'm out to lunch
But I'm constantly swiping and tapping
It's never relaxing, I need a new routine

(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(But she works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)
Let's move on to the next step
Og ew ereH
!nuf evah dna esicrexE
Step, touch, step, touch
Perfect form and shape
Come on!
Get on your hands and knees
Ready? Here we go!

Welcome to the shitshow
Grab a comfortable seat
Find me in the front row
Facing the music, anyone can see

(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(But she works out too much and)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)
Remember to drink a glass of water before and after you work out
Learn form and shape
Stick with it
Here we go!

I'm going off the deep end
Time to let myself go
Nothing's ever as easy as when
It never begins, the end is just a dream

(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(But she works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
(She works out too much and...)
The only reason we never worked out was
He didn't work out enough
(He's trying)
(She works out too much)
The only reason we never worked out was
We didn't work out, it never works out
No, it never works out
She works out too much
No, I never work out
It didn't work out
No, it never works out
Okay, we're done8Embed
