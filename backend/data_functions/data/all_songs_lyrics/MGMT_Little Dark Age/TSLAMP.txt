TSLAMP Lyrics
On my phone

Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
I try to pull the curtains back
Turn you off but can't detach
When all I want and all I know
Is time spent looking at my phone
(On my phone)

Find me when the lights go down
Signing in and signing out
Gods descend to take me home
Find me staring at my phone
I'm wondering where the hours went
As I'm losing consciousness
My sullen face is all aglow
Time spent looking at my phone

Last thing that you need
Is the new shiny feature
All the memories you've shared
Devoured by perverted creatures
Nothing can compete
With the first time you saw her
Passing strangers on the street
Spending every moment looking at their phones
(On my phone)
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
Time spent sitting all alone
Time spent looking at my phone
I call you, you don't call me back
Almost had a heart attack
I'm listening to the window moan
Time spent looking at my phone

Clouds are getting full
So you close all the windows
I would never let you die
Even if our love is ornamental
You know what you need
Is a way to remember
You can never find the time
If you spend everyday looking at your phone


You should come with me
We can lose ourselves in nothing
Copy faces from the feed
And then try to turn them into something
Even if you choose to believe that it's ending
You'll come back to me again
You can go ahead and stop pretending
Doo doo doo doo doo...8Embed
