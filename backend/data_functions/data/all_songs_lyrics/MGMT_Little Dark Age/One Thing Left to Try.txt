One Thing Left to Try Lyrics
One thing left to try
See if you can make it
Before you choose the night
And the silence overtakes you
If you looked into the fire
And you had that conversation
Then there's one thing left to try
If you want to save your life

Fear is his name, but his friends still call him God
Again and again, the thought remains
(The only way to get rid of the feeling)

I don't wanna die
Wishing I'd done something
More than what's required
To last until the sunset
No, I don't wanna die
Thinking that I'm dreaming
There's one thing left to try
If you want to change your life
Today I left those thoughts behind, behind
Over and over, you die just to feel alive

The only way to get rid of the feeling
You have to draw the line
And remember there's more than you're seeing
Decide
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
Do you want to keep us alive?
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to keep us alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
Do you want to feel alive?
(Fun is over tonight)
