When You Die Lyrics
(Hey!)

I'm not that nice
I'm mean and I'm evil
Don't call me nice
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I've got some work to do
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off

Yeah!

Go fuck yourself
You heard me right
Don't call me nice again
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out

You die
And words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die
Words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

Go fuck yourself
I'm mean, not nice
You said it twice
You said it twice
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?

I've got some work to do
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I heard you the first time27Embed
