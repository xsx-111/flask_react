James Lyrics
James
If you heed the call
And you go outside, and wander off
Then home is there
Wherever you will make it
You can always say, "Who's laughing now?"

James
If you need a friend
Come right over, you don't even knock
And I'll be home
The door is always open
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

Oh, James
My little doll
You just go outside and you call
James
Oh, you're never too far off


Oh, James
My little doll
You just go outside and you call
Oh, James
No, you're never too far off
If your fire's out
There's no need to shout
I'm always home
And walk on in
I'll make you tea and breakfast
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James
No, you're never too far off (James)
No, you're never too far off2Embed
