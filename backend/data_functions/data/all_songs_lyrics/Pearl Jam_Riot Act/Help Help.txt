Help Help Lyrics
Tell me what I want to hear
This shit's too good to be true
My dear

Tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me lies, tell me

Help me, help me, help me
Help me, help me, help me

Storybook keeps from hurting me
You see
Shell of the man from the sea

Tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me why
Tell me why, tell me
Tell me why, tell me
Tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me lies, tell me
Help me, help me, help me
Help me, help me, help me

Reservoir of hate and fear
Invisible in repair
A hundred thieves cast a spell
This is hell

Help me, help me, help me
Help me, help me, help me

The man they call my enemy, I've seen his eyes
He looks just like me, a mirror
The more you read, we've been deceived
And everyday it becomes clearer, clearer, clearer, clearer, (clearer), clearer, (clearer)
Not my enemy, no, not my enemy
Don't speak for me, no, not my enemyEmbed
