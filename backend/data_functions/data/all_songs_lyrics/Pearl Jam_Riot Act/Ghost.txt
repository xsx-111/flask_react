Ghost Lyrics
The mind is grey, like the city
Packing in and overgrown
Love is deep, dig it out
Standing in a hole alone
Working for something
That we can never hold
A place in the clouds
Your place to hide oh my oh

I'm flying away, away
I'm driving away, away
Finding hope in ways I missed before

The TV, she talks to me
Breaking news and building walls
Selling me what I don't need
I never knew soap made you taller

So I'm riding away, away
Hiding away, away
So much talk it makes no sense at all
So I'm flying away, away
Driving away, away
Passing old friends I don't know at all

It doesn't hurt, when I bleed
But my memories, they eat me
I've seen it all before
Bring it on because I'm no victim

Dying, dying
Dying, dying1Embed
