Green Disease Lyrics

G...

It's a disease, and they're all green
It emanates from their being
A satiation with occupation
And like weeds, with big leaves
Stealing light from what's beneath
Where they have more, still they take more
Course I know, then I don't
There's a stowaway with my throat
It's deceiving, I don't believe him
We can scream, out our doors
Behind the wall a fat man snores
In his dreams he's choking on leaves

Well I guess
There's nothing wrong with what you say
But don't sell me, there can't be better ways
Tell the captain, "the boat's not safe and we're drowning"
Turns out he's the one making waves, waves, waves
Well, I said there's nothing wrong with what you say
Believe me, I'm just asking you to sway
No white, or black, just grey
Can you feel this
World with your heart and not your brain?
