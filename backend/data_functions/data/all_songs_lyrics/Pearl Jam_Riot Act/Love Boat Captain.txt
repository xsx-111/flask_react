Love Boat Captain Lyrics
Is this just another day, this God forgotten place
First comes love and then comes pain
Let the games begin
Questions rise and answers fall, insurmountable

Love boat captain, take the reigns
And steer us towards the clear, here
It's already been sung, but it can't be said enough
All you need is love

Is this just another phase?
Of earthquakes making waves
Trying to shake the cancer off?
Oh, stupid human beings
Once you hold the hand of love
It's all surmountable

Hold me and make it the truth
That when all is lost there'll be you
'Cause to the human race, I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word I still believe
And it's love
It's an art to live with pain, mix the light into grey
Lost nine friends we'll never know, two years ago today
And if our lives became too long
Would it add to our regret?

And the young they can lose hope
'Cause they can't see beyond today
The wisdom that the old can't give away, hey
Constant recoil
Sometimes life don't leave you alone

Hold me and make it the truth
That when all is lost there will be you
'Cause to the human race, I don't mean a thing
And there's just one word and I still believe
That it's love, love, love, love

Love boat captain, take the reins
Steer us towards the clear
I know it's already been sung, can't be said enough
Love is all you need, all you need is love, love, love2Embed
