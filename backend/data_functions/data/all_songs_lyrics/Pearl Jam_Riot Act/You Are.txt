You Are Lyrics
This broken wheel is coming undone
And the road's exploding
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you

Love is a tower
And you're the key
Leading me higher
When you let me in

Keeping us close, so close
On down the line
Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun
With no one knowing
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you

You are a tower
Of strength to me
The darkening hour
Sees light again
Again
Ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are

Love is a tower
Of strength to me
I am the shoreline
But you're the sea
The sea

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are
You are2Embed
