Up in Arms Lyrics
The rain is here and you my dear
Are still my friend
It's true the two of us
Are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

The rain is here and you my dear
Are still my friend
It's true the two of us
Are back as one again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

Together now I don't know how
This love could end
My lonely heart, it falls apart
For you to mend
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you, girl
Now I am up in arms again

I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you Gil
Now I am up in arms again
I was the one who left you
Always coming back
I cannot forget you Gil
Now I am up in arms again2Embed
