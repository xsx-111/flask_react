The Colour and the Shape Lyrics
You're a real short ride, wow right
They're the big stuff anyway, that's right
You're a teachers pet, wow right
Still a bleach one anyway, that's right
Wow right

Colour and the shape
Colour and the shape

No sweat yeah, wow right
You're a retard anyway, that's right
Stand to beat your hands away, wow right
Said a river boy runaway, that's right

Colour and the shape
Colour and the shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, hey

You're a retard anyway, that's right
Stand to beat your hands away, wow right
Said a river boy run away, that's right
Colour and the shape
Colour and the shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shape, shape, shape
Shape, shapeEmbed
