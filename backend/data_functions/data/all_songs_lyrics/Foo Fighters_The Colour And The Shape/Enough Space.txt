Enough Space LyricsI was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lili
The best I've ever seen
Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be enough space
Space, space, space
I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lili
Best I've ever seen
Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be enough space
Space, space , space
Space, space, space, space
Space, space, space, space
Space, space, space, space1Embed
