Compliments Lyrics
We sit and we sigh, and nothing gets done
So right, so clued-up, we just get old
And all the while, been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria
We sit and we sigh, and nothing gets done
So right, so clued-up, we just get old
And all the while, been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria


We sit and we sigh, and nothing gets done
So right, so clued-up, we just get old
And all the while, been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria
We sit and we sigh, and nothing gets done
So right, so clued-up, we just get old
And all the while, been torn asunder
Nicotine and bacteria

We sit and we sigh, and nothing gets done
(What are we coming to?)
So right, so clued-up, we just get old
(And what are we gonna do?)
And all the while, been torn asunder
(And what are we coming to?)
Nicotine and bacteria
(And what are we gonna do?)8Embed
