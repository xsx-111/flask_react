So Here We Are Lyrics
I caught a glimpse
But it's been forgotten
So here we are again
I made a vow
To carry you home, home
I really tried
To be what you wanted
It all went wrong again
I made a vow
To carry you home
If you fall sick
If you pass out, out

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out
I figured it out
I can see again
I can see again
I can see again
I can see again
I can see again6Embed
