Helicopter Lyrics
North to south, empty
Running on bravado
As if to say, as if to say
As if to say, he doesn't like chocolate
He's born a liar, he'll die a liar
Some things will never be different

Stop being so American
There's a time and there's a place
So James Dean, so blue jeans

Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?

Three out of five, three out of five (It's not enough)
Six out of ten, better luck next time
Just like his dad, just like his dad (The same mistakes)
Some things will never be different
Hungry and dumb, hungry and dumb (So wait in line)
Queuing up for some more junk food
It's not my fault, it's not my fault (Just this once)

Bury your head in the sand
I'm thinking six, six, six, I'm thinking six

Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?
Are you hoping for a miracle?


Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough)
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough)
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough)
Are you hoping for a miracle? (It's not enough)17Embed
