Blue Light Lyrics
You'll find it hiding in shadows
You'll find it hiding in cupboards
It will walk you home safe every night
It will help you remember

If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is

I still feel you in the taste of cigarettes
What could I ever run to?
Just tell me it's tearing you apart
Just tell me you cannot sleep

If that's the way it is then that's the way it is
If that's the way it is then that's the way it is

And you didn't even notice when the sky turned blue
And you couldn't tell the difference between me and you
And I nearly didn't notice the gentlest feeling
The gentlest feeling
The gentlest feeling
The gentlest feeling
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)
You are the bluest light (You are the bluest light)3Embed
