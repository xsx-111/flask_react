Positive Tension Lyrics
He said, "You're just as boring as everyone else
When you tut and you moan and you squeal and you squelch"
He said that you're just as boring as everyone else
Nothing ever happens
Things replace things
Days replace days
Things replace things

She said, "I'm gonna use my teeth and my claws"
She said, "I'm gonna use my teeth and my claws"
She said, "I'm gonna use my teeth and my breasts
I'm gonna make it happen"
She said

(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
And you cannot run or ever, ever escape
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
You cannot run or ever hide it away
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
Something glorious is about to happen
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
The reckoning
They go, "You're just as boring as everyone else
When you tut and you moan and you squeal and you squelch"
They go, "You're just as boring as everyone else"
Stuck past timing
The fear and the yearning, the fear and the consumption
The fear and the yearning, it's gonna eat you alive
They go

(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
And you cannot hide or ever, ever escape
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
You cannot hide or ever put it away
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
Something glorious is about to happen
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
The reckoning

They go, they say
They go, they say
They go
Why'd you have to get so hysterical?
Why'd you have to get so hysterical?
Why'd you have to get so hysterical?
Why'd you have to get so hysterical?
Why'd you have to get so hysterical?
(Success, success, success is over)
Why'd you have to get so hysterical?
(Success, success, success is over)
Why'd you have to get so hysterical?
(Success, success, success is over)
Why'd you have to get so fucking useless?
Play it cool, boy
Play it cool, boy
Play it cool, boy
Play it cool, boy
