Price of Gas Lyrics
I've been driving a mid-sized car
I never hurt anyone
Is that a fact? Is that a fact?
Is that a fact? Is that a fact?
The price of gas keeps on rising
Nothing comes for free
Make like a stone, make like a plant
Make like a stone, make like a plant
I can tell you how this ends

We're gonna win this (War! War! War! War!)
We're gonna win this (War! War! War! War!)
We're gonna win this (War! War! War! War!)

With spades and truncheons, guns and trowels
That is how the war will be won
Just swat the fly, just swat the fly
Just swat the fly, just swat the fly
Taking care of cars and bodies
Nothing ever comes for free
The ghosts are here, the ghosts are here
Red white and blue, red white and blue
I can tell you how this ends
We're gonna win this (War! War! War! War!)
We're gonna win this (War! War! War! War!)
We're gonna win this (War! War! War! War!)

We're gonna win3Embed
