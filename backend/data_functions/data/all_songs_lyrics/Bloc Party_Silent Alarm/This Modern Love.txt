This Modern Love Lyrics
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
You've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
You've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
I've been paid, I've been weighed, I've been

Don't get offended if I seem absent-minded
Just keep telling me facts and keep making me smile
And don't get offended if I seem absent-minded
I get tongue-tied
Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never known what's good for me
Baby, you've got to be more demanding
I will be yours

I'll pay for you anytime
I'll pay for you anytime

And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
Well jump on, enjoy, you can gorge away
And you told me you wanted to eat up my sadness
(Jump right)
Baby, you've got to be more discerning
I've never known what's good for me and
Baby, you've got to be more demanding
(Jump left)
What are you holding out for?
What's always... (In the way?)
Why so damn absent-minded?
Why so scared... (Of romance?)
This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me
This modern love breaks me
This modern love wastes me

Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Do you wanna come over and kill some time?
Throw your arms around me10Embed
