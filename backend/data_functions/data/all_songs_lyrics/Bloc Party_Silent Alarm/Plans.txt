Plans Lyrics
Wake up, dreamer
It's happening without you
Cut your hair and shave your beard
You squandered your chances
I'll give you a thousand pounds
To show me how you do it
Stop being so laissez-faire
We're all scared of the future

Been training vipers to come for you
In your dreams to release you
Been training vipers to come for you
In your sleep
And the ravens are leaving the tower
And the ravens are leaving the tower
And the ravens are leaving the tower
Make your peace

I've got a taste for blood
Leave the weak, leave the young
I've got a taste for blood
I'm walking out without you
You will kill, or be killed
It's about progress
I've got a taste for blood
Wake up, sleepyhead
It's happening without you
Such a nice guy
You tell me everything twice
Whip cracks, we jump
We will run backwards
Stop being so laissez-faire
We're all scared of the future

We make plans for big times
Get bogged down, distracted
We make plans for good times
Only young on surface
So kiss me before
It all gets complicated
I've got a taste for blood2Embed
