Wildest Dreams Lyrics
1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4!

I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go

And I just feel I can be anything
That I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I want to be
Make my wildest dreams come true

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again

When I remember back to how that
Things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away the hell
When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna break away

I'm gonna break away
I'm out on my own
I'm out on my own
I'm gonna break away
Breaking away

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again
I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna break awayEmbed
