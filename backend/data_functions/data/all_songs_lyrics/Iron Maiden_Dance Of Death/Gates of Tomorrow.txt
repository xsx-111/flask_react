Gates of Tomorrow Lyrics
Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption rewards for the meek

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a God to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a God to save you
If you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in a web, but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrowEmbed
