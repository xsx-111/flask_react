Rainmaker Lyrics
When I was wandering in the desert
And was searching for the truth
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again
I turn my face towards the barren sun

And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in our lives
Like the cracks upon the ground
They are sealed and are now washed away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away

You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears


You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears away
You tell me we can start the rain
You tell me that we all can change
You tell me we can find something
To wash the tears
And I know of the pain
That you feel the same as me
And I dream of the rain
As it falls upon the leaves
And the cracks in the ground
Like the cracks are in our lives
They are sealed and are now far away1Embed
