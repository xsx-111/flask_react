Time And Space LyricsLet it take you
Through the slowly
Lie hands and there's more
To let our love grow
If all time seems to
Wait on feeling
Because it's not
How we should show our love
And I was easy love
And I wasn't easy enough
Time and Space
Peel away at angst
Time and Space
Learn to let go
Baby lean on me
Help you lean
Help you lean
Help you lean on me
Baby lean
Baby lean
Baby lean on me
Got to lean
Got to lean
Got to lean on me
Are we joined by both
Our hearts or limbs
Only by arms length
We'll sigh ever show
Let go
Let go
And I was easy love
And I wasn't easy enough
Time and Space
Peel away at angst
Time and Space
Just to let go
Baby lean on me
Help you lean
Help you lean
Help you lean on me
Baby lean
Baby lean
Baby lean on me
Got to lean
Got to lean
Got to lean on me
And I was easy love
And I wasn't easy enough
And I was easy love
And I wasn't easy enough
Let
