Not Forgotten LyricsThe winter wind blows out your tune
I can breathe but I'm not alive
The night sky wakes up your smile
My heart strings swell out of tune
The wind blows out of tune
Whistles from green to yellow, blue
Can't stop the world, reminded me of you
My heart strings swell out of tune
The night sky wakes up your smile
With your eyes I see for miles and miles
I can breathe but I'm not alive
Can't stop the world reminded me of you
Coz your hearts finished my shock
My real thoughts are sold and bought
Coz your hearts finished my shock
My real thoughts are sold and bought
I can't imagine why I should go on
I can't continue solo for so long
Coz your hearts finished my shock
My real thoughts are sold and bought
Coz your hearts finished my shock
My real thoughts are sold and boughtEmbed
