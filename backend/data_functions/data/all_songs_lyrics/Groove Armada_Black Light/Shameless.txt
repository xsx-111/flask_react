Shameless LyricsI can read your lips
I can read your mind
It's all I want to hear
Why am I so blind?
And the way we were
Fatefully entwined
In a shameless world
Rock 'n roll desire
All the things you are
In a single word
Famously inspired
Privately absurd
And the way we were
Fatefully entwined
In a shameless world
Rock 'n roll desire
And the days go by
Morning noon and night
Permanently wired
To the simple life
And the way we were
Fatefully entwined
In a shameless world
Rock 'n roll desire
Rock 'n roll desireEmbed
