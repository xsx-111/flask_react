Paper Romance Lyrics
The taste that's in the air so sweet
Creatures they come alive
Confusion on the city streets
Our love electrified

I feel your heat
I never wanna let you go
Horizons meet
I'm standing here to let you know

Yeah you can write me a love letter
But there's nothing to say
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
Anyway
Yeah you can rub me up much better
If you come my way
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
Anyway

My golden heart beats for two
My golden heart beats for you
I fear our pain
The time it takes
For us to change
It's gonna happen anyway
I feel your heat
I never wanna let you go
Horizons meet
I'm standing here to let you know

Yeah you can write me a love letter
But there's nothing to say
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
Anyway
Yeah you can rub me up much better
If you come my way
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
Anyway
Yeah you can write me a love letter
But there's nothing to say
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
Anyway
Yeah you can rub me up much better
If you come my way
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
Anyway
Yeah you can write me a love letter
But there's nothing to say
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
Anyway
Yeah you can rub me up much better
If you come my way
I don't wanna take a chance on your paper romance
