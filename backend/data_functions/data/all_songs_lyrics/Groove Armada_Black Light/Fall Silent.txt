Fall Silent LyricsNo chance for me to start again
Break my heart(hold?) again
No more reason why I'm here
There's a flood in my room I'm distraught(destroyed?)
There's extra news and that's for sure
Bring back my chance to survive
Fall of man are bullshit and lies
Hope shatters my whole damn life
Even though I'm not alone tonight (Tonight - Tonight - Tonight)
My saviour breaks through
Clouds drain down on you (I'm left? I'm left? I'm left?)
With you girl come on give in to what I've done (I'm left? I'm left? I'm left?)
Turn the lights out on my life
Can't you see I'm losing my mind?
You walk away again out of my sight
Cause I'll never have you as my wife
I'll just fall silent (I'm left? I'm left? I'm left?)
My saviour breaks through
Clouds drain down on you (I'm left? I'm left? I'm left?)
With you girl come on give in to what I've done (I'm left? I'm left? I'm left?)Embed
