History LyricsOhhhh
I'm sad at the way that I am
I'm turnin' away from the past
I'm lookin' for a better place
I'm lonely but finding my way... around...
So wrong, it's just history repeating;
Because, it keeps turning me around
So wrong, I'm sick of history repeating;
Because, it keeps turning me around
It's starting to push at my mind
Forget all the things that I took with me
I'm throwing away all my dreams...
Dreams, dreams, dreams...
So wrong, it's just history repeating;
Can't find a way (history repeating)
So wrong, it's just history repeating;
History repeating
So longEmbed
