Before and After Lyrics

Love ain't seen me coming
Offer something new today
Still don't believe we're fading
But never washed away
And now you find a lesson
In what I have to say
Well, the time is right
And it is today

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe we could talk about it
And try to get it straight
After all these years, baby
Maybe it's too late
But I really need to
Have you by my side
And that's the only feelings
Baby, I can't hide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well you aren't listening, I ain't talking
We ain't getting nowhere
I keep trying to get through to you baby
All you do is stare
I don't wanna see that
I need to try to by myself
Well, I don't want to be your lover
Babe, I wanna be your man

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, now my story's over, baby
And I ain't gonna tell it twice
Well, you better start listening
Yeah, to my advice
Or you're gonna be left out
I said left out in the cold
Yeah, before you get my loving
Babe, you'll be too old
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, come to me baby
Well, I said yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!2Embed
