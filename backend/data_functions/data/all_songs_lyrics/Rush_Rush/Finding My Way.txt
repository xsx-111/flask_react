Finding My Way Lyrics
Yeah, oh yeah!
Ooh, said I, I'm comin' out to get you
Ooh, sit down, I'm comin' out to find you
Ooh, yeah
Ooh yeah
Findin' my way!

I've been gone so long
I've lost count of the years
Well, I sang some sad songs
Oh yes, and cried some bad tears

Look out! I'm comin', whoa, whoa
Look out! I'm comin', whoa, yeah
I'm runnin', finding my way back home
Oh yeah!

Yeah, oh, yeah!
Ooh, said I, I'm comin' back to look for
Ooh, sit down, I'm goin' by to beg for
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Findin' my way!
You've done me no right
But you've done me some wrong
Left me lonely each night
While I sing my sad song

Look out! I'm comin', whoa, whoa
Look out! I'm comin', whoa, yeah
I'm runnin', findin' my way back home

I'm comin'
Ooh, babe, I said I'm runnin'
Whoa, babe, I said I'm comin' to get you, mama
Said I'm runnin'
Ooh, babe, I said I'm comin' for you, babe. I said I'm runnin'
Ooh, yes, babe, I said I'm comin' to get you, babe
I said I'm comin'
Ooh, yeah

I'm findin', I'm findin' my way back home
Well, I've had it for now, livin' on the road
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah


And I'm findin'
Findin' my way back home!
Well, I've had it for now, livin' on the road
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

Yeah
Ooh, yeaaah
Ooh, say now, I'm comin' out to get you
Ooh, say now, I'm comin' out to find you
Ooh, yeeah
Ooh, yeah
