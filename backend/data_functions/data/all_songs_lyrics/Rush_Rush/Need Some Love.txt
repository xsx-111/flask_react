Need Some Love Lyrics
I'm running here, I'm running there
I'm looking for a girl
Because there's nothing I need, there's nothing I want more
In the whole wide world
Well, I need it quick and I need it now
Before I start to fade away
That's why I'm searching, that's why I'm looking
Each and every day

Ooh, I need some love
I said I need some love
Ooh yes, I need some love
This feeling I can't rise above
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Well, I been hustling here, I been hustling there
I been searching for about a week
And I started feeling this strange sensation
My knees are starting getting weak
Well, I need what keeps a young man alive
I'm saying I need it now
I'm gonna get the message across to you
Some way, some how
Ooh, I need some love
I said I need some love
Ooh yes, I need some love
This feeling I can't rise above
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Ooh, I need some love
I said I need some love
Ooh yes, I need some love
This feeling I can't rise above
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah2Embed
