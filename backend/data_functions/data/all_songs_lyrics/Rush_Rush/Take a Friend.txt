Take a Friend Lyrics
Well, I'm looking at you
And I'm wondering what you're going to do
Looks like you got no friends
No one to stick with you till the end

Take yourself, a friend
Keep them till the end
Whether woman or man
It makes you feel so good
So good

Yes, you think you're all right
But now you're lonely every night
Well, you need a friend
Someone on whom you can always depend

Take yourself a friend
Keep them till the end
Whether woman or man
It makes you feel so good
So good

Yes, you need some advice
Well, let me put it to you nice
I said you need a friend
Someone who'll stick with you to the end

Take yourself a friend
Keep them till the end
Whether woman or man
It makes you feel so good

Take yourself a friend
Keep them till the end
Whether woman or man
It makes you feel so good

Take yourself a friend
Keep them till the end
Whether woman or man
It makes you feel so good
So good2Embed
