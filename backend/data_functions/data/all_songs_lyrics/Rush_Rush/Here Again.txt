Here Again Lyrics
I said I played this song
So many times before
That the melody keeps repeating
Growing new ideas
Flowing chords and notes
Like a mountain river bleeding
Well, I say as I look back
At all the thoughts I've had
They reflect just what I'm learning
Yes, you know that the hardest part
Yes, I say it is to stay on top
On top of a world forever churning
Well, you say you laugh
But I can see that your eyes are glad
Well, do you see, can't you see
Can't you see what I'm feeling?
Yes, I've seen your face before
I said, I've seen it everywhere
Showing up to me without a scent revealing
Well, I said will it ever change?
Oh yes Lord, I said will it stay the same?
I'd surely like to know before it's over
Well, I said I played this song
Yes, I said it won't be long
Won't be long before I stop and play, play it over
And I've, Oh I've, I've seen your face before
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
And I've, Oh I've, I've been in one place too long
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?


And I've, Oh I've, I've seen your face before
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
And I've, Oh I've, I've been in one place too long
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?2Embed
