Working Man Lyrics
Well, I get up at seven, yeah
And I go to work at nine
I got no time for livin’
Yes, I’m workin’ all the time

It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that’s why they call me
They call me the workin’ man

They call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am

So I get home at five o'clock
And I take myself out an ice cold beer
Always seem to be wond'rin'
Why there's nothin' goin' down here

It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me
The workin' man
Well, they call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am


Well, they call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am


Well, I get up at seven, yeah
And I go to work at nine
I got no time for livin'
Yes, I'm workin' all the time

It seems to me I could live my life
A lot better than I think I am
I guess that's why they call me
They call me the workin' man

Well, they call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am
They call me the workin' man
I guess that's what I am7Embed
