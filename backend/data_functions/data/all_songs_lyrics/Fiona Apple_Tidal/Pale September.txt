Pale September Lyrics
Pale September, I wore the time like a dress that year
The autumn days swung soft around me like cotton on my skin
But as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappeared
My heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full
And sank in the burrows of my keep

And all my armor falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep

He goes along just as a water lily
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts, his body floats
Unweighed down by passion or intensity
Yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts
And he finds a home in me
For what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reap

And all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep
All my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep
All my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep3Embed
