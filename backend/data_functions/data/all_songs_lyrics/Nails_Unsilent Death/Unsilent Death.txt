Unsilent Death Lyrics
Broken hope, frozen bones, stone eyes
My mind burns through the night
As my love turns to ash
Forever haunted by my past

I feel the knife turn
I watch my life descend
In spite of the world
My fight will never end

I've paid in pain and abuse
To expose the lies that you call truth
No matter the reproach expressed
I will never die a silent death

I feel the knife turn
I watch my life descend
In spite of the worldEmbed
