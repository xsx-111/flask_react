I Will Not Follow LyricsAs the rope tightens around our necks
Pray for silence
Pray for the end
Pray for silence
Pray for the end
The ones that we trusted were not our friends
Pray for silence
Pray for the end
Pray for silence
Pray for the end
Fuck the sheep who tell me how to live
I wasn't born to follow or swallow anybodies shitEmbed
