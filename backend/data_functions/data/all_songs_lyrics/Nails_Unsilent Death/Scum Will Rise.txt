Scum Will Rise LyricsAs truth hide the scum will rise
A loser's flag is waved up high
Disregarding all in their way
Accruing debt they cannot pay
Fuck their control
Force their control down
They think they're judge and jury
But they'll never fucking sentence me
Fuck their control
Force their control
Force their control
Force their control downEmbed
