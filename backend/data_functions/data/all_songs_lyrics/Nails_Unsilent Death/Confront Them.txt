Confront Them LyricsJealous cowards want to see us fail
Don't ever let them see you fail
Confront them, confront them
Confront them, confront them
They'll fight their wars based on lies
Shit on them and their plastic lives
Confront them, confront them
Confront them, confront them
Don't ever let them take what's yours
Confront them
Confront themEmbed
