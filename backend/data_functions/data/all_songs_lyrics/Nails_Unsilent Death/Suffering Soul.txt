Suffering Soul LyricsLost in yourself so frustrated
Fear, guilt, and deprecation
You hate what you see when you see me
Like a mirror self reflecting
Suffering soul
Losing control
Sick of all the shit that they've said
I never want to see their face again
Pain runs through these veins that were severed
You'll live in my shadow forever
Suffering soul
Losing control
Fuck all that shit in your mind
Your half truths are full of fucking lies1Embed
