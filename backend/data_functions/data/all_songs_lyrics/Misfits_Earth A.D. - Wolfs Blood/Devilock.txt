Devilock Lyrics
Don't mess with demon offspring
The virgin's demon offering
Their fury has no master
I am cancer

Gonna make this world bleed
Gonna make it pay
Gonna rip its core out
I am cancer, I am a devilock
I'll rip your heart out
I am a devilock
I pluck your eyes out of hell

The head of woken darkness
The head of potent evil
Its fury has no master
I am cancer

Gonna make this world bleed
Gonna make it pay
Gonna rip its core out
I am cancer, I am a devilock
I'll rip your heart out
I am a devilock
I rip your heart out of hell
Devilock
I'll rip your heart out
I am a devilock
I pluck your eyes out
I am a devilock
I rip your heart out of hell
Go, go, go, go, goEmbed
