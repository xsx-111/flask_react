Earth A.D. Lyrics
World is dead like I told you so
I bet you're gonna like it in A.D., A.D
Kingdom come is not so bad
A.D., A.D
Bloody hell is not so bad

See the heads on a picket fence
Oh you're really gonna like it in
A.D., A.D
Screaming hell is not so bad
A.D., A.D
A living hell is not so bad

You bet your life there's gonna be a fight
You bet your life because the hills have eyes I said
You bet your life there's gonna be a fight
You bet your because the hills have eyes
I said that guns are god
I said that death is mine to give to you

Oh, doom on earth as it is in hell
We'll see you dead and like it in
A.D., A.D
Kingdom come is not so bad
A.D., A.D
Ruling hell is not so bad
You bet your life there's gonna be a fight
You bet your life because the hills have eyes I said
You bet your life there's gonna be a fight
You bet your because the hills have eyes
I said that guns are god
I said that death is mine to give to you
You bet your life there's gonna be a fight
You bet your life because the hills have eyes I said
You bet your life there's gonna be a fight
You bet your because the hills have eyes
I said that guns are god
I said that death is mine to give to youEmbed
