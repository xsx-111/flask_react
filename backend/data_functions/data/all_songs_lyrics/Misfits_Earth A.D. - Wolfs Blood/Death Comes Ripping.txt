Death Comes Ripping Lyrics
Turn the lights down low and bar the doors up
Your future is coming, your future as a
Chopped up, hacked up, heaving piece of meat
When the door flies open, hot wind approaches you
Feel the heat, boy, feel the heat as it burns your balls off

Death comes ripping, then you know it
Death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
It'll rip your back out, death comes ripping out

Flex and hemorrhage, you bloody pulp
Door kicks open, a little too late to beg and pray

Death comes ripping, then you know it
Death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
It'll rip your back out
Death comes ripping, then you know it
Death comes ripping
You feel the heat as death comes ripping
It'll rip your back out
Death comes ripping, then you know it
Death comes ripping outEmbed
