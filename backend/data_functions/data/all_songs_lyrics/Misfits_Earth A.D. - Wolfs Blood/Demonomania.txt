Demonomania Lyrics
Look upon me, I am a beast

Demonomania, demonomania, demonomania
My father was a wolf
Demonomania, demonomania, demonomania
My mother was a whore

Check and see, reality of the wolf
It's in the blood, I wanna be the fucking savior
Humans are weak, what else you fucking do?
Humans are weak, I want your blood

Demonomania, demonomania, demonomania
My father was a wolf
Demonomania, demonomania, demonomania
My mother was a whore
Demonomania, demonomania, demonomania
My mother was a whore
Demonomania, demonomania, demonomania
My father was a wolfEmbed
