Bloodfeast Lyrics
When they pull out her tongue, pull off her face
Pluck out her eyes, then that blood must flow
When it drips from the mouth, be forewarned
Be prepared for a grisly bloodfeast

And that blood is just so real because you just can't fake it
And that blood is just so real because you just can't fake it

When you think of severed heads, think of my face
Think of your life, and then a human bloodfeast
When you think of my face, think of your blood
Think of your death, and then a great big bloodfeast

I'm obsessed with your death, obsessed with your blood
Obsessed with your demise and then a great big bloodfeast
I'm obsessed with your heart, obsessed with your tongue
Obsessed with your blood and then just-a-break you

And that blood is just so real because you just can't fake it
And that blood is just so real because you just can't fake it
And that blood, and that blood
I'm obsessed with your death, obsessed with your blood
Obsessed with your demise and then a great big bloodfeast
I'm obsessed with your heart, obsessed with your tongue
Obsessed with your blood and then just-a-break you

And that blood is just so real because you just can't fake it
And that blood is just so real because you just can't fake it
And that blood, and that blood1Embed
