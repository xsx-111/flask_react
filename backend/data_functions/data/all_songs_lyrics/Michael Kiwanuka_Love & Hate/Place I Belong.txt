Place I Belong Lyrics
Ooh, look all around
I get the feeling something is wrong
Ooh, I'm moving on
My friends are leaving, my friends are gone

You're walking fast
You're losing
You're leaving your path behind
You're growing (old?)

Ooh, what's on your mind?
You're growing older, you're losing time
Ooh, it's so unkind
There ain't nobody you can find

You're walking fast
You're losing
You're leaving your path behind
You're growing (old?)

 when I'm here on my own
I'm in a place I belong
 when I'm here on my own
I'm in a place I belongEmbed
