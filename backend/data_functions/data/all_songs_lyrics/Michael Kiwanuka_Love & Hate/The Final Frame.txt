The Final Frame Lyrics
I said I wanted you
And you from the start
I could tell you apart
But my heart fell and broke in two
You felt the pain for my foolish games
Didn't know what I stood to lose
I realized, that you'd be my life, it's true
Love's been a strain, a strain in my heart
I'm numb to the feeling

It's too late, to run away
The final frame will never know
Just float away, in our parade
Of love and pain, away we go, away we go

I said I wanted to
Do all I can, to be a good man
But the scene I fell into
Took me away, but what can I say?
It's the times, I'm living through
And we can't pretend
We're reaching the end, it's true
Love's been a strain, a strain in my heart
I'm numb to the feeling
It's too late, to run away
The final frame will never know
Just float away, in our parade
Of love and pain, away we go, away we go1Embed
