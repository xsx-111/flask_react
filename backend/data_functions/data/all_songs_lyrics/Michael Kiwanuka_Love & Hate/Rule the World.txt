Rule the World LyricsDo I have to rule the world?
Or will it come to me?
Do I have to live in doubt
Or will it turn to me?
Do I have to lose my mind?
Cause it's been wandering
Will they ever let me out?
I've been wondering
Help me to see
Who I can be
Help me to know
Where I can go
(take me)
Take me out of myself again
(help me)
Help me lose control
(show me)
Show me love, show me happiness
(love me)
I can't do this on my own
I don't understand the game
Or who I'm meant to be
It's driving me insane
The way you're playing me
Help me to see
Who I can be
Help me to know
Where I can go
(take me)
Take me out of myself again
(help me)
Help me lose control
(show me)
Show me love, show me happiness
(love me)
I can't do this on my own
(take me)
Take me out of myself again
(help me)
Help me lose control
(show me)
Show me love, show me happiness
(love me)
I can't do this on my own
(take me)
Take me
(help me)
Help me
(show me)
Show me
(love me)
Lo-o-ove
(take me)
(help me)
(show me)
Show me love, show me happiness
I can't do this on my own
(take me)
(help me)
(show me)
Take me out of myself again
Help me lose control
Show me love, show me happiness
I can't do this on my ownEmbed
