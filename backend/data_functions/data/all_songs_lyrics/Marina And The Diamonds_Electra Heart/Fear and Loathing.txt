Fear and Loathing Lyrics
I lived a lot of different lives
Been different people many times
I lived my life in bitterness
And filled my heart with emptiness

Now I see, I see it for the first time
There is no crime in being kind
Not everyone is out to screw you over
Maybe, yeah just maybe, they just want to get to know you

And now the time is here
Baby, you don't have to live your life in fear
The sky is clear
It's clear of fear

Don't wanna live in fear and loathing
I wanna feel like I am floating
Instead of constantly exploding
In fear and loathing

Got different people inside my head
I wonder which one that they like best
I'm done with tryna have it all
And ending up with not much at all
And now the time is here
Baby you don't have to live your life in fear
The sky is clear
It's clear of fear
Of fear

Don't wanna live in fear and loathing
I wanna feel like I am floating
Instead of constantly exploding
In fear and loathing

And when the time comes along
And the lights run out
I know a light will burn on
When they blow me out

Don't wanna live in fear and loathing
I wanna feel like I am floating
Instead of constantly exploding
In fear and loathing

I wanna be completely weightless
I wanna touch the edge of greatness
Don't wanna be completely faithless
Completely faithless
When the time comes around
When the lights will go out
When the time comes around
When the lights, they go out
Ποθώ γλυκές νεράιδες να δω
Και από κορμί ξωτικό μαγικό χορό
Να χαϊδέψω μαύρα μαλλιά
Να φιλήσω χείλη μελιά
Ένα τραγούδι απ' τ' Aλγέρι
Τραγούδι του καμηλιέρη
Σ' ένα γλυκό αφρικάνικο σκοπό20Embed
