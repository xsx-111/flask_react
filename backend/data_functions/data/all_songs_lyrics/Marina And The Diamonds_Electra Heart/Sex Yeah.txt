Sex Yeah Lyrics
Sex, sex, sex, sex (yeah)
Sex, sex, sex (la-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex (yeah)
Sex, sex, sex (la-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

Nothing is provocative anymore, even for kids
No room for imagining, 'cause everyone's seen everything

Question what the TV tells you (la-da-da)
Question what a pop star sells you (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Question mom and question dad (la-da-da)
Question good and question bad (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

If history could set you free (from who you were supposed to be)
If sex in our society (didn't tell a girl who she would be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what history has given me, me

Sex, sex, sex, sex (yeah)
Sex, sex, sex (la-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
If women were religiously recognized sexually
We wouldn't have to feel the need to show our ass-ets to feel free

Been there, done that, got the t-shirt (la-da-da)
Sold my soul, and yeah, the truth hurt (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Tired image of a star (la-da-da)
Acting naughtier than we really are (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

If history could set you free (from who you were supposed to be)
If sex in our society (didn't tell a guy who he should be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what history has given me, me

Sex, sex, sex, sex (yeah)
Sex, sex, sex (la-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex (yeah)
Sex, sex, sex (la-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)

All my life I've felt it deep inside of me
All this time was fighting for what I believe
All my life I've tried to hide what history has given me, me
If history could set you free (from who you were supposed to be)
If sex in our society (didn't tell a guy who he should be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what history has given me, me

Sex, sex, sex, sex (yeah)
Sex, sex, sex (la-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex (yeah)
Sex, sex, sex (la-da-da)
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex (la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da)38Embed
