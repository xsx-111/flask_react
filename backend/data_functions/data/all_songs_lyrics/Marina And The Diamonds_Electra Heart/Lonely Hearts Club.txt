Lonely Hearts Club Lyrics
Laugh track on a TV show
Echoes in the dark alone
I go to bed feeling bad
That I’m the reason that you’re sad

January to December
Do you wanna be a member?

Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?
Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?

I feel like if I’m too kind
Then you will only change your mind
Take advantage of my heart
And I’ll go back into the dark

Love will never be forever
Feelings are just like the weather
January to December
Do you want to be a member?
Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?
Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?

Oooh
Somebody like me?
Oooh
Somebody like me?
Oooh
Somebody like me?
Oooh

Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?
Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?

Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?
Oh! Oh!
Do you want to be with somebody like me?
Lonely hearts club
Do you want to be with somebody like me?15Embed
