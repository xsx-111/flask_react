Valley of the Dolls Lyrics
In the valley of the dolls, we sleep
We sleep
Got a hole inside of me
Of me

Born with a void
Hard to destroy with love or hope
Built with a heart, broken from the start
And now I die slow

In the valley of the dolls, we sleep
Got a hole inside of me
Living with identities
That do not belong to me
In my life, I got this far
Now I’m ready for the last hoorah
Dying like a shooting star
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley

Pick a personality for free
When you feel like nobody
Body
Born with a void
Hard to destroy with love or hope
Built with a heart, broken from the start
And now I die slow

In the valley of the dolls, we sleep
Got a hole inside of me
Living with identities
That do not belong to me
In my life, I got this far
Now I’m ready for the last hoorah
Dying like a shooting star
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley

Back to zero, here we go again, again
Racing down into oblivion
Back to zero, here we go
I can feel it coming to the end, the end

In the valley of the dolls, we sleep
Got a hole inside of me
Living with identities
That do not belong to me
In my life, I got this far
Now I’m ready for the last hoorah
Dying like a shooting star
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley
In the valley20Embed
