Radioactive Lyrics
Lying on a fake beach, you'll never get a tan
Baby, I'm gonna leave you drowning until you reach for my hand

In the night your heart is full and by the morning empty
But baby, I'm the one who left you, you're not the one who left me

When you’re around me, I’m radioactive
My blood is burning, radioactive
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive

Waiting for the nightfall for my heart to light up
Oh baby, I want you to die for, for you to die for my love

In the night your heart is full and by the morning empty
But baby, I'm the one who left you, you're not the one who left me
When you’re around me, I’m radioactive
My blood is burning, radioactive
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
Ready to be let down
Now I’m heading for a meltdown

Tonight I feel like neon gold
I take one look at you and I grow cold
And I grow cold
And I grow cold

When you’re around me, I’m radioactive
My blood is burning, radioactive
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
Ready to be let down
Now I’m heading for a meltdown
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear20Embed
