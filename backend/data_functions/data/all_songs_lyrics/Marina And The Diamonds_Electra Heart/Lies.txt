Lies Lyrics
You're never gonna love me, so what's the use?
What's the point in playing a game you're gonna lose?
What's the point in saying you love me like a friend?
What's the point in saying it's never gonna end?

You're too proud to say that you made a mistake
You're a coward till the end
I don't wanna admit that we're not gonna fit
No, I'm not the type that you like
Why don't we just pretend?

Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh
I can't let you go, can't let you go, oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh

You only ever touch me in the dark
Only if we're drinking can you see my spark
And only in the evening could you give yourself to me
'Cause the night is your woman, and she'll set you free
You're too proud to say that you made a mistake
You're a coward till the end
I don't wanna admit that we're not gonna fit
No, I'm not the type that you like
Why don't we just pretend?

Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh
I can't let you go, can't let you go, oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh

(Ooh)
(Lie-ee-i-ee-ies)

Lies
Don't wanna know, donâ€™t wanna know, oh
I can't let you go, can't let you go, oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh27Embed
