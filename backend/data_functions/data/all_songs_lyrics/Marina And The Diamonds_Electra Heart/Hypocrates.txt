Hypocrates Lyrics
You’re the lonely
One and only body in the world
Who can make me
Who can break me down into a young girl
You say that love is not that easy
And that’s the lesson that you teach me
So hypocritical, overly cynical
I’m sick and tired of all your preaching

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?

You’re my last bone of contention
That could break at any mention
You’re the last wall that will stand tall
Till the end of the world
I know you only want to own me
And that’s the kind of love you show me
You tell me one thing and do another
Keep all your secrets undercover

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?
Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go
Of me

Yeah you played the martyr for so long
That you can’t do anything wrong

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?

Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go
Yeah, you let, you let go
Of me

Who are you to tell me, tell me
Who to, to be, to be?15Embed
