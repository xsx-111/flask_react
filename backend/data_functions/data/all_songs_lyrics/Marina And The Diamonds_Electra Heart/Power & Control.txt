Power & Control Lyrics
Power and control

Give a little, get a lot
That’s just how you are with love
Give a little, get a lot
Yeah, you may be good looking
But you’re not a piece of art

Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall
Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall

Women and men, we are the same
But love will always be a game
We give and take a little more
Eternal game of tug and war

Think you’re funny, think you’re smart
Think you’re gonna break my heart
Think you’re funny, think you’re smart
Yeah, you may be good looking
But you’re not a piece of art
Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall
Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall

Women and men, we are the same
But love will always be a game
A human vulnerability
Doesn't mean that I am weak

That I am weak, I am weak
I am weak, I am weak, weak
Weak, weak, weak, weak

Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall
Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall

Women and men, we are the same
But love will always be a game
We give and take a little more
Eternal game of tug and war
Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall
Power and control
I’m gonna make you fall

I’m gonna make you fall
We give and take a little more
‘Cause all my life I’ve been controlled
You can’t have peace without a war
Without a war, without a war12Embed
