Poor Cow LyricsWhen all is gone and things go wrong we don't need them anymore
The artifice and all they lack, we don't need them anymore
I don't have the means and so it seems for now I can't participate
But I've waited long, now the dollar's strong again, I still can't participate
When we don't consume it seems we are immune to all of the thoughts they sell
You know as well as I, that's a lie
'Cause I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story but it always ends
I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story but it always ends
And when I die, the angels will try to count all my belongings
To measure my worth, pure gold, solid dirt, to see if I'm worth keeping
But the house I rent and the car I drive, I'm sorry but they ain't mine
You know as well as I, that's no lie
'Cause I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story but it always ends
I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story but it always ends
And it always ends, and it always endsEmbed
