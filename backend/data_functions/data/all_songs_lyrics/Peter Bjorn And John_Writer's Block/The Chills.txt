The Chills LyricsYour tongue is sharp
But I miss the taste of it
You said time heals
There's not enough of it
The lessons are too cruel to keep
To lock the door to hide the key
To hear you cast a spell so sweet
To still have hours left to sleep
Your fear is crowdin'
And there is still
No place
For someone
Like me to fill
Don't know about luck
But I know the lack of it
Don't know about luck
But I'm losing track of it
The lessons are too cruel to keep
To lock the door to go to sleep
I know that time until it kills
You're giving me the chills
Your fear is crowdin'
And there is still
No place
For someone
Like me to fill

The lessons are too cruel to keep
To lock the door to hide the key
To hear you cast a spell so sweet
And still have hours left to sleep
Your fear is crowdin'
And there is still
No place
For someone
Like me to fill
X2
The lessons are too cruel to keep
To lock the door to go to sleep
I know that time until it kills
You're giving me the chills
I know that time until it kills
You're giving me the chills
You're giving me the chills
You're giving me the chills1Embed
