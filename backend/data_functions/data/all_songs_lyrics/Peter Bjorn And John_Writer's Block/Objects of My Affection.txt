Objects of My Affection LyricsI remember when, when I first moved here a long time ago
'Cause I'd heard some song I used to hear back then a long time ago
I remember when, even further back in another town
'Cause I saw something written I used to say back then hard to comprehend
And the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree, I laugh more often now
I cry more often now, I am more me
But of course some days I just lie around and hardly exist
And can't tell apart what I'm eating from my hand or my wrist
'Cause flesh is flesh, flesh as flesh as flesh, the difference is thin
But life has a certain ability of breathing new life into me, so I breathe it in
It tells me here we are and we all are here
And it still can make sense
If you just show up and present an honest face
Instead of that grin
And the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree, I laugh more often now
I cry more often now, I am more me
And the other day, this new friend of mine said something to me
"Just because something starts differently doesn't mean it's worth less"
And I soaked it in, how I soaked it in, how I soaked it in
And just as to prove how right he was then you came
So I'm gonna give, yes I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you a try
So I'm gonna give, yes I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you a try
And the question is, was I more alive then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree, I laugh more often now
I cry more often now, I am more meEmbed
