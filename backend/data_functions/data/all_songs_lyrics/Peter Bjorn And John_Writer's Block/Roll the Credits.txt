Roll the Credits LyricsLet's take the easy way out, let's move away for good
Let's pull the curtains down and leave
It's between me and her now, can't separate at all
Let's put the cards back in the sleeve
She's stepping on my shoes and I couldn't want it more
That way I always know she's close
She's like a big orchestra playing my tiny tune
Let's pull the curtains down and leave
Let's take the easy way out, let's move away for good
Let's pull the curtains down and leave
It's between me and her now, can't separate at all
Let's put the cards back in the sleeve
She's stepping on my shoes and I couldn't want it more
That way I always know she's close
She's like a big orchestra playing my tiny tune
Let's pull the curtains down and leave
Let's take the easy way out, let's move away for good
Let's pull the curtains down and leave
It's between me and her now, can't separate at all
Let's put the cards back in the sleeve
She's stepping on my shoes and I couldn't want it more
That way I always know she's close
She's like a big orchestra playing my tiny tune
Let's pull the curtains down and leaveEmbed
