Start to Melt LyricsI start to melt with your arms 'round my waist
And your mouth starts to spell, and the words telling me to fade
I start to fade with your arms 'round my waist
And your mouth starts to spell, and the words telling me to stay
I start to melt with my arms'round your waist
And my mouth starts to spell, and the words saying it's OK1Embed
