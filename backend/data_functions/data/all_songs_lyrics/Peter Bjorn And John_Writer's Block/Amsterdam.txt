Amsterdam LyricsBaby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow
Baby went to Amsterdam
Four, five days for the Big Canal
Now it's so slow, so slow
And I was heading up north to a place that I know
Eating well, sleeping well
But still I was way, way out of line
Amsterdam was stuck in my mind
Oh, it's some kind of stupid rule
That you can't ignore
Oh, it's some kind of natural fact
Sometimes you're just left to be alone
Baby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow
Baby went to Amsterdam
Four, five days for the Big Canal
Now it's so slow, so slow
And I got to go away to a place of my own
Working hard, fill my time
From that day on, till I hit the bed
Amsterdam was stuck in my head
Oh, it's some kind of stupid rule
That you can't ignore
Oh, it's some kind of natural fact
Sometimes you're just left to be alone
Baby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow
Baby went to Amsterdam
Four, five days for the Big Canal
Now it's so slow, so slow
Baby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into traveling
Now it's so slow, so slow
Baby went to Amsterdam
Four, five days for the Big Canal
Now it's so slow, so slow, slow2Embed
