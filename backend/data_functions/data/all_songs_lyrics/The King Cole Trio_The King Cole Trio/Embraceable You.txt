Embraceable You LyricsEmbrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me
I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama, come to mama do
My sweet embraceable you
{instrumental interlude}
I love all the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to mama, come to mama do
My sweet embraceable youEmbed
