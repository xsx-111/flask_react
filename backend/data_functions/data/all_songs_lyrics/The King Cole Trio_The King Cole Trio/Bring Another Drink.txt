Bring Another Drink LyricsLast night we had a party
With some mellow chicks
At the gin mill down the street
Just to get some kicks
We sat down at the table
The cover was a deuce
The bad was swingin', in the mood
"Bring us all some juice"
We started lushin', the chicks got high
But they weren't high enough
'Cause we whispered love words in their ears
The chicks got rough, awful stuff
So let this be a lesson
You better stop and think
Before you whisper in her ear
Bring another drink
We started lushin', the chicks got high
But they weren't high enough
'Cause we whispered love words in their ears
The chicks got rough, awful stuff
So let this be a lesson
You better stop and think
Before you whisper in her ear
Bring another drinkEmbed
