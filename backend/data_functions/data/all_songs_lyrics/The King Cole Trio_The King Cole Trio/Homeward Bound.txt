Homeward Bound LyricsFeelin' very sad 'cause it's bad when you're all alone
Baby please prepare for me there, 'cause I'll soon be home
Can't imagine why, but I'm high and I still feel low
Only got a dime and a long long way to go!
The night that I went away from you, I was glad that you stayed behind
But the time that I spent away from you gave me time to change my mind!
Tell your other friends they don't have to hang around;
Baby, throw 'em out 'cause your man is homeward bound!
Tell your other friends they don't have to hang around;
Baby, throw 'em out 'cause your man is homeward bound!Embed
