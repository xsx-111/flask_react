Come To Baby, Do! LyricsI took a choo-choo-choo-choo fast as I could take a choo-choo
I've come a long long long long way to take you in my arms
And now it's your first move to prove that you've been true
Come to baby, do
I've been away way way way way beyond the blue horizon
I hope that no no no no no one else is on your mind
So pucker up, my sweet, and meet your Waterloo
Come to baby, do
Stop me from guessing
T'ain't no time to tease
Stop all your messin'
And put your beggin' baby at ease
I want to love-love-love you just the way I want to love you
I'm gonna try-try-try to try to make you understand
When all is said and done, the one for me is you
Come to baby, do
Comе to baby, do
I've come a long, long way to kiss ya
You'll nevеr know how much I missed ya
Stop your teasin'
Come to baby, doEmbed
