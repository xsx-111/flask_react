Got A Penny LyricsGot a penny, Benny?
I got to telephone to Jenny
And I've just got, just got
Four cents to my name
Got a penny, Benny?
Can't you guess I haven't any?
And I've got to, got to
Call that solid dame
I went down to the bank
But they had none to spare
I looked up on the shelf
But the cupboard was bare
Got a penny, Benny?
Got to telephone to Jenny
And I've just got, just got
Four cents to my name
I went down to the bank
But they had none to spare
I looked up on the shelf
But thе cupboard was bare
Got a penny, Benny?
Got to tеlephone to Jenny
And I've just got, just got
Four cents to my name
Four cents to my name
Four cents to my name
Ain't that a doggone shameEmbed
