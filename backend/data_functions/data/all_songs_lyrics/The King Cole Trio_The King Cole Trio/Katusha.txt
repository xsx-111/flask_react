Katusha Lyrics
Purple skies
Remind me of Katusha
My sweet love
Who is so far away
Bright young eyes
That smile at me so bravely
As we watched
The stars grow pale and grey

On the hill
I lingered with Katusha
Lingered 'til
The dawn came stealin' through
Oh my love
Katusha, my Katusha
I'll come back
Yes, I'll come back to you

On the hill
I lingered with Katusha
Lingered 'til
The dawn came stealin' through
Oh my love
Katusha, my Katusha
I'll come back
Yes, I'll come back to youEmbed
