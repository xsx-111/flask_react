Please Consider Me LyricsYou don't love me, it's true enough
But I love you, and that makes it tough
So darling please consider me
And can't you see that I'm not free
You locked my heart and you hid the key
Oh darling please consider me
What have I done to have such luck
I wish that I knew
I paid the price which wasn't so nice
For loving and losing you
My love for you has grown to make
Me pray the lord my soul you'll take
Oh darling please consider me
My love for you has grown to make
Me pray the lord my soul you'll take
Oh darling please consider me
Oh darling please consider meEmbed
