I Realize Now LyricsI realize now, I treated you so unkind
Can't realize how my heart could have been so blind
Blind as I've been, I must give in to this yearnin'
The torch I've tried to toss aside, just keeps on burnin'
So won't you forgive? I pray for the day you will
My heart wants to live, if you say it will, it will
Darlin', dream it over the way I had to do
'Cause I realized now, I've never stop lovin' you
Darlin', dream it over the way I had to do
'Cause I realized now, I've never stop lovin' youEmbed
