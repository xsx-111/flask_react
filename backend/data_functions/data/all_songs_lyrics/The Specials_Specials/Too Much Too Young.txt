Too Much Too Young LyricsYou've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me
Oh no, no gimme no more pickni
You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a son
When you should be having fun with me
We don't want, we don't want
We don't want no more pickni
Ain't he cute?
No he ain't
He's just another burden
On the welfare state
You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me
No gimme, no gimme, no gimme no more pickni
Call me immature
Call me a poser
I'd love to spread manure in your bed of roses
Don't want to be rich
Don't want to be famous
But I'd really hate to have the same name as you
(you silly moo)
You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me
Gi we de birth control, we no want no pickni
You've done too much
Much too young
Now you're chained to the cooker
Making currant buns for tea
Oh no, no gimme no more pickni
Ain't you heard of the starving millions
Ain't you heard of contraception
You really want a program of sterilization?
Take control of the population boom!
It's in your living room
Keep a generation gap
Try wearing a capEmbed
