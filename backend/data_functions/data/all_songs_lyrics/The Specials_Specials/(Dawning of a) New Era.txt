(Dawning of a) New Era LyricsThis is the dawning of a new era!
This is the dawning of a new era!
I met a girl from area three
She told me that she worked in a chicken factory
This is the dawning of a new era!
By two o'clock we were 'Brahms & Liszt'
I had to walk her home through area six
This is the dawning of a new era!
Sticks and stones may break my bones
In area six they throw bottles and bricks and kicks
This is the dawning of a new era!
I climbed the stairs to the fourteenth floor
The key won't fit the door
This is the dawning of a new era!
She said she had a beautiful flat
We had to sleep on the mat
This is the dawning of a new era!
Woke up and thought "This ain't exactly heaven"
Oh shit, this is area seven
This is the dawning of a new era!
This is the dawning of a new era!
This is the dawning of a new era!
This is so boring, it's a new era!Embed
