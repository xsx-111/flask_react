Monkey Man Lyrics
This one's for all the bouncers
Big, big monkey man

Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey man
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey man

I never saw you, I only heard of you
Huggin' up a big monkey man
I never saw you, I only heard of you
Huggin' up a big monkey man

It's no lie, it's no lie
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey man
It's no lie, it's no lie
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey man
Now I know that, now I understand
You're turning a monkey on me
Now I know that, now I understand
You're turning a monkey on me

Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey man
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey man

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la

I was on my way to Banbury Cross
Then I see a monkey upon a white horse
With rings on his fingers, bells on his toes
Sing a little song, wherever he be
'Cause he's a monkey, 'cause he's a monkey
'Cause he's a witty-bitty-switty-bitty monkey man
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey man
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Them a tell me you
Huggin' up a big monkey manEmbed
