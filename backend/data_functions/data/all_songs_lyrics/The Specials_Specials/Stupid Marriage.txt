Stupid Marriage LyricsCourt in session
What you mean 'Oy oy oy'? Me say court in session!
Order!
My name is Judge Roughneck
And I will not tolerate any disobedience in my courtroom
Rude Boy, you have been brought in front of me
And charged with smashing this woman's window
Before I sentence you, what have you got to say in your defence?
I was walking down the street one night
When I saw her silhouette in her bathroom light
Her way of life may be nothing to hide
With her frosted glass shattered, curtains open wide
Naked woman, naked man
Where did you get that nice sun tan?
You live in a castle built of sand
Naked woman, naked man
Naked from your bath, you go naked to your bed
And I can't stop the hatred running through my head
Silence in court! Order!
Rude Boy, you have led me to believe
That you was going out with a girl, and she left you
And married someone else. So you got drunk
And smashed up your ex-girlfriend's property
I have come to one conclusion
That is to sentence you to five months in prison
Before they take you down to the cells
What have you got to say for yourself?
He wanted to be something but she knows he never will
She's got him where she wanted and forgot to take her pill
And he thinks that she'll be happy
When she's hanging out the nappies
If that's a happy marriage I'd prefer to be unhappy
Married woman, married man
Where did you get that family plan?
Mrs. Ewe and Mr. Ram
Where did you get that lovely lamb?
Naked woman, naked man
Where did you get that nice sun tan? (Order in my courtroom!)
Naked woman, naked man
Where did you get that nice sun tan? (Hush up!)
Naked woman, naked man
Where did you get that nice sun tan? (Take him away!)Embed
