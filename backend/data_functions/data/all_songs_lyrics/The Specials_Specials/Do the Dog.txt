Do the Dog LyricsAll you punks and all you teds
National Front and Natti dreds
Mods, rockers, hippies and skinheads
Keep on fighting 'till you're dead
Who am I to say?
Who am I to say?
Am I just a hypocrite?
Another piece of your bullshit
Am I the dog that bit, the hand of the man that feeds it?
Do the dog, do the dog
Do the dog, not the donkey
Do the dog, don't be a jerk
Do the dog, watch who you work for
Do the do the do the do the dog
Everybody's doing the dog
Take your F.A. aggravation
Fight it out on New Street station
Master racial masturbation
Causes National Front frustration
Who am I to say?
To the IRA
To the UDA
Soldier boy from UK
Am I just a hypocrite?
Another piece of your bullshit
Am I the dog that bit, the hand of the man that feeds it?
Do the dog, do the dog
Do the dog, not the donkey
Do the dog, don't be a jerk
Do the dog, watch who you work for
Do the do the do the do the dog
Do the do the do the do the dog
Do the do the do the do the dog
Everybody's doing the dogEmbed
