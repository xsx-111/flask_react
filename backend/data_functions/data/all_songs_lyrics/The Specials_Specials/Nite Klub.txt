Nite Klub LyricsIs this the in place to be?
What am I doing here?
Watching the girls go by
Spending money on...
Sleep all day
It's the only way
I'm a parasite
I creep about at night
Nite Klub, is this the in place to be?
Nite Klub, what am I doing here?
Nite Klub, watching the girls go by
Spending money on...
Hey, hey, I don't work
Cos I don't have to
I don't have to work
There's no work to do
Nite Klub
I'm a member of the Nite Klub
Nite Klub
A fully paid up member of the Nite Klub
I won't dance in a club like this
All the girls are slags
And the beer tastes just like piss
I'm a parasite
I creep about at night
Yes I'm a member of the Nite Klub
A fully paid up member of the Nite Klub
Nite Klub, is this the in place to be?
Nite Klub, what am I doing here?
Nite Klub, watching the girls go by
Spending money on beer!Embed
