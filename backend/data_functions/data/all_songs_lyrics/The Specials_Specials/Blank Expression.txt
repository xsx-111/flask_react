Blank Expression LyricsSnow is falling all around
Seven o'clock and the roads are blocked
So I walk down town
There's no one around
I walk in a bar and immediately I sense danger
You look at me, girl, as if I was some kind of a total stranger
Where did you get that blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that blank expression on your face?
The streets are dark and there's no one about
I wander home and all the lights are out
I keep wondering
Where did you get that blank expression on your face?
REPEAT TO FADEEmbed
