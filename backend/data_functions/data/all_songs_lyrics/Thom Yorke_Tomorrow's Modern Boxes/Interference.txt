Interference Lyrics
We stare into each other's eyes
Like jackdaws, like ravens
The ground may open up and swallow us
In an instant
An instant

But I don’t have the right
To interfere
To interfere
I don’t have the right
To interfere
To interfere

In the future, we will change our numbers
And lose contact
In the future, leaves will turn brown
When we want them

And I don’t have the right
To interfere
To interfere
I don’t have the right
To interfere
To interfere
I don’t have the right
To interfere
