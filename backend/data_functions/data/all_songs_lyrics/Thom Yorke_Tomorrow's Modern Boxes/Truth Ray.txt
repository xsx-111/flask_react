Truth Ray Lyrics
Tender love's caught an easy ray
And I've lost everything
In the dust in your eyes
And in your hair
A rose-colored evil ray

Tender love's caught an easy ray
I won’t let go, I won’t let go
Don’t let go, don’t let go

Have you no mercy, no mercy?
What that now weakens me
And all of this is in my head
Oh my god, oh my god
All my life, sin, sin, sin

Tender love's caught an easy ray
I won’t let go, I won’t let go
Don’t let go, don’t let go

Have you no mercy, no mercy?
My love slips away from me
With iron wings and iron will
Have you no mercy, no mercy?
What is now awakening?
Oh my god, oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god
A rose-colored evil ray
And I’ve lost everything
All my life is sin, sin, sin
And all of this is in my head
Tender love's caught an easy ray
I won’t let go, I won’t let go
I won’t let go, I won’t let go11Embed
