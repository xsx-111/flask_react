The Mother Lode Lyrics
Another clown jumps off the ladder
A shallow pool but it doesn’t matter
The way it goes, the way it goes
He’s falling through barriers and hedgerows

A hollow man, hollow hand puppet
Where’s the applause when you need it?

The baseball bats, somersaults and backflips
Oh, how I wish some things would be different
A mother lode, a mother lode

A hollow man, hollow hand puppet
I’m a clown, you don’t wanna know me
The knife behind the curtain
The truth is ordinary


You can’t see your way out of this one
He makes a joke but nobody listens
At least he does not know it
The last of all his courage
Press the button for a free ticket
Here he goes, hits the ground running9Embed
