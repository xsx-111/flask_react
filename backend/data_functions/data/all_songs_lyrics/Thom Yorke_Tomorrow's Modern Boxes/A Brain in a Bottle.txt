A Brain in a Bottle Lyrics
Lord, why hast thou forsaken us?
Still, answer, come and talk to us
Looked in your eyes, in your eyes
Seagulls laugh and pick the bones
The entity I wrestle to the ground
With demon eyes, demon eyes

Chill, chill, chill, chill

Somedays I'm gonna break myself in two
It’s like I've forgotten you
Think I’m gonna go to pieces now
I come out fighting back (in the dark)
Fall in love in the dark

Chill, chill, chill, chill

Think I’m gonna slow my dance to you
Like we already knew
Throw a punch, I'll just keep bouncing back
Come out fighting back
Chill, chill, chill, chill13Embed
