Nose Grows Some Lyrics
I don’t know when this night will end
If I open up the door
To the back of your sunken mind
And then in will come the flood
When it all becomes too much
I have swept the crises
In the times you are afraid
In a room full of clocks
If I’m blowing myself away
Through the bad times

Two birds on a wall
Your nose just grows

I need just another drop
It is metal and it’s cold
I wait up on the rocks
I am waiting on the tide
Through the bad times
If I’m blowing myself away
Under hot fluorescent lights

Two birds on a wall
Your nose just grows and grows
One day I’ll grow up tall
I will be with you3Embed
