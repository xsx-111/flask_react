Guess Again! Lyrics
Wild dogs are howling
Behind the curtains
I hold onto my children
The creatures staring in
All of my nightmares
Are in the garden

Guess again

I’m fighting in the darkness
The one who can’t be killed
Elastic and bionic man

Guess again

As one door shuts
Another opens

Guess again
It seems your number’s up
It seems your number’s up
It seems your number’s up
Guess again
It seems your number’s up
It seems your number’s up1Embed
