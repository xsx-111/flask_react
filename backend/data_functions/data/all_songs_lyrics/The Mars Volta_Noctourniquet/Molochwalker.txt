Molochwalker Lyrics
The world is burned, it never hurts
Shanks round the bend when you're foaming at the binge
On your serrated edge, you're like a snail that sticks
The hiss I make is warning to the scoundrel

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny
When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

When nobody wants to fix this frame
The guilty presence starts to vellicate
Fall into the strangle, skip around the neck
This albatross is warning with extreme prejudice

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny
When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny
When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

Half of the time
I'm never clean
Filth of my filth
Can't get no relief
Half of the time
I see the weak
Don't roll your eyes
If still you can't see
All of my coins
You've taken and gave
They fill your void
And still you're empty
What's that set of numbers doing?
Count my fingers till extinction1Embed
