Noctourniquet Lyrics
Made my bed in drought of barrel
I haven't shot this thing in years
Do you think I'll fold?
Calloused hands of detriment
From a crossbow flinch of gasping air
Do you think I'llâ€¦

Solomon, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden
Solomon, your hollow heart
A nomadic void of halcyon youth

Prenatal at the hips where we once joined
Severed by the scalpel when we were young
Do you think I'll fold?
Held under the water in a breathless trough
Buried in the plot of your front steps
Do you think I'll fold?
Incinerate the faith that you were taught
Incinerate your crone of useless flesh
Do you think that

Solomon, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden
Solomon, your hollow heart
A nomadic void of halcyon youth
Solomon, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden
Solomon, your hollow heart
A nomadic void of halcyon youth
And in this life you long to flee
You can stop the rain from falling
Tie it on in your mind
It's your Noctourniquet
And in your file will it read
That you caved it to the night?
Tie it on in your mind
It's your Noctourniquet

Made my bed in drought of barrel
I haven't shot this thing in years
Do you think I'll fold?
Bucolic hymns that frolic on your hissing tongue
The rivalry of siblings cut from saffron cloth
Do you think I'll fold?
I'll reach right through the pavement with the shortest straw
Never a dull blade in your mother's drawer
Do you think I'll fold?
Place it in the thirst her endless flask
The iridescent poison will quench foreboding
Do you think that

Solomon, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden
Solomon, your hollow heart
A nomadic void of halcyon youth
Solomon, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden
Solomon, your hollow heart
No matter what it takes, no matter what it takes for you1Embed
