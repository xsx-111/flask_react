Aegis Lyrics
The days are catching up to me
My unconscious fear unbound
Is it time to tailor fit the notion
That come Sunday I'm in the ground?
The obelisk fumes have occupied, emphatically austere
A smelter pile made by the debt collector

Where the children should be seen, not heard
Even if there is no way back home

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away

Can you hear him saber rattling
With bones I've left behind?
Obloquy is the bulwark of his implants
Am I your son or just a clone?
Dasehra you were sworn to be, a window to my night
My subterfuge, just branches to the mandrake
Where the children should be seen, not heard
Even if there is no way back home

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away

Under the aegis of cognition
I am dead, I will escape
Engrammic marks of ligature
I am dead, I will escape
Under the aegis of cognition
I am dead, I will escape
Engrammic marks of ligature
Am I dead? Will I escape?

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
(Am I running away?)
I'm not running away
(Am I running away?)
I'm not running away
(Am I running away?)
I'm not running away
(I am running away)1Embed
