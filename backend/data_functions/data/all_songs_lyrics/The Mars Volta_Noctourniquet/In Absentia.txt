In Absentia Lyrics
There was once a boy with knives stuck in his voice
All he wanted, all he wanted was a little affection
Until one day he caved into his mother's taste
All she wanted, all she wanted was to spread her infection

He spins her spindle weaving fuse
Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend
Her broken flesh

They've stolen all my love, buried in absentia rose
Can you hear my vitreous heart breaking in absentia rose?
Smoke stack burning, eidolon turning
I won't ever let you go
They've stolen all my love
Yes, they've stolen all my love

He brings her the bait, she makes him her pet
Does he want some, does he want a little insurrection?
With oneiric gaze in somatic days
Ocular incision tell me I'm the reason
I've just gotta get out of here
He spins her spindle weaving fuse
Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend
Her useless flesh

They've stolen all my love, buried in absentia rose
Can you hear my vitreous heart breaking in absentia rose?
Smoke stack burning, eidolon turning
I won't ever let you go
They've stolen all my love
Yes, they've stolen all my love

Taken by the night, divagate remembrance
Check the puzzle, does it fit?
I am alpha and omega
And on the seventh day I rise
Past the pangs of my resistance
When the son gives up his throne
What becomes of this theft?

Dasehra, make these shackles go away
Dasehra, make these shackles go away
Dasehra, won't you help me stand my ground if I should fall?
Dasehra, as long as I am injured
Dasehra, as long as I remember
Dasehra, as long as I am injured
Dasehra, as long as I remember
Dasehra, as long as I am injured
Dasehra, as long as I remember
Dasehra, as long as I am injured2Embed
