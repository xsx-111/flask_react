Vedamalady Lyrics
Here it comes again
Mesh of arms travels up my neck
Morning dawn declares itself
And mirrors stare back at my reflection

When I'm alone, I'm alone at night
I want winter to fall on me
And I'm alone, I'm alone in flight
I am free of equity
Where did I go wrong?
I've got a sneaking suspicion that I'm under
A kindred connivance
I'm written in runes

Here it comes again
Malady of Veda in your ears
Flood the class adorns your lips
I can't stop myself because

When I'm alone, I'm alone at night
I will set my father free
And I'm alone, I'm alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key
Where did I go wrong?
I've got a sneaking suspicion it ain't over
A kindred connivance
I'm written in ruins
Long way patience to drown
Little prayers that you won't say for me
Long way patience to drown
Spin through my spiral, I dance dwindling
Long way patience to drown
You call me, I answer and all I can do is obey
Long way patience to drown
I can't hold my breath for this long

When I'm alone, I'm alone at night
I wanna set my father free
And I'm alone, I'm alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key
Where did I go wrong?
I've got a sneaking suspicion it ain't over
I won't let you, I won't let them
Set me to repeat1Embed
