Dyslexicon Lyrics
Nature red in tooth and claw
I haven't seemed to keep my powder dry
I always seem to hear it in your laughter
The second that I fell in love
With the handle of your revolver
I always seem to hear it in your laughter
I begged to you a second chance
With dried white roads to Bethlehem
I always seem to hear it in your laughter

Am I the valency that you deny?

In the time of the sixth sun
We are cattle to the prod
And I burn this dictionary
Because it's my dyslexicon

When I collapse and bury all the things
Unconsciously I hear cackling in chloroform
This spectre will ensnare
I always seem to hear it in your laughter
A braided strand of children's manes
Acquired with impunity
I always seem to hear it in your laughter
The things you say to me are deaf in tongue
I always seem to hear it in your laughter
Am I the valency that you deny?

In the time of the sixth sun
We are cattle to the prod
And I burn this dictionary
Because it's my dyslexicon

You've never tasted heaven
Stood your mother filled with grief
In the wake of Monday morning
Culprit void of breath with guile
If fate is your endearment
Through pistil and through stem
In the wake of Monday morning
A culprit void of breath with guile
And on the seventh day
You will come to find
My prism is not colorblind
In death's mosaic spirit
A culprit void of breath with guile
That's why I repent
That's why I go under
That's why I repent
That's why I go under
That's why I repent for the night

In the time of the sixth sun
We are cattle to the prod
And I burn this dictionary
Because it's my dyslexicon

In the time of the sixth sun
We are cattle to the prod
And I burn this dictionary
Because it's my dyslexicon
It's my dyslexicon2Embed
