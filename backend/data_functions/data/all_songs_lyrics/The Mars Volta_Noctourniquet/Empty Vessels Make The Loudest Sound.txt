Empty Vessels Make The Loudest Sound Lyrics
If I trust in the wind, she will pave me a different road
I will try and start over, but I think I must choose someone else
I am pulled from the pages where the letters lack the pigment of trust

Must be on my way, I've gotta get home
Won't be back someday, so let it unfold

I've abandoned the outcome in search of the rest I deserve
You can do what you will with my body, but I won't ring the bell
I've omitted the chapters that bow and admit defeat

Must be on my way, I've gotta get home
Won't be back someday, so let it unfold

Higher than mountains of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog
Higher than mountains of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Of the flowers that grew from the cracks in the ground you paved
Didn't you think he would warn me through the thorns of my waking dreams?
When the riddles connected the dots of this constellation
Must be on my way, I've got to get home
Won't be back someday, so let it unfold

HIgher than mountains of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog
Higher than mountains of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

I found a reason to leave you with this love
All I can do is forgive your broken heart
Trapped in this town made of amber for too long
All I can do is forgive your broken heart

Higher than mountains of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog
Higher than mountains of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog1Embed
