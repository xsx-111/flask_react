The Malkin Jewel Lyrics
I must've crawled through your bedroom door in a fit of jealous breath
Perched up on the Bacchus foot of your unsuspecting bed
From the blossom rags in my jackal croon to the stems of the cinquefoil
I give to you the shrapnel with which to sprinkle in her soil because

All the traps in the cellar go clickety clack 'cause you know I always set them for you

And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
Yeah, you know they're gonna take me to you

Yeah, for you
And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
Yeah, you know they're gonna take me to you

Yawning with hunger, they take turns of nourishment
And she says

From the mountains of avarice this I beg to you
My ether turns flesh to gravel

All the traps in the cellar go clickety clack 'cause you know I always set them for you
Yeah, for you
And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps 'cause you know they're gonna take me to you
Yeah, to you

All the traps in the cellar go clickety clack 'cause you know I always set them for you
Yeah, for you
And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps 'cause you know they're gonnaâ€”Embed
