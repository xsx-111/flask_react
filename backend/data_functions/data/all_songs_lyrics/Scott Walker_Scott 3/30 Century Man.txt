30 Century Man Lyrics
See the dwarves and see the giants
Which one would you choose to be?
And if you can't get that together
Here's the answer, here's the key

You can freeze like a 30 century man
Like a 30 century man

I'll save my bread and take it with me
'Til a hundred years or so
Shame you won't be there to see me
Shakin' hands with Charles De Gaulle

Play it cool and saran wrap all you can
Be a 30 century man
You can freeze like a 30 century man
Like a 30 century manEmbed
