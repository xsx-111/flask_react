We Came Through Lyrics
We came through
We came riding through like warriors from afar
Our black horses danced upon the graves of yesterday's desires
Haunted by our visions framed in fire
I greet you, for you still believe in what's behind a door
You've seen the children freeze upon their knees
And praying to the wind
Descend their grey madonnas back again

Fire the guns, and salute the men who died for freedom's sake
And we'll weep tonight, but we won't lie awake
Gazing up at statues dressed in stars
We won't dream, for they don't come true for us, not anymore
They've run far away to hide in caves with haggard, burning eyes
Their icy voices tear our hearts like knives

We came through
Like the Gothic monsters perched on Notre Dame
We observe the naked souls of gutters pouring forth mankind
Smothered in an avalanche of time
And we're giants
As we watch our kings and countries raise their shields
And Guevara dies encased in his ideals
And as Luther King's predictions fade from view
We came through
We came through
We came through
We came riding throughEmbed
