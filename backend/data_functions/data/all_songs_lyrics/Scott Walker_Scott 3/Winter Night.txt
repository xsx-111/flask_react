Winter Night Lyrics
You're like a winter night
Your thoughts are frozen
You kiss your lovers
In the snow
Too many icy tears
Glisten for someone

You watch the leaves
As they shiver your loneliness
Your eyes are lanterns
Growing dim
I hum inside
Like the meadows in summer
But I'll never light them up againEmbed
