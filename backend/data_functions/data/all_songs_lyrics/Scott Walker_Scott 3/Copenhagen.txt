Copenhagen Lyrics
Hope for me, I hope for you
We're snowdrops falling through the night
We'll melt away before we land
Two teardrops for somebody's hand
Follow me into just one more Spring

Copenhagen, you're the end
Gone and made me a child again
Warmed my feet beneath cold sheets
Dyed my hair with your sunny streets
Children aren't afraid to love and laugh
When life amuses them
And our love is an antique song
For children's carousels2Embed
