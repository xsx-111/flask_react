Funeral Tango Lyrics
Oh, I can see them now clutching a handkerchief
And blowing me a kiss discreetly asking how
How come he died so young or was he very old
Is the body still warm, is it already cold?
All doors are open wide they grope around inside
My desk, my drawers, my trunk there's nothing left to hide
Some love letters are there, an old photograph
They've laid my poor soul bare and all they do is laugh
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha - ha, ha, ha!

Oh, I can see them all, so formal and so stiff
Like a sergeant-at-arms at a policeman's ball
And everybody's pushing to be the first in line
Their hearts upon their sleeves like a ten-cent valentine
The old women are there too old to give a damn
They even brought the kids who don't know who I am
They're thinking about the price of my funeral bouquet
What they're thinking isn't nice, for now they'll have to pay
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha - ha, ha, ha

Oh, I see all of you all of my phony friends
Who can't wait till it ends who can't wait till it's through
Oh, I see all of you you've been laughing all these years
And now all you have left are a few crocodile tears
Ah, you don't even know that you're entering your hell
As you leave my cemetery, you think you're doing well
With that one who's at your side you're as proud as you can be
Ah, she's going to make you cry but not the way you cried for me
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha - ha, ha, ha
Oh, I can see me now, so cold and so alone
As the flowers slowly die in my field of little bones
Oh, I can see me now I can see me at the end
Of this voyage that I'm on without a love, without a friend
Now all this that I see is not what I deserve
They really have a nerve to say these things to me
No, girls, just bread and water and your money you must save
Or there'll be nothing left for us when you're dead and in your grave
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ha, ha, haEmbed
