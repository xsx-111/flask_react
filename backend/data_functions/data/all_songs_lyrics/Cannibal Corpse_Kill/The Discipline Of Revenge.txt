The Discipline Of Revenge LyricsPatience is my ally
Design should not be rushed
Aspirations long forgotten
Never left my mind
My rage must be controlled
My plans require time
My rage must be controlled until the time is right
Mastery of self control
Seething deep inside
Enemies oblivious
My ruse has made them blind
My rage must be controlled
My plans require time
My rage must be controlled until the time is right
My hate has been concealed
My time has come at last
My hate has been concealed but now the scum will die
Batter the face
Crushing the pompous fool
Retaliation
This was worth the wait
Endurance
Deception
Abhorrence
Vengeance
Wounds of the enemy
Oozing hypocrisy
Duplicitous slime
They are less than nothing
Twisted
Slaves to their vanity
They are beneath my feet
Only now can they learn
As my boot kicks their heads
Pitiless tormenting
Resolve never wavering
Contemptible pieces of human trash litter my life
Victory was certain
They never saw it coming
Years of planning have paid off
Voice inside silencedEmbed
