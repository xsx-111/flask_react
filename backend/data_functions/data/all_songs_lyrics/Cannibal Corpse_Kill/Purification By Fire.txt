Purification By Fire LyricsInternal burning
An omen reborn
Embrace the torture
Purify the soul
Bathe in red hot coals, dripping skin becomes a pleasure
Face begins to melt, liquid from the head rewarding
Eternal burning
Sancified with flames
Unholy recourse
The demons are here
Unleash the fury
Body slowly burnt, vital organs charred and blackened
Scorch to disinfect is the method for acceptance
Purification by fire
Transformation is rapture
Beyond recognition and deranged from the cleansing
Frenzied schizophrenic a memory before the scalding
Sacrifice for pain
Unrelenting heat scrambles the senses
Caustic remedy betrays existence
Hellish invasion just part of the plan
Beasts have been summoned to conquer again
Unleash the fury
Internal bleeding
An omen reborn
Embrace the torture
Purify the soul
Bathe in red hot coals, dripping skin becomes a pleasure
Face begins to melt, liquid from the head rewarding
Body slowly burnt, vital organs charred and blackened
Scorch to disinfect is the method for acceptance
Purification by fire
From within the torment is complete
Any worthy future now obsolete
Purification by fire
Transformation is raptureEmbed
