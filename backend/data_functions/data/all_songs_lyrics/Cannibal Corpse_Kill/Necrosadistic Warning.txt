Necrosadistic Warning LyricsHordes of the rotting dead surround the villagers
Unwary victims mangled and battered
Once buried warriors have risen to kill again
Signs of their wickedness left for a warning
Mutilate
Disembowel
Amputate
Kill and rape
Gratification achieved by dismemberment
Unnatural legions ravage the carcasses
Open wounds targets for evil defilers
Seeds of iniquity cover the body parts
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Violate
Death so foul
Ejaculate
Pieces raped
Bound with intestines the body is held upright
Travelers encounter the gruesome monition
Terrorized realization of coming death
They will be next for the army of killers
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Remains are on display
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Molested corpses hang
Undead
Molest
Defile
Kill them
Butcher
Then fuck
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Discharge on the corpse
Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
Necrosadistic warning
Desecration of the deadEmbed
