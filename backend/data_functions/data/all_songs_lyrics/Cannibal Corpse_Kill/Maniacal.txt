Maniacal LyricsRage, taking control of my mind
Driving me to
Kill without mercy
I see red
Blood on
My hands
My knife
Crazed, boiling blood pumps through my heart
Pushing me to
Respond with violence
I spill their
Blood with
Vicious
Cruelty
Maniacal
Psychopath
Slash through the crowd of faces leaving a trail of bloody dead
Hold down the scumbag, slice off his ear, gouge out his fucking eyes
Pounding the human maggots, broken bones cause screams of pain
Femur pokes through the muscles in his upper leg, I wrench it out with force
Stabbing the faces
Knocking out teeth with my nail spiked bat
Internal damage
Trauma from beatings causes organs to burst
Maniacal
Psychopath
Chunks of butchered victims cover the floor in my wake
Frenzied battery and slashing slung pieces of face on the ceilings and walls
Raging violence will consume all of my damaged brain
Ruthless murders are the only way to make this impulse abate
Maniacal
PsychopathEmbed
