Buzzers Lyrics
"Milosevic couldn't care less if Bosnia was recognized" a laughing Dr. Karadzic later told a television interviewer. He said, "Caligula proclaimed his horse senator but the horse never took his seat."

Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
Shinier still and stick the fork in him
He's done boys
He's done boys

Where will you sleep my stomach
My second stomach through the trees
Handicapped, buzzing out on the steppes
Spooking yourself in the breeze
Somebody dies, somebody don't shave
Ruminating the slimy stars

Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
(Kad tad, kad tad, kad tad, kad tad)
Polish it more and stick the fork in him
(Kad tad, kad tad, kad tad, kad tad)
Shinier still and stick the fork in him
He's done boys
He's done boys
Faces of the grass go lengthening
The lengthening faces through the ice and the sun
Faces lengthen go lengthening faces
Into lengthening faces from the branch to the grass
With buried heads they stand in full view
Eyes sliding of the faces up and up
Slide up the faces and up the sun
And up the faces go lengthening faces
Eyes are sliding above the tall and peaceful grass

Polish the fork and stick the fork in him
(Kad tad, kad tad, kad tad, kad tad)
Polish it more and stick the fork in him
(Kad tad, kad tad, kad tad, kad tad)
Shinier still and stick the fork in him
He's done boys
He's done boysEmbed
