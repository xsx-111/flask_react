Cue Lyrics
What do Seoul/Sudan have in common?
Both start with an S
Deep as a virus
Little Mary, little Mary
From scratchless I ascend
Stamps tongue-swabbed

Now embark for the Ivory Coast
Chiming like mouse bells
Bam bam bam bam
Bam bam bam bam
At the birth of a vermin Holy Ghost
Stars led to sky, lash led to eye
Herpes to clit, then stopped

Expect I'm carried by lanterns
Expect I will follow the aerosol patterns

Immunity
Won't feed on the bodies
Bones closing too soon at the tips
Won't feed on the bodies
From the fat black crocodile on the sand bar
Can't swallow it then bury it
From the voice flooded semen clotting to paste
Can't swallow it then bury it
And the jigger raps pits, darkness long
Jigger raps pits
Bam bam bam bam
Bam bam bam bam

Shoes made to shine, splicing to swine
Strain after strain, after strain, after strain
Immunity
Immunity

Through the dominant wards and nurseries
A flugleman moves
In the lung-smeared slides and corridors
A flugleman moves
And his tune rises
On the harvest clouds of dust
Trading the wah-wah's for
Bam bam bam bam
Bam bam bam bam
Stars led to sky
Toe led to thigh
Tumour to breast
Then stoppedEmbed
