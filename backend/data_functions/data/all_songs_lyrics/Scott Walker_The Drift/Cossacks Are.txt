Cossacks Are Lyrics
"A moving aria for a vanished style of mind"
"A noble debut, tackling vertiginous demands"
"Has absence ever sounded so eloquent, so sad? I doubt it"

With an arm across the torso
Face on the nails
With an arm across the torso
Face on the pale monkey nails

"Touching the shattered lives it unearths"
"A nocturne filled with glorious ideas"
"A chilling exploration of erotic consumption"

With an arm across the torso
Face on the nails
With an arm across the torso
Face on the pale monkey nails

Cossacks are charging in
Charging into fields of white roses
Cossacks are charging in
Charging into fields of white roses
"That's a nice suit"
"That's a swanky suit"
"Been a pope like no other"
"I'm looking for a good cowboy"
"A rare outcry makes you lead a larger life"
"You could easily picture this in the current top ten"
"Medieval savagery, calculated cruelty"
It's hard to pick the worst moment, It's hard to pick the worst moment

With an arm across the torso
Face on the nails
With an arm across the torso
Face on the pale monkey nailsEmbed
