Psoriatic Lyrics
Neath the bougie a thimble rigger slyly rolls the pea
Bye the bye, the bye, the bye
Red is patchy, snows the silver
Bye the bye, the bye, the bye
Can't turn from a crotch in the darkness
To turn to the valley of a king
Ja-da, ja-da
Ja-da ja-da, jing jing jing

Wrapped in blankets then in blankets
Hear the germs pinging on the night wind
Cross the west coast to the west coast
To the west coast the Angelus begins
Eye for hand, dye y'et eye
Bye-t the negro, come on sucker
Anthrax Jesus, sack of the'b
Shawl for he'b, no bye the bye
Pulling out won't be slow
Sorry baby b' the needles
Another night I gotta pull
Muffle bye, no, bye the bye
By the bye, no, bye the bye

Neath the bougie a thimble rigger slyly rolls the pea
Bye the bye, the bye, the bye
Red is patchy, snows the silver
Bye the bye, the bye, the bye
Don't think it hasn't been fun because it hasn't
Donje is Donje in the spring
Ja-da, ja-da
Ja-da ja-da, jing jing jing
Here the blankets, here come the blankets
They plunge like rays snapping down the night wind
Cross the east coast to the east coast
Scratch the air and blue burn, the Angelus begins
Pulling out won't be slow
Sorry baby, stuff the chancellor
Dreamed he mans, gathered yet
Bye the bye, no, bye the bye
Scaling comes, scaling comes
Red is patchy, snows the silver
Another night I gotta pull
Muffle bye, no, bye the bye
Bye the bye, no, bye the byeEmbed
