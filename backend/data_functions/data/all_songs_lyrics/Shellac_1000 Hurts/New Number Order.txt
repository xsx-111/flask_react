New Number Order LyricsOkay
Here's what we're going to do
We all know the numbers right?
From zero to infinity
Whatever
Some other number with a mess of zeros behind it
Here's what we're going to do
We're gonna change the order
Of these numbers
To make things interesting
Okay here we go:
1 Million and 1
Sixty-six
1 Billion, twenty-five, seventy-five thousand
1 Billion and eight, six, something
Zero
1 Million 1
Twenty-two
Seventy-five
Eleven
Eleven
Ok this is the new order
The New Number OrderEmbed
