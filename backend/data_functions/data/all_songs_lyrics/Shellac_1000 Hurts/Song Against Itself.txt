Song Against Itself LyricsThis is the song against itself
It's of two minds of it's own
The discussion brought to logical conclusion
It follows through
But is not true
We'll just write a song against itself
Why do you act like you don't know
What in the world I'm talking about?
It follows through
You have no clue
(I've already had it up with you)
(I've already had it up with you)
(I've already had it up with you)
(I've already had it up with you)
(I've already had it up with you)Embed
