1000 hurts

To the one true God above:
Here is my prayer -
Not the first you've heard, but the first I wrote
Not the first, but the others were a long time ago
There are two people here, and I want you to kill them

Her - she can go quietly, by disease or a blow
To the base of her neck
Where her necklaces close
Where her garments come together
Where I used to lay my face...
That's where you oughta kill her
In that particular place
Him - just fucking kill him, I don't care if it hurts
Yes I do, I want it to
Fucking kill him but first
Make him cry like a woman
No particular woman
Let him hold out, hope that
Someone or other might come then fucking kill him

Fucking kill him
Kill him already, kill him
Fucking kill him, fucking kill him
Kill him already, kill him
Fucking kill him!
Fucking kill him!
Kill him already, kill him
Just fucking kill him!
Fucking kill him!
Fucking kill him already, kill him
Ah, fucking kill him
Fucking kill him
Kill him already, kill him
Kill him already
Kill him already
Kill him, fucking kill him
Just fucking kill him
Fucking kill him
Kill him already, kill him
Fucking kill him
Kill him
Fucking kill him already, kill him
Kill him, fucking kill him
Kill him, just fucking kill him
Kill him already
Kill him already
Kill him
