Watch Song Lyrics
Hey man, I wanna have a fight with you
Regardless of my feelings on the subject
It appears that I am going to
Get up to fight, forget about it
I've paid more than anyone would advise for this watch and so far I am disappointed in it
It beeps at me at noon and seven and five and I cannot turn off the piece of shit

Hey man, hey!
Hey man, I wanna have a fight with you
From the way that you behave, it is clear to me you would like to have one too
Let's stop, dance, and do what we both came here to do

Hey man, hey!
Hey!
Hey man!
Hey man, hey, hey!
Hey man, I wanna have a fight with you
From the way that you behave, it is clear to me you would like to have one tooEmbed
