Mama Gina LyricsOh, my mama Gina
Had a sister, Angelina
If there is a heaven
(though I think that there's no heaven)
She's probably dancing with you...
She liked to dance; she would've liked you
When she heard you died
My pretty girlfriend cried
And cried and cried
And cried and cried
And cried and cried and cried and cried...
She liked to dance and she would've liked you
(Alright, stop! Stop! Stop!)Embed
