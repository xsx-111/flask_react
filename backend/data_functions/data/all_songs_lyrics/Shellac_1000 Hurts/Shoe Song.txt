Shoe Song LyricsI still remember hearing your shoe hit the floor
Do you get the same jokes as me?
Do you get the jokes the same as me?
I remember the first kiss;
I don't remember the last
Smash my skull on the sidewalk...with the truth
I don't remember the last time
I didn't know
And I miss you
I miss you1Embed
