Ghosts LyricsShe's making ghosts
She's so happy
Ballroom dancing
Spinning
Falling ghosts
Real ghosts
Roam the earth forever
Real ghosts
Didn't ask to be
All her goodness
All her goodness
Pray she doesn't make you
Pray she doesn't
Or anyone you know
(unintelligible)
Carnival worker
Presidents
Sacagawea
Show jumper
A television clown
(unintelligible)
Madam Curie
Ballerinas, she's crazy about ballerinas
(unintelligible)Embed
