Shadow of a Lonely Man LyricsLook at me now, a shadow of the man I used to be
Look through my eyes and through the years of loneliness you'll see
To the times in my life when I could not bear to lose, a simple game
And the least of it all was the fortune and the fame
But the dream seemed to end just as soon as it had begun, was I to know?
For the last thing of all that was on my mind, was the close at the end of the show
The shadow of a lonely man, feels nobody else
In the shadow of a lonely, lonely man
I can see myself
(looking out of nowhere, looking out of nowhere)
But the sound of the crowds when they come to see me now, is not the same
And the jest of it all is I can't recall my name
But I'll cling to a hope till I can't hold on anymore, anymore
And for all the acclaim I am all alone and I see as I look through the door
The shadow of a lonely man, there's nobody else
In the shadow of a lonely, lonely man
I can see myself
Look at me now, a shadow of the man I used to beEmbed
