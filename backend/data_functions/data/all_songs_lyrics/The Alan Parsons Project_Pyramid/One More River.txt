One More River LyricsDon't look back cause there's one more river
Don't turn your back you got one more river to cross
No more fighting and no more dying
No more cheatin' and no more lying
Don't look back cause there's one more river
Don't turn your back you got one more river to cross
Don't start asking the rhyme or the reason
Don't hold back it's the time of the season
One more mile and one more road
One last bridge and one less load
One more river
Don't look back cause there's one more river
Don't turn your back you got one more river to cross
Don't start asking the rhyme or the reason
Don't hold back it's the time of the season
One more mile and one more road
One last bridge and one less load
One more river
One more riverEmbed
