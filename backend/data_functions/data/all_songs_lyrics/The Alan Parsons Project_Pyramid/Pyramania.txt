Pyramania LyricsThere are pyramids in my head!
There's one underneath my bed!
And my lady's getting cranky
Every possible location
Has a simple explanation
And it isn't hanky-panky
I have read, somewhere in a book
They improve all your food and your wine
It's said that everything you grow
In your garden would taste pretty fine
Instead, all I ever get
Is a pain in the neck and a
Yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap!
I've consulted all the sages
I could find in yellow pages
But there aren't many of them
And the Mayan panoramas
On my pyramid pajamas
Haven't helped my little problem
I've been told someone in the know
Can be sure that his luck is as good as gold
Money in the bank
And you don't even pay for it
If you fold a dollar in the shape
Of the pyramid that's printed on the back
It's no lie
You can keep the edge
Of a razor as sharp
As an eagle's eye
You can grow a hedge
That is vertically straight
Over ten feet high
All you really need
Is a pyramid and just a little luck
Wuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu ah ouh
Wuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwuwu ah ouh
I have read, somewhere in a book
They improve all your food and wine
And I've been told, someone in the know
Can be sure of his good luck and it's no lie
All you really need is a little bit of pyramidic
Help!2Embed
