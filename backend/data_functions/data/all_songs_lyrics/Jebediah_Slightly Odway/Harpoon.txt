Harpoon LyricsThis will take some explaining, but I think you will agree
There is no use pretending, that there's hope for you and me
But I love her, but do you think she can see
When I tell her, it's the end for you and me
It was over, ever since you went and shot me
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon in my heart...
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon in my heart...
Yeah...
I can handle the fighting, it's the affection I can't stand
And I don't mind us talking, just don't try and touch my hand
And I love her, but do you think she can see
When I tell her, it's the end for you and me
It was over, ever since you went and shot me
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon in my heart...
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon in my heart...
Yeah...
When you left, I didn't want you back
But now your gone, so won't you
Come right back
Come right back
Come right back
Come right back
Come right back
Come right back
Why does it hurt?
Simple matters don't seem worth
We are the same, but it's not happening again
And I love her, but do you think she can see
When I tell her, it's the end for you and me
It was over, ever since you went and shot me
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon in my heart...
Like a harpoon
Like a harpoon in my heart...Embed
