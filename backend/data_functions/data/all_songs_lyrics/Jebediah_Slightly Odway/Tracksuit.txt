Tracksuit LyricsWell I don't want to make things bad
But these last few weeks are the worst I've had
And that's really sad
It's really sad you know
Whoa!
Because I knew what we were gonna say
And I didn't want it to end that way
Like on a winter's day but that's okay
Because I've got my tracksuit ready on
Don't give me your friends
Yeah they're driving me round the bend
I just wanted some time alone
So we could sort this thing out
Life's a rolling stone
So I'll take you for an elephant ride
And I'll show you things that I feel inside
Yeah that's what I'll do
Coz I like you
And I don't wanna let things slide
Ohh'ohh'ohh
So I hope everything's all right
Because I know I won't see you tonight
I just turn out the light and fall asleep
Without a peep
And when I wake up with my tracksuit on
Well then I'll know that you've been away too long
So I'll play a song
I'll play a song
And I'll dedicate it just for you
Can we still be friends
Yeah that's all that we've got in the end
But I've been secretly holding out
That some day you will say you want more than that
So I'll take you for an elephant ride
And I'll show you things that I feel inside
Yeah that's what I'll do
Coz I like you
And I don't wanna let things slide
Ohh'ohh'ohh
Ohh'ohh'ohh
Ohh'ohh'ohhEmbed
