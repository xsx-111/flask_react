Invaders LyricsIt was in the evening, or was it afternoon
It doesn't really matter, they were in my room
No there no here to save you x3
No there not
One by one
They tricked me one by one
They stripped me one by one
They fixed me one by one
Invaders picked me
I thought that I should go now but I just had to stay
Stick around and listen to what they had to say
No we're not going to hurt you x3
No we're not
Ohhhh, arrggghhh, oohhh
Invaders, Invaders, Invaders, Invaders........
Ooh, I like their eyes, like buggy flies
Their purple skies, where no one dies
Their silken hair, and what they wear
Without a care for nothing
Say that you care but you fucking don't
And you say that you care but you fucking don't
And you say that you care but you fucking don't
And you say that you care but you fucking don't
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah...... etc
(Watch out for invaders... )Embed
