Leaving Home LyricsWere you laughed at by your friends?
And were you lost for words
When everybody finally told you what they thought?
You can't keep up with the trend
It makes you lose
But somehow, everybody
Always makes up in the end
Oh, was it something that I ate?
Oh, didn't even touch my plate
Oh, suddenly I'm feeling great
Do you like me now?
Leaving home, life was never good to me
Leaving home, I smell the morning air
Leaving home, life was never good
You can work it out, we're leaving home
I could hear them through the door
As people came in
Laughing at the way they acted, when they were alone
And an argument can start
With nothing more than this
To be the light, and leave you standing on your own
Oh, am I doing it again?
Oh, I'm a loser now and then
Oh, and I smile at everything
Do you like me now?
Leaving home, life was never good to me
Leaving home, I smell the morning air
Leaving home, life was never good
You can work it out, we're leaving home
Hope I like the life I find
When I leave everything behind
I hope, I'm sure, I've made my mind
To go, leave home...
Leaving home, life was never good to me
Leaving home, I smell the morning air
Leaving home, life was never good
You can work it out, well...
Leaving home, life was never good to me
Leaving home, I smell the morning air
Leaving home, life was never good
You can work it out, we're leaving homeEmbed
