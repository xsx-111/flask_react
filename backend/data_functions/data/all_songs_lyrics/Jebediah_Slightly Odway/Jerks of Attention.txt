Jerks of Attention LyricsThere is no pain, my body's drained
I never should of had that fourth... slice... straight
We gathered round, the lost and found
But my jerks of attention let... me... down
I took the first one
And I pulled it back
And what was once green
Had all turned black, had all turned black
And there was nothing left to say
I'm ten foot tall, the world's so small
I know it all, when I'm wasted
And what you see, inside of me
Has been set free, when I'm wasted, wasted
I'm getting there, my constant stare
And I don't think, I'll move from... this... chair
We've got them both, Archers of Loaf
And the Stone Roses in the stereo
I took the first one
And I pulled it back
And what was once green
Had all turned black, had all turned black
And there was nothing left to say
I'm ten foot tall, the world's so small
I know it all, when I'm wasted
And what you see, inside of me
Has been set free, when I'm wasted
I'm ten foot tall, the world's so small
I know it all when I'm wasted
What you see, inside of me
Has been set free when I'm wasted
Wasted, wasted
Wasted, wasted
...ed
I'm ten foot tall, the world's so small
I know it all, when I'm wasted
And what you see, inside of me
Has been set free, when I'm wasted
And I don't want to be straight, don't want to be straight
And I don't want to be wasted, wasted, wasted, way, wasted
Don'tEmbed
