Lino LyricsThere is the mat
Wipe where it's at
You can come in
So can the cat
I can see me
Under my feet
Under a fan
Spreading the heat
If everyone's ready and waiting for you, Yeah
Then come along Friday what is there to do?
We like to clean, our hands with preen
To keep all the germs away from the scene
That's our motto, that's what we say
That is the truth, that's how it'll stay
If everyone's ready and waiting for you, Yeah
Then come along Friday what is there to do?
Scrub and make clean the lino, lino
In case of visitors
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean
Hard to clean
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean
Hard to clean, it's hard to clean
There is the mat
Wipe where it's at
You can come in
So can the cat
I can see me
Under my feet
Under a fan
Spreading the heat
If everyone's ready and waiting for you, Yeah
Then come along Friday what is there to do?
Scrub and make clean the lino, lino
In case of visitors, visitors
Like what you get when you've just started retarded
Think of what you want and who you are
M, m, m, My life, when I think is so circumstancial
You take what you're given it's never substancial
But that doesn't matter, when I am around her
I think of something more, but what will I use it for
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean
Hard to clean, hard to clean
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean
Hard to clean
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean
Hard to clean
You don't wanna know, you just want them to go
They walked on your lino and it's hard to clean
Hard to clean
Can you tell me what I meanEmbed
