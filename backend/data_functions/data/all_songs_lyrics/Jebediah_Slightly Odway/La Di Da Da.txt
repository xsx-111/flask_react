La Di Da Da LyricsWell I've been outside and it's not my scene
And I know you don't know what I mean
But I'm trying hard, cos I've never been
On the other side, of a day dream
La da di da da...
And I've been around, tried to be kind
But it gets me down, when I often find
People that I meet, in this state of mine
Hanging onto threads, falling behind
La da di da da...
Seems I've found
Something to stick around my neck and be proud
Seems I know
Somethings will never go with what you've got on show
Even so...
La da di da da...Embed
