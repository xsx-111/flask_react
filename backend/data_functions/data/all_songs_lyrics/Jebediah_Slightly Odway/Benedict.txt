Benedict LyricsYeah!
Benedict sits in his room, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
Green men are coming soon, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
He waits for them in the dark, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
He stands alone in the ballpark, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
I said, Ben-Benedict
They didn't wanna find you
They didn't wanna beat you, beat you
They didn't wanna find you
They didn't wanna beat you, beat you
Ohhh, ohhh.....
Benedict's losing his head, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
He keeps it under the bed, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
His mind will let him know, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
When it is time to go home, Benedict, Ben-Benedict
I said, Ben-Benedict
They didn't wanna find you
They didn't wanna beat you, beat you
They didn't wanna find you
They didn't wanna beat you, beat you
Ohhh, ohhh.....
Oh, We're suddenly much better than you
Oh, We're suddenly much better than you
Oh, We're suddenly much better than you
Oh, We're suddenly much better......
Now you're looking at the new fave
Now you're going to see the next rave
Keep on blasting out and go green
Blame it on the magic brain bean, yeah...
Ben-ben-ben-ben...........
Ben-ben-ben-ben...........
Ben-ben-ben-ben...........
Ben-ben-ben-ben-ben-ben-ben-ben...........Embed
