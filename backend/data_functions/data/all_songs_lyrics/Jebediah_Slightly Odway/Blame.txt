Blame LyricsI was strolling down your road
When I saw you now I know
It's clear, it's all your fault dear
And the price I had to pay
Shit that I took everyday
I lived was all that you could give
And I know that you're to blame x 6
I've been fighting it so long
But I know that I'm not wrong
With this, I'm totally pissed
So I'll take it out on you
And all your girlfriends too
Cause they hate me but they're too blind to see
And I know that you're to blame x 6
Sssah....
And I know that you're to blame x 6
It'll never be the sameEmbed
