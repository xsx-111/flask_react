Twilight=Dusk LyricsI don't wanna go anymore
I don't wanna go anymore
Stop pushing me through the door
I don't wanna go anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
Picking myself off the floor
I don't wanna fight anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
I said I'd try but you don't believe me
You still don't know who I am, if only
I had the guts to tell you
If I had the guts to tell you
If... If... If...Embed
