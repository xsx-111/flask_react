Spoil the Show LyricsI know, I've said
Things I didn't mean to say
And I know I've done
Things I didn't mean to do
I'm stupid, pathetic
'Cause sometimes, I say
Things I never mean to say
And sometimes, I do
Things I don't wanna do
But can we, leave that out?
I'm waiting for the early sign
That signals everything is fine
I've rocked the boat enough, I know
To make a scene, and spoil the show
I get jealous
Way too easy, all the time
And overzealous
Way too easy, on time
Before I see things straight
'Cause sometimes, I say
Things I never mean to say
And sometimes, I do
Things I don't wanna do
But can we, leave that out?
I'm waiting for the early sign
That signals everything is fine
I've rocked the boat enough, I know
To make a scene, and spoil the show
The show, the show, the show...
I'm waiting for the early sign
That signals everything is fine
I've rocked the boat enough, I know
To make a scene, and spoil the show
The show, the show, the show...Embed
