Teflon LyricsWe we're going along to a particular song
Just hanging around feet scuffing the ground
Catching us on a roll we were collecting the dole
Doesn't mean something's wrong we were just
Slipping along (x4)
At this party we found people hanging around
There was nothing to do we'd been smoking a few
Saw two girls outside they were both pretty wired
I thought something was wrong but they were just
Getting it on (x2)
Slipping along (x2)
So long
I'm slipping on
And on
We were going along to a particular song
Just hanging around feet scuffing the ground
Catching us on a roll we were collecting the dole
Doesn't mean something's wrong we were just
Slipping along (x4)
1,2,3,4
So long
I'm slipping on
And on
At this party we found people hanging around
There was nothing to do we'd been smoking a few
Saw two girls outside they were both pretty wired
Thought something was wrong but they were just
Getting it on
Getting along
Slipping along
Yeah, slipping along
1, 2, 3 4
So long
I'm slipping on
And onEmbed
