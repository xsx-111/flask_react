Monument LyricsI'm really gonna pack in
This new job I do
It's gonna be the death of me
I went to a party of
Some girl that I knew
At least the alcohol was free
With all the family around
We couldn't find a common ground
And so we left with what we found
When we first came so
Where you been
Where you been
Where'd you go
Leaving me alone and feeling low
I'm supposed to be the one you want
I'm supposed to be the one you want
I'm supposed to be the one you want
I know that I don't earn
One hundred points in bed
But will you love me anyway
It's just that there's so much
Going on in my head
That I don't know what to say
Your car rolled away out of sight
You cannot leave without a fight
Okay you lose so we were right
When we first came so
Where you been
Where you been
Where'd you go
Leaving me alone and feeling low
I'm supposed to be the one you want
I'm supposed to be the one you want
Where you been
Where you been
Where'd you go
Leaving me alone and feeling low
I'm supposed to be the one you want
I'm supposed to be the one you wantEmbed
