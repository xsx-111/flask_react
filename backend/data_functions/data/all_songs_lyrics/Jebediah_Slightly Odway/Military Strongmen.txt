Military Strongmen LyricsI'm on parade, you don't say: why can't you see that
Keeping my feelings at bay: why can't you see that when
When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you
I'm just better off...
All of the years add up to: why can't you see that
Something has happened to you: why can't you see that when
When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without you
You just get me down
It's not me, it can't be
I'd rather leave
It's getting hard, to be a part
Of what is around
Is this the situation of the time
If so you can have yours, I want mine
I know there's something better you could be
Now I am past caring, completely
When you're around, you just get me down, I'm better off without youEmbed
