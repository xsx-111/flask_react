Blood on My Hands LyricsDeath to my vision
Blind I shall serve
Give rise to god war
Watch the civils fall
Hateful seed inside me
Scald my mind of all but truth
I concede; I am the chosen one
Open wide the gate
Stain the world with the blood of man
Affliction
Forced unto all
Human vexation
Transcend with blood on my hands
Spirits of the grave remember
Rise up o' powers from the land of Til
Plague and madness spread thru this world
Burn in me for I suffer your willEmbed
