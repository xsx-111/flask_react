World of Shit (The Promised Land) Lyrics
Bred from the bowels
Sheep one and all
Bound by the doctrine of lies
To fucked human shit
I shout blasphemy
As I make my way
Thru to the promised land

Smell of shit is so foul
Writhe in disgust
Earth heaves and death comes to call
All the waste - Cling to your lie
You are as sand and the wind blows
My disgust - A fever
To kill a thousand more

Gene dead from birth
God's holy fuck
Canonized but of no use to me
Human shit, Untermensch
Waste begone from my earth

Desolation - No life bodies littering
Beast of earth devour
Cleanse this world for those who deserve
Burning cities, all is well
I remain in my conviction
As the waste in sewer flows
Thru the promised landEmbed
