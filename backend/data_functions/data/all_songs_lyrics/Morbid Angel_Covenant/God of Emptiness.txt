God of Emptiness LyricsPart 1: The Accuser

Lies, and you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world
And all the glory you receive
So, what makes you supreme?
Rise, and your crown is falling
I offer fantasy
And you, creator, are blind with envy

Let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake I'm slithering
Through my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul and you'll be like me
In emptiness, in emptiness

Lies, and you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world
And all the glory you receive
So, what makes you supreme?
Rise, and your crown is falling
I offer fantasy
And you, creator, are blind with envy
So let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake I'm slithering
Through my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul and you'll be like me
In emptiness, in emptiness
