Pain Divine Lyrics
Release this fury
Malediction
Cursed existence
Writhing in this life of dissent
Pain for pleasure
Pain for adoration
Pain is to godliness
Bleeding for ecstasy

Divine
Pain Divine

Locked in vicious
Offer to the sado-gods
Nails driven through my dreams
Bleeding - Pain is a god's reward

Gliding through these dungeons
Heightened senses overwhelmed
Hedonistic rupture
Endurance makes one divine
Divine
Pain Divine

Locked in vicious
Offer to the sado-gods
Nails driven through my dreams
Bleeding - Pain is a god's rewardEmbed
