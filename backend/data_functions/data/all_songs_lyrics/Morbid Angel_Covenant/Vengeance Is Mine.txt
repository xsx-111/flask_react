Vengeance Is Mine Lyrics
Naught within this circle
All but emptiness expelled
I am deep in wiccan
And whore to demons works
Master - I call thee
Master - Surround me
With evil in our hearts
This night we take revenge

Mote it be
Satan's sword I have become
No son shall escape
No word left unburned
Now the power is in me
Hellspawn in aeturnum
I burn with hate
To rid this world of the Nazarene

This night of splendor
The beast arise in me
This is my destiny
My sword shall take life
Mote it be
These unholy ones
Mote it be
Return to naught
Vengeance is mine
With all of its emptiness
My sword delivers
Curse this day in memoryEmbed
