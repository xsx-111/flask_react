Sworn to the Black LyricsSpawn of the ever rolling abyss
Ever espousing unluminous
Charred soul - Burned at rebirth
Quest not save the death of the sun
Repulsed by the light
Heart pumping ice
So cold to this world
Reclude until the summoning
Sworn to the black
Our father begotten, not made
Before all legends of man
Receive my loyalty, my offering
In my veins; the blood of the ancient brood
Summon me
Burning inside, I feel the call
Blood of the Ancient Ones now boils
At war - War with the race
Father rise and the world be one
Repulsed by the light
No feeling for life
Drained of my being
I lie dead but still I'm swornEmbed
