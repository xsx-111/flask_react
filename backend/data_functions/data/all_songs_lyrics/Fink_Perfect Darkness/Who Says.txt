Who Says Lyrics
Try this on for size
Who says it ain’t enough
If it fits like a glove
Then it must be love
Try this on for size
Ok, it’s rough around the edges
If it fits like a glove
Then it must be love

Who says
We can’t live this way
We can work it out, in our own way

Try this on for size
There’s no way they’re ever gonna listen
If they’re sharpening their knives
Then it must be love (hmm hmm)
And I can see it in their eyes all day (yeah)
They just get what they are given
And if they criticize
Then it must be love (hmm hmm)
Who says
We can’t live this way
We can work it out, in our own wayEmbed
