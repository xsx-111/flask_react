Foot in the Door Lyrics
Who knows just how long it’s supposed to last
'Cause I’m new in London with my fresh face
Pressed up against the glass

From the outside looking in
Seems as difficult to stop
As it is easy to begin

I'm in
I'm in
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

Who knows just how much we’re supposed to take
'Cause I need something to take the edge off
My latest mistake

From the outside looking in
It seems as difficult to stop
As it is easy to begin

I'm in
Mmm
I'm in
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in
They tell me everyone is excited
Now I’ve got, my foot in the door
Mmm
Just point at where you want me to sign it
Now I’ve got, my foot in the door

I'm in
I'm in
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

Who knows just how long it’s supposed to last
'Cause I’m new in London with my fresh face
Pressed up against the glass
Up against the glass
Against the glass
Mmm
Against the glassEmbed
