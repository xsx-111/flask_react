Honesty Lyrics
Who was it telling me honestly
Honesty is all about the timing?
Oh, my bad, there was I sitting there
Thinking that honesty was all about truth

Oh mmm, woe is me
Mmm
And your honesty

We've had conversations about the past
It's taken long enough to see your true colours
You've got so many, baby
You're like a fucking rainbow
Just let me revel in your blue notes

Who was it sitting here yesterday
Saying that I'm leaving in a hurry?
Oh, my bad, there was I sitting there
Watching you talking like I'm already gone

Oh mmm, woe is me
Mmm
And your honesty
We've had conversations about the past
It's taken long enough to see your true colours
You've got so many, baby
You're like a fucking rainbow
Just let me revel in your blue notes

Who was it telling me honestly
Honesty is all about the timing?
My bad, there was I sitting there
Thinking that honesty was all about truth

Oh mmm, woe is me
Mmm
And your honesty
And your honesty
Mmm, your honesty
Mmm, and your honesty
Oh, and your honesty
Mmm
Your honesty
And your honesty, ohEmbed
