Perfect Darkness Lyrics
Perfect memories fall down like ashes
From the fire we made along
And everything we gotta say we say it
See the black heels around the fire
Feel the night air in perfect darkness babe
Perfect darkness is all I can see

Deep water, stay under
See it rolling over your head and just roll with it
Until it's all good yeah
Deep water a little deeper than you thought
Feel it going over the edge and just go with it
Until it's all good yeah

Keep those brown eyes wide open for
For this moment we own for now
And everything we gonna do we do it
See the black clouds fall out of fear
Feel it rise up in perfect darkness babe
Perfect darkness is all I can see

Deep water, stay under
See it rolling over your head and just roll with it
Until it's all good yeah
Deep water a little deeper then you thought
Feel it going over the edge and just go with it
Until it's all good yeah
Compass points out in all directions
From this moment we over now
With everything we do we're gonna do it
And everything we do we're gonna do it
And everything we're gonna do we do it
And everything we do we're gonna do it
And everything we're gonna do we do it
Hmm
Perfect darkness is all I can see
Perfect darkness is all I can see
