Warm Shadow Lyrics
What you got going on
Behind those, eyes closed, holding on
And I don't want another, day to break
Mmm

Take our, steal our, night away
Warm shadow
Mmm
Warm shadow
Won't you cast yourself on me
Mmm

What you got in store for me?
Keep those, eyes closed, next to me
I don't want another, day to break

Take our, steal our, night away
Warm shadow
Mmm
Warm shadow
Won't you cast yourself on me
Warm shadow
Warm shadow
Won't you cast yourself on me
Won't you stop breaking in
Red sky, red light, awakening
I don't want another, day to break
Take our, steal our, night away
Take our, steal our, night away
Take our, steal our, night away
Take our, steal our, night away
Take our
Steal our
Night awayEmbed
