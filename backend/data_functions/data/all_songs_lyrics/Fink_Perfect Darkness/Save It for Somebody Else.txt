Save It for Somebody Else Lyrics
So kind of you to come 'round and testify
With your softly spoken alibi

You’re so convinced that you’re saving yourself

You should save it for somebody else
Save it for somebody else
Mmm

Hood up, head down and just walk away
I already know what it is that you’re gonna say

You know the truth is a much harder sell
Might as well

Save it for somebody else
Save it for somebody else
Save it for somebody else
Save it
Hood up, head down
Hood up, head down
Hood up, head downEmbed
