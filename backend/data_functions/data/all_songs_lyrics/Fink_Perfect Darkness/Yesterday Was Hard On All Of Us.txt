Yesterday Was Hard On All Of Us Lyrics
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
And is it real or just
Something we think we know?

Where are we going now?
Where do we go?
Cause if it's the same as yesterday
You know I'm out, just so you know

Because, because
Our paths, they cross
Yesterday was hard
On all of us
On all of us

Who can we trust from here?
Who can we trust?
And are you real, or just
Something from wanderlust?
Who can you trust my dear sweet flower?
Who can you trust?
From cradle to grave, from ashes to ashes
From dust to dust

Because, because
Our paths, they cross
Yesterday was hard
On all of us
On all of us

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
And we got nothing we can trust
And nothing we can't sell, that's for sure

And how do we get out?
How do we move around with
All these eyes on us?
Tell you what, you go first
It's almost like it's kind of rehearsed, but it's not

Because, because
Our paths, they cross
Yesterday was hard
On all of us
On all of us2Embed
