Fear Is Like Fire Lyrics
Fear is like fire
You can warm your hands on it
Mmm
Fear is like fire
You can burn your house down with it
You can watch it burn

Yeah
Yeah, you can light it
Mmm, you can light it
You can light it
Or you can utilize it

You can peel back the layers
Find what's underneath of us
Peel back the layers
One by one, everyone
Will reveal a side of us

Yeah
Yeah, you can light it
Mmm, you can light it
You can light it
Yeah, or you can utilize it
As long as it don't go out

Here we are
At the point of no return
Fear is like fire
You can watch it burn
You can watch it burn
Mmm
You can watch it
You can warm your hands on it
Warm your hands on it
You can warm it up
You can warm your hands on it1Embed
