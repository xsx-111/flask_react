Move It LyricsSweet little sister, this scene's sure getting old
Don't you think it's time we've got to go?
I got so twisted trying to make it right
Don't you know we've wasted half the night?
I was told to use my head
Be heard and never seen
It's just your daddy's double talk, oh yeah
Baby, and it don't mean no thing to me
Let's move it, time to say so long
Let's move it, let's get this mother on
Hey, little sister, in your high heeled shoes
Don't you know it's time to learn the blues?
Ooh, sweet little sister, time to get it on
Don't you know the meaning to this song?
I recall what daddy said
Stay where you belong
That's just another lie, oh yeah, into nowhere
Let's get this baby on
Let's move it, time to say so long
Let's move it, let's get this mother on
Let's move it
Oh, now time to say so long
Let's move it
Yeah, let's get this mother on
Let's move it
Let's move it
Let's move it
Just like that
It's just that double talk
Don't mean no thing to me
It's time to shake it loose
Shake it from the family tree
Let's move it, time to say so long
Let's move it, let's get this mother on
Let's move it
Baby, time to say so long
Let's move it, let's get this mother on
Just move itEmbed
