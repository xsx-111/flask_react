House Of Broken Love LyricsCome the morning don't you wake me
I'll be dreaming that I'm free
Come the daybreak don't you shake me
Send me back to misery
'Cause I'm dealing with the devil
With no help from above
I'm stealing with the devil
Through this house of broken love
Taking chances with you, baby
I saw something in your eyes
And though no one else could blame me
There were signs I should have recognised
Now I'm dealing with the devil
With no help from above
I'm sleeping with the devil
In this house of broken love, broken love
If you don't want to lose my loving
Use it constantly
If it's going to be lies
Suspicious eyes
Then, baby, oh baby, set me free
When the night falls and she's leaving
The moon shines so cold and grey
Hear my heartbeat yeah yeah hear me weeping
Pain and sorrow's here to stay
Now I begged you, baby, help me
But you turned your back on me
You didn't even listen
When you should have set me free
Now I'm leaving with the devil
Going to leave this search for love
I'm leaving with the devil
Leave this house of broken love, broken loveEmbed
