Hiway Nights LyricsI know the spell you're under
I know it so well
How far well you may wonder
No way to tell
I've travelled miles from nowhere
Where suns never rise
Looking to find a meaning
Now open your eyes
I've been this way so long
Tomorrow's gone
See if the rhyme has reason
Chasing the wind
Look for a change of season
Somewhere to begin
The freeway is my song
Highway nights, red tail lights, lead my love light on
Highway nights, freeway sights, to this eagle I belong, it rolls me on
So how can I bring you loving
Out of the night?
Is it a dream
To fade in the light?
The freeway is my song
Highway nights, red tail lights, to this eagle I belong
Highway nights, freeway sights, lead my love light on
Highway nights, red tail lights, lead my love light on
Highway nights, freeway sights, to this eagle I belong, it rolls me on
Baby, won't you start your motor?
Baby, won't you turn it over?
Baby, won't you drive me, drive me through the night?
Highway nights, red tail lights, to this eagle I belong
Highway nights, freeway sights, lead my love light on
Highway nights, red tail lights, lead my love light on
Highway nights, freeway sights, to this eagle I belong, it rolls me onEmbed
