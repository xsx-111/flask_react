She Only LyricsSo many years to go by
So many tears can fill your eyes
So many fears to lock behind a door
So you drift away
And yet another day
Day goes by empty as before
I'll be there come the morning light
Waiting there, I'll wait for you
She only needs someone
She only needs some time
She only needs someone
To stay this time
She's waiting for love to come
She waits there on her own
She's waiting for someone
To get it right this time
So many days drift by
There's too many ways slowly die
How many shadows fade across the wall?
Baby, soon the day will come
You may find someone
Only now lonely evermore
She's still there come the morning light
She's waiting there, she waits for you
She only needs someone
She only needs some time
She only needs someone
To stay this time
She's waiting for love to come
She waits there on her own
She's waiting for someone
To get it right this timeEmbed
