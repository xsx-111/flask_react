Heart The Hunter LyricsI had a woman, gave her all of my loving
Gave her all that I had
The kind of woman, she could make you believe her
Nothing's going to go bad
Took a while and all of the hurting
Since she left and went away
Behind her smile though I can't be certain
I thought i heard her say
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's game
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's game
Little baby, I won't give you no heartaches
I won't give you no pain
Sweet little darling, can't you see what is coming
Oh 'cause you know me by name
Used to be when I was a child
I thought loving should be free
And it's so hard to be reconciled
That ain't the way it ought to be
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's game, my heart's a hunter
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's game
It's only loving when she's gone and she's left you
It goes to show
It's always something that I felt when I met you
It comes and it goes
I ride alone tonight, so bittersweet
I took a chance, I tried to love her
Someone whispered her name, heartbreaker
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's game. a lonely hunter
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's game
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's game, my heart's a hunter
My heart's a hunter
And love is a loser's gameEmbed
