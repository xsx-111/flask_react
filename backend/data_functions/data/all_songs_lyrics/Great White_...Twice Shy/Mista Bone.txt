Mista Bone LyricsThat girl is just a cool good looker
That baby's sweeter than raw brown sugar
Never mind 'cause the fancy took her
She says she wants to have the small head rock her
What a smile, don't it drive you insane, my baby
Drive a mile, just to ride back again, baby, won't you rock it tonight?
And when she's in the mood
When she needs that loving groove
When she wants it rude
She grooves with mista bone
If she's in the mood
If she hits that loving groove
When she's getting rude
She grooves with mista bone
Just take it like a sweet injection
Just a token of my affection
Another night we'll take another direction
I'm going to play you like a rhythm section
What style, let me see that again, my baby
Drive a mile, just to ride you again, baby, won't you rock it tonight?
And when she's in the groove
When she needs that loving mood
When she wants it rude
She grooves with mista bone
When she's in the mood
When she hits that loving groove
When she's getting rude
She grooves with mista bone
When she's in the mood
When she needs that loving groove
When she wants it rude
She grooves with mista bone
When she's in the mood
When she hits that loving groove
When she's getting rude
She grooves with mista boneEmbed
