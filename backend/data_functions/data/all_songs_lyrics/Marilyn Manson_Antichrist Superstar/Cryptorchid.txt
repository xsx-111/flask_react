Cryptorchid Lyrics
Each time I make my mother cry
An angel dies and falls from heaven (But when they get to you)
When the boy is still a worm
It's hard to learn the number seven
But when they get to you (5, 6, 7, 8, never)
It's the first thing that they do (7, 8, 9, 10, Heaven)
But when they get to you (4, 3, 2, 1, never get to 7)

Each time I look outside, my mother dies
I feel my back is changing shape (But when they get to you)
When the worm consumes the boy
It's never, ever considered rape
But when they get to you (I wish I had my balls)
First thing that they do (I wish I had my balls)
But when they get to you...

Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things
Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things
Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things
Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things
Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things2Embed
