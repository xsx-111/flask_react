Irresponsible Hate Anthem Lyrics
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you
And all the children sing
We hate love, we love hate
"We hate love, we love hate!"
"We hate love, we love hate!"

I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

Hey victim, should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim, you were the one who put the stick in my hand
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
Let's just kill everyone and let your God sort them out

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

Everybody's someone else's nigg​er
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side
I better, better, better, better not say this
Better, better, better, better not tell
Better, better, better, better not say
Better, better, better, better not tell
I hate the hater, I'd rape the raper
I am the idiot who will not be himself

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!

Everybody's someone else's nigg​er
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

America can not see anything
America can not see anything
America can not see anything
History was written by the winner

Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Everybody's someone else's nigg​er
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side10Embed
