Little Horn Lyrics
There's an apple in the pussy mouth
Now I am the dinner whore
There's a tumor in the TV mouth
Burn it out before it grows
Someone better get the dog to kick
Jaws wired shut to save the dick
Out of the bottomless pit
Comes the little horn

"Little horn is born"
"Little horn is born"
"Little horn is born"
"Little horn is born"

World spreads its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar

Dead will dance for what is left
Worms will wait with bated breath
"Your blind have now become my deaf"
So says the little horn
"Save yourself from this"
"Save yourself from this"
"Save yourself from this"
"Save yourself..."

World spreads its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar

Everyone will suffer now
Everyone will suffer now
Everyone will suffer now
Everyone will suffer now
"You can't save yourself"
"You can't save yourself"
"You can't save yourself"
"You can't save yourself"

World spreads its legs for another star
World shows its face for another scar1Embed
