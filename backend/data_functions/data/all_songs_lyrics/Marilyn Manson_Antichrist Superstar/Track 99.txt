Track 99 Lyrics
— Go ahead and build a better messiah, we can dig another grave
— This is your calling. If you are hearing this, there's nothing I can do. Something has grown in my chest, and I have seen it, it is hard and cold. It's been dormant for many years. I have tried to save you, but I cannot come to save you. But this is what you deserve, this is what we deserve. This is something that we have brought upon ourselves. We are not a victim, you are not a victim. We are not a victim, you are not a victim. God will grovel before me, God will crawl at my feet. These are the dying years, these are the dying years. When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed youEmbed
