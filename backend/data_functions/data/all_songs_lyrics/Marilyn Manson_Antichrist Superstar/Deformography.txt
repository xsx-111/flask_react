Deformography Lyrics
When you wish upon your star
Don't let yourself fall, fall in too hard

I fell into you, now I'm on my back
An insect decaying in your little trap
I squirm into you, now I'm in your gut
I fell into you, now I'm in a rut

Lift you up like the sweetest angel
I'll tear you down like a whore
I will bury your god in my warm spit
You'll be deformed in your porn

(Dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (Dirty, dirty, dirty)

You eat up my heart and all the little parts
Your star is so sharp, it leaves me jagged holes
I make myself sick just to poison you
If I can't have you, then no one will
I will bury your god in my warm spit
You'll be deformed in your porn

(You're such a)
Rock star, yeah (Dirty, dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (A dirty, dirty, dirty)

You are the one I want, and what I want is so unreal
You are the one I want, and what I want is so unreal
You are the one I want, and what I want is so unreal
You are the one I want, and what I want is so unreal

I lift you up like the sweetest angel
I'll tear you down like a whore

You're such a dirty, dirty
Rock star, yeah (Dirty, dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (Dirty, dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (Dirty, dirty, dirty)
Rock star, yeah (You're such a dirty, dirty)
I am the one you want, and what you want is so unreal
I am the one you want, and what you want is so unreal
I am the one you want, and what you want is so unreal3Embed
