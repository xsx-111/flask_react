Wormboy Lyrics
When will you realize you're already there?
So watered down, your feelings have turned to mud
"Love everybody" is destroying the value of
All hate has got me nowhere

I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping
I know I'm slipping away
I know I'm slipping, I know I'm slipping
I know I'm slipping away

(Oh no, it is) Everything they said it was
(Oh no, I am) All the things they said I was
(Oh no, it is) Everything they said it was
(Oh no, I am) All the things they said I was

When you get to heaven
You will wish you're in hell
When you get to heaven
You will wish you're in hell

When will you realize you're already here?
You'll thank us now that you have crossed over
Don't pick the scabs or you will never heal
The world shudders as the worm gets his wings
(Oh no, it is) Everything they said it was
(Oh no, I am) All the things they said I was
(Oh no, it is) Everything they said it was
(Oh no, I am) All the things they said I was

Then I got my wings
And I never even knew it
When I was a worm
Thought I wouldn't get through it

When you get to heaven
You will wish you're in hell
When you get to heaven
You will wish you're in hell

(Oh no, it is) Everything they said it was
(Oh no, I am) All the things they said I was
(Oh no, it is) Everything they said it was
(Oh no, I am) All the things they said I was

(Oh no, it is) Said I was
(Oh no, I am) Said I was
(Oh no, it is) Said I was
(Oh no, I am) Everything they said I was
(Oh no, it is) Said I was
(Oh no, I am) Said I was
(Oh no)Embed
