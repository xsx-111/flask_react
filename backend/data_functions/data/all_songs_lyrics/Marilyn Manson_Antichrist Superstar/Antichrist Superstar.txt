Antichrist Superstar Lyrics
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

You built me up with your wishing hell
I didn't have to sell you
You threw your money in the pissing well
You do just what they tell you

Repent, that's what I'm talking about
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Repent, that's what I'm talking about
Whose mistake am I, anyway?

Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the Hydra
Now you'll see your star

Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things
Prick your finger, it is done
The moon has now eclipsed the sun
The angel has spread its wings
The time has come for bitter things
Repent (That's what he's talking about)
I shed the skin to feed the fake
Repent (That's what he's talking about)
Whose mistake am I, anyway?

Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the Hydra
Now you'll see your star

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
The time has come, it is quite clear
Our Antichrist is almost here
The time has come, it is quite clear
Our Antichrist is almost here
The time has come, it is quite clear
Our Antichrist is almost here

Cut the head off
Grows back hard
I am the Hydra
Now you'll see your star
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
When you are suffering know that I have betrayed you12Embed
