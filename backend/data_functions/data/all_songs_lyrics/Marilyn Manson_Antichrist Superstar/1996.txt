1996 Lyrics
Light a candle for the sinners
Set the world on fire

Anti choice and anti girl
I am the anti-flag unfurled
Anti white and anti man
I got the anti-future plan
Anti fascist, anti mod
I am the anti-music god
Anti sober, anti whore
There will never be enough of anti more

I can't believe in the things that don't believe in me
Now, it's your turn to see what I hate about me

Anti people, now you've gone too far
Here's your Antichrist Superstar

Anti money, anti hate
Anti things I fucked and ate
Anti cop and anti fun
Here is my anti-President gun
Anti Satan, anti black
The anti world is on my back
Anti gay and anti dope
I am the faggot anti-Pope
I can't believe in the things that don't believe in me
Now, it's your turn to see what I hate about me

Anti people, now you've gone too far
Antichrist Superstar
Anti people, now you've gone too far
Here's your Antichrist Superstar

This is where your faith ends
1996! 1996! 1996! 1996!

Anti peace and anti life
Anti husband, anti wife
Anti song and anti me
I don't deserve a chance to be

Anti people, now you've gone too far
Antichrist Superstar
Anti people, now you've gone too far
Here's your Antichrist Superstar2Embed
