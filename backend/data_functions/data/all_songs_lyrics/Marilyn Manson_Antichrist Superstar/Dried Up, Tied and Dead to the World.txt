Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World Lyrics
You cut off all of your fingers
Trade them in for dollar bills
Cake up on some more makeup to cover all those lines
Wake up and stop shaking, 'cause you're just wasting time

Don't you want some of this?
Don't you need some of this?

You take, but can't be given
You ride, but cannot be ridden
Pinch this tiny heart of mine, wrap it up in soiled twine
You never read what you've written

I'll be your lover, I'll be forever
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high
I'll be your lover, I'll be forever
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high

Don't you want some of this?
Don't you need some of this?
Don't you want some of this?
Don't you need some of this?
You shove your hair down my throat
I feel your fingers in me
Tear this bitter fruit to mess and wrap it in your soiled dress
Now, you must spit out the seeds

I'll be your lover, I'll be forever
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high
I'll be your lover, I'll be forever
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high

Anything, when I'm high
Anything, when I'm high

I'll be your lover, I'll be forever
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high
I'll be your lover, I'll be forever
I'll be tomorrow, I am anything when I'm high

Anything, when I'm high

All dried up and tied up, forever
All fucked up and dead to the world
All dried up and tied up, forever
All fucked up and dead to the world
All dried up and tied up, forever
All fucked up and dead to the world
All dried up and tied up, forever
All fucked up and dead to the world3Embed
