Angel with the Scabbed Wings Lyrics
He is the angel with the scabbed wings
Hard-drug face, wanna powder his nose
He will deflower the freshest crop
Dry up all the wombs with his rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores, rock and roll sores

Dead is what he is, he does what he please
The things that he has
You'll never want to see
What you're never gonna be, now
Sketch a little keyhole for looking-glass people
You don't wanna see him, you only wanna be him
Mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow
Man can't always reap what he sow

He is the maker
He is the taker
He is the savior
He is the raper
Dead is what he is, he does what he please
The things that he has
You'll never want to see
What you're never gonna be, now
Sketch a little keyhole for looking-glass people
You don't wanna see him, you only wanna be him
Mommy's got a scarecrow, gotta let the corn grow
Man can't always reap what he sow
He is the maker
He is the taker
He is the savior
He is the raper

Get back, you're never gonna leave him
Get back, you're always gonna please him
Get back, you're never gonna leave him
Get back, you're always gonna please him

He is the angel with the scabbed wings
Hard-drug face, wanna powder his nose
He will deflower the freshest crop
Dry up all the wombs with rock and roll sores

Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Rock and roll sores
Man can't always reap what he sow7Embed
