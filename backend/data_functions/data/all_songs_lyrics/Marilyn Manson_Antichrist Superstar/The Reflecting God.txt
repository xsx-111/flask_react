The Reflecting God Lyrics
Your world is an ashtray, we burn and coil like cigarettes
The more you cry, your ashes turn to mud
The nature of the leeches, the virgin's feeling cheated
You've only spent a second of your life

My world is unaffected
There is an exit here, I say it is and it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead

I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies
When I'm God, everyone dies

Scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here, and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
One shot, and the world gets smaller

Let's jump upon the sharp swords, cut away our smiles
Without the threat of death there's no reason to live, at all
My world is unaffected
There is an exit here, I say it is and it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more I sleep
You'll understand when I'm dead

I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me
Saw Heaven and Hell were lies
When I'm God, everyone dies

Scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
One shot, and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here, and the world gets smaller
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker

Each thing I show you is a piece of my death
No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness (This is beyond your experience)
No salvation, no forgiveness
No salvation, no forgiveness (Forgiveness)
No salvation, no forgiveness (Forgiveness, forgiveness)
No salvation, no forgiveness (Forgiveness, forgiveness)
No salvation, no forgiveness (Forgiveness, forgiveness)
No salvation, no forgiveness (Forgiveness)
I went to God just to see
And I was looking at me, yeah
Saw heaven and hell were lies
When I'm God, everyone dies

Scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here, and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
Scar, scar, can you feel my power?
One shot, and the world gets smaller

Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker
Shoot, shoot, shoot motherfucker12Embed
