Kinderfeld Lyrics
He lives inside my mouth, tells me what to say
When he turns the trains on, he makes it go away
Hands are cracked and dirty, and the nails are beetle wings
When he turns the trains on, he unties all of the strings

"Tell me something beautiful
Tell me something free
Tell me something beautiful
And I wish that I could be"

Then I got my wings
And I never even knew it
When I was a worm
Thought I couldn't get through it

Come, come
Toys all smell like children, and the scab-knees will obey
I'll have to kneel on broomsticks just to make it go away

Then I got my wings
And I never even knew it
When I was a worm
Thought I couldn't get through it
"Because today is black
Because there is no turning back
Because your lies have watered me
I have become the strongest weed"
"Because today is black
Because there is no turning back
Because your lies have watered me
I have become the strongest weed"

The taste of metal, Disintegrator
Three holes upon the leather belt
It's cut and swollen, the age is showing
"There's no one here to save ourselves"

This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear
This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear
This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear
This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear
This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear
This is what you should fear
You are what you should fear3Embed
