Seven Months Lyrics
How can I forget you
Disregard how I feel
Silently listen
To the words I can't see

As long as I have tried
As low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek

Why should I forgive you
After all that I've seen
Quietly whisper
When my heart wants to scream

For as long as I have tried
And as low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seek

There's no time to rest
Or to reconsider
For this cruel unsaid
Won't concede
For as long as I have tried
And as low as I can be
I will never resign myself
From the trial I seekEmbed
