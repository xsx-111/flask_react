Half Day Closing Lyrics
In the days of golden days
When everybody knew what they wanted
It ain't here today

Through the times of lasting love
When parents talked of things tried and tested
It don't feel the same

Dreams and belief have gone
Time, life itself goes on

Far beyond the shrinking skies
Where money talks and leaves us hypnotised
It don't pave the way

Underneath the fading sun
The silent sum of a businessman
Has left us choking

Dreams and belief have gone
Time, life itself goes on
In the days, the golden days
When everybody knew what they wanted
It ain't here today

Dreams and belief have gone
Time, life itself goes onEmbed
