Mourning Air Lyrics
Did I see a moment with you
In a half lit world
I'm frightened to believe
But I must try
If I stumble if I fall

I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohh

Have I got the strength to ask
Beyond the window
I feel this fear alone
Until we have
Total honesty
If I tremble or fall

I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohh

Should I feel a moment with you
To softly whisper
I crave nothing else so much
Longing to reveal
Total honesty
I can feel your touch
I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohh

I'm reaching out in this mourning air, ohhEmbed
