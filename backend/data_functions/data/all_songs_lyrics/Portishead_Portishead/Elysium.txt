Elysium Lyrics
No one has said
What the truth should be
And no one decided
That I'd feel this way
If you felt as I
Would you betray yourself?

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

No one should fear
What they cannot see
And no one's to blame
It's just hypocrisy
It's written in your eyes
And how I despise myself

But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me

And it's your heart
That's so wrong
Mistaken
You'll never know
Your feathered sacred self
But you can't deny how I feel
And you can't decide for me
And you can't deny how I feel
Oh, why should you decide for me?4Embed
