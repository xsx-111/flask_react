Over Lyrics
I can't hold this day anymore
Understand me anymore
To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over

I can't mould this stage anymore
Recognise me anymore
To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?
Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
Yes, it's all over, yeah
Oh, it's all over, yeah3Embed
