The Bitter End LyricsIf ever you should die I know I'll shave my head
Its not a morbid thought, I mean it out of love
Come back daddy
Come back to the bitter end
Come back daddy
Hounds-tooth coats and vitamins
If ever the sea claims the cities on the coast
Before the last bridge blows I know I will propose
Come back baby
Armed with paddles in your hands
Come back baby
Come back to the bitter end
The soil on the spade will be my love and hurt
The cellphone satellites will hurl to the earth
To the earth
But in the moon
There is half of our shadow on
From in the womb
There are strange sounds on the water front
And it takes a monk
To lose it all
Come back baby
Come back to the bitter end
Come back everything that caught up in the plans
Come back baby
Come back to the bitter end
Come back everything that put salt in the sandEmbed
