Go On, Say It LyricsPicking up sound on the interstate
I am my breath
Letting in waves
There will be time when the sleep I'm in
Covers me cold
Covers me thin
I know I'll wake up old
Forgetting which box this is in
How I will keep you
Uh huh...uh huh
Uh huh...uh huh
Just how I left you
Our daughter once told me I know a lot
Now I'm strutting off with more than I've got
A hitchhiker told me I don't talk a lot
Made me feel fine
Made me quiet
If you had said it right
Instead of painting words white...
How I would keep you
Uh huh...uh huh
Uh huh...uh huh
Just how I left you
Uh huh...uh huh
Come on say it right
Uh huh...uh huh
Come on say it right. Come on say it right
Come on say it right. Come on say it right
Come on say it right. Come on say it right
Come on say it right2Embed
