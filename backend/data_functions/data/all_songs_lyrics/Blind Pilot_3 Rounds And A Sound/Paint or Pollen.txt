Paint or Pollen LyricsDon't move an inch
Listen for a singing
Hitting in your bones like they were forks
If you hear what I hear
Don't just sit there
We are only strumming water
On this most unlikely chord
You got blown shore to shore
Not quite sailing
Riding on the trade-winds of age
Things blow in
Don't just cast them
You say it now, what you want to stay
I was once on a long boat
Star mapping the night routes
Lightening the load
Just in case
Things float in to be taken
If you don't know by now, what will stay?
So don't move an inch
Don't move a single second
Until the shade behind your thoughts is not confused
Cause I felt your itch
I know the scent as well as any
Clotting your garden
Of paint or pollen
Brick in your mortar
Petals to soak in
On the cracks
Thicker or finer
Milk in your water
Black in your primer
Wood in your brush
Now I am your cloth
Whatever you want-
The best is upon us
Its a finicky muse
With only potential
