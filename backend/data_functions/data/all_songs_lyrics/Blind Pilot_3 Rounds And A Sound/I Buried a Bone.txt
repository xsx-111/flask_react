I Buried a Bone LyricsI buried a bone
And darling you don't know him
Darling you don't know him
Darling you don't know
And just where you are
Might be the right place
It might be that sweet space
But you don't know
Now look me in the head
I've got nothing on my mind
I've been waiting for you
All this time
And I'd seen a path turn to an old road
But the secret's too slow
And we're too fast
Look me in the mouth
I've got nothing in my smile
I've been waiting for you
You're just my style
Look me in the gut
I've got fear for my own name
I'd dig it up for you
If you'd do the same
I buried a bone
And darling you don't know him
Darling you don't know him
Darling you don't knowEmbed
