3 Rounds and a Sound Lyrics
They're playing our song
They're playing our song
Can you see the light
Can you hear the hum
Of our song
I hope they get it right
I hope we dance tonight
Before we get it wrong
And the seasons will change us new
But you're the best I've known
And you know me
I could not be stuck on you
If it weren't true
I was swimming
My eyes were dark
'Til you woke me
And told me that opening
Is just the start
It was
Now I see you, 'til kingdom come
You're the one I want
To see me for all
The stupid shit I've done
Soil and six feet under
Kept just like we were
Before you knew you'd know me
And you know me
Blooming up from the ground
3 rounds and a sound
Like whispering, you know me
You know me

So this was our song
This was our song
I still see the lights
I can see them
And the crisscross
Of what is true, won't get to us
Cause you know me
I could not give up on you
And the fog of what is right
Won't cover us
Cause you know me
I could not give up a fight
Soil and six feet under
(Crisscross of what is true, won't get to us)
Kept just like we were
(Cause you know me, I could not give up on you)
Before you knew you'd know me
(Wouldn't feel true)
And you know me
Blooming up from the ground
(And the fog of what is right won't cover us)
3 rounds and a sound
(Cause you know me, I could not give up a fight)
Like whispering 'you know me
(Wouldn't feel right)
You know me5Embed
