The Story I Heard Lyrics
Hey Jojo
Yeah I know your name
I thought I saw you
Jump the Utah train
But I could not say
I could not say

Heard you tried to
Keep your heart on the shelf
Married a woman
Went off and loved someone else
It could be as well
I cannot tell
Oh, no I cannot tell

Hey Jojo
Don't you forget your name
Might try to keep you
From the man you have been
So don't go that way
Don't go that way

Oh 'cause the story I heard
Is that people are bored
And the measures you take
To wrestle with your lord
All the money you take
All the memories you spill
Will he measure your tongue
Will he measure your will
Oh now
One of these mornings
Will be the loudest you hear
You'll write your story
On firecracker paper
And disappear
You disappear
And disappear
And you disappear

Oh 'cause the story I heard
Is that people are bored
And the measures you take
To wrestle with your lord
Are the measures you fake
Whether you're dead or just still
Will he measure your time
Will he measure your will
Oh now

One of these mornings
We'll be, we'll be
One of these mornings
We'll be, we'll be home3Embed
