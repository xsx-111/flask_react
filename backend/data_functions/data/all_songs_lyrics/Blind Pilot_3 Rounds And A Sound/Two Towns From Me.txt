Two Towns From Me LyricsRemember the world
Living in the half
That you cannot see
Been walking along
The thinning tide
And stepping in too deep
Watching water thread my sleeve
What did I pull from underneath
Tie it down
Wait it out
Hope our memories hold
Lead white nail
Driven down
A hundred years ago
Feeling wheels on my old road
Feeling bad for what I sold
I had a dream you were two towns from me
Got to sleep, spent the whole night running
Dive in gold
Wet their breath
And live in between
Hollow bones
Knowing both
What they want and what they need
How I want that mystery
Let me dive 'til I believe
I had a dream you were two towns from me
Got to sleep, spent the whole night, whole night
Had a dream were nothing more than
Caught up in our own lives, Honey1Embed
