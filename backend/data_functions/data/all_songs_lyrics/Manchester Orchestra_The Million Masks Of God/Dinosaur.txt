Dinosaur Lyrics
Fall asleep
Start drifting over, stunned police
Wildly enlightened, pace your peace
Nobody really knew him, but you and me
Were raised by the lion

Hold me now
I will not repeat myself
So hold me now
All I do is repeat myself
Over and over
Over and over

Wait for me
The future is passing you and me
And nobody's laughing, fate, for me
It’s recycled and haunted so rescue me
From raising a lion

Hold me down
I will not repeat myself
So hold me down
Yeah, all I do's repeat myself
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over

Love me now
I will not repeat myself
So love me now
'Cause I just can’t redeem myself
From all the lies I told myself would help
From all my faults I blame on someone else

Over and over1Embed
