Inaudible Lyrics
You're inaudible
Thrown away like an audible
Wheel you down to the old folks' home
Are you listening to me?
I'm your obstacle
Dad would tell you, "Impossible"
So my options are optional
Do you see what I mean?
You're mumbling

"Afterlife? Some wasted light"
And the notion you'll never be free
So, spend all your time on money
'Cause money is the only thing you need

So I catapult
I jump you like an animal
You bite back like an animal
And we both try to leave
You're mumbling

"Afterlife? Some wasted light"
And the notion you’ll nevеr be free
So, spend all your time on monеy
'Cause money is the only thing you need
(Have no bad dreams)
(Have no bad dreams)
(Have no bad dreams)

Now that you're clawing the top and it's taken your air
Are you here but in some ways you vanished?
Are you clear but you're lost in the wind?
Now you're clawing the top and it's finally taken your air
Are you clean, but you're finally forsaken?
Are you washing it out with your hands?

Are you washing it out with your hands?
Are you washing it out with your hands?Embed
