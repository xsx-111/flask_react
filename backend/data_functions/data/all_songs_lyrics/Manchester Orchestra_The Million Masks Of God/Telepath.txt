Telepath Lyrics
In my mind, you are an old empty apartment
Sitting on your mother’s table next to you is her
Carving out our names into each piece of wood and concrete
Told her I don’t have a lot babe but you can have my soul

Baby do you want me?
Baby do you want me?
Baby do you want me?
No, no, no

In your mind, this is some new and glorious morning
And you ain’t ever gonna let nobody take that light again
Everyone I know is slowly falling in the ocean
I don’t want to be the next to row, I never learned to swim

Baby do you love me?
Baby do you love me?
Baby do you love me?
No, no, no

In my mind, you are the road I chose to travel
Might as well have been the very last thing I decide
Half the time I’m lost, afraid that you’re just borrowed
It don’t matter much to me man, I’m not afraid to die
Baby are you with me?
Do you forgive me?
You’re the one I wanted, want now, want when I am old

Baby are you with me?
Do you forgive me?
You’re the one I wanted, want now, want when I am old

When I’m falling
When I’m falling1Embed
