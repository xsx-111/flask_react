Way Back Lyrics
I don't miss you
The way that I did
Rearrange me
Buried again
Now I can't find you
Oh, where have you been?
The opened closet
The terror begins

Way back, way back
Way back, way back

How'd I miss it?
And where did it go?
Searching cobwebs
Finally, alone
Now I see it
There is nothing to hold
Let me fix it
Move, move

Wave back, wave back
Wave back, wave back
Wave back, way back
Wave back, way back
When it began, I was starvin', wide eyed and alone, afloat
I wanted to turn off my time and ignore what was done, thе gun
The only demand I could muster was bеgging you no, so know
I'm moving to mute all my memories I made in that moat, I know
That I won't stop breathing
I know (So young to fall)
That I won't (So learn to fall)
Stop (So learn to fall)
