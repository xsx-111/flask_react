The Internet Lyrics
Wake me up
I am inside of it
You were in spite of it
I was on fire for it
Let me admire this and let go
In your web
I was an autograph
You were the internet
There was no arguing that
Thousands of photographs to recall

Do you know what it means?
Another life outside dismantling me
Do you know what it means?
Another man inside the man that's in me

Make me up
I am your silhouette
You are my alphabet
Holding our iron in
And I'm just obsessed with it to take hold

Do you know what it means?
Another life outside dismantling me
Do you know what it means?
Another man inside the man that's in me
(All I want's the weight erased for you)
Under the gun
Undone again
Uncloud my heart
(Yeah, all I want's the weight erased for you)
Unsee the dead
Untie my mind
Unframe my mess
Untrain my eyes
(Yeah, silently I wait and pace for you)
Untame my head
Under the gun
Undone again
Uncloud my heart
(Yeah, all I want's the weight erased for you)
Unsee the dead
Untie my mind
Unframe my mess
Untrain my eyes
Untame my head

So what's that story about?
The boy had to learn his lesson
This time there was really a wolf
And guess what that wolf did?
What?
Ate the sheep
And all this time
I thought I was right
And all this time
I thought I was right1Embed
