Let It Storm Lyrics
You like the echo in here?

Waiting in your line
You gotta go this time
Wouldn't waste my time
You wouldn't lie, you wouldn't lie
Baby's breath, another secret kept
Another lost regret
Another movement in the thread

Oh, don't mind, I wouldn't hurt you
Oh, don't mind, I wouldn't search you
Desert you, convert you

I don't wanna hold back my faith anymore
I don't wanna fall into that man again
I just wanna keep both my feet on the floor
So let it touch me
And let it storm

Fairness in your time
You had a lot, let it slide
You wrote it down, let it hide
You felt it blossom in your mind
Fear is for thе faux so let it go, let it go
You lay it down, watch it grow
You let it livе, you take it home
Oh, don't mind, I wouldn't hurt you
Oh, don't mind, I wouldn't search you
Desert you, convert you

I don't wanna hold back my faith anymore
I don't wanna fall into that man again
I just wanna keep both my feet on the floor
So let it touch me
And let it storm

When the guilt's got you strapped to your bed
Gnashing teeth while you bargain your debt
You just can't get it out of your head
Call it holy

I don't wanna hold back my faith anymore
I don't wanna fall into that man again
I just wanna keep both my feet on the floor
So let it touch me
And let it storm
