Keel Timing Lyrics
Thunder inside my head, it's rolling
Thunder inside my head, it’s just rolling
I'm a dog, you're the cops, I am rolling

Don’t let 'em in your bed, we're lying
Don't let 'em in your bed, he is lying
Little more, a little more, he is biting

I was folding slowly frozen
Changed for you
And it wasn't right, but it wasn't wrong
It was holy

I think I'll start again, slowly
Help rearrange my head, slowly
I’m the woods, you’re the fire, interloping

I was smoking red light glowing
Flamed for you
It wasn't mine, but it wasn’t wrong
It was holy
Hold me now
No, I will not repeat myself
So hold me down
Yeah, all I do is rеpeat myself
Oh oh oh

Something insidе my head, growing
Something inside my chest, growing
Little more, little more, who is holy?

I've been coping, slowly sloping
Changed the truth
It is in the heart, it is in the blood, it's in the story

So love me now
No, I will not repeat myself
So love me now
Yeah, all I do is repeat myself
There's comfort in the constant quell
Now I’m awake and I don't know how
Oh oh oh1Embed
