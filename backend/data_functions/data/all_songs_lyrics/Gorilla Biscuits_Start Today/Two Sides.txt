Two Sides LyricsSome people think they're always right and right is all they'll ever be
Well there's two sides and ego's divide
And we're so concerned with who's right
These people are so quick to judge
Let's get the judgement straight
It's not who's wrong it's how we get along
And I don't think that we do yet
TRUTH is a word that you're sure of
Or so you've said
But I'd love to see you give someone else a chance
Open up, It's not so hard
Is hard what you want to be to kick some ass
It's a sure bet you'll get your way with no friends left
Don't say you know what I'm about, because you don't
For God's sake give me a fucking break
You don't even know my name
TRUTH is a word that you're sure of
Or so you've said
But I'd love to see you give someone else a chance
I listen to the things you say, I've weighed the facts out in my head
Can you do the same...No, then don't waste my time
TRUTH is a word that you're of
It's all you said
But I'd love to see you give someone else a chance
This time my mind is set
My side you'll never get
What I say
What did you say
We can both be right just not in the same way
You think we could reach some common ground...No...no wayEmbed
