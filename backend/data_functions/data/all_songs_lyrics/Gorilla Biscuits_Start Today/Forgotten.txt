Forgotten LyricsDedicated to your cause look at all the friends you've lost
Discarded because I'm no more use
Our tight friendship is hanging loose
Stepping on the people who were getting all the things you wanted
Now that you've got them we're forgotten. No need
For token interest in my life
Don't make amends, don't even try
Guilty Conscience? Maybe not
You just want more of what I've got
Stepping on the people who were getting
All the things you wanted
Now that you've got them we're forgotten
But I'll remember you
Try and think why
Why you carry on this way
It's not you talking
It's your greed I hear
Nothing means nothing if you're insincere
I don't know why
You decide I'm not worth calling up
Things have changed between you and me
We don't hang out but that's okEmbed
