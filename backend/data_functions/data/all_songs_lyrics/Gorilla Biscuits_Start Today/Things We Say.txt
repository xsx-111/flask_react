Things We Say LyricsHumor's got a place like all things
Be aware of the pain it can sometimes bring
A joke to you might not be so funny
So take the time and think it out before you open up your mouth
I can't believe the things we say
A cutting word can ruin days
I can't believe the things we say
Now I wish I hadn't spoke
Can't you learn to take a fucking joke
We say things we don't mean but friends understand
Strength and humor don't always go hand in hand
A joke to you might not be so funny
So take the time and think it out before you open up your mouth
I can't believe the things we say
A cutting word can ruin days
I can't believe the things we say
Now I wish I hadn't spoke
Can't you learn to take a fuckin' joke
But no one's laughing
I wish that I could crack a smile, but I can't
I know he's just a fucking jerk
But jerks hurt too
And I'm not that cool that I can laugh
I see because it's happened to me
And I think I was an asshole when I said what I said
It's just a sick sense of humor rolls around in my head
Cause we've had our fun at your expense and that's wrong
And we know it
You said we were friends
For friendship's sake
Let's give it a break
I can't believe the things we say
A cutting word can ruin days
I can't believe the things we sayEmbed
