First Failure LyricsI've worked so hard on things that never seemed to pay off
But looking back I realize that I never really meant that much
And if you've been let down
And if it's not the first time
I'm sorry, and I know how it feels
When my eyes see a loser in the mirror
I think "what did I do?"
Sure I fucked up, but I got back up
So that loser shits out the window
And if you been let down, it might not be the last time
Cheer up, it will hurt much less tomorrow
We're all tired of fucking up and that's not just being sorry
It means brush the dirt off, get up and try again
When you're sick of trying, how can you expect to succeed?
I can't recall my first failure, and I'll forget this one too over time
And if you've been let down, it might not be the last time
Cheer up, it will hurt much less tomorrow
We're all tired of fucking up and that's not just being sorry
It means brush the dirt off, get up and try againEmbed
