Competition LyricsIt seems that all succesful things and all the envy that they bring
Might not be worth it
Being shot down every minute for the effort you put in and all the time that you've spent
The key to success is the faith in knowing you're right
Memories of better days is what you're holding onto
When the critics loved you
Competition has it's way of bringing you down
Bringing you down
Always being number one, robs the music of it's fun
Ego trips get in the way of the goals we set
Now the audience is split
We've worked too hard to watch it all, ALL FADE AWAY
Memories of better days is what you're holding onto
When the critics loved you
Competition has it's way of making you mad
Why can't you be glad...for me?
Well I know what competition means
And all the feelings that it brings
Friends that want to be on top
You're on the list of the friends to drop
Success is what I want to feel
What you're expecting isn't real
It's jealousy...
And jealousy's not true
No it's not true...at your expense
In competition with youEmbed
