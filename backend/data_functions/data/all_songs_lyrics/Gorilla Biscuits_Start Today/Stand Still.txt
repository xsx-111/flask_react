Stand Still LyricsSitting down on a couch, you watch
A fucking slave to a TV show
You thought before but you sat and dropped
What did you learn? You don't even know
And I kid myself but my eyes are glued on this thing
It steals my time and it wastes what I've learned
I'm holding out for a better deal, for something real
You know I'd like to say that I could spend a day
At home with it left off
How strong's our will?
Stand still!
I can't fit in with the ads I see
They're better looking than me
You try to look your best, but you'll never rest
Think, it won't make you happy
A standard set that i just can not live up to
It steals my time and wastes what I've learned
I'm holding out for a better deal, for something real
You know I'd like to say that I could spend a day
At home with it left off
How strong's our will?
Stand still!
Our lives are led by TV shows, you know it's true
Instead of thinking we play Donkey Kong
There's something wrong with that
We're made to think life is like a game show
So here we go again
The one who dies with the most toys is the one who wins
Stand still!
I just can't stand it
Stand still!
Sitting down on a couch, you watch
A fucking slave to a TV show
You thought before but you sat and dropped
What did you learn?
You don't even know
Is it a brain vacation, or mental masturbation?
It steals my time and it wastes what I've learned
I'm holding out for some reality
I'd like to say that I could spend a day at home with it left off
How strong's our will?
Stand still!Embed
