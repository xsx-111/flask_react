Good Intentions LyricsThings I try don't work out
Other people gripe and shout
That's not positive
I'm not perfect, I'm just Civ
Trial and error
Good intentions
Throw a beer at the stage
That's how you behave
Paid admission, had no fun
You think I'm the stupid one
Think again
Good intentions
I'll just try my best
And you?
