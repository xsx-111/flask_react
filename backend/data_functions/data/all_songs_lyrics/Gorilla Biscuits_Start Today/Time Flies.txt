Time Flies Lyrics(Time flies)
I'm lucky to be where I am today
Not by myself, summer's on the way
The jobs I'll be working, the money I'll spend, not making a living
Just making new friends
And I'm trying my hardest to make the most out of every minute
Not getting any younger, getting older. it's scary
Swept out from under your feet your youth's gone and you wonder why...
BECAUSE TIME FLIES
How much does it cost the booze and the drugs you need
Put your life on pause
Is it that much fun, maybe for some
I think its dumb to let anyone or anything slow me down or prevent me from living my life
The most of every minute
Not getting younger, getting older
It's scary
And I'm scared too
Time flies!
Work machine makes us old before our time
I don't consent that's how I feel
Because life's too short, so I do what I can to get by
I'll decide where my time is spent and you can bet there'll be a smile on my face
How about yours? How about yours
Cause time fliesEmbed
