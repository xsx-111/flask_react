Degradation LyricsTell me who's pure, tell me who's right
Tell me the last time that you fought a fair fight
A loser's way to find some friends
You look like a skin but that's where it ends
True, they're always at our shows
It doesn't mean we fit in with their hatred and racism shit
They ruin our name, you know what I mean
Racial supremacists, they degrade our scene
You know you can kiss my ass before I read your 'zine
There's no good side to this white power scene
Kids beat down for standing up
Your turn will come because we've all had enough
You look like kids we know, you're not welcome here
You don't like music and we don't like fear
I guess it's your right to be proud that you're white
Are you here for music or just to pick fights?
Don't fool yourself cause you don't fool me
It's not just blacks you hate
It's everything you see
Rich, poor, young and old, whoever's in your way
What a boring life, hating every day
You've got nothing but hatredEmbed
