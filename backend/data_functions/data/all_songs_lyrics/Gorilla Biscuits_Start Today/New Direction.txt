New Direction Lyrics
What do you mean it's time, time for me to grow up?
I don't want any part. It's right to follow my heart
The new kids ran, ran out the back door fast
And the bands that came before
They had their noses in the air
Pretending that they care about our scene
Just because our money's green
I'll tell you stage dives make me feel more alive
Than coded messages in slowed down songs

Now you're so ashamed
Now I'm so ashamed of you
We believed the same things
You stand to the side, rebirth of hardcore pride
It all came true
Too bad you can't see all the good things that I see

Back in, back in the days
When I'd wait to see the old bands play
It didn't seem like wasted days
I was so sincere, but now I see more clearly
Music's only work to them, it's not to me
So I say "Hats off to bands that change
Good luck, go your own way"
Why play for us if your heart's not in it?
Cause what might seem dumb to you
Is pounding in my heart
Now you're so ashamed
Now I'm so ashamed of you
We believed the same things
You stand to the side, rebirth of hardcore pride
It all came true
Too bad you can't see all the good things that I see
No, you just can't fucking see it

Now you just turn your back
You said I don't want it any more
Old friends you attack
Our pain, out of touch
You don't get it do you?
New stage, new ideas
You don't need to make excuses for us
Sitting there looking back, I'm scared
Don't spoil memories of the way things were1Embed
