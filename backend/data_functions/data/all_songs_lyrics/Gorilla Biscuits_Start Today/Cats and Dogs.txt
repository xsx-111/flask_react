Cats and Dogs LyricsMan's best friend is beautiful, affectionate, an ideal pet
Cats are the same, we make up their names and our love for them is real
Listen up, I gotta ask you, how can we be so cruel?
You say you care, that's a lie
My true compassion is for all living things and not just the ones that are cute so I do what I can
I wanna save lives and I've got a plan
Under the table he'll eat your dinner like the veggies we can't stand
What kind of meal would he make?
We don't want to ask it
Tradition is all that keeps him alive
Listen up, I gotta ask you, how can we be so cruel?
You say you care, that's a lie
My true compassion is for all living things and not just the ones who are cute so I do what I can
I wanna save lives and I've got a plan
Why am I so upset
Don't even own a pet
I am not trying to press my will
I am not the first to say...
THOU SHALT NOT KILL
Full is all you want to feel
We eat to stay alive, but it's their lives we steal
I think we'd like to change
But most of us are stuck, that's why cats and dogs have
ALL THE LUCKEmbed
