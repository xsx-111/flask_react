Pothole Lyrics
The fossils of my footsteps
Will be unearthed at a far-off date unknown
Impressed in concrete from walking home alone
After walking you home
And the mops of greasy hair
Will romanticize my despair
But they won't know
That I didn't care

I liked the silence
I liked the empty streets
Crawl down 'em on hands and knees in a heartbeat
If I had to
I owe them that, at the very least

The map had faded out
But I could've sworn I noted every stride
I guess the rain hit before the ink could dry
And where I thought I'd be
Was not what I perceived
Assessing the progress
From beneath your sheets
That's why I need the silence
I need the empty streets
Just as bad as they don't need me
It's a sick, sad sham of a marriage
But it's all there is
And it's all I need

I can be everything you need
If you make me
I can be every crack in your concrete
If you let me off easy
I can be easily deceived
If you want that
But you are the ember of my heart
Whether you like that or not6Embed
