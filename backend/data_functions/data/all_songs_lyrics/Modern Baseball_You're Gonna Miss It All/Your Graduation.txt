Your Graduation Lyrics
It's been three whole years of me thinking 'bout you every day
Sometimes for hours, sometimes in passing
Saw you from the bottom of the staircase
Stood out for hours as you complained
About how you haven't seen your friends yet
That you're too drunk to stand and
You not knowing if you can love him forever
Bullshit, you fucking miss me!
There, I said it! I guess I'll talk to you in a few months
Sitting drunk on the sidewalk
I guess I'll get up, I guess I'll go for a walk
Press my shoes against the pavement
I swear, this has gotta be the hundredth
Time I've thought of you tonight

You weren't the only one who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go, let you walk away
Where I let you walk away
Used to call you a crook, called you a bandit
There ain't no other good damn reason why
My heart, it would go missing
For so many months, so I was wishing that you
That you would stop pretending
Remember all those countless nights
When I told you I loved you
And to never forget it? Oh, just forget it!
You weren't the only one who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go, let you walk away
Where I let you walk away


You weren't the only one who thought of us that way
I spend most nights awake, wide awake
I never thought that I, oh, I would see the day
Where I'd just let you go, let you walk away
Go ahead and walk away31Embed
