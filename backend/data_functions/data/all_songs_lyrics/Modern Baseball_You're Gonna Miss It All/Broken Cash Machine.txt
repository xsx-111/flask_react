Broken Cash Machine Lyrics
Home alone on Friday night
No better time for exercise
And wishing you were still my girlfriend
Sweeping floors and folding napkins
Praying something cool might happen
The sun explodes, we die, the world ends
Talking to my friends about stuff
Nasty beer and plastic handcuffs
Back when them and you and me
Would share our space in harmony

Oh, why did I do that?
Why does everything collapse?
Even when it's glued together
Hey, why did I do that?
I make everything collapse
Even when it's glued together

Questioning my awkward footing
Mixing bitter pills with chocolate pudding
Hiding gifted fixtures
Trying not to say words out loud
Wondering if I'm talking too loud
My eyes burning holes in your old pictures
Oh, why did I do that?
Why does everything collapse?
Even when it's glued together
Hey, why did I do that?
I make everything collapse
Even when it's glued together
Fuck you! Why did I do that?
It's your fault I can't relax
But nothing's changing while I'm sitting here
With both hands glued together4Embed
