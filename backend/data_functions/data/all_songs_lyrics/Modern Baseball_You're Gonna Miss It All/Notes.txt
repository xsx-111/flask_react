Notes Lyrics
Dear long, dark hair
I write 'cause I know you'll forget
You could be sea-green in a wastebasket tomorrow
No repulsion toward
My premature indulgences
If you can't recall a word I said

Not like those cheekbones
That crooked nose
No, those fellas stick around too long
Perpetuating every pathetic word that I would skew
Into song

She was my trophy shelf of slip-ups
My untamed, hormonal Loch Ness shitshow
On late night rotation for months on end
A brick-boot swimming lesson
In the deep end of my adolescence
Scrawling notes on the backs of my hands

But I'll start fresh with you
Extracting the rusted attachments
Keeping the die-hard nuts, bolts, and screws
We'll go from Square One
With the wit of an old pro
And you can fill in the gaps
With whatever you know
My long, dark hair3Embed
