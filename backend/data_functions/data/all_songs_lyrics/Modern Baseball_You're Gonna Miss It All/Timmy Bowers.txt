Timmy Bowers Lyrics
Wait a minute 'cause
I've been living more like a piece of shit without you
And I've been spending all your past killings
Trying to drink my way out of this groove
Wait a minute 'cause
I've been living more like a piece of shit without you
And I've been spending all your past killings
Trying to drink my way out of this groove
Wait a minute 'cause
I've been living more like a piece of shit without you
And I've been spending all your past killings
Trying to drink my way out of this groove
Wait a minute 'cause
I've been living more like a piece of shit without you1Embed
