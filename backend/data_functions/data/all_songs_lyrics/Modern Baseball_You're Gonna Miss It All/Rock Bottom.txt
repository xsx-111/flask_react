Rock Bottom Lyrics
Is he here? Are you making out?
I can you hear you guys on the couch
Shut up, make out, do something already, I'm waiting
After reading that text from your friends
I start losing all my confidence
So I'll stay tired, I know soon I'll be bailing

Then, you—you ask if I gotta leave
And I wish that I could say no


My head is on the verge of exploding
No amount of aspirin or pizza could help this from hurting
And now, I'm turning to you, scared shitless
Hoping this song goes well
Can we highlight the fact that
My mouth smells like coffee and garlic?
The five cups I had this morning are getting to me
I gotta go—I got the worst fucking spins

Then, you—you ask if I gotta leave
And I wish that I could say no
But we’re so caught up in the moment
And I just need a second to catch my goddamn breath
(... Fuck it!)
To hell with the spins, I'm staying
There's no good reason why I should leave your bed tomorrow
We can watch "Planet Earth" and brainstorm tattoos
To hell with class, I'm skipping
Let's order food and sleep in
I've got so much to do
But it's OK, 'cause "whatever, forever"
To hell with the spins, I'm staying
There's no good reason why I should leave your bed tomorrow
We can watch "Planet Earth" and brainstorm tattoos7Embed
