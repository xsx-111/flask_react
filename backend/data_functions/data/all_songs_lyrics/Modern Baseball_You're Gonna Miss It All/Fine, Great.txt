Fine, Great Lyrics
I hate worrying about the future
'Cause all my current problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's all right, and I'm okay
I won't need your help, anyway, ah, well
I hate having to think about my future
When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me

I'm so tired, or maybe just bored
I can't really tell the difference whenever I'm talking to you
And I know that you just adore
Starting off with me, that way
That there's no way that I'll assume
That you're wasting all of my time
To vent about your problems
Like how your Instagram stopped working
And how your friends bailed on you, but it was funny
'Cause it was the day you were supposed to hang with me
(Yeah... About that...)

I'm guilty as charged for leading you on
A lie that I know is easy to see
But it's crucial to blot out any
Signs that I might have feelings
This way, you don't ask me, "How am I?"
This way you won't force me to proceed
With actually having to tell you my worries
With actually having you give a damn about me
You giving a damn about...
I hate worrying about the future
'Cause all my fucking problems are based around the past
And I hate when you call me late at night
Just to check in to make sure I got nothing to be sad about
But it's alright, and I'm okay
I won't need your help, anyway, ah, well
I hate having to think about my future
When all I wanna do is worry about everyone but me12Embed
