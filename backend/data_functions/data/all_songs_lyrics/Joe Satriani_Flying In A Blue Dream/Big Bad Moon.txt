Big Bad Moon LyricsWhen the night falls, the big moon's gonna rise
You can look right up, see it in the sky
Makes me feel like I'm going to blow a fuse
I start to shiver and shake with a strange kind of blues
But I like it
I see it now, the moon is high above
It's got a hold on me, but I just can't get enough
Big, round, black and white, I feel the pull, I see the light
A big bad moon's looking down on me tonight
But I like it
When the moon comes, got nowhere to hide
It can turn your head around like it turns the tide
Man, woman, boy, child, makes you feel like you were born wild
The big bad moon's looking down on me tonight
But I like it
I like it
Talkin' 'bout big bad moon
Ooh yeah, the big bad moon
Talkin' 'bout big bad moon
Ooh yeahEmbed
