I Believe LyricsI've been out walking for hours
I've got something on my mind
How did we get here? Where are we going?
And why is life so hard?
I read the stories, see the photographs
World's in a crazy space
I've got to hold on to my dreams
There's just no other place
There's just no other place
I believe
We can change anything
I believe
We can rise above this
I believe
There's a reason for everything
I believe
In my dream
I've seen the shadows of the living
I've seen them turn and walk away
And I keep searchin' for the right words
To send these thoughts away
There's a picture I like to look at
A picture of a beautiful face
And I see something in her eyes
Sends me to a better place
Sends me to a better place
I believe
We can change anything
I believe
We can rise above this
I believe
There's a reason for everything
I believe
In my dream
I believe
We can change anything
I believe
In my dreamEmbed
