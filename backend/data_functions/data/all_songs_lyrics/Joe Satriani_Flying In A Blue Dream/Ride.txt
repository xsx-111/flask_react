Ride LyricsI know some people like to take life easy
That's not my style
I'm not the type to let this life tease me
I'm gonna make it wild
I just wanna ride
Get on my bike and ride
Some people think you've got to like your life one way
I disagree
I'm not gonna pay attention to them anyway
It's got nothing, nothing to do with me
Life is so short, we've got
No time to waste at all
I just wanna ride
Get on my bike and ride
I just wanna ride
Get on my bike and ride
I see the road, as it opens up before me
I feel the heat
I'm gonna go where I want, when I want to
Just got to be free
I just wanna ride
Get on my bike and ride
I just wanna ride
Get on my bike and ride
Feels so right...
Feels so good...Embed
