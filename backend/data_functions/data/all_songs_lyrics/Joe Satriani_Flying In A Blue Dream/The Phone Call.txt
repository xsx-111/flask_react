The Phone Call Lyrics(Gimme that phone!)
I got to talk to you, baby, set the record straight
'Cause this relationship is goin' from love to hate
You're always trying to make me do things that are really dumb
And we're always disagreein' on how to have fun
And you know I don't want what you want
I want what I want
Well, you look like a yuppie, and that's too bad
Yeah, it used to be funny, but now it's sad
And your friends are all stupid and they talk too much
And I'd feel a lot better staying out of touch
And you know I don't want what you want
I want what I want
You can say goodbye to me, honey
You can say goodbye to my money
Well, I'm sittin' here callin' from Tennessee
And I've been jammin' with my buddies like I ought to be
And it feels real good bein' on my own
And I don't mind leaving you dry as bone
But you know I don't want what you want
I want what I want
Well, it's all over, it's just too late
And I'm so glad we're living in different states
You know I said it all before like I knew I should
But you got nothing in your head but a block of wood
And you know I don't want what you want
I want what I want
You know I don't want what you want
I want what I want
You know I don't want what you want
I want what I want
Ow! YeahEmbed
