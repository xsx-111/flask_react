Strange LyricsMy heart is pounding, my stomach's inside out
I'm feeling kinda shaky, my mind is full of doubt
All I ever think about is fearing fear itself
I wish I could unscrew my head and put it on the shelf
You know I'm feeling kinda... Strange
You know I'm feeling kinda... Strange
Everything is twisted, everything is oh so tight
Don't know what I'm looking at, the lights are all too bright
My brain's about to crumble, spill out on the floor
Sweep 'em up, throw 'em away, I don't want 'em any more
You know I'm feeling kinda... Strange
You know I'm feeling kinda... Strange
Clouds race across the sky, day turns into night
Still there are the questions, no answers in sight
Everything is twisted, everything is oh so tight
Staring out the window, everything is just too bright
Brain's about to crumble, spill out on the floor
Wish I could unscrew my head and kick it out the door
You know I'm feeling kinda... Strange
You know I'm feeling kinda... StrangeEmbed
