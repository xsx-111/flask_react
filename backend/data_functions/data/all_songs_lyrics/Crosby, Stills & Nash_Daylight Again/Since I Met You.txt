Since I Met You LyricsSince I met you
In the time it takes to count from one to four
I'll be back and asking you is there more
Yes it is all about your loving
I am yours I can't get enough of your love
Since I met you
Might be all about I like the things you say
I don't really care do you? Either way, yeah
Feeling very strong about you I don't want to live
Without your love
Since I met you
I met you
I became a stronger man
Trying too hard
To prove too much before
If you're trying to relax
Don't ask questions
That will surely tax you later on
You'll have your answer yeah
Best of all you never worry but always care
All you need to know is that I am there, yes I am
Don't know why you ever chose me
Heaven knows we certainly have loved enough
Since I met you
Since I met you, since I met you girl
Since I met you, since I met you girl
Since I met you, since I met you girl, girl, girlEmbed
