Feel Your Love LyricsHigh on a balcony, right where we used to be
This city dancing like a sparkling sea
I wanna catch a wave, I wanna swim to shore
Walk on that same beach like I did before
I really want the sun, want the sun to rise
I really want to end the night
I really wanna feel, wanna feel your love
I wanna feel your love
I think of our old friends, I count my enemies
I hear you tell me how I don't know love
I wanna feel your love, I wanna lay right down
Wish I was swimming in the sound of love
I really want the night, want the night to end
I really want the sun to rise
I really wanna feel, wanna feel your love
I wanna feel your love
And now the night is still, the mansion on the hill
The children sleeping in their endless dreams
I wanna feel your love, I wanna feel your love
I wanna feel your love, feel your love, feel your love
I wanna feel your love, I wanna feel your love
I wanna feel your love, feel your love, feel your loveEmbed
