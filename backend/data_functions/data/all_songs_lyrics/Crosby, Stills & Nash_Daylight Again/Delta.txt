Delta LyricsWaking stream of consciousness
On a sleeping street of dream
Thoughts like scattered leaves
Slowed in midfall to the streams
Of fast running rivers of choice and chance and time stops here
On the delta
While they dance while they dance
I love the child who steers this riverboat
But lately he's crazy for the deep
The river seems dreamlike in the daytime
Someone keeps thinking in my sleep
Of fast running rivers of choice and chance and time stops here
On the delta
While they dance while they dance
While they danceEmbed
