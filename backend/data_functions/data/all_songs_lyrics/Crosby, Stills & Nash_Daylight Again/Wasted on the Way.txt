Wasted on the Way Lyrics
Look around me
I can see my life before me
Running rings around the way it used to be
I am older now
I have more than what I wanted
But I wish that I had started
Long before I did

And there's so much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away


Oh, when you were young
Did you question all the answers?
Did you envy all the dancers
Who had all the nerve?
Look round you now
You must go for what you wanted
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved
So much time to make up
Everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
So much love to make up
Everywhere you turn
Love we have wasted on the way
So much water moving
Underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
Let the water come and carry us awayEmbed
