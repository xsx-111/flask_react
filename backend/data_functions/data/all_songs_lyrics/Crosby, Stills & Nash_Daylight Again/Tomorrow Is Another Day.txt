Tomorrow Is Another Day LyricsHave you got the room for me
And your heartache?
My love is not pushing you
Around this way
If you think you see another love
As strong as me, and you must go see
I’ll miss you, girl
I won’t resist your curiosity
‘Cause tomorrow is another day
And there is little else that would break my heart
It’s yours anyway
Don’t ask me why
Let me see
Can this be put another way?
There are times when life just turns on you
It seems that way
But if what you love should fly away
Let it go
And if it comes back anyway
It will never fly away again
And tomorrow is more than another day
It’s the beginning
Of what you started yesterday
Don’t ask me why
Tomorrow is another day
And there is little else that would break my heart
Tomorrow is more than another day
It’s the beginning of what you started yesterdayEmbed
