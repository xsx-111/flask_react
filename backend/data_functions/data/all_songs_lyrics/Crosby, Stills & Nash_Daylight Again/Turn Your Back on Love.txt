Turn Your Back on Love LyricsMmm ...
Is this a prison
Or do you call it love?
You will know for certain someday
It'll never be tough enough
When love is hidden
It is below above
And you know when you run away
You turn your back on love
Lonely days and lonely nights
Will we ever get it right
Don't be blinded by the light
Turn your back on love no, no
You're dying to prove
That you are never wrong
You're so right you'd rather be sad
But you won't go along
You built a wall, didn't ya
'Round what you're thinking of
Never mind what anyone says
You're turning your back on love
Lonely days and lonely nights
Will we ever get it right
Don't be blinded by the light
Turn, turn, turn
Would you turn your back on love
Aaah ... aaah ...
Isn't it my life
Tell me what else it is
You can do whatever you want
If you will take a risk
When is it my love
How will you handle it to wit
There are two whenever we are
If you can hear the kiss
If you believe it
Love is quite strong enough
Be together honest and free
No turning back on love
Lonely days and lonely nights
Will we ever get it right
Don't be blinded by the light
Turn your back on love
Turn your back
Turn your back on love ...Embed
