Might As Well Have a Good Time LyricsThere are windows on the water
Lighting up the silver strand
Shining on the sea
Shining on the sea
And the ocean's just a player
On an old piano
Who repeats one melody
Repeats one melody
I belong on the shore
Hustlin' nickels and dimes
'Cause it ain't long before it's gone
You might as well have a good time
Well, the elbows of his jacket
Are blue and shiny
He's drunk and gone to seed
He's drunk and gone to seed
And he mumbles as he plays
The only song he knows
It's the only song he needs
The only song he needs
I belong on the shore
Hustlin' nickels and dimes
'Cause it ain't long before it's gone
You might as well have a good time
All his restless music
Don't mean a damn thing to me
The shallow or the deep
Said, the shallow or the deep
And if you're free this evening
We'll go out together
And party 'till we sleep
I said, party 'till we sleep
And I belong on the shore
Hustlin' nickels and dimes
'Cause it ain't long before it's gone
You might as well have a good time
I belong on the shore
Hustlin' nickels and dimes
'Cause it ain't long before it's gone
You might as well have a good time
You might as well have a good timeEmbed
