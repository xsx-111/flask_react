Song for Susan LyricsIf anyone wants to know where to find me
I'll be right here in the warmth of your arms
'Cause you you're the one I can trust in
You've never done me harm
I'm putting all my troubles behind me
I don't feel the same when I'm away from your smile
'Cause you you're the one that can calm me down
Whenever I get wild
Fooling myself about how to exist
All by myself there was much I had missed
You came and showed me what happiness is
Fooling myself about how to exist
All by myself there was much I had missed
You came and showed me what happiness is
If anyone wants to know where my heart is
Tell everyone that's it's wrapped around yours
'Cause you you're the one I can turn to
You opened up the doorEmbed
