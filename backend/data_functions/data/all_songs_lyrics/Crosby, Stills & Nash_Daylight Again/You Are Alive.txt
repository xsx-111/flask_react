You Are Alive LyricsWhen you know there's someone you can talk to
And she's waiting by the door when you get home
With her hand she'll caress away your worries
You are alive
I hope you know
That you're alive
When you're waiting for her standing by the doorway
And your heart is laughing as she turns the key
Here it comes again always the same feeling
You are alive
And so is she
Do you know what life would be without her?
Do you know what loneliness can be?
You'll die by yourself only with someone else, why?
When it's all a game and there is no pleasure
And you're just like all the rest cannot see
And you're feeling like there's no more point in searching
Are you alive?
How could it be
Are you alive?
I'd like to see
If you're aliveEmbed
