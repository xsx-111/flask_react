Daylight Again/Find the Cost of Freedom LyricsDaylight again
Following me to bed
I think about a hundred years ago
How my father's bled
I think I see a valley
Covered with bones in blue
All the brave soldiers that cannot get older
Been asking after you
Hear the past a' calling
From Armageddon's side
When everyone's talking and no one is listening
How can we decide
Do we find the cost of freedom
Buried in the ground
Mother Earth will swallow you
Lay your body down
Find the cost of freedom
Buried in the ground
Mother earth will swallow you
Lay your body down
(Find the cost of freedom
Buried in the ground)Embed
