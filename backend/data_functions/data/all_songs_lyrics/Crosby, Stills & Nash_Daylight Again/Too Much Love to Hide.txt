Too Much Love to Hide LyricsCan I sing a song to the woman
Take a look at what you might be missing
With a certain love that you know will stand
It takes a good woman and a good man, I believe
I believe, I believe enough don't I
I believe when I see her eyes
I believe there is too much love to hide
Boy don't stand there in the shadows
Let her know you care about what she knows
Turn your mind into a window
And the listener will lead who follows, I believe
I believe, I believe enough don't I
I believe when I see her eyes
I believe there is too much love to hide
If you don't trust at all you lose
You are bound to fall
Lost behind your wall
I believe, I believe enough don't I
I believe when I see her eyes
I believe there is too much love to hide
Too much, too much
So you know now you found out
This is the kind of love you can shout about
Leave your loneliness in the past
This is the kind of love that's gonna last, I believe
I believe, I believe enough don't I
I believe when I see her eyes
I believe there is too much love to hide
Too much, too muchEmbed
