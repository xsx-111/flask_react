The Veldt Lyrics
Happy life with the machines
Scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me
Happy technology
Outside, the lions roam
Feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us, now
So in love with the way we are

Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made

Every night, they rock us to sleep
Digital family
Is it real or is it a dream?
Can you believe in machines?
Outside, the beating sun
Can you hear the screams?
We'll never leave, look at us, now
So in love with the way we are
Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made

Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made

Happy life with the machines
Scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me
Happy technology
Outside, the lions roam
Feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us, now
So in love with the way we are

Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made10Embed
