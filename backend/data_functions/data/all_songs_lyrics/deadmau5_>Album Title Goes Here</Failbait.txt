Failbait Lyrics
Burn like a furnace keep it hot like a thermos
It's the realest extra service now I'm on a higher purpose
And you haters donâ€™t deserve us but we give it to you like a virus
We the highest motherfuckers ruling from the hills of Cypress
We magnificent you're insignificant
See what's in my weed sack bitch try sniffing it
Sending nah hittin it smell so aromatic
Smoking out the room Sorry homie it's fucking habit

Mad dog off the leash I don't be fronting son
Run up on me and watch a nigga give you some
I am swinging for the fence blasting out home runs
Cholo with a knife cut your ass like a shogun
Little something for the peasants yanking on my chain
You the reason niggas sing about the membrane
Running round like a clown acting hella strange
On the rhythm I forget about your punk name

We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
See my mind is at the pinnacle stress levels are minimal
You see a criminal label the fight unwinnable
You're so cynical smoke like it's fucking legal
Either way the people represented nothing equal
Yes spark it up, daytime mark it up
You got a problem I'mma Rolling Stones start it up
You stomp me up I'mma you promise I'll never stop
The last thing you hear is the blast when the hammer drops

Run in with the sick click we uncheckable
Cypress Hill misfits bring it through the vegetables
Bringing in clouds of smoke representable
The highest a toke and his generals
The nation stands with us ready for war
We done cock it two decades and we still want more
I could call you out by name but what the fuck for?
You're under my sneaker that I stomp on the floor

We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high

See my mind is at the pinnacle stress levels are minimal
You see a criminal label the fight unwinnable
You're so cynical smoke like it's fucking legal
Either way the people represented nothing equal
Yes spark it up, daytime mark it up
You got a problem I'mma Rolling Stones start it up
You stomp me up I'mma you promise I'll never stop
The last thing you hear is the blast when the hammer drops

Run in with the sick click we uncheckable
Cypress Hill misfits bring it through the vegetables
Bringing in clouds of smoke representable
The highest a toke and his generals
The nation stands with us ready for war
We done cock it two decades and we still want more
I could call you out by name but what the fuck for?
You're under my sneaker that I stomp on the floor

We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by5Embed
