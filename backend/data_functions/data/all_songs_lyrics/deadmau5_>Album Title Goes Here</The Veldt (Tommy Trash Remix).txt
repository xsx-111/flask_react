The Veldt (Tommy Trash Remix) Lyrics
Happy life with the machines
Scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me
Happy technology
Outside, the lions roam
Feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us, now
So in love with the way we are


Happy life with the machines
Scattered around the room
Look what they made, they made it for me
Happy technology
Outside, the lions roam
Feeding on remains
We'll never leave, look at us, now
So in love with the way we are

Here, the world that the children made
The world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
Here, the world that the children made
