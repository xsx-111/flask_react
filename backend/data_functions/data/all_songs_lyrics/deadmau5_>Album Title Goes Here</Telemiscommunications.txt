Telemiscommunications Lyrics
Hey babe, how's your day been? No, you first
Oh, what? The delay's quite bad
Yeah, sorry
Where are you? I can't really hear you
A taxi, distracted...
Anyway, you... you were saying?
Wait, oh, now, they're waving me over
Can I call you back? Yeah, everything's fine, why?
Am I? I don't know why
I probably just need sleep, it's been a busy week
Sorry, I've got to go
Sorry... okay, bye

This is just so unlike us
Cut back to horizontalisms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus telemiscommunications

Plan foiled, sirens pass by, kids screaming
The longest public announcement
Reached check-in, finally got through
Running for a flight, shoes off
You're calling voicemail
In-joke, group laughter
Closing scenes in a meeting
Angel! (Angel!) Why didn't you tell me?
One second, someone needs directions
Can't you see I'm on the phone?!
This is just so unlike us
Cut back to horizontalisms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus telemiscommunications

So unlike us (Unlike us)
Cut back to horizontalisms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus telemiscommunications

Did I tell you I loved you, today?
Did I tell you I loved you, today? Kiss, kiss
Did I tell you I loved you, today?
Did I tell you I loved you, today?
Did I tell you I loved you, today?
Did I tell you I loved you, today? Kiss, kiss
Did I tell you I loved you, today?
Did I tell you I loved you, today?5Embed
