Sleepless LyricsIn the end, we are nowhere
Sleepless and still untied
Maybe we should fall asleep
Saving what was left behind
Standing outside the chalk outline
Beside ourselves in time
The only thing I want, is the last thing I need
Awake and sleepless as stars shine
In the end, we are nowhere
Sleepless and still untied
Maybe we should fall asleep
Saving what was left behind
Standing outside the chalk outline
Beside ourselves in time
The only thing I want, is the last thing I need
Awake and sleepless as stars shineEmbed
