Professional Griefers Lyrics
I like the sound of the broken pieces
I like the lights and the siren she says
We got machines but the kids got Jesus
We like to move like we both don't need this
God can't hear you, they won't fight you
Watch them build a friend just like you
Morning sickness, XYZ
Teenage girls with ESP

Give me the sound to see
Another world outside that's full of
All the broken things that I made
Just give me a life to bleed
Another world outside that's full of
All the awful things that I made

We like to dance but the dead go faster
Turn up the slam/hound/bar/code/blaster
We want the cash or the junk you're after
Rez-up control for the mixtape master
Cell-correction, mass-dissection
Death squad brats are in detention
Morning sickness, XYZ
Boys with bombs in NMA
Carbon-lacing, spent shell-casings
Photographs that I'm erasing
Bonus lives with pixel-screams
Girls with guns on LSD
Cell infection, mass destruction
Program for the final function
Lab Rat King, rescue team
Save me from the next life
Gimme the sound to see
Another world outside that's full of
All the broken things that I made
Just give me a life to bleed
Another world outside that's full of
All the awful things that I made
'Cause we are the last disease
Another broken life that's full of
All the awful things that I made
And we got the eyes to see
Another broken life that's full of
All the awful things that are made
