Hometown Unicorn LyricsIan Gibson: He Hot!
I was lost
Lost on the bypass road
Could be worse
I could be turned to toad
Won't you take me back to my hometown
Take me back before I break down
I say you please return me
Will you ever return me
Will you ever return me
Just like Frankie Fontaine
I wonder what can I do?
I was found riding a unicorn
Could be worse
I could be backwards born
Won't you take me back to my hometown
Take me back before I break down
I say you please return me
Will you ever return me
Will you ever return me
Just like Frankie Fontaine
I wonder what can I do?
Calm down and then leave me alone
Calm down and then leave me alone
Calm down and then leave me alone
Calm down and then leave me alone
I say you please return me
Will you ever return me
Will you ever return me
Just like Frankie Fontaine
I wonder what can I do?Embed
