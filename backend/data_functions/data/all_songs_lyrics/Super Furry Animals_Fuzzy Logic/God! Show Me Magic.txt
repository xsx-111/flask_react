God! Show Me Magic LyricsI had a soul transplant operation
Coz my bypass didn't function
So now I'm keeping on my toes
Till I see your one-man show
Show me magic
Show me magic
Show me magic
Show me magic
And wouldn't it be nice to know:
What the paper doesn't show
And what the TV doesn't say
And what my hamster ate today
Show me magic
Show me magic
Show me magic
Show me magic
God! show me magic
God! show me magic
God! show me magic
God! show me magic
Show me magic
Show me magic
Show me magic
Show me magicEmbed
