Bad Behaviour LyricsBad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour...
Bad behaviour
Was my saviour
Making mischief used to make my day
Subsequently
Accidently
I put my fist through a window pane
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour...
I remember
Once I had a brain
Amnesia never crossed my mind
Tonsilitis was my alibi
Truancy was my vocation
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
Bad bad behaviour
Bad bad
