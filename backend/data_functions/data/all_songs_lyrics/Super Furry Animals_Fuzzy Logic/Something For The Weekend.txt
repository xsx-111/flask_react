Something For The Weekend LyricsFirst time, I did it for the hell of it
Stuck it on the back of my tongue and then swallowed it
Second time, things are getting easier
Blow me down, this wind is getting breezier
Third time lucky, maybe feeling fuzzy
Oh my God, we're getting hippy-dippy
Four, six, seven, man I'm in heaven
And I'm growing my beard, until it gets sheared
You're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
'Cause I know you're here to stay for the rest of my mind
On my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
'Cause I know you're here to stay for the rest of my mind
First time, I did it for the hell of it
Stuck it right up and that was the end of it
Second time, things are getting easier
Hairs on the back of my neck are getting stickier
Third time unlucky, perversly bloody
Doctor, I'm ill, please pass me the brandy
Four, six, seven, I heard George Foreman say
Slow horses lose
Fast women frightened
You're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
'Cause I know you're here to stay for the rest of my mind
On my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
'Cause I know you're here to stay for the rest of my mind
I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself
I just keep repeating myself
You're on my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
'Cause I know you're here to stay for the rest of my mind
On my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
'Cause I know you're here to stay for the rest of my mind
On my mind
Every day and every night
And you'll never go away
'Cause I know you're here to stay for the rest of my mindEmbed
