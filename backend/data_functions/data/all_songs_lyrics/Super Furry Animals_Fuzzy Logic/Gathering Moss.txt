Gathering Moss LyricsLost capacity
For infinity
You and me are idly gathering moss
Fields of industry
Death by misery
You and I are idly
You and me are idly gathering moss
False security
Faked insanity
You and I united by itemised bills
Fills my sympathy
Builds my agony
You and me are idly
You and I are idly gathering moss
But when you see me
I'll be idly sweeping the dust away
Look, here comes the sun again
And we'll aim there to be merry
You and I are idly
You and I are idly
You and me gathering moss
You and me gathering moss
You and me are idly...Embed
