Fuzzy Birds LyricsHamster, turning round in your wheel
I've got something to tell you, I can harness your feel
Dynamo for electricity
You empower my feelings, give me light for me to see
"So won't you give me some food?
I really need to get some energy in me
Give me some
I really need to get some energy in me
Give me some
For whirling, turning, kicking, screaming round my wheel, yeah
To spread it on my bread...
Don't you know that I spread it on my bread?"
Rest yourself, you've been long on your feet
If I buy you a matchbox, will you keep it all neat?
Radiate, you're no flash in the pan
You're the battery incarnate, I'm an innocent man
"So won't you give me some food?
I really need to get some energy in me
Give me some
I really need to get some energy in me
Give me some
For whirling, turning, kicking screaming round my wheel, yeah
To spread it on my bread...
Don't you know that I spread it on my bread?"Embed
