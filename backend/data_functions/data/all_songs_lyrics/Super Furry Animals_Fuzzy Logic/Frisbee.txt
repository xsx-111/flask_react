Frisbee LyricsLocked in a sorry dream
You know we're drowning in designer ice cream
This is the present but it's no surprise
Then I realise
What I see I spies
The past was eagle-eyed
The future's pixelised
I had my frisbee sharpened and honed
I had it galvanised and chromed
Decapitate and bury your toys
My frisbee brings the noise
What I see I spies
The past was eagle-eyed
The future's pixelised
(To see ya, to see ya, to see ya, nice to see ya...)Embed
