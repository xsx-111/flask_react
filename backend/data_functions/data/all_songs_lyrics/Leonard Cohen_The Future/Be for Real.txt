Be for Real LyricsAre you back in my life to stay
Or is it just for today
Oh that you're gonna need me?
If it's a thrill you're looking for
Honey, I'm flexible
Oh, yeah
Just be for real
Won't you, Baby
Be for real
Oh, Baby
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again
So you see I'm not naive
I just would like to believe
Ah what you tell me
So don't give me the world today
And tomorrow take it away
Don't do that to me darling
Just be for real
Won't you, Baby
Be for real
Won't you, Baby
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again
Been hurt so many times
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again
Now I don't give a damn about the truth, baby
Except for the naked truth
Oh, yeah
Just be for real
Won't you, Baby
Be for real
Won't you, Baby
You see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again
Oh no no no
Just see I, I don't want
To be hurt by love again
Thanks for the song Mr. KnightEmbed
