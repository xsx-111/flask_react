Mountain Lyrics

Whoa!

All these dreams and all these plans, I built them all with these
Two hands, everything I've realized, my dreams
The city lights shine down and they blind me sometimes
But through it all, I was lost, but I found my way

So tell me what you want, 'cause I would give you anything
Tell me what you need, and I'll go get it
I'd give up all these dreams to have you in my arms right now
I'd give up everything and I'd forget it

I wasn't on a mountain
When it came to me
All my life's been wasted
Chasing shallow dreams

So here we are
Let me lift you up and show you this world over me
And all these things, what I've gained, and what I've seen
It can't compare to the love that you could give to me
So tell me what you want, 'cause I would give you anything
Tell me what you need, and I'll go get it
I'd give up all these dreams to have you in my arms right now
I'd give up everything and I'd forget it

I wasn't on a mountain
When it came to me
All my life's been wasted
Chasing shallow dreams

Years go by, and nothing's slowing down the time
Years go by, and then they're wasted
All this time, I thought that I gained everything
If you are not mine, I'm so empty

I wasn't on a mountain
When it came, when it came to me
All my life's been wasted
Chasing shallow dreams

So, please come back to me, I'm right here waiting
So, please come back to me, now...
