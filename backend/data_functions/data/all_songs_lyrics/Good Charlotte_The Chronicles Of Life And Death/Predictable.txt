Predictable Lyrics
Something isn't right, I can feel it again, feel it again
This isn't the first time that you left me waiting

Sad excuses
And false hopes high
I saw this coming
Still I don't know why I let you in

I knew it all along, you're so predictable
I knew something would go wrong (Something's always wrong...)
So you don't have to call or say anything at all
You're so predictable (So predictable...)

So take your empty words, your broken promises
And all the time you stole, 'cause I am done with this

I can give it away, give it away
I'm doing everything I should've
And now I'm making a change, I'm living the day
I'm giving back what you gave me, I don't need anything
I knew it all along, you're so predictable
I knew something would go wrong (Something's always wrong...)
So you don't have to call or say anything at all
You're so predictable (So predictable...)

Everywhere I go, everyone I meet, every time I
Try to fall in love, they all wanna know why I'm so broken
Why am I so cold? Why I'm so hard inside
Why am I scared? What am I afraid of?
I don't even know, this story's never had an end, I've been waiting
I've been searching, I've been hoping, I've been dreaming
You would come back, but I know the ending of this story
You're never coming back! Never, never...
Never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never...

I knew it all along, you're so predictable
I knew something would go wrong (Something's always wrong...)
So you don't have to call or say anything at all
You're so predictable (So predictable...)

Everywhere I go for the rest of my life
(So predictable...) Everyone that I love, everyone I care about
They're all gonna wanna know what's wrong with me
(So predictable...) And I know what it is, I'm ending this right now!Embed
