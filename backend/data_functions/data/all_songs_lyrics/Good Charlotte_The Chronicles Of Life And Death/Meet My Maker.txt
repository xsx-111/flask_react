Meet My Maker Lyrics
This is the way I'll meet my maker tonight...

So this is it, this is my life
This is my time, it's ending tonight
I made my mistakes, I tried to live right
Stepped out of the darkness into the light
And when I'm gone, will they remember?
Will they mourn? Will they move on?
When my sad songs for lonely son
His time has come, his life is done

And tonight, we'll celebrate the end
Of this life, and we'll sing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Whoa oh oh oh, it's alright
This is a night like we've began
With open arms, this is the way
The way I'll meet my maker tonight

And on my grave, what will it say?
"Here lies another soul that was saved..."
So, please don't cry, just sleep at night
And I will wait on the other side
And tonight, we'll celebrate the end
Of this life, and we'll sing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Whoa oh oh oh, it's alright
This is a night like we've began
With open arms, this is the way
The way I'll meet my maker tonight


And tonight, we'll celebrate the end
Of this life, and we'll sing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Whoa oh oh oh, it's alright
This is a night like we've began
With open arms, this is the way
The way I'll meet my maker tonight

Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh oh ohEmbed
