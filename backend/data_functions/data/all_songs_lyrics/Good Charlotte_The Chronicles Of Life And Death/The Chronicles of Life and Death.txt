The Chronicles of Life and Death Lyrics

You come in cold, you're covered in blood
They're all so happy you've arrived
The doctor cuts your cord, hands you to your mom
She sets you free into this life

And where do you go with no destination
No map to guide you?
Wouldn't you know, that it doesn't matter
We all end up the same... (The same...)

These are the chronicles of
Life and death and everything between
These are the stories of our lives
As fictional as they may seem

You come in this world, and you go out just the same
Today could be the best day of your life!

And money talks in this world
That's what idiots will say
But you'll find out that this world
Is just an idiot's parade
Before you go, you've got some questions
And you want answers
But now youâ€™re old, cold, covered in blood
Right back to where you started from... (from...)

These are the chronicles of
Life and death and everything between
These are the stories of our lives
As fictional as they may seem

You come in this world, and you go out just the same
Today could be the worst day of your life...


But these are the chronicles of
Life and death and everything between
These are the stories of our lives
As fictional as they may seem

You come in this world, and you go out just the same
Today could be the best day of
Today could be the worst day of
Today could be the last day of your life
It's your life, your life...
