Secrets Lyrics
In the dark, in the darkness you will find
Dirty little secrets we all hide
Because we all have a darker side
A place we keep where no one else will find

Because everybody wants to hide their secrets away
Nobody wants to stand up to the pain

But I will stand up to the pain
Wake up and fight again
If you could dance with me through this rain
And we will fight, we’ll fight again, fight again

In the back, in the closets of your mind
That's where skeletons and dirty secrets hide
And I'll rip out my insides
And leave them on display for you tonight

Because everybody wants to hide their secrets away
Nobody wants to stand up to the pain
But I will stand up to the pain
Wake up and fight again
If you could dance with me through this rain
And we will fight, we’ll fight again, fight again

Fight again…

All my life, I hide my secrets away
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
We all try to hide our secrets away
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark

Stand up to the pain
Wake up and fight again
If you could dance with me through this rain
And we will fight, we’ll fight again, fight again

Fight again

Because everybody wants to hide their secrets away
And that’s okay
Nobody wants to stand up to the pain
Fight againEmbed
