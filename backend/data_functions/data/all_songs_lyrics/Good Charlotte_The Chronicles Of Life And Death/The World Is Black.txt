The World Is Black Lyrics
Turn on channel seven at a quarter to eight
You see the same damn thing, it's just a different day, and
No one really knows why this is
Happening, but it's happening
And everywhere you go, it's just a different place
You get the same dark feeling, see the same sad faces
No one really cares that this is
Happening

We come into this world, and we all are the same
In that moment, there's no one to blame

But the world is black, and hearts are cold
And there's no hope, that's what we're told
And we can't go back, it won't be the same
Forever changed by the things we've seen, seen

Living in this place, it's always been this way
There's no one doing nothing, so there's nothing changed
And I can't live when this world just keeps
Dying, it's dying
People always tell me this is part of the plan
That God's got everybody in his hands
But I can only pray that God is
Listening, is he listening?
We're living in this world, growing colder everyday
Nothing can stay perfect, now I see

But the world is black, and hearts are cold
And there's no hope, that's what we're told
And we can't go back, it won't be the same
Forever changed by the things we've seen, seen, seen

We come into this world, and we all are the same
And in that moment, there's no one to blame
But we're living in this world, growing colder everyday
Nothing can stay perfect, now I see

But the world is black, and hearts are cold
There's no hope, that's what we're told
And we can't go back (we can't go back)
It won't be the same (It won't be the same)
Forever changed (What will ever change)
By the things we've seen, seen, seen

Turn on channel seven at a quarter to eight
You see the same damn thing it's just a different day
And no one really knows why this is
Happening...1Embed
