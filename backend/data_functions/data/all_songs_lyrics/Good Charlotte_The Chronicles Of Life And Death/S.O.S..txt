S.O.S. Lyrics
Is anybody listening? Can they hear me when I call?
I'm shooting signals in the air, 'cause I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own, so I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening? Listening...

I've been stranded here, and I'm miles away
Making signals hoping they'd save me
I lock myself inside these walls, 'cause out there, I'm always wrong
I don't think I'm gonna make it

So while I'm sitting here on the eve of my defeat
I'll write this letter and hope it saves me

Is anybody listening? Can they hear me when I call?
I'm shooting signals in the air, 'cause I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own, so I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening? Listening...

I'm stuck in my own head, and I'm oceans away
Would anybody notice if I chose to stay?
I'll send an S.O.S. tonight, I wonder if I will survive
How in the hell did I get so far away this time?
So now, I'm sitting here, the time of my departure's near
I say a prayer, please someone, save me!

Is anybody listening? Can they hear me when I call?
I'm shooting signals in the air, 'cause I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own, so I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening? Listening...

I'm lost here, I can't make it on my own, I don't want to die alone
I'm so scared, drowning now, reaching out
Holding on to everything I know
Crying out, dying now, need some help!


Is anybody listening? Can they hear me when I call?
Shooting signals in the air, I need somebody's help
I can't make it on my own, I'm giving up myself
Is anybody listening?Embed
