The Truth Lyrics
So here we are, we are alone
There’s weight on your mind, I wanna know

The truth, if this is how you feel
Say it to me, if this was ever real

I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts me

I want the truth, so this is you

You're talking to me, you found a million ways to let me down
So, I’m not hurt when you’re not around, I was blind

But now, I see this is how you feel
Just say it to me, if this was ever real

I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts me
I know that this will break me, I know that this might make me cry
You gotta say what’s on your mind, on your mind
I know that this will hurt me, and break my heart and soul inside
But I don’t wanna live this lie

I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts me
I want the truth from you
Give me the truth even if it hurts, I don’t care no more, no!

Just give me the truth, give me the truth
‘Cause I don’t care no more
Give me the truth
‘Cause I don’t care no more, no!
Just give me the truth, give me the truth
Give me the truth, give me the truth
Give me the truth
‘Cause I don’t care no more, no!Embed
