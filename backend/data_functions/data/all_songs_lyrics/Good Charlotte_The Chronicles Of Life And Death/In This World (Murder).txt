In This World (Murder) Lyrics

In this world, all of our sins are simple
We choose death over innocent life
And in this world, it's not all our money that's evil
It's the ones who choose it over life
And in my heart, I cannot believe in this murder
And I will not be fed by the lies
Or the life that's created just to be murdered
It's murder

No matter how hard they try, and no matter how loud they cry
They can't buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try, and no matter how high they climb
Up the ladder, they won't reach up into heaven

And they can't see, the innocent lives, the pointless suffering
And in my heart, I wanna undo all this murder
And give back their innocent life
Open cages and stop their luxurious murder, it's murder

No matter how hard they try, and no matter how loud they cry
They can't buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try, and no matter how high they climb
Up the ladder, they won't reach up into heaven
Murder! Innocent life!
Innocent what? What have we done?
(No mercy for beautiful money!)
No matter how hard they try, and no matter how loud they cry
(Money for blood! It's murder!)
They can't buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try, and no matter how high they climb
Up the ladder, they won't reach up into heaven

No matter how hard they try, and no matter how loud they cry
They can't buy their way into heaven
No matter how hard they try, and no matter how high they climb
Up the ladder, they won't reach up into heaven

Heaven, heaven...
