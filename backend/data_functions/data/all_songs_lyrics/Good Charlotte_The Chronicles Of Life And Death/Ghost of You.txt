Ghost of You Lyrics

And I will wait until the end, when the pendulum will swing back
To the darker side of our hearts bleeding
I will save this empty space next to me like it's a grave
Where I lay a place for us to sleep eternally together

I have been searching for
Traces of what we were

A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all

So, here I am, pacing around this house again with pictures of us
Living on these walls, I see my breath in the cold of the air that I
Breathe and I'm wondering, I'm wondering if it's you that I feel
If it's you that I feel here haunting me forever

I have been searching for
Traces of what we were
A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all

And I'm not looking for anything but us
Anything but what we were
And I'm not asking for painted memories
I only want to know you're here

A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all

A ghost of you is all that I have left
It's all that I have left of you to hold
I wake in the night to find there's no one there but me
And nothing left of what we were at all...1Embed
