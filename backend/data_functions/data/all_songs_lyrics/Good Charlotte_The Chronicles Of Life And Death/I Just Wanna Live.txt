I Just Wanna Live Lyrics

I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are
Creeping about, these people are
Freaking me out these days

It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone, there's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me? And why can't anyone see

I just wanna live?
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live

I rock a lawsuit when I'm going to court
A white suit when I'm getting divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
Talking on the phone, got an interview
With the Rolling Stone, they're saying
"Now you're rich and now you're famous
Fake-ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Your first hit, aren't you ashamed?"
Of the life, of the life
Of the life we're living

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live

"Stop your messing around, boy!
Better think of your future!
Better make some good plans, boy!"
Said everyone of my teachers
Look out! You better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say where we're coming from
We've already seen the worst that this life can bring
Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say, yeah, we already know

I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)
I just wanna live
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)

I just wanna live
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)
Don't really care about the things that they say
(Just wanna live, just wanna live, just wanna live)
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live...1Embed
