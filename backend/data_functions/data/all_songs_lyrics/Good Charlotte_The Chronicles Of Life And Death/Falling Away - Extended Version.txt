Falling Away - Extended Version Lyrics
And tonight we burn down everything we worked so hard to build
The ashes will rain down on me, memories set aflame
Sail away, what we said if we can make this
Then we can break this into two memories

I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again
I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again

And tonight I will be a vessel with these sails set aflame
Let this ocean of our memories carry me
Out to sea, I will be, fall beneath the crashing waves
Into my grave, I will sleep

I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again
I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again
I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again
I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again
If we can make this, then we can break it
If we can build it, then we can burn it down

I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again
I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again
I feel you falling away, I feel you falling away
I feel you falling away from me again

And now you're farther away, now you're farther away
Now you're farther away from me again
And now you're farther away, now you're farther away
Now you're farther away from me again
And now you're farther away, now you're farther away
Now you're farther away from me again
And now you're farther away, now you're farther away
Now you're farther away from me againEmbed
