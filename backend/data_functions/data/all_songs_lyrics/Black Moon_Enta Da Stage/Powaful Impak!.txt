Powaful Impak! Lyrics
Ayo this is straight up for all them niggas out there who fronted on some bullshit, in the beginning
Fuck that

Blaaaww! Here comes the Buckshot Shorty
I kill at will, so guard your grill like naughty
Niggas call me Jeffrey Dahmer, why
I'm quick to bomb a crew so fuck your armor, 'cause I cause mad trauma
No comma, straight through your mama like acid
I fucked her, then I jetted, that's why you's a little bastard
You talk mad shit with no back up
What's up, act up, you punk niggas get smacked up
Word life, you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
I fuck too many on the mic, they call me Daddy Long Trigger
Mister Buckshot, makin' the gun hot
From niggas who fiend to see my little ass rot
Peep my style, check my level
I'm so hot, I shot a fuckin' fair one with the devil
Boo-ya-ka! Watch your back, grab your fuckin' gat
Here come brothers who lyrically act

Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak, boom!! From the cannon
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak, boom!! From the cannon
Some pack a mac, I choose to pack a black .22
By my waistline, buckin' your whole crew
I step through and represent Black Moon
First, before I kick a verse, I puff a bag of boom
Lyrically I freak your funk you never heard
My shit is so fly, when I kick it, it's absurd
Damn, how I wrecked your life with one record
Made your crew break up and your girl get naked
Respected, because I work hard for my cash
Shakin' more flavor than Mrs. Dash
Look out below, my flow will hit your brain
I got dough, but I still hop the train
I'm bustin' niggas open, Attica style
Yo, straight to the jugular, brother you're mad foul
Gimme dap, because I rock with the best
Yo, peace to the hardcore niggas, fuck the rest

Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak, boom!! From the cannon
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak, boom!! From the cannon
Fee, to the Fi, to the Fo, to the Funk
I pop junk and keep the pump in the trunk
Puff the skunk and get high, oh Lord
Get on my skateboard and do a motherfuckin' driveby
You little crab ass flea
Biting my style, you know the original rudeboy is me
Buckshot, no joke, smoke a nigga like buddha
Who the fuck you think you playin' wit?
Yeah, I'm sayin' it
'Cause I want beef, for you can hang here right
Yo, sometimes I wonder how the fuck you get a mic
But I don't sweat that, 'cause I'm still paid
Niggas get bucked down, bitches get sprayed
I do what I must, just so I can make loot
If it's illegal, pack the gat son, you know how we do, true

Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak, boom!! From the cannon
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak
Powafal Impak, boom!! From the cannonEmbed
