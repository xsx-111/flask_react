Son Get Wrec Lyrics
This is a warning, I advise you all to stay alert, yo
Reals grab the nine, 'cause it's time to go to work
Ask Dee, rest the rhythm, I hit 'em, then I just split 'em
Best to believe that's the way you should've did him
Backing niggas down with the heat, feel the flame
Ripping through your flesh, can you handle the pain
I don't give a fuck, I never did, I never will
A little Crooklyn knight nigga with the skill to kill
Which to the point, I will extend the trey pound
Nobody makes a move, nobody makes a sound
Catch mad wreck, raise hell with my crew
Chillin' in the east as I sip on a brew
Drugs no frills 'cause the dutch is the master
An individual who blows up because I have to
Bust mad shots, it's time for me to misbehave
Whoever doesn't like it we can take it to the grave

I'm a grave digging nigga that can hold his own weight
They tried to flex on the Five now they lives is at fate
They didn't think I had enough heart to set off the spark
I'm a shorty getting naughty getting ill after dark
My eyes are bloodshot red
All the hell I feel has set the stage in my kingdom
And not your rule in every state
The war has begun, and I'm about to just blow
So pass the hand grenade, it's time for me to let you know
My feats, too deep, don't sleep, plus they real
Three slugs through your grill, the pain you will feel
Rippin', wrecking, causing mad drama
You acted like you want it, now you crippled like your momma

It's time for you to represent
Spread your wings and prepare to meet your maker
Fucking with the Five, I'm like your average life taker
Deaths in the street in the borough known as Brooklyn
Where niggas lose they life and they get their shit tooken
Guilters run it all, don't even try to riff
Shoved down his throat was the nickel-plated fifth
Shoot out his brains, left them on the dinner table
Went home, puffed the herbs, and watched a little cable
Just layin' back, thinking of the things I do
Throw on my Timberlands, grabbed my crooked eye brew
Called my man Dru, told him to meet me at the spot
'Cause things is getting hot, too many bodies in the lot
Just the other day they raped a girl in the exit
Put her in a coma, now she's three months pregnant
Damn it's so real in the heart of Bucktown
Make a nigga think before he dare fuck around
