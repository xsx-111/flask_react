Mercy, Mercy, Mercy Lyrics
Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

Well I went to see a gypsy
Had my fortune read
She said "Pickett, your baby's gonna leave you"
Her bag is packed up under her bed, I cried

Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
I cried mercy, lord
Have mercy on me

Well now if you stay here baby
I tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna work three jobs, seven days a week
Bring my money to you, I cried

Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
When I heard baby, heard child
What you're trying to do
Hey baby, hey child
Lord, don't say we're through
Oh no, no
Oh no

Well now if my baby leave me
Girl, if you put me down
Well I'm going to the nearest river, child
Jump overboard and drown

Oh yeah baby, mercy
Mercy, baby don't leave me
Lord have mercy, mercy
Lord have mercy, mercyEmbed
