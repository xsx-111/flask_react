For All We Know LyricsLove, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say
And as we go from day to day
I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow
For all we know
Love (love), look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so (and love may grow)
And love may grow
For all we know
(love)Embed
