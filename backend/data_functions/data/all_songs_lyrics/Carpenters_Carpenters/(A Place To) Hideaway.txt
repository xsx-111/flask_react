(A Place To) Hideaway LyricsI've got to find a place to hideaway
Far from the shadows of my mind
Sunlight and laughter, love ever after
Oh how I long to find a place to hide away
I hear you whisper and I must obey
Blindly I follow where you lead
Knowing tomorrow, brings only sorrow
Where can I go to find a place to hide away?
Bright coloured pinwheels go round in my head
I run through the mist of the wine
But night and the music remind me instead
The world once was mine
I'll save my pennies for a rainy day
But where can I buy another you?
Dreams are for sleeping, love is for weeping
For how I long to find a place to hide away
But night and the music remind me instead
The world once was mine
I'll save my pennies for a rainy day
But where can I buy another you?
Dreams are for sleeping, love is for weeping
For how I long to find a place to hide away1Embed
