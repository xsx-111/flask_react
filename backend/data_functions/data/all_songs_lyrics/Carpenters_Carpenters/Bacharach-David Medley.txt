Bacharach/David Medley LyricsKnowing When to Leave
Go while the going is good
Knowing when to leave may be the smartest thing anyone can learn
Go
I'm afraid my heart
Isn't very smart
Fly while your still have your wings
Knowing when to leave won't ever let you reach the point of no return
Fly
Foolish as it seems
I still have my dreams
So I keep hoping
Day after day as I wait for the man I need
Night after night as I wish for a love that can be
Though I'm sure that
No one can tell where their wishes and hopes will lead
Somehow I feel there is happiness waiting for me
When someone
Walks in your life you just better be sure it's right
'Cause if he's wrong there's heartaches and tears you must pay
Keep both of your
Eyes on the door never let it get out of sight
Just be prepared when the time has come you run away
Sail when the wind starts to blow
But like a fool I don't know
When to leave
Make It Easy On Yourself
And make it easy on yourself
Make it easy on yourself
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do
(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me
If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender
Love we used to share
Love we used to share
Just go back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there
Oh how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
When there is always something there to remind me
I'll Never Fall In Love Again
Don't tell me what it's all about
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you
Here to remind you
Here to remind you
Here to remind you
What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again
Walk On By
If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry
Walk on by
I just can't get over losing you
So if I should seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me have
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
Do You Know The Way to San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I'm going back to find
Some peace of mind in San Jose
L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years
How quick they pass
And all the stars there never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Can't wait to get back to San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?Embed
