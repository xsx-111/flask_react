Druscilla Penny LyricsDruscilla Penny, what a name
Are you sure you didn't make it up yourself?
You're very pretty, yes, you are
But with all the junk you wear it's hard to tell
Man, you must work hard
To get your hair to look like that
I don't need a horoscope
To tell me where you're at
Your family's probably given up on you
Since you began to follow groups
Of long haired rock and rollers
I can hear your mother
Crying for her daughter
Druscilla Penny, what a girl
Where's the purpose to the crazy life you lead?
It doesnâ€™t matter after all
You're so sure instant love is all you need
I've seen your face at least a thousand times
You're always standing there behind
The stages at the concerts
Waiting for an offer
To be with someone after
Druscilla Penny, how's your head?
Do you ever wake up lonely in the night?
It isn't easy for a girl
When she can't decide if love is wrong or right
I hope I live to see a change
Could you ever really love?
Ever really care?
Ever really get it together?
No, noEmbed
