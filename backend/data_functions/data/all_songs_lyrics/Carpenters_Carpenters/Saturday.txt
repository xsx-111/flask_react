Saturday LyricsSaturday
Began just the same as other days
But ended up different in many ways
Love is in my world since Saturday
Morning came
But somehow it didn't seem the same
The sadness of Friday had somehow changed
To the happy sounds of
Saturday, Saturday, ever loving Saturday
I whistle to bluebirds
I tried to tell them how you brought me sunshine
My head's filled with new words
That sing to the sounds of the day after Friday
Come and see
The flowers of love she gave to me
The touches of laughter and harmony
To the happy sounds of
Saturday, Saturday, ever loving Saturday
My head's full of new words
Sing to the sounds of the day after Friday
Day after Friday
Come and see
The flowers of love she gave to me
The touches of laughter and harmony
To the happy sounds of
Saturday, Saturday, ever loving Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, ever loving SaturdayEmbed
