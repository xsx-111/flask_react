Doncha Bother Me Lyrics
I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more"
I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more
Well, I'm looking for my face and I got no place to go"

I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more"
I said, "Oh no, don't you follow me no more
Well, pick your own mind and don't you touch mine no more"

Still waiting here for a single idea
In your clothes and your hair, I wore it last year
Oh no, don't you follow me no more


I said, "Oh no, don't you copy me no more"
I said, "Oh no, don't you copy me no more
Well, the lines around my eyes are protected by a copyright law"

Well, all the clubs and the bars and the little red cars
Not knowing why, but trying to get high
Oh no, don't you follow me no more
Don't you follow, don't you followEmbed
