Flight 505 Lyrics
Well I was happy here at home, I've got everything I need
Happy being on my own, just living the life I lead
Well suddenly it dawned on me that this was not my life
So I just phoned the airline girl and said
Get me on flight number 505
Get me on flight number 505

Well I confirmed my reservation, then I hopped a cab
No idea of my destination and feeling pretty bad
With my suitcase in my hand and in my head my new life
So then I told the airline girl, well
Get me on flight number 505
Get me on flight number 505
All right


Well I sat right there in my seat, well, feeling like a king
With the whole world right at my feet, of course I'll have a drink
Well suddenly I saw that we never ever would arrive
He put the plane down in the sea
The end of flight number 505
The end of flight number 505
All right
They put the plane down in the sea
The end of flight number 505
The end of flight number 5051Embed
