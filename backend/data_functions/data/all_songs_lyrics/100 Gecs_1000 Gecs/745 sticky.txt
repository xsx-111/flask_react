745 sticky Lyrics
I make my money on my own, yeah
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah
I've been on a roll, yeah
I spend my money like it's stolen, yeah
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah

Goddamn, what the fuck?
Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all

I'm done trying, new plan
Do what I want, don't hold my hand
I can do anything I want, first try
You take like ten tries, hurtin' my eyes
(Oh my god)

Batshit, got a check and I spent it
Money got me feelin' like a dentist
I can do anything I put my mind to
You can't do anything even if you wanted to (Yeah)
I make my money on my own, yeah
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah
I've been on a roll, yeah
I spend my money like it's stolen, yeah
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah

Goddamn, what the fuck?
Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all14Embed
