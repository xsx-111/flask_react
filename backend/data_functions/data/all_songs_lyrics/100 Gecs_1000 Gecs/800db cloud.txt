800db cloud Lyrics
He said, "I love you," on the plane, I said, "I love you too"
He said, "Everything is different now, everything has changed
Always on a plane, always something new"
I said, "Nothing's new, nothing’s changed, I still need you"
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Smokin’ somethin' new

Ro-ro-roll the boof, then I smoke, then it's all gone
Hit that G so hard that I fall off
Taking shots in the dark, that's a bad call
Going straight for your head, got a sawed-off
(Go, go, go, go, go) I got a bag on the way
(Go, go, go, go, go) Smokin' a zip in a day
(Go, go, go, go, go) What were you trying to say?
(Go, go, go, go, go) Making it up on the way

I never say what I need, when I need you
Never say what I need, when I need you
I'm good on the weed but I need you
I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof

I'm addicted to Monster, money, and weed, yeah
I'm blowin’ clouds so loud, you can’t fuckin' see, yeah
I’m addicted to everything that I see, yeah
I'm addicted to making money off me, yeah
I might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah
It ain't hard to quit caring what you think, yeah
Burnt me one too many times like a tree, yeah
Now there's fire raining down on your screams, yeah
Ohhhh
Yeah
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it’s all gone
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it's gone
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof and the weed, yeah
(AAAAAAAA)
I hit the big boof then it's gone
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed at?
Just shut the fuck up, where's the weed?
Just please fuck me up, where's the weed at?
Just shut the fuck up20Embed
