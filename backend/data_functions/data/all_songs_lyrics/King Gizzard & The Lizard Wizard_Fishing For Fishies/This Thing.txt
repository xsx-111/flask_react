This Thing Lyrics
Well, I fake a lot of symptoms to be a different person
I try to listen
I try to be primed for a reason to go back to sleep
That's not to say there's no relief
I like it when it happens, you don't
You're happy? When you show it, I won't
The cycle keeps repeating, I can't escape the rip
There's no stopping what this is

Back in the day your style was impressive
Infectious, stress-less
Disposition had it all, nothing but rapport
Full of what you're empty of
I hide my riches in embarrassing sheets
That reek of suspicious happenings
'Cause I'm a different person and that will make you sick
There's no stopping what this is

This thing we left outside is waterlogged
You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
And all that I know is one of us has to wring it out
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
And all that I know is one of us has to wring it out
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I've thought about nothing but this)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I've thought about nothing but this)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I won't escape the rip)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I won't escape the rip, I won't escape the rip)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I've thought about nothing but this)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I've thought about nothing but this)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I won't escape the rip, I won't escape the rip)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I won't escape the rip, I won't escape the rip)2Embed
