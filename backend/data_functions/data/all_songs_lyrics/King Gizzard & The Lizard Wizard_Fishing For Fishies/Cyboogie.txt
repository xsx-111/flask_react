Cyboogie Lyrics
Cyboogie, boogie, boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie, a hunk of grey matt
Multitude cells in his metallic dome
Brine fluid floating within
Flows between nodes in his cognisance home
Cyboogie, augmented senses
Scholarship vogue called for celebration
But was it a consciousness can?
Bouncy-ball thoughts in his cerebration

Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie's heart is a mess
Cables in knots in his cavity chest
Cyboogie's feeling depressed
Need to debug and run over the tests
Cyboogie's ticker ain't flesh
Pistons and pumps under graphene lattice
No people to service the mess
When he breaks down in spiritual stress
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Cyboogie
Cyboogie

Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Cyboogie

Cyboogie, lump in his throat
Palpitations and nausea ensue
Cyboogie's chorophobia
Terminal error vascular tissue
So Cyboogie's fishing for fishies
Red-bellied trout in a binary brook
How is it that he is depressed?
The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Cyboogie, cyboogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
