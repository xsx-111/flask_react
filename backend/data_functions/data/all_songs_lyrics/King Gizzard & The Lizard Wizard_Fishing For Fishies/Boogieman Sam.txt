Boogieman Sam Lyrics
Well, up jumped the boogieman
He ate mumma's babies
And shot the policeman
And went down to the nightclub
And shocked all the patrons
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With the room in his hand

Causing mayhem
’Cause he's the boogieman
Causing mayhem
'Cause he’s Boogieman Sam
(Boogieman Sam)

Well, up jumped the boogieman
He stole from a punter, the exact shoes he wanted
To carve holes in the floorboards
And dance like a demon
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogieman
With the room in his hand

Causing mayhem
'Cause he's the boogieman
Arms are flailing
'Cause he's the Boogieman
(Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, Boogieman)
Doing damage
'Cause he's the boogieman
(Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie)
He's outlandish
’Cause he’s Boogieman Sam
Boogieman Sam
Yeah, yeah
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie5Embed
