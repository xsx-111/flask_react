Fishing for Fishies Lyrics
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

Don't matter to kiss and
Put back, poor fishies should be free

I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim

Oh, your heart's a hook
Ego tied in knots, baiting fate
Don't do it
You ain't a god
Don't hunt salmon, carp or cod

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies
It seems like cruelty to me
You ain't hungry, leave them be

I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim

Oh, your heart's a hook
Ego tied in knots, baiting fate
Don't do it
You ain't a god
Don't hunt salmon, carp or cod

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies
I have been fishing and
I don't want to catch none
I have been fishing and
I don't want to catch none
I've let them swum
I've let them swum
I've let them swum
I've let them swum

I have been fishing and
I don't want to catch none
I have been fishing and
I don't want to catch none12Embed
