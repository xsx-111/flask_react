The Bird Song Lyrics
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

To a cow, what is a car?
It's a deadly predator

To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Can it think at all?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

To a cloud, what is a breeze?
It's a predetermined sneeze
To a seal, what is real?
Surely more than it can feel
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?
To a bird, what's a plane?2Embed
