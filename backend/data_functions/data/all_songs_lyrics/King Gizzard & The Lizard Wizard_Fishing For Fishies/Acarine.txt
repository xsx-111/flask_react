Acarine Lyrics
I am the honeybee
Drink the blood of the tree
I can't breathe, I can't see
Evil being, confusing

Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine

Little mite, so much spite
Multiply, ruin life
I can't fly, I can't cry
Acarine, make me die

Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Acarine
Acarine
Conduct larynx cesarean
Excise low life

Acarine
Acarine
Acarine
Acarine
