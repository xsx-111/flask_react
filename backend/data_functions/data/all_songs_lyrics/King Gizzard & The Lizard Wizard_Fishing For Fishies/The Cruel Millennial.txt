The Cruel Millennial Lyrics
Underestimated technology
I'm addicted to tablet screens
No escaping battleground PUBG
Computer games ain't for me

Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post-millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial

I was only born in '92
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
The cruel millennial

White dog shit, not on my nature strip
Calcium bone conspiracist
Berenstein Bears read to as kids
It's a glitch in the matrix

Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post-millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
