Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Lyrics
It took me five bars
Saw thirty license plates
I saw her mustang
And my eyes filled up with rage
I brought my pistol
But I ain't some kinda fool
So I walked right in barehanded
She was on his arm while he was playing pool
Just like I used to do

She kissed him while I got a beer
She didn't think I'd show up here
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend

I watched her for a while, but I didn't like her walk
Came across kinda cheap to me
But hey, how's that my fault?
She looked at my man
Like he didn't have on a stitch
Somebody tell that girl
To step up to the plate, I'm gonna pitch
Little bitch
Well, those pretty girls can play their game
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
Hey

I started throwing things and I scared folks half to death
I got up in his face, smelled whiskey on his breath
Didn't give a second thought to being thrown in jail
'Cause, baby, to a hammer, everything looks like a nail
I'm mad as hell

Those pretty girls, they're all the same
But they're damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend1Embed
