Getting Ready Lyrics
Oh baby, I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go
My hands are shaking
My heart's unsteady
Oh, how I once loved you so

I know all the magic's gone
Wish I had a magic wand
I would put a spell on you
You would see it as I do

Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go

Oh baby, you're my drug
I was just your cigarette
I was nothing you could be proud of
I have lost my self respect
My self respect, self respect
I have lost my self respect

Oh (Oh), I'm getting ready to let you go
(I'm getting ready to let you go)
Oh (Oh), I'm getting ready to let you go
(I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready)
Oh baby, baby, I got no traction
I've been waitin' and waitin' for your reaction
So I tried a new direction
I'm gonna give myself a resurrection

I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go
(I'm getting ready to let you go)
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go, let you go
Let you go1Embed
