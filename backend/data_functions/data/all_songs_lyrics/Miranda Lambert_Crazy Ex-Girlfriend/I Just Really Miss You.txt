I Just Really Miss You Lyrics
There's a dark cloud hanging over my heart
I can't see where it ends, or where it starts
I should get over you, but baby, it's so hard
With this dark cloud hanging over my heart

There's a sad song ringing in my head
Baby, it's been here ever since you left
I should be moving along how far would I get
With this sad song ringing in my head

I just really miss you, I just really miss you
There's a life I can't ask you to leave
I just really miss you, right now I kinda want to
The closest that you'll ever be to me
Is free

There's a hard wind blowing through this town
And nothing left to hold is pushing me down
It blows over you and me without a sound
There's a hard wind blowing through this town

I just really miss you, I just really miss you
There's a life I can't ask you to leave
I just really miss you, right now I kinda want to
The closest that you'll ever be to me
Is free
Now it's one more night at the upside down
It's ten steps in, and hundred miles back out

I just really miss you, I just really miss you
There's a life I can't ask you to leave
I just really miss you, right now I kinda want to
The closest that you'll ever be to me
Is free

There's a dark cloud hanging over my heartEmbed
