Famous in a Small Town Lyrics
They say life is so much sweeter
Through the telephoto lens of fame
Around here you get just as much attention
Cheerin' at the high school football game
I dreamed of goin' to Nashville
Put my money down and place my bet
But I just got the first buck of the season
I made the front page of the "Turner Town Gazette"

Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town

Tyler and Casey broke up
It ended pretty quietly
We heard he was caught red-handed with her mama
So that's just what they let us all believe

Every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Baby, who
Needs their faces in a magazine?
Me and you
We've been stars of the town since we were seventeen

Let's go on down to the quick stop
Wear your yellow shades, and I'll put on my tight jeans
And we'll just spend the weekend burnin' rubber
And we'll let 'em point and stare in disbelief

'Cause every last one, route one, rural heart's got a story to tell
Every grandma, in-law, ex-girlfriend
Maybe knows you just a little too well
Whether you're late for church or you're stuck in jail
Hey, word's gonna get around
Everybody dies famous in a small town
Everybody dies famous in a small town1Embed
