All You Need Is Hate LyricsThis was how I broke the best
Indifference, overblown with confidence and ignorance
It all made sense
And then I watched them take the test
I believe it's better to inflict than to attempt relief
You ask me what you need?
Hate is all you need
Hate is all around
Find it in your heart and every waking sound
On your way to school, work or church
You'll find that it's the only rule
Build a different world
Hate will help you find what you've been looking for
Hate is everywhere
Inside you mother's heart and you will find it there
You ask me what you need?
Hate is all you need
This was how I won the west
Charity, a joke that friendly cities think that we believe
Or so it seems
We kicked and punched and stabbed to death
Everyone applauded my fine actions
I was overcome
You ask me what I've seen?
Hate is all I've seen
Hate is in the air
Come on people feel it like you just don't care
Everlasting hate
Feel it in the people where it's warm and great
Come on hate yourself
Everyone here does so just enjoy yourself
Hate is everywhere
Look inside your heart and you will find it there
You ask me what I mean?
Hate is all I meanEmbed
