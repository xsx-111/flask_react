Child Killers LyricsLately days all seem the same
Since I lost my brain
Golden nights will see you through
Darker days need glue
How can I find what's right?
In truth our love was the night
What's the point to you?
Goodbye wonder, goodbye brain
This life is insane
No one here gets out alive
Not for life you'd like
How can I find what's right?
The truth is our lives were shite
What's the point to you?
Come down, down, down
We have the only gack in town
Understand that it's here that I'm coming from
If I'm wrong or I'm right
Maybe soon we'll peace in another world
Say goodnight
Eyes of black and lips of gray
When do I get my say?
Hard to come and easy go
Is the life I know
How can I find what's right?
The truth is our lives were shite
What's the point to you?
Come down, down, down
We have the only gack in town
Understand that it's here that I'm coming from
If I'm wrong or I'm right
Maybe soon we'll peace in another world
Say goodnight
Understand that it's here that I'm coming from
I don't mind if you're right
Maybe now I'll find peace in another world
