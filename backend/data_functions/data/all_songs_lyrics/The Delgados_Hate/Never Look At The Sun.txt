Never Look At The Sun LyricsIf you dare
Look up and see what's there
Level your eyes with some surprise
At the truths realized
Now you care
And you will climb for air
With some relief
You've found your peace
Are you taking us there?
Some cold comfort is waiting somewhere
Stand out
Now we can see
We've been found out
How can this be?
We've been hoping and praying
There's one life worth saving
Cold out
Happy to be here
Without doubt
Too much to see here
We're hoping and praying
There's one life worth saving
It's not too late
Trust in us
If you can trust in us
Follow the lead
For hearts that bleed
We're a difficult breed
Once you're found
No longer gagged and bound
Whisper to me "I think I'm free"
And the world will turn round
In between us
There are colors
But they're hidden from view
In between us
There is silence
But it's breaking for you
Some cold comfort will tell us what's true
Stand out
Now we can see
We've been found out
How can this be?
We've been hoping and praying
There's one life worth saving
Cold out
Happy to be here
Without doubt
Too much to see here
We're hoping and praying
There's one life worth saving
Hold out
My own reflection
I've found out
Less than perfection
I'm been hoping and praying
There's one life worth saving
Cold out
Happy to be here
Without doubt
Too much to see here
I'm hoping and praying
There's one life worth savingEmbed
