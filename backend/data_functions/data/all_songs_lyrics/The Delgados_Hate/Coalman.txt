Coalman LyricsIf we try too hard, forgive us
If we try too hard
If we think too much, control us
If we think too much
Take a bow in front of us now
Take a bow in spite of us now
If we want too much, ignore us
If we want too much
Can we give some back in offers?
Can we give some back?
Take a bow in front of us now
Take a bow in spite of us now
And all our voices became one
And the tide did turn
And there were voices overhead
What's done it's done
And we forgot compassion
For we had won
And the choice for all is ours alone
What's won it's won
We have time enough to take you
We have time enough
And when we succeed, we'll break you
And we will succeed
Take a bow in front of us now
Take a long last look at us now
And Victor's Justice is ours
And you'll have none
All life is ours to justify
We won, we won
And it's our right to own you
And you'll succumb
And freedom's ours forevermore
Your lives are doneEmbed
