The Drowning Years LyricsThis is the life of a woman with demons
First time we met I was sure she was steamin'
This is my life
This is my life
What a life
Life isn't precious, and life isn't sacred
Sometimes release only comes when you meet death
Night of reprieve
We were wrecked when we slept in the park
When we woke in the morning
You cried could I squeeze out the dawn
Destroy the noises
That make all the voices
And get them out of my head
Bring on the screaming
And I'll take your demons
Now that I'm already dead
Days of release when she almost felt better
Gradually faded and words couldn't get her
Where is the light
Where is the light
Get the light
Fearless and clear all her doubts had been cast off
Last night alive is a nightmare I'm part of
Dreams are a lie
Dreams are a lie
So am I
If that's all there is
Then I might as well get in the fire
Destroy the noises
That make all the voices
And get them out of my head
Bring on the screaming
And I'll take your demons
Now that I'm already dead
Oh how the rights of the righteous kept coming
Shining before like the day
I stand before them and cried that you're dying
Your way
I'm still not sure
If the right and the wrong side is one
I'm still not sure
If the right and the wrong side is one
I'm still not sure
If the right and the wrong side is one
I'm still not sure
If the right and the wrong side is oneEmbed
