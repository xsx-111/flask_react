The Light Before We Land Lyrics
In cases such as these I'd like a hand
Don't wake me up without a master plan
With sight and sound becoming fragile
Don't you understand?
When things that once were beautiful are bland

And when I feel like I can feel once again
Let me stay awhile, soak it in awhile
If we can hold on
We can fix what is wrong
Buy a little time
For this head of mine
Haven for us

In truth there is no better place to be
Than falling out of darkness still to see
Without a premonition, could you tell me where we stand?
I'd hate to lose this light before we land

And when I feel like I can feel once again
Let me stay awhile, soak it in awhile
If we can hold on
We can fix what is wrong
Buy a little time
For this head of mine
Haven for us
Before we let euphoria convince us we are free
Remind us how we used to feel before when life was real

And when I feel like I can feel once again
Let me stay awhile, soak it in awhile
If we can hold on
We can fix what is wrong
Buy a little time
For this head of mine
Haven for us2Embed
