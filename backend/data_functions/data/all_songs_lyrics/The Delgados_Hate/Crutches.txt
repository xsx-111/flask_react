Crutches LyricsStruck out with crutches while passing the car
And he stared cause his mind was elsewhere
Feet didn't look like they'd take him too far
What a mess how he failed to impress
He staggered inside
He never attempted to hide
Picked up his prize and was soon back outside
Carry on as you need to go on
Nobody followed and nobody tried
So he walked and we travelled close by
He went to sit down
Or was he pretending to drown
We could not trust
We only imagined the worst
