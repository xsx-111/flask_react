Mad Drums LyricsStand beside the photograph
Then stand beside the door
I'd like you to go quietly
When sliding to the floor
Take a look before you go
And watch you threw away
There is no sense in recompense
This act you can't delay
Let's take the colours
And throw them over
Then swim 'til you can see
The eyes of me
In truth I feel no hatred
In truth I feel no shame
I only feel confusion
At what you stood to gain
Strip the years of candy floss
Strip the years of pains
You tried to take a part of me
Now look at what you face
Let's take the colours
And throw them over
Then swim 'til you can see
The eyes of me
Taste of another
Who was forbidden
Lay down your guilty hands
In light of meEmbed
