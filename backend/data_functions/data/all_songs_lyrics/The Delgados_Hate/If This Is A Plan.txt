If This Is A Plan LyricsMake it better
Anyway just to make it feel better
By the way I've been eating the hearts again
Now I know you're not worth it
I had time but refused to discuss it
Anyway I wouldn't know where to begin
Well if this is a plan
Then I'm dead where I stand
I've been cursing the truth
Like I'm cursing my youth
But I know what it's like
To seem wrong when you're right
Hallelujah I'm down
And it's finally happening
You look older
You look harder and tired, you're colder
Is this what ten years with a dickhead can bring?
Least we know we're not worth it
But you know you could try to return it
All I said was you looked like you needed a friend
Well if this is a plan
Then I'm dead where I stand
I've been cursing the truth
Like I'm cursing for you
But I know what it's like
To seem wrong when you're right
Hallelujah I'm down
And it's finally happeningEmbed
