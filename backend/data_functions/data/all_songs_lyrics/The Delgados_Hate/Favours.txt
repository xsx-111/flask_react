Favours LyricsStarted to fight
But I took off in fright
I could not believe
That she didn't chase me
Climbed on her back
With an ambush attack
Down came the force
And down came the briefcase
Quiet before
Then you came to the fore
Not unsurprised
Still happy to see you
You know there's no chance
Not a sniff of romance
And I'm thinking this is the end of the line
And you're feeling fine
Are you looking for favours?
Returned for your crime
Help me to stand
Help me to say
That I don't want to be here
I don't want to stay
I just want away
A hit for a feel
With unconquered appeal
You locked the door
And I started to tremble
Touch without touch
Are we feeling too much?
I can't decide
If I'm feeling able
Eyes that don't meet
Are we too scared to speak?
I can't provide
What you are requesting
You know there's no chance
Not a sniff of romance
And I'm thinking this is the end of the line
And you're feeling fine
Were you looking for favours?
Returned for your crime
Help me to stand
Help me to say
That I don't want to be here
I don't want to stay
I just want away
And I, I'll try to feel fine
While I'm taking orders
From bottles of wine
Help me to stand
Help me to say
That I don't want to be here
I just want away
Touch without touch
Feel without feel
Are we both really hoping
This just isn't real?
Help me to stand
Help me to say
That I don't want to be here
I don't want to stay
I can't give todayEmbed
