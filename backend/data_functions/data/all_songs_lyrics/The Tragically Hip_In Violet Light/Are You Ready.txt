Are You Ready LyricsHear the old whistle blowing, they're pulling the plug
We got to get going, they got our hole dug
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready to love?
And are you ready, ready, are you ready to love?
The devil's in the blues, smoke it to the stub
Never accept, then accept with a shrug
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready to love?
And are you ready, ready, are you ready to love?
To love, to love, to love, to love
They got safety fifth, and they take the world straight
Whatever it is, they'll just have to wait
To get pretend back, who wants to be tough
To be permanent, permanent enough
Are you ready, are you ready, are you ready to love?
And are you ready, are you ready, are you ready to love?
And are you ready, ready, are you ready to love?
And are you ready, ready, are you ready to love?
To love, to love, to love, to love, to loveEmbed
