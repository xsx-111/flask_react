A Beautiful Thing LyricsIn the ulcerating silence perspective comes
The way it always does for it's ransom
So randomly somebody calls
The phone rings and it brings Niagara Falls
At three o'clock in the morning
"You'd better be dying" and you were
So we talked about time and where it went
Unremarkable events
And how one day took two days and they got spent
How you'd continue, carefully, in degrees
Trying to do one true beautiful thing
And your beautiful thing
It'd be
A beautiful thing
To see
That beautiful thing
Continuing
"I don't live there, I just commute"
Secretly cradling a joint and I might puke
A fumble with the keys under duress
The point is this is practise duress
At three o'clock in the morning
"You'd better be dying" and you were
So we talked about things and where they went
Big remarkable events
And how each day's a new day and they get spent
How you'd continue, artfully, like the breeze
Trying to do one true beautiful thing
And your beautiful thing
It'd be
A beautiful thing
To see
That beautiful thing
Continuing
Your beautiful thing
Continuing
And your beautiful thing
Will be
A beautiful thing
To me
A beautiful thing
Continuing
Your beautiful thing
