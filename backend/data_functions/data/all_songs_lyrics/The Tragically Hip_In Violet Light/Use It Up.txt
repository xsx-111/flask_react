Use It Up LyricsUse it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later
If there's music out there laying in wait
To pounce and drain every ounce if you wait or hesitate
And music that'll help you be tough
And come together on more than Springsteen, though most days it's been enough
There's music that can take you away, away, away, away
So use it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later
Use it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later
If there's music out there staying awake
To cry and drain every eye until hatred's eliminated
And music that can help you feel great
And come together in the fictive dream with a kind of Randy Newman take
There's music that can take you away, away, away, away
Where we can jump to our feet, agape 'cause nothing is cruel
And even if it is or was indefeasibly cruel
But we don't care because you're a fool, I'm a fool
You're a fool and I'm a fool
For music that can take you away
For music that can take you away
For music that can take you away
Music that can take you away
"Use it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later"Embed
