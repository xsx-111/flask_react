The Dire Wolf LyricsIn that September off, Isle Aux Morts
The desultory sea grew more so through the night
And made one think of tawny ports
As Aspen trembling in tomorrow's thorough light
And of Tallulah Bankhead and Canada Lee
Somewhere far off, peaceful, sleeping, and done with acting
Past the Dire Wolf's Lair on a Newfoundland's Paws
Close to nowhere and half way across
But never more here, expanse getting broader
Though bigger boats been done by this water
Though better boats been done by this water
Though better boats been done by less water
In that September off, Isle Aux Morts
Colourable seas grew more to through the night
And made one think of yawning shores
Gambier bleached in tomorrow's thorough light
And of Tallulah Bankhead and Canada Lee
Somewhere far off, peaceful, sleeping, they learned to love sleep
At the Dire Wolf's Crest, the Newfoundland paused
Desolate's best was gotten across
We were never more here, expanse getting broader
When better boats been done by this water
At the Dire Wolf's Best, the Newfoundland paused
So desperate as to be a lost cause
You were never more hear, expanse getting broader
When better boats been done by this water
Where bigger boats been done by less water
And better boats been done by this water
When bigger boats been done by less water
And better boats been done by this waterEmbed
