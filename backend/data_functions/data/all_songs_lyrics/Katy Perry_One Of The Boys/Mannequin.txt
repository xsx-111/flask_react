Mannequin Lyrics
How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no workout
But I have no clue how to get through to you

Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man

I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in, make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you, there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart
Oh, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's out of my hands
I can't put you back together again

'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man

If the past is the problem
Our future could solve 'em, baby
I could bring you to life
If you let me inside, baby
It'll hurt, but in the end
You'll be a man

You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real, oh
Toy, could you ever be a real, real boy and understand?
But you're not a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man4Embed
