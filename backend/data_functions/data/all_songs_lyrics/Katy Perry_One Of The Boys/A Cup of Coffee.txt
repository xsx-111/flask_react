A Cup of Coffee Lyrics
I take these turns a bit too fast
Trying to leave you in my past
The CD skips our favorite songs
Our greatest hits just don't belong
I really love to hate this
Love hate, hate love relationships

Are overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again

So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose
I pop these pills like cracker jacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes
Just watching you react
When you're depressed you sleep too much
I'm not sure if I'm waking up

It's overrated
Over my dead body is how this will end
You said it's over
And I could go for another chance to do this over again

So this is it?
After all we've been through
We called it quits
And I'm about to
I lost my grip
On what little I had left
You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close
Cup of coffee and an overdose

You said it's over
And I could really go for a cup of coffee and an overdose
Leave it all behind me
You'll see it when you finally find me
Comatose or pretty close

I stood in line without you, oh
I stood in line without you, I, I-I-I-I
I stood in line
(I stood in line without you and I don't tell you what they ever thought)
I stood in line without you (About you)
I stood in line without you (Well without you)
I stood in line without you (Is everything I've got)
(I stood in line without you and I don't tell you all they ever thought about you)
And only, only ever thought about your pretty face
(Well, without you is everything I've got)
(I stood in line without you)2Embed
