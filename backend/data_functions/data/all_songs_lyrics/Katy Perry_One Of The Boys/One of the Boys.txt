One of the Boys Lyrics
Do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do

I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
'Cause they just get in my way

(The way) The way (You look) you look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
(High five) You high five (You) your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be (Just wanna be)
One of the girls (Just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys
So over the summer, something changed
I started reading Seventeen and
Shaving my legs and
I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you
Staring at me 'cause

(I know) I know (What you) what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
(Okay) It's okay, (Maybe) maybe one day
But not until you gimme my diamond ring

'Cause I donâ€™t wanna be (Don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your (Just wanna be)
Homecoming queen (Just wanna be)
Pinup poster dream (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day, you're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna... (Don't wanna be)
So I don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be (Just wanna be)
One of the girls (Just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys
