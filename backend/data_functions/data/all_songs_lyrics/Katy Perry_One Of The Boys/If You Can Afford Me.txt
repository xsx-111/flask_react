If You Can Afford Me Lyrics
If you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the crème de la crop
If you want me, you better do better than that tonight
Oh-oh
If you want me, it takes more than a wink
More than a drink, more than you think
If you want me, you're gonna have to break the bank, tonight

'Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill, 'cause that's the deal

If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me, I'm not a piece of ass
A one-night stand, a storage shed
I think you better walk by, tonight, oh no
If you want me, then stop begging
I don't put out for charity
If you want me, there's no discount price tonight
But I don't need your dollar bills
I just want something real
'Cause nothing's free, except loving me

If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me

If you want me
The cherry on top, the pick of the pack, the crème de la crop

If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you wanna ride, just name your price
And don't play cheap with your heart
And don't make a bet if you can't write the check for me
For me
'Cause I can be bought, but you'll pay the cost
If you can afford me3Embed
