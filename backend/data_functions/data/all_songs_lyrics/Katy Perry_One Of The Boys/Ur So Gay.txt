Ur So Gay Lyrics
Your mind may refuse to believe
Your mind may refuse to believe

I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it’s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like...

You're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
You’re so skinny, you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I'm so angry 'cause you’d rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup
And
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like...
Hey
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh!
La la la, la la la
Do do do, bah bah bah
Do do do, da da day
You're so gay
You're so gay

You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull 'em down and there's really nothing there
I wish you would just be real with me

You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
Oh, no no no no no no no
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like... penis16Embed
