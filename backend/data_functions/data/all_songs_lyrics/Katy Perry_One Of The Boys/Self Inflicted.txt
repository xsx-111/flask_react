Self Inflicted Lyrics
Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin?
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken, but my heart is still wide open

I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

With each scar, there's a map that tells a story
What a souvenir of young love's like jumping out
An airplane riding a tidal wave of an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open

I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
And I cover up these scars
(We'll make it, we'll make it, but we break it)
And I can't stop seeing stars
(Let's hope, not die)
Whenever you're around, around

I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to

I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
Oh, I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
Ohh
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose3Embed
