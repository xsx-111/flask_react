Crossword LyricsWalking on air
Shoulder and head above you
Down in the street
Black canyons walking through
Hooded sad eyes
Fixed on your shuffle shoes
Life is a clue in your crossword
Typewriter turk
Telephone terror takes
Time to wind down
Push-button finger shakes
City of dreams
Back to your quiet nightmare
Your life is a clue in the crossword
Working to rule in your own time
Drag yourself home to your star sign page
Staying awake on cold yesterday's steak and warm beer
Ladder of string
Climbing to sweet success
Homework aside
Your brain on the train to test
Pick up the news
You left on the seat beside you
Your life is a clue in the crossword
Your life is a clue in the crossword
Your life is a clue in the crosswordEmbed
