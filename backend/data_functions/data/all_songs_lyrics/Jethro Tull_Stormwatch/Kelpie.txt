Kelpie LyricsThere was a warm wind with the high tide
On the south side of the hill
When a young girl went a-walking
And I followed with a will
Good day to you, my fine young lady
With your lips so sweetly full
May I help you comb your long hair
Sweep it from that brow so cool
Up, ride with the kelpie
I'll steal your soul to the deep
If you don't ride with me while the devil's free
I'll ride with somebody else
Well, I'm a man when I'm feeling
The urge to step ashore
So I may charm you, not alarm you
Tell you all fine things and more
Up, ride with the kelpie
I'll steal your soul to the deep
If you don't ride with me while the devil's free
I'll ride with somebody else
Say goodbye to all your dear kin
For they hate to see you go
In your young prime to this place of mine
In the still loch far below
Up, ride with the kelpie
I'll steal your soul to the deep
If you don't ride with me while the devil's free
I'll ride with somebody else
Up, ride with the kelpie
I'll steal your soul to the deep
If you don't ride with me while the devil's free
I'll ride with somebody else
Up, ride with the kelpie
I'll steal your soul to the deepEmbed
