Home LyricsAs the dawn sun breaks over sleepy gardens
I'll be here to do all things to comfort you
And though I've been away
Left you alone this way
Why don't you come awake and let your first smile take me home
The shadows in the park were longer yesterday and Lady Luck stood still, waiting for the kill
And on a jumbo ride over seas grey, deep and wide
I flew for heaven's sake and let the angels take me home
Down steep and narrow lanes I see the chimneys smoking above the golden fields ...
Know what the robin feels in his summer jamboree
All elements agree in sweet and stormy blend ---
Midwife to winds that send me homeEmbed
