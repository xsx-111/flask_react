Man of God LyricsI carry my visions on my shoulder
And you'd better look out for the things I say
Hellfire and brimstone leave me colder
Than Jack frost stripped naked on a winter’s day, hey hey hey
Well, I touch your children with my water
Sanctified by holy breath
Of holy mothers, holy daughter
I won't make you laugh but I'll be your death
I’m a man of God
Yes, I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
Well, I'm a man of God
Yes, I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I’m a man of God
I’m a man of God
I'm the black frock king
I’m the hard-eyed sender
Dispatch you all to another place
Whether better or worsе is your decision
I can only scare you to your face
Suffеr little children to come and feel me
In the house I share with the Lord above
He is the tenant, I am the master
Mine is the hate, his is the love
I'm a man of God, mmm
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I’m a man of God
I'm a man of God
Yes, I'm a man of God
I say, I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
Oh, I'm a man of God
Yes, I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
Yes, I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of God
I'm a man of GodEmbed
