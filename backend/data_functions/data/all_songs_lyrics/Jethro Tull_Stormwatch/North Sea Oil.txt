North Sea Oil LyricsBlack and viscous--bound to cure blue lethargy
Sugar-plum petroleum for energy
Tightrope-balanced payments need a small reprieve
Oh, please believe we want to be
In North Sea
In North Sea oil
New-found wealth sits on the shelf of yesterday
Hot-air balloon inflation soon will make you pay
Riggers rig and diggers dig their shallow grave
But we'll be saved and what we crave
Is North Sea
Is North Sea oil
("Viking, Forties, Fisher: north-west, backing west, four to five. Dogger, German Bight: north-west, five or six, occasionally gale eight.")
Prices boom in Aberdeen and London Town
Ten more years to lay the fears, erase the frown
Before we are all nuclear--the better way!
Oh, let us pray: we want to stay
In North Sea
In North Sea
In North Sea oilEmbed
