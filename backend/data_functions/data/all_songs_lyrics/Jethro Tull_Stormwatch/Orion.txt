Orion LyricsOrion, won't you give me your star sign
Orion, get up on the sky-line
I'm high on my hill and I feel fine
Orion, let's sip the heavens' heady wine
Orion, light your lights:
Come guard the open spaces
From the black horizon to the pillow where I lie
Your faithful dog shines brighter than its lord and master
Your jewelled sword twinkles as the world rolls by
So come up singing above the cloudy cover
Stare through at people who toss fitful in their sleep
I know you're watching as the old gent by the station
Scuffs his toes on old fag packets lying in the street
Orion, won't you give me your star sign
Orion, get up on the sky-line
I'm high on my hill and I feel fine
Orion, let's sip the heavens' heady wine
And silver shadows flick across the closing bistro
Sweet waiters link their arms and patter down the street
Their words lost blowing on cold winds in darkest Chelsea
Prime years fly fading with each young heart's beat
Orion, won't you make me a star sign
Orion, get up on the sky-line
I'm high on your love and I feel fine
Orion, let's sip the heavens' heady wine
And young girls shiver as they wait by lonely bus-stops
After sad parties: no-one to take them home
To greasy bed-sitters and make a late-night play
For lost virginity a thousand miles away
Orion, won't you make me a star sign
Orion, get up on the sky-line
I'm high on your love and I feel fine
Orion, let's sip the heavens' heady wine
On the sky-line
