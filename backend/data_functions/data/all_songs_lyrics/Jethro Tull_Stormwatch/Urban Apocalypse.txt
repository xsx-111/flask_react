Urban Apocalypse LyricsHalt the ringing cry of progress
Sang the horseman riding by
They've used up all the good god gave us
And we're riding back to yesterday (to yesterday)
Turn the tables in the temples
Break the holy trinity
Of life assurance, General Motors
And silicon efficiency
Stop cheating for your daily dues
The race is run - no prize - you lose
Stop craving for your daily news
There's no messiah to change your views
The homeless breadless queues must eat
Let reason re-assume its seat
It stands waiting in the slips
You hold the reins of the apocalypse
Galvanise yourselves to action
Cast aside iniquity
The atavistic voice has spoken
Now print your names in history
Halt the ringing cry of progress
Sang the horseman riding by
They've used up all the good god gave us
And we're riding back to yesterdayEmbed
