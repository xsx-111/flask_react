Lagoon Lyrics
Imagine a perfect beach
Without a mermaid
Imagine a perfect hideaway
Without a time

Ocean soul

Imagine a perfect Eden
Without a friend (without a serpent)

Ocean soul
Lonely soul

Feeling lonely and content at the same time
I believe
Is a rare kind of happiness

Ocean soul
Lonely soulEmbed
