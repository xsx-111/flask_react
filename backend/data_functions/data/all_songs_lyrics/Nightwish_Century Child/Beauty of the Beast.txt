Beauty of the Beast Lyrics

Trees have dropped their leaves
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me
Distance is covering your way
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me

Oh, do you care
I still feel for you
Oh, so aware
What should be lost is there

I fear I will never
Never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost love

Oh, do you care
I still feel for you
Oh, so aware
What should be lost is there


Safely away from the world
In a dream, timeless domain
A child, dreamy eyed
Mother's mirror, father's pride

I wish I could come back to you
Once again feel the rain
Falling inside me
Cleaning all that I've become

My home is far but the rest it lies so close
With my long lost love under the black rose
You told I had the eyes of a wolf
Search them and find the beauty of the beast
All of my songs can only be composed of the greatest of pains
Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes
I wish I had one more night to live

A saint blessed me, drank me deeply
Spitting out the misery in me
Still a sinner rapes a thousand saints
Sharing the same hell with me
Sanest choice in this insane world:
Beware the beast but enjoy the feast he offers


Sanest choice in this insane world:
Beware the beast but enjoy the feast he offers

All of my songs can only be composed of the greatest of pains
Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes
I wish I had one more night to live


"Oh, sweet Christabel
Share with me your poem
For I know now, I'm a puppet on this silent stage show
I'm but a poet who failed his best play
A Dead Boy, who failed to write an ending to each of his poems"Embed
