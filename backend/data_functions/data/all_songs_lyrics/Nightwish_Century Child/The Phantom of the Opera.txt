The Phantom of the Opera Lyrics
In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my mind

Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside your mind

Those who have seen your face draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear, it's me they hear
Your spirit and my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there inside my/your mind
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera

Where all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery lay both in you
And in this labyrinth where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is here inside my/your mind
Sing, my Angel of Music
He's there the Phantom of the Opera
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing for me6Embed
