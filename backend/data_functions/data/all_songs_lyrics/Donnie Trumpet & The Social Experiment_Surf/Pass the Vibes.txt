Pass the Vibes Lyrics
She had some vibes for me
I had no vibes for her (No vibes)
She pressed them on to me
I have some vibes for her (I got the vibes now)
Aye, pass me the vibes
I want to play the vibraphone
She had some vibes for me
I had no vibes for her (No vibes)
She pressed them on to me
I have some vibes for her (I got the vibes now)
Aye, pass me the vibes
I want to play the vibraphone32Embed
