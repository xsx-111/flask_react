Questions Lyrics
Why, why, why-why
Why, why, why-why
Why, why, why-why
Why, why
Rain so hot in the neighborhood
My love don't call when she said she would
Friends who come don't stay for good, no, no, no
Why?
Pigs wanna take Black mamas' kids
Bible say we all from the same rib
But some of us go to Heaven too soon
Why some of us get to Heaven too soon?
Why, why, why-why
Why, why, why-why
Why, why, why-why
Why, why
Why, why, why-why
Why, why, why-why (Why, why)
Why, why, why-why (Why, why, why)15Embed
