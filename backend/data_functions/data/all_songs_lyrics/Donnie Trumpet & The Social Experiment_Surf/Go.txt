Go Lyrics
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go

Ahh, ooh
Aight, say what's up
Ahh, ooh
Ugh

I never meant to leave (Don't go, don't go), but girl, I gotta go
Selfish, it may be, but know, my heart ainâ€™t cold
I got some things to see, but tonight, get on the floor
Better yet, jump on the board, surf's up
This wave gon' take us all from city to city
From the 'Go, to Cali, to Paris
In my dreams, once I'm lifted, you will know (Ugh)
Needed to go let me see, go let me eat, be MG
I'ma come back just to show you the air
That you never will breathe without me, I'ma

Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go (Go, go)
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go (Go, go)
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go (Yeah)
You should never go away
You should never go away
You should never go away (Ahh, ooh)
You should never go away (Purple)
Ugh, you remind me of one of these girls
Or should I say "one of these hoes"
You could be a Playmate girl, centerfold
In the mirror, working on your magazine-cover pose
All you really want is credit cards, billboards
Magazines, movie screens, money rolls
You really are the shit that you see, huh?
You know, you only see what they show you
I could show you something different, baby girl
Sometimes, the bullshit glisten, baby girl
Standing in the club with your eyebrows furrowed
Secondhand watch on, so you know your time's borrowed
I don't really mean to look at you the wrong way
But, did the couple free shots get you home, bae?
When you woke up, were you still in the wrong place?
Guess the lil' money that he spent on drinks done went a long way
Now, go on, get your panties out the hallway
Twelve missed calls, what your phone say
On the ride home, you still take the long way
Had to blame it all on the alcohol like the song say, damn
Guess you should have listened to the man
Now, you done gone and went missing on the man
Sharks in the water, still fishing for the man
Surf's up, smoke something, Young Purple, I'm the man, ugh
Surf's up
Surf's up
Surf's up

Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go (Go, go)
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go (Go, go)
Please don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go

Surf's up, surf's up
Surf's up, surf's up
Surf's up, surf's up
Surf's up36Embed
