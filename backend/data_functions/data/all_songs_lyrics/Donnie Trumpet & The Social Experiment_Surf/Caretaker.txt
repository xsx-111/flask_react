Caretaker Lyrics
I'll take care of you (Hey, yeah)
Even if you got a man now
'Cause I been fucking fans now
Still I'll take care of you (Hey, yeah)
Even if you got a man now
I would have to understand now
'Cause I ain't been there
Oh but you know I still gotchu baby
I've been bad
I had to do what I had to do
I've been bad
But you know I still love you
I've been bad
Sorry
Still I'll take care of you (Hey yeah)
Even if you've got a man now
I'd be forced to understand, now
(Ooooh)35Embed
