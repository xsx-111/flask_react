World Full of Hate LyricsA feeling inside
In the back of my head
Like a song I still know
From so long ago
And I wouldn't change a thing
Like a car driving by
Triggers something in my mind
Am I retreiving my direction?
Or just charging forward blind?
Am I everything that you wanted me to be?
Have I lost that conditional connection I couldn't see?
To the end
Like a friend
Stands by you again
And I wouldn't change a thing
Toe-to toe
Friend or foe?
It's all that I know
And I wouldn't change a thing
As the years pass us by
Will I still make the grade?
Can I really offer anything?
And will my soul be saved?
Can you cleanse me up?
Drive out the swine?
Am I only falling farther?
Can you keep me safe from harm?
The memories you build
In the house on the hill
Would you really change a thing?
Correcting mistakes in a world full of hate
Never changes anything
Till the end
Like a friend
Stands by you again
Toe-to-toe
Friend or foe?
It's all that I know
Till the end
Like a friend
Stands by you again
And I wouldn't change a thing
Toe-to-toe
Friend or foe?
It's all that I know
And I wouldn't change a thingEmbed
