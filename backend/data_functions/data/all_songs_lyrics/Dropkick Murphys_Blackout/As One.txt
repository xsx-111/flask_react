As One LyricsTonight my son, I'll heed the call
If you're to live, then I must fall
Just give me one more moment, another walk out in the sun
One more day to find some justice with your shadow by my side
Cuff me, tie me, lock me down 'cause I'll be back to go another round!
As one!
My blood runs red beneath the knife
I give my soul to you tonight
From early on I was on my own with no light to guide my way
Then the hand of destiny called me only now do I understand
Interwoven our lives became, bonded by blood no need to be repaid!
As one!
Just give me one more moment with your shadow by my side
And we will always be together... as oneEmbed
