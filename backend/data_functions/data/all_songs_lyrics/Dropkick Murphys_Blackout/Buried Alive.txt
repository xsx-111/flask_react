Buried Alive LyricsNothing they could do just sit down there
As the black closed all around them
And the water rose so quick and cold
An unlikely place to drown
Chorus:
Nine in the mine, trapped down below
Down! Down! Down in the ground
And this would be the day I didn't kiss my wife goodbye
Take care of the family, I'm buried alive
They held their heads up high
As they struggled hard to breathe
And asked the Lord to open his arms
For the nine souls he'd receive
They lashed themselves together
So in Death all might be found
And prayed there for a miracle
Some twenty-four storeys downEmbed
