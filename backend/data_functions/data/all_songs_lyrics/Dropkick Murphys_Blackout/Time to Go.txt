Time to Go Lyrics
Go! Go! Black and gold!
Old-time hockey, bar the door
Clear the track it's all-out war
Light the lamp, throw a hit
Black and gold never quit
The barn is full, our team's in town
So put 'em up boys, knock 'em down
Drop the puck, it's time to go, time to go

Bust outta work, it's a quarter past five
Time to round up the gang
And take the Red to the Orange line
Head for the street and the Causeway crowd
You can feel it in the air, when the team's in town

Go! Go! Black and gold!
Old-time hockey, bar the door
Clear the track it's all-out war
Light the lamp, throw a hit
Black and gold never quit
The barn is full, our team's in town
So put 'em up boys, knock 'em down
Drop the puck, it's time to go, time to go
Rancourt's ready, it's time to take to the ice
So tie down the jersey cause it could get ugly tonight
Top corner, five hole, off the post and in
On a quest for the cup, and we're ready to win

Go! Go! Black and gold!
Old-time hockey, bar the door
Clear the track it's all-out war
Light the lamp, throw a hit
Black and gold never quit
The barn is full, our team's in town
So put 'em up boys, knock 'em down
Drop the puck, it's time to go

Go! Go! Black and gold!

Drop the puck, it's time to go, time to goEmbed
