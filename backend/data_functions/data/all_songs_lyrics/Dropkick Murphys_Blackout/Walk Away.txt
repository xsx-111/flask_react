Walk Away Lyrics
So you say you fell in love and you're gonna get married
Raise yourself a family, how simple life can be
Somewhere it all went wrong and your plan just fell apart
And you ain't got the heart to finish what you started

Yeah, you fell in love and you went and got married
Had yourself a family, how simple life can be
Somewhere it all went wrong and your plan just fell apart
And you ain't got the heart to finish what you started

The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones you said you'd try to find
Are they trying to find you?
The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones you said you'd try to find
Are they trying to find you?


Somewhere it all went wrong and your plan just fell apart
And you ain't got the heart to finish what you started
You walked out that door to find where you belong
To fulfill your own selfish dreams, I think you might have forgotten

The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones you said you'd try to find
Are they trying to find you?
The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones you said you'd try to find
Are they trying to find you?
The ones that you loved
The ones that you left behind
The ones you said you'd try to find
Are they trying to find you?Embed
