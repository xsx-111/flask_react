Black Velvet Band LyricsIn a neat little town they call Brockton
Apprenticed in trade I was bound
And many an hour of sweet happiness
I spent in that neat little town
Then bad misfortune befell me
And caused me to stray from the land
Far away from my friends and companions
To follow the black velvet band
As I was out strolling one evening
Not intending to stay very long
I met a frolicsome damsel
As she came tripping along
A watch she pulled out her pocket
And slipped it right into my hand
On the very first night that I met her
Bad luck to the black velvet band
Her eyes, they shone like the diamond
You'd think she was queen of the land
And her hair hung over her shoulder
Tied up in a black velvet band
Before judge and jury next morning
Both of us did appear
The judge he said to me, "Young man, the case against you is quite clear."
"I'll give you seven years penal servitude to be spent far away from this land
Far away from your friends and companions to follow the black velvet band."
So come all you jolly young fellows
I'll have you take warning by me
Whenever youre out on the liquor
Beware of the pretty Colleen
She'll fill you with whiskey and porter
Until youre not able to stand
And the very next thing you'd know
You've landed in Van Dieman's landEmbed
