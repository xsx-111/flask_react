The Outcast LyricsIf they can make a law then I can break a law
If I can break the law will the law break me?
It comes tumbling down again, I can't comprehend, is it destiny
Your nomadic state, are you a refugee, no place to call your home
Forever walk alone as the world goes on
Forgotten by the ones you've known
Chorus:
And all the words you gave me
I lost on bended knee
But you can't stop these cravings
Just by praying they would cease
If I can make a life, then I can take a life
And if I save a life, will this life save me
Time after time I still seem to find you're looking out for me
So wrap your arms around me, hold me close and don't let go
Let me lean on you as I think things though, if I dont't we'll never know
:Chorus:
Will your faith save me
Will I find this place where I belong
Can you protect me from my troubles, keep me safe from harm
Will you help me carry onEmbed
