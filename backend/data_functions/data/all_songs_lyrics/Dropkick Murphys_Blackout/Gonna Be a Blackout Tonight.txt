Gonna Be a Blackout Tonight LyricsGonna be a blackout
Gonna nail me a black curtain up good an' tight
Gonna do what my air raid man says is right
I'm gonna pull down my shade an' turn out my light
There's gonna be a blackout tonight
Cause my town is big and my town is bright
My town can work and my town can fight
So don't strike no light and don't cause a red
There's gonna be a blackout tonight
Gonna be a blackout, blackout tonight
Gonna be a blackout
Gonna do what my air raid man says is right
Blackout tonight
Pull down my shade an' turn out the light
Lights will go out all over town
And the air raid warden will walk up and down
It's part of the war, I'm gonna do right
There's gonna be a blackout tonight
Gonna be a blackout, blackout tonight
Gonna be a blackout, gonna be a blockout
Gonna do what my air raid man says is right
Blackout tonight
Pull down my shade an' turn out the light
My town is big and my town is bright
My town can work and my town can fight
Lights will go out all over town
And the air raid warden will walk up and down
It's part of the war, I'm gonna do right
There's gonna be a blackout tonight
Gonna be a blackout, blackout tonight
Gonna be a blackout, gonna be a blockout
Gonna do what my air raid man says is right
Blackout tonight
Pull down my shade an' turn out the lightEmbed
