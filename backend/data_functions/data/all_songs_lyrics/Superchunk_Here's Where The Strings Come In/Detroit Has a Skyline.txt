Detroit Has a Skyline LyricsAs soon as I got home
I reached out for the phone
Drank my sleep from a can
Playing track six, track seven
Again and again
I had a crush
Nothing works out
Well, I had faith
You could not have known
Don't even say it
Meet me again, maybe one mile high
Meet me again, I won't flake this time
Meet me again, maybe a year from now
Meet me again, I think we both remember how
It was no architect designed this view
He could not have known about you
Mousy homes, catacombs
Detroit has a skyline, too
Detroit has a skyline, too
I had a crush
Nothing works out
Well, I had faith
You could not have known
So don't even say it
Meet me again, it is one mile high
Meet me again, and I won't flake this time
Meet me again, maybe a year from now
Meet me again, I think we both remember how
I think we both remember how
I think we both remember, both remember howEmbed
