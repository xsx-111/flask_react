Animated Airplanes Over Germany LyricsWell I'm getting good at sleeping on planes
But I'm suffering more than a jagged time change
Not to say you're not a gracious host
But the cold water here is colder than most
Pull down your mask
Reach down under your feet
Call me one last time from the phone in your seat
Yeah the cold water here is colder than most
Sometimes I think there's only one warm place in this world
It's under the flag, of your (love unfurled?) on the phone (?)
Trace your finger down this map
Well is it relief?
From this height everything looks flat
Now that I believe
Pull down your mask
Reach down under your seat
Buy the stewardess wine
Drink some for me
Sometimes I think there's only one warm place in this world
It's under the flag, of your (??) on the phone
He thought he saw his life flash between his knees
On an animated airplane over GermanyEmbed
