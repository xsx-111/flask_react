Eastern Terminal LyricsWell do you think your friends will show? (I don't, I don't know)
Because the light is beginning to go
If when we speak my cheeks start to burn
Then I'm a blushing bride ready to learn
Hung out at the Eastern terminal
All dressed up at dusk for a ride
Flamingos, and me on one leg
Swept up in the terminal's tide
I'm glad they tore that trailer down (I don't, I don't know)
Though back then you weren't even around
And now the sun is beginning to sink
Will I get that promised drink?
If when you speak my cheeks start to burn
Then I'm a blushing bride ready to learn
Hung out at the Eastern terminal
All dressed up at dusk for a ride
Flamingos, and me on one leg
Swept up in the terminal's tide
Hung out at the Eastern terminal
Too messed up at dusk for a ride
Flamingos, and me on my last legs
Drowning in the terminal's tide - yeah!Embed
