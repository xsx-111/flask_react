Silverleaf And Snowy Tears LyricsSilverleaf and snowy tears
Wish I could have frozen time this year
You know nothing grows up here
It's all silver leaf and snowy tears
You know nothing grows up here
I'm digging in the permafrost
I'm scratching out the lines I never thought you'd cross
I'm sending up a flare for roaming dogs uncaught
In hopes that they might drag you home
Silver leaf and snowy tears
What buried box of luck could you not find here
Stamp some feelings back into my legs
I guess I'll freeze to death before, before I'll beg
You know nothing grows up here
You know nothing
I'm digging in the permafrost
I'm scratching out the lines I never thought you'd cross
I'm sending up a flare for roaming dogs uncaught
In hopes that they might drag you home
Forever after this might be
The fixture on my mantle piece
The feet are washing whites around
And nothing growing on the groundEmbed
