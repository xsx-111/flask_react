Green Flowers, Blue Fish LyricsYou gave me the keys, but not to your home
The porcelain locks, they just wouldn't hold
Against my shoulder, against the cold
They gave right in and went on in
You put on your helmet, just to breathe
You put on your shoes, but you did not leave
You made you mind up and took it all back
You flew your plane home with the boxes you packed
You filled your vase full but the flowers all died
You painted them green but the paint would not dry
You linked up a list of thinks not to say
I put in the tape and began to play
You made your mind up but the thoughts came unstacked
You flew your plane home, but I flew it back
You filled the lake full, but the fish they all died
You painted them blue, but the paint would not dry
You filled your vase full but the flowers all died
You painted them too, but the paint would not dryEmbed
