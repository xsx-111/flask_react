Certain Stars LyricsHotel telephone exchange rates not what they use to be
Horrible fox and hounds oil painting hanging over me
Cathode ray tube the only sane room, we're undone now?
You have to bring your nightstar with you're if you're going out
Certain stars put me to bed
Certain stars, certain stars
You brought the sign, you believe what you read
Certain stars, certain stars
Certain stars swim around in my head
Certain stars, certain stars
Fake wood ??? blanket could never keep me warm
While in the house some planet rising will bring on a lightning storm
And if you squint that portrait could be anyone
Just let me have my same old illusion and keep your fun
Certain stars put me to bed
Certain stars, certain stars
You brought the sign, you believe what you read
Certain stars, certain stars
Certain stars put me to bed
Certain stars, certain stars
Certain stars put me to bed
No matter where you are
Swimming around in my head
Certain starsEmbed
