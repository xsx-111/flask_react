Iron On LyricsWhen I woke up this morning, it was raining
Yeah, it was pouring again
Still I think the birds were singing
I couldn't hear them through the din
Couldn't hear them
Will you send me a picture, so I can remember
Will you send me a picture, so I can
We're passing the bottle over to you
Across the floor of our sinking, dug-out canoe
We got so drunk that night, we got so drunk that night
I hardly remember driving you home
Or was I driving you away
Will you send me a picture, so I can remember
Will you send me a picture, so I can
Iron this on when you get homeEmbed
