Evil Rabbit Lyrics
The devil tried to take my home
The devil tried to take my

I'm taking your town
I'm taking your town
I'm taking your town
With the miracle key
We're going

Root ticks tock, I'm cold, five ill again
Sick in the cerebral
Tongue stay terrible
Tune in for goons, spoonful of pepper
Our step steps to the better
We're getting knowledge of them culture
Over, still sturdy
Superbly souped up, yearning in my gut back
Tracking down spies in the silent night
All might be calm but 'tis far from holy

I'm taking your town with the miracle key
To go up on the one they call Evil Rabbit
With the evil we have
We find them or work with fallen angel
We not ready to dig that
We be freedom fighter, fighting for the people
Getting love from the crough-necks to crough-backs to crusties
Decent people keep decent friend
Broadcast Manuvas on my rebel FM
Subversive movement
Bringing improvement
To my surroundings, grounded in the faith
What if Manuva got squalored to Hell?

I'm taking your town with the miracle key
As we go upon the one that they call Evil Rabbit
We beat evil with the evil

Two sides to the penny, two sides to the bread
Two sides to the biscuit, ten sides to my head
I'm every man, I'm every cause, I'm every whim
Concoction of cocktails, scotch, rum, and gin
I hate this world so much, I'm shitting out love
I'm healthy, I'm working out in the pub
These eyes, they show the lies, they show the truth
I swear I was Jesus but I don't have the proof
I'm taking your town with the miracle key
Just to work upon the one that they call Evil Rabbit
Evil, weed him out
Weed him out
I like taking your town, I like taking your town1Embed
