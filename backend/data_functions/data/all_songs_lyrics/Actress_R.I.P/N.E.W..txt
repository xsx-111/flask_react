N.E.W. LyricsYou said you heard of me so why are you so afraid?
Some minor changes made, you'll miss the big parade
Another filthy day, another Hollywood sign
You missed the caution line and you just walked right in
You walked right in
There's a body there, somebody you once knew
He took a liking to your conversation cues
The way you cut your hair, the time you did it yourself
You're lack of hired help, the way you fit right in
The way you fit right in
'Cause you're a brand-new kind of actress
You're a brand-new kind of actress
You're the same old stubborn waitress, baby
You're a brand-new kind of actress
You swim the other way, you put your seed upstream
So many hopes and dreams, so many in-betweens
Your new reality, just make yourself at home
He's always watching me, he's never been alone
So you just walked right in
'Cause you're a brand-new kind of actress
You're a brand-new kind of actress
You're the same old stubborn waitress, baby
You're a brand-new kind of actress
You little greasy guy, I don't care what you did
In 1965 before the wife and kid
I'll leave my jacket on, so sorry, I can't stay
Just put the piece away
Just put the piece away and let me call a cab
We'll go our separate ways, we'll go our separate ways
Just put the piece away, I don't care what you did
Back in younger days, just put the piece away, get it away
'Cause Im a brand-new kind of actress
Im a brand-new kind of actress
Im the same old stubborn waitress, baby
Im a brand-new kind of actressEmbed
