Queens Will Play LyricsBlood crawls through the night holes
Blood sprawls across the walls
Blood crawls up and hassles
Blood sprawls across the walls
We've all seen tomorrow
And there's truth to what they say
Demons may be hiding in our shadows
Blood crawls across the cancer
Blood sprawls across the shore
Blood crawls up and hassles
Blood sprawls across the walls
We've all seen tomorrow
And there's truth to what they say
Demons may be hiding in our shadows
Let your time shine
Queens will play
We've all seen tomorrow
And there's truth to what they say
Demons may be hiding in our shadows
Let your time shine
Queens will playEmbed
