Wucan LyricsNo, you don't
Ever wanna get some place where you cannot believe
High up on the sun
The howlin' ones
High up on the sun
Flower, flower train
That won't bring you home
So we can come together
Yeah, we can come together
No, you don't
Ever wanna get some place where you cannot believe
High up on the sun
The haunted ones
Howlin' in your head
"Yeah, it's a broken scene"
That won't bring you home
But we could come together
Yeah, we could come together
No, you don't
Ever wanna get some place where you cannot believe
High up on the sun
The howlin' ones
High up on the sun
Flower, flower train
That won't bring you home
No, you don't
Ever wanna get some place where you cannot believeEmbed
