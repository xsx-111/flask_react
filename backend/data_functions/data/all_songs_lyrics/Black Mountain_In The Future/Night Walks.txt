Night Walks LyricsNight walks with me
And moon leaves me
Just enough light to see
And the shadow
My only company
And it moves
Just like me
And it walks
Just like me
Help me breathe
I can only read
What I see
Be kind to me
Cause the worst call now carefully
And they break up easily
And I woke up
In between
Night walks with me
And the moon leaves me
Just enough light to see
And the shadow
My only company
And it moves
Just like me
And it walks
Just like meEmbed
