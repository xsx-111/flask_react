Evil Ways LyricsWitchy child put a spell on me
And there ain't no way I can be freed
I've been imprisoned by your demon lust
Cursed by your black magic touch
It ain't easy but you've got to change your evil ways
Damn, you know I've burnt some sinner's fire
Chased the devil now I've seen the light
Ain't no escape from these evil ways
Sweet Lucifer, I must break free
It ain't easy but you've got to change your evil ways
Bless me lord from what I've done
Problem child ain't no devil's son
But the hounds of hell keep chasing me
Free the witch and let me be
It ain't easy but you've got to change your evil waysEmbed
