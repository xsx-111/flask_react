Stay Free LyricsAnd there comes a time
When you, when you aughta know
Well it's stormy outside
So quit, so quit all that runnin'
We're birds on the street
Oh the sweat in your pores
Oh stay free
Money, the sundown
Stiff on their knees
Oh beautiful ponies
So beautiful
They'll kill us all
Lets hide ourselfs together
Down under the stairs
Don't you leave
Oh hey what did they say
To get you so lonesome today?
Oh hey restless brown eyes
Don't you sound
And there comes a time
When you, when you aughta know
Oh there comes a time
So quit, so quit all that runnin'
We're fire in the sky
Oh the death at your door
Oh stay free1Embed
