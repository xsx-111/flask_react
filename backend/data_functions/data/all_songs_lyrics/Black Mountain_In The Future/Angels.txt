Angels LyricsCome on, lay your halo down
Well, angels, lay your arms around
Oh every city's seen the setting sun
Call 'em kicks, you know they just begun
So come on, lay your halo down
Oh, lady lady, don't let your worry please
Well you got something
And that ain't nothing to just let be
So why you kicking all those storms around?
And keeping fake down in the underground?
Oh come on, lay your halo down
So why you kicking all the rollies round?
And keeping fake down in the underground?
We won't call curtain
Still we know that you have found...
Come on, lay your halo down
Angels, lay your arms around
Oh every city's seen the setting sun
Call em kicks, you know they've just begun
Come on, lay your halo downEmbed
