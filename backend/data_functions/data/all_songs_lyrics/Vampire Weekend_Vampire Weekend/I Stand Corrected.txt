I Stand Corrected Lyrics
You've been checking on my facts
And I admit I have been lax
In double-screening what I say
It wasn't funny anyway

I stand
Corrected
I stand
Corrected

No one cares when you are wrong
But I've been at this far too long
To act like that when we should be
In perfect harmony

I stand
Corrected
I, oh, I stand
Corrected

Lord knows I haven't tried, I'll take my stand
One last time
Forget the protocol, I'll take your hand
Right in mine
I stand
Corrected
I, oh, I stand
