My Religion is You Lyrics
Yeah, Buddha’s cool
And you're no fool to believe anything
You need to believe in if Hare Krishna
Maybe it's the thing for you

Hey, that's cool
I don't need no religion
You're all I need
You're the thing I believe in

Nothing else is true
My religion is you
My religion is you
My religion is you

If being a Christian
Is your thing then
Own it friend
Don't phone it in

I don't need no religion
You're all I need
You're the thing I believe in
Nothing else is true
My religion is you
My religion is you
My religion is youEmbed
