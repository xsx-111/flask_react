Assassins of Youth Lyrics
Assassins of youth
Even when they tell the truth
Another part of you dies
The truth is a lie
Assassins of youth
Sugar let me look at you
They know still you're going on and on
You're already gone, gone

I was young yesterday
But now everything has changed after today
And I don't know what to do
Oh, my youngest self I, I miss you
Yes, I do

Assassins of youth
Even when they tell the truth
Another part of you dies
The truth is a lie
Assassins of youth
Sugar let me look at you
They know still you're going on and on
You're already gone, gone
I was young yesterday
But now everything has changed after today
And I don't know what to do
Oh, my youngest self I, I miss you
Yes, I do


In case I couldn't see
Talking while I'm me
How sad to think you're done
Even when you will die
I can't believe you died
I can't believe their lies
But sugar let me look at you
