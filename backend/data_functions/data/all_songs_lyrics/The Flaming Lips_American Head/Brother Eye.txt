Brother Eye Lyrics
Brother, I don't want you to die
Brother, can you live forever?
Brother, I don't wanna cry
Oh

Can you live forever?
Can you live forever?
Oh

You were born and the dark was changed
Like the stars into the night
Like the sun breaking through the sky
Brother, I, I

Brother, I can see into your eyes
And the way you look for something better
And you can try to act like it's forgotten
Oh, I see it way too often
I see it way too often
Oh

You were born and the dark was changed
Like the stars into the night
Like the sun breaking through the sky
Brother, I
Can you live forever?
Can you live forever?
Oh
Can you live forever?
Oh
Can you live forever?
