God and the Policeman Lyrics
If God and the policeman are
Watching over me
They both know what I have done
If God and the policeman are
Watching over you
They both know you're on the run
On the run, on the run

I did what I had to do
You did what anyone would have done
I did what I had to do
And now you have to be on the run
If God and the policeman are coming for me
If God and the policeman are coming for you
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

God will forgive me
God will forgive you
God please forgive meEmbed
