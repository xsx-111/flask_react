Will You Return / When You Come Down Lyrics
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?

Flower gun
Now you're on the run
Flower head
Now all your friends are dead
And their ghosts
Floating around your bed
Hear it said
Now all your friends are dead

Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Shooting star (Shooting star)
Crashing in your car (Crashing in your car)
What went wrong? (Singing songs)
Now all your friends are gone (All your friends are gone)
And they scream (And they scream)
Screaming from beyond (Screaming from beyond)
Hear their song (Hear their song)
Now all your friends are gone

Will you return?
Will you return?
Will you return?
Will you return?
Will you return?
Will you return?
Will you return?

Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Will you return?
Will you come down?
Screaming from beyond
Screaming from beyond
Screaming from beyond
Screaming from beyond
Screaming from beyondEmbed
