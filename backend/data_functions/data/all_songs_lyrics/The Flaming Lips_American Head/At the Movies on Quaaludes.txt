At the Movies on Quaaludes Lyrics
Thinking of you and me
At the movies
We're so high that we
Forget that we're alive
As we destroy our brains
'Til we believe we're dead
It's the American dream
In the American head

You and me
Me and you
You and me

You and me (You and me)
In a drug dream life (In a drug dream life)
Makes you think about if we (Makes you think about if we)
Ever get out alive
Someday we'll be rich (Someday we'll be rich)
We'll be famous fools (We'll be famous fools)
Spending all our dreams (Spending all our dreams)
'Cause we got nothing to lose

You and me
Me and you
You and me
Me and you
As we destroy our brains (Someday we'll be rich)
'Til we believe we're dead (We'll be famous fools)
It's the American dream (Spending all our dreams)
In the American head

You and me
Me and you
At the movies
