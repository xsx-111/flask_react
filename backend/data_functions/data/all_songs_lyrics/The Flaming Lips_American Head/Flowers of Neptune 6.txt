Flowers of Neptune 6 Lyrics
Yellow sun is going down so slow (Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow)
Doing acid and watching the light bugs glow (Glow, glow, glow, glow, glow)
Like tiny spaceships in a row (Row, row, row, row, row)
The coolest thing I'll ever know (Know, know, know, know)

John's still a greaser and Tommy's gone off to war
James got busted and doesn't give a fuck anymore

Oh my god, why is it them?
Oh my god, now it's me

Orange flowers bursting into bloom
Into Saturn, Jupiter, the moon

John's still a greaser and Tommy's gone off to war
James got busted and doesn't give a fuck anymore

Oh my god, why is it them?
Oh my god, now it's me
Oh my god, why is it them?
Oh my god, now it's me
Alright, cool1Embed
