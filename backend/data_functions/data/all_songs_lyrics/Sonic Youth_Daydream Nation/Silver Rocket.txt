Silver Rocket Lyrics
Snake in it, jack into the wall
TV amp on fire blowing in the hall
Gun your sled, close your peeping toms
Turbo organizer cranking on the knob

You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket

Hit the power, psycho helmets on
You got to splice your halo, take it to a moon
Nymphoid clamor fueling up the hammer
You got to fake out the robot and pulse up the zoom

You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocket

Can't forget the flashing
Can't forget the smashing
The sending and the bending
The atmosphere re-entry
You gotta have the time
Got another in your mind
Got your heart injected
And you got your soul aligned
You got it
Yeah, ride your silver rocket
Can't stop it
Burnin' hole in your pocketEmbed
