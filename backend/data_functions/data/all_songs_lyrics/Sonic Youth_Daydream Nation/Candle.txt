Candle Lyrics
I see a dog star jiving like he's magic snatching
It keeps me up awake, a crystal cracking
I can't wait, I can't stay a candle
Gotta change my mind before it burns out

I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop

I see a falling snowgirl walking Broadway
Turns the corner at 14th and I know there's no way
It's alright, it's a lighted candle
And I know she'll be okay by someday

I'm the cocker on the rock
Humming bells start chiming in your electric clock

It's safe to say, candle
Tonight's the day, candle
It's alright now, candle
The wind's away, candle
Never thought I'd see a dog star falling
I'm the cocker on the rock
Wind is whipping through my stupid mop3Embed
