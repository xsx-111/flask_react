Boogie Shoes Lyrics
Girl, to be with you is my favorite thing, yeah
And I can't wait 'til I see you again, yeah, yeah

I wanna put on my, my, my, my, my
Boogie shoes just to boogie with you, yeah
I wanna put on my, my, my, my, my
Boogie shoes just to boogie with you

I want do it 'til the sun comes up, oh yeah
And I want to do it 'til I can't get enough, yeah yeah
 
I wanna put on my, my, my, my, my
Boogie shoes just to boogie with you, yeah
I wanna put on my, my, my, my, my
Boogie shoes just to boogie with you

I wanna put on my, my, my, my, my
Boogie shoes just to boogie with you, yeahEmbed
