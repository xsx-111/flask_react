Disco Inferno Lyrics
(Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn)
*Burning*

To my surprise - listen - one hundred stories high
People getting loose y'all, getting down on the roof, do ya hear?
The funk was flaming, out of control
It was so entertaining, when the boogie started to explode

I heard somebody say
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn the mother down
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno, yeah
(Burn, baby, burn) burn the mother down
*Burning*

Satisfaction (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Came in the chain reaction (Burning)
I couldn't get enough, 'till I had to self-destruct (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
The heat was on, rising to the top, mmh
Everybody's going strong (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down, y'all
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno, yeah
(Burn, baby, burn) Mother down
*Burning*

(Up above my head, I hear music in the air)
I hear music
(That makes me know there's somebody somewhere)

Satisfaction, came in a chain reaction, do ya hear?
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct, mmh
The heat was on, rising to the top, mmh
Everybody's going strong, that is when my spark got hot

I heard somebody say
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno, yeah
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn the mother down, get it
(Burn, baby, burn) Ahh-hey
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn the mother down
(Burn, baby, burn) Disco inferno
(Burn, baby, burn) Burn that mother down
(Burning)
Ow, uh
(Just can't stop
When my spark gets hot)
(When my spark gets hot)


(Burning, burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Burning, burning, burning, burning)

I wanted you to understand what I'm talking about
I'm not talking about burning down a building
It's coming from the soul
(Just can't stop)
Soul funk
(When my spark gets hot)
Burning in my soul
Just can't stop
Ow
(When my spark gets hot)
Now, listen
Don't you rescue me
(Just can't stop)
Let my spirit burn free
(When my spark gets hot)
Don't you rescue me, no
Just can't stop
Let my spirit burn free
(When my spark gets hot)
Everybody say ow
Ow
Say ow
Ow
You feel the spirit tonight
Ow
Disco funk
Ow
Come here on the floor, ugh
Let's rock some more, ugh

Burning, Burning

Burning, Burning
Let the good times roll
Burning, Burning
Aw, yeah
Burning, Burning
Hah, ya know I feel alright?
Burning
Feel pretty good, y'all
Burning
People getting loose, mmh
Burning
Getting down on the groove
Burning
The flame is higher, mmh
Burning

Burning
Alright
Burning
Ah, burn
Burning
I can't get enough
Burning
I want some more
Burning

Burning

Burning in the soul, y'all

When my spark gets hot)
Just can't stop
