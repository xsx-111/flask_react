Heart Attack LyricsYou giving me a heart attack
Girl I want you back
I just can't stand it no more
You giving me a heart attack
Girl I want you back
My heart can't take it no more
Do you know how it feels
When the pain feels like it could kill
It just knocks you to the floor
She screams your name like shes next door
It gets u down to your knees
Got me screaming baby come on please
Well I, promised I was talkin to myself
Looking for love from somebody else
But then I figured out that's its not you
My heart drops to my shoes
See I heard you not coming back from some other cat
You giving me a heart attack
Girl I want you back
I just can't stand it no more
You giving me a heart attack
Girl I want you back
My heart can't take it no moreEmbed
