Go To Hell Lyrics
Here's the situation, yes, the devil knows me well
See, I'm trying to do my best not to go to hell
I'm counting all my blessings as I walk the narrow road
Victory is near, that's what I've been told
I can feel it getting closer, closer every day
I wanna be a warrior of everything I say
There's trials in the valley, take me upstream
I need to feel this water rolling down over me
Rolling down over me

I can see my name written across the sky
Ravens started flying, I saw tears in their eyes
There was fires in the mountains and storms in the sea
Winds in the valley, rushing into me
Knock and it will open, seek and you'll be fine
You're just a flower and the seed is your mind (Seed is your mind)
Clouds will bring us water and the sun will bring us heat
But we have the power moving from sea to sea
Moving from sea to sea

Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together
(Let it bring us together, let it bring us together)
Let love bring us together
(We need more love, we need more love in the world today)
Let love bring us together, together
(Let it bring, let it bring all of us together)
Let love bring us together
(Somebody walk with me)
Let love bring us together, together
(Walk with me, walk with me quickly, yeah yeah yeah)
Let love bring us together
(Yeah yeah yeah, let love bring us together, yeah yeah, I'm going)
Let love bring us together, together
Let love bring us together
(Let love bring us together)
Let love bring us together, together
(More love everywhere, all around the world)
Let love bring us together
Let love bring us together, together
(Let love bring us, bring us together)Embed
