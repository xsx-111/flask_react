Day Dreams Lyrics
Have you ever wanted to
Buy someone you love somethin'
But you couldn't afford it
But you just bought it anyway?
You know how that go

Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh
Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, uh huh
When the price ain't right
And everything ain't lookin' right
But you still want it all, uh huh
This line is long but still I ponder
This here check won't last 'til October
But nothin' more special than bringin' my gifts to you

Oh, I'm livin' on daydreams (Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford (Livin' on daydreams)
Uh huh (Livin' on daydreams)
Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford (Livin' on daydreams)
Uh huh (Livin' on daydreams)
When the sun comes out I find myself
Spendin' money on foolish necessities, mhm
This woman I got is worth a lot
But man, she sure hits the spot
Nothin' more special than bringin' them gifts to you, ooh wee
I'm livin' on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford (Livin' on daydreams)
Uh huh (Livin' on daydreams)
Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
I'm gonna buy me somethin' I can't afford (Livin' on daydreams)
Uh huh (Livin' on daydreams)
Take it home, take it home
Ooh, alright, a little bit of Randolph
Oh oh oh

Yes, I'm livin' on daydreams
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, yes, I am
Livin' on daydreams
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford, like I said
When the sun comes out I find myself
Spendin' money on foolish necessities, uh huh
See uh, this woman I got is worth a lot
But man she sure hits the spot
Nothin' more special than bringin' them gifts to you

Yeah, I'm livin' on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
Gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford
I'm livin' on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
I'm gon' buy me somethin' I can't afford
With bad credit and all, baby
I'm livin' on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
I'm gonna buy me somethin' I can't afford
Even if I have to take it back next month
I'm livin' on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
Gonna buy me somethin' I can't afford
Even if I have to borrow from my other girlfriend, ha
I'm living on daydreams
(Livin' on daydreams, livin' on daydreams)
Gonna buy me somethin' I can't afford
Just for you, it makes me feel good (Livin' on daydreams)
Whenever I buy somethin' 'specially for you (Livin' on daydreams)
It makes me feel good (Livin' on daydreams), yes, it does
(Livin' on daydreams)
I'm livin' on daydreams
Yes, I am, livin' on daydreams (Livin' on daydreams)
It's like the sunshine (Livin' on daydreams)
Makes me feel good, alrightEmbed
