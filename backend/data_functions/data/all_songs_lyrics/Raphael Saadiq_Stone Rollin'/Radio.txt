Radio LyricsI met this girl named Radio
Said her signal was low
She wasn't gettin' my sound
She kept the volume down
I told her turn up the bass, bass
And then she kissed me in my face, face, face
I told her I had a girl
That meant the world to me
She just looked me up and down
Was her name R&B?
Started pullin' off her dress
Started lickin' on my chest, chest, chest
I tried to move away
She found me the next day
I tried to move away
She found me the very next day
I tried to move away
Found me the next day, ay, ay
See that girl is so bad
She's rollin', smokin' and makin' cash
See that girl is so bad
She's rollin', smokin' and makin' cash
See that girl is so bad
She's rollin', smokin' and makin' cash, ay, ay
She knows I like it like that
She knows exactly where is that
She knows I like it like that
That girl is blowin' my mind
She knows I like it like that, yeah
She knows exactly where is that
Oh, oh, oh, you got me doin'
Somethin' I didn't wanna do, yeah
I'm stone rollin', baby
Throwing the dice on the table with you, babe
I didn't want to go there
Call me in a month or two, yeah
I know you really want a baby
I think I want one too
But I am just not sure
If I want it with you
You see, every time we touch
I take a chances of a fool
Stone rollin', darlin'
Stone rollin', darlin'
Stone rollin', darlin'
Stone rollin', darlin'
Stone rollin', darlin'
I know I'm taking the chances of a fool
Stone rollin', baby
Stone rollin', baby
Stone rollin', baby
Stone rollin', baby
Stone rollin', baby
I'm taking the chances of a fool
Stone, stone, stoneEmbed
