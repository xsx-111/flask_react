Over You Lyrics
Next time I see you, I just might commit a crime
I've fallen in love far too many times
You know that I love you, you got what I need
Your kiss is so deep, it knocks me to my knees
Oh!
Next time I see you, I'm not letting you get away
I'm locking you up, and making love all day
Give you good lovin', mix it up good
Give you great wine, and take you to the...oh!

Girl, everything is okay
When you kiss me that way
Oh!
Oh!
Say it ain't so!
Don't stop, just go! (Go!)

I never go to sleep without calling you
It's all in my head, it's amazing the things you do
When I hear your voice, it's a sunny delight
'Cause you ease my pain, on a Friday night
So why don't we do it, baby? Kiss and kiss again
I know it's free to lose, but it costs when you want to win
You know it's true, yeah, I'm your fool
And I just can't seem to get over...
You-hoo-hoo
Oh-oh-oh-over
You-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Oh-over
You-hoo
You
You-hoo
You
You-hoo
You
You-hoo
You

Girl, everything is okay
When you kiss me that way
Oh! (Oh!)
Oh! (Oh!)
Say it ain't so!
Don't stop, just go! (Go!)Embed
