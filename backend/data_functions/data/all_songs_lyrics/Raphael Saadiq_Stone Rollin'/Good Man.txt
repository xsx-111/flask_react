Good Man Lyrics
I'm a good man, food on the table
Working two jobs, ready, willing and able, check
Good man, up having fun
Got no kids and I love the Lord, check
Good man, I'm monogamous
Never did time—well, maybe just once, check
Good man, and I puts it down
Wanna say it twice, well, I puts it down, check

How could you ever walk away
After all I've done for you?
I feel like there's a knife in my back, babe
You might as well put it all the way through
Good man

I'm a good man, food on the table
Working two jobs, ready, willing and able, check
Good man, up having fun
Got no kids and I love the Lord, check
Good man, I'm monogamous
Never did time—well, maybe just once, check
Good man, and I puts it down
Wanna say it twice, well, I puts it down, check
You watched them handcuff me, lady
And walk me through my own home
I never been so humiliated
I don't think that I deserved this from you
Good man

I'm a good man, food on the table
Working two jobs, ready, willing and able, check
Good man, up having fun
Got no kids and I love the Lord, check
Good man, I'm monogamous
Never did time—well, maybe just once, check
Good man, and I puts it down
Wanna say it twice, well, I puts it down, check

Right now I'm better
(What was I going through?)
Better than ever
(That was the hardest time of my life)
So much better now
(But I do understand you gotta go through it to get to you)
My life is better, my love is greater
(But I just don't think I'd be going through this with you)
My love is greater
So much better now
(But I'm so much better now)
Without you (Let the horns blow)
I never felt so good inside, without you
I never felt so good inside
(I'm a good man)
How could you just get up and walk away?
See, but when things got rough
You quickly ran in to trade me, somebody save me
(I'm a good man)
There's one thing I know
So I'm gonna tell you that I'm a good man, thanks to you
Good man...good man...good man...good man2Embed
