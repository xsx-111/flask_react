Three Headed Woman Lyrics
And I had one of those dreams
You were a three headed woman
You were sleeping with my best friend
And I woke up in a sweat
And I've been ripping off my skin
To see what's on the inside, to see what's going on

Oh, but I hate you sometimes
For making me feel the way I feel, feel, feel
'Cause the love that keeps me sane
Is killing me all the same
It's killing me, it's killing me, I'm done...

And it's just one of those days that I
I can't stop thinking about you
I'm as heavy as my hangover is heat
And I woke up in a sweat
And I've been wanting to explain
That I'm aware of consequence
And I'm aware of pain now, too

Oh, but I hate you sometimes
For making me feel the way I feel, feel, feel
'Cause the love that keeps me sane
Is killing me all the same
Oh, and I don't see the point now
In dragging ourselves through all that shame, shame, shame
No, I ain't no fucking traitor
I'm hurting all the same
I'm sorry for whatever I have done...
Now I walk, I walk alone
And your face follows where I go
But I won't walk that way you know
A hurt that only makes you grow
It tears a hole right through you
And I'll forever know...Embed
