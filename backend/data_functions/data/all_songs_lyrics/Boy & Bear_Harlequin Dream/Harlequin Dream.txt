Harlequin Dream Lyrics
And I've been worried for a while now
Cause you don't look the same
How the devil takes his toll
When you go walking through that flame
And I'm not saying it's been easy
But you know all too well
Oh, you cannot replace the space
Your spirit had once held

So we run through the jungle
And I can feel the rhythm of war
You see, I'm fighting
But I just can't fight anymore
I'm in awe...

So we'll give ourselves to the harlequin dream
Giving over all our friends and our family
And we'll say goodbye to the world that we love
For I can no longer deny my blood

And now you're taking on a kingdom
I'm ravenous for more
Oh, an appetite so beautiful
But vacant to its core
And I've been living on my instincts
So you better run, you better keep moving along
For it seems I have been wandering
Far too long

So we run through the jungle
And I can feel the rhythm of war
You see, I'm fighting
But I just can't fight anymore
I'm in awe...

So we'll give ourselves to the harlequin dream
Giving over all our friends and our family
And we'll say goodbye to the world that we love
For I can no longer deny my blood
