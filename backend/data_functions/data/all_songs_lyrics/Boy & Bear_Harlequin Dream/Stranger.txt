Stranger Lyrics
Old man, was it worth it?
Was it all that it seemed?
Did you ever find the carcass of your dreams?
Oh, you must know I was young
The fear I had not yet outrun
Oh, I was never meant to hurt you
But I do, oh, I do, oh

It's got a hold of me
And it keeps coming away

And you were always looking at me
From afar, I can't change, I'm a stranger to my nature
Would you love me anyway, If my head don't talk right
Don't let me down, old man

Through the swollen eyes of your Ritalin
It's like a stranger's standing over me
Some kind of faceless beast that watches as I sleep
Now, there's a hard lump in my throat
And all the best times that you've ever known
Are all just fading off the back of my sanity
Oh please, I made you weep

It's got a hold of me
And it keeps coming away

But you were always looking at me
From afar, oh, I'm in chains, I'm a stranger to my nature
Would you love me anyway, If my head don't talk right
Don't let me down, old man

I want it back
I left the seeds of a memory
And I wonder if I've come too farEmbed
