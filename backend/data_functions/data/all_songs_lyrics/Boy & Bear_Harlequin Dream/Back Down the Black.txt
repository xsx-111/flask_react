Back Down the Black Lyrics
'Cause you're hurting
I can tell by the way that you move
You got your head on your chest
And your chest in your mouth, you don't look so good
There'll be change
Cause this one's too big not to see
But brother, you're scared and I'm scared
When you're scared, 'cause you ain't supposed to be

So I'll scream out loud, 'Won't you get out my way?'

'Cause I got the animal
I've got the beast on a leash these days
So you don't go wandering back down the black
To that awful place
And help
Is well on its way
You taught me too much to sit back
And watch you this way
Just to watch you this way
There's a light sound that comes around
Like a raven in flight
A shivering child as the
Car windows left open overnight
And I watched it light up the moon again
And I watched it all disappear
Oh, tether of life won't you
Shepherd me home again, dear

So I'll scream out loud, 'Won't you get out my way?'

'Cause help
Is well on its way
Well, you taught me too much to sit back
And watch you this way
And I've been back down the black now, before
And I won't watch you this way
No, I won't watch you this way

And oh, oh, my legs don't work
And my limbs all hurt
As my body aches to take the weight
That's been thrown down on top of you
Like you would do, too
And oh, oh, my legs don't work
And my limbs all hurt
As my body aches to take the weight
That's been thrown down on top of you
Like you would do, too
And oh, oh, my legs don't work
And my limbs all hurt
As my body aches to take the weight
That's been thrown down on top of you
Like you would do, too
And oh, oh, my legs don't work
And my limbs all hurt...4Embed
