End of the Line Lyrics
The end of the line
Calamity at first sight
Now, the man in me don't walk right
Just like a pebble in my shoe
But you were a wanderer
And a competent one at that
So it caught me by surprise, this vulnerability
That I never thought I had

But you tried so hard to say, oh
Everything you wanted to
And with an aching tongue
Oh, you spat out at the world, now not of words
But of a pearl that had belonged to her...

So I went back to the country
Where the air was mild and sweet
I was in need of some reprieve and intermission
Oh, to gather up my things and to get back upon my feet
But I can't say I've got the answers
For it's always shades of grey
But there's a warmth in the air in mid-September
And its enough across my face just to remind me that I'm well upon my way
And I feel the ease
Man, I feel it tingle in my toes
How funny are the way that these memories do grow
Into some old French film in black-and-white
And I know the ropes
Because, you see, I've said goodbye to some lovers
Fleshed out and tied to each other
By that invisible string; it tangles me

And when that morning came up fast, well it
Broke the fever square upon its back
And finally I felt just like I should
Oh, the blood under my fingers warm the clearing
Of a two-month storm, now done...

So I went back to the country
Where the air, now bitter sweet
And subtle is the change of my indifference
Oh, but strange is how the solitude can leave a man complete
And I can't wait 'till the morning
Be it sunshine, hail, or snow
See, I do not believe in superstition
But somewhere amongst this mess, I may have found some happiness to call my own
Oh, and time is a healer
Time is a friend of mine
In time, if you feel it
Would you be a friend of mine?
Oh, I hope you're a friend of mine...Embed
