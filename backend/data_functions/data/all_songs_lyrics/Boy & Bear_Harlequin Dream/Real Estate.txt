Real Estate Lyrics
Such a fool
I've been only running scared
I use my conscience
As a way to get through
While all my friends
Were drifting in the glow
Of love lights and tangerine
All my fortunes came true

But oh, I've had something on my mind these days
It's cornered me this time
But I can't say it in front of you
So, maybe I'm just not that guy
God only knows I've tried

I'm your feather made of stone
In the hat you had forgotten
You'll be swimming all alone
When it drags you to the bottom of the ocean floor

Flowing down
Three rows of fine wine and savouries
Conversation to skittle my view
But I'm so tired
Of talking 'bout of the price of real estate
You better head back down
To where you came through

And oh, I've got something on my mind these days
It's warning me this time
See, it don't mean much when you're alone
So, I guess I'm gonna take my time
I'll whistle and I'll whine

For the weight of something more
I'll tear it up in pieces
'Til my hands are red and raw
'Til it drags me to the bottom of the ocean floorEmbed
