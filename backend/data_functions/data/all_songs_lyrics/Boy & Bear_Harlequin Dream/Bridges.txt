Bridges Lyrics
Get up and dance, girl
I'm in a rock and roll band
That makes me more of a man
Didn't you know?
'Cause I can hardly stand
'Cause I'm drunk and I'm easy
But I'm in need of your body
And nothing more

It's up to you now, honey
So what am I dreaming of now?
I got the best now, honey
So what am I dreaming of now?

And all my friends think I'm selfish
Some kind of idiot dreamer
I'm burning bridges like bong hits, baby
I'm in no mood to try anymore

It's up to you now, honey
So what am I dreaming of now?
White picket fence now, honey
But what are you dreaming of now?
Another cocaine footprint
But what are you dreaming of now?
I've had the best now, honey
So what am I dreaming of now?

Oh, and I need to be wanted
'Cause my 'kingdom come'
Is a-coming undone...

It's up to you now, honey
So what am I dreaming of now?
White picket fence now, honey
So what am I dreaming of now?
Another cocaine footprint
But what are you dreaming of now?
I've had the best now, honey
So what do I need of you now?

So what am I dreaming of now?
So what am I dreaming of now?Embed
