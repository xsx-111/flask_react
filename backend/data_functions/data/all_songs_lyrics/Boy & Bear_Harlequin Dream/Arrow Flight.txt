Arrow Flight Lyrics
I've done all my thinking
You got me in a spin
Rolled out and sleeping
But I belong here, basking in the autumn sun
For this moment's fleeting
But maybe that's okay
It's proof I'm healing
I'm an anchor and I'm weighing on your mind

Oh, it's true, oh, you met me in the arrow flight
Like a streamer, bursting in the open night
And I'm feeling that things are gonna be alright
My friend, but I wanna go home
I'm gonna go home

Count all your pennies
You put 'em in a line
Eyes growing heavy
Won't your rest your weary warmth on mine
And now I keep moving
A second at a time
No point in losing you
Oh, I'll make you a bed of roses just make it home tonight
And it's true, you met me in the arrow flight
Like a streamer bursting through the open night
And I'm feeling that things are gonna be alright
My friend, just wanna go home

And all my reasons
They move, but you always remained there
Out of love, out of love
And all my reasons
They move, but you always remain, dear
Out of love, out of loveEmbed
