Southern Sun Lyrics
In all you've seen, what was it that came down on me that night?
A conjuring; I held on to that moment and lie just to make it alive

I stood out there in the covering
In the baskings of a holy night
And I was lucid and conscious
And hovering like a firefly
My mind stretched out on the canopy
It put its arms out slow
And I heard the whispers of silence
Floating down from the radio

So come on, come on, I'm ready now
I got that feeling, honey, like I'm ready to roll
You see, I'm not gonna wait till the end of me
'Cause I got the burning fire in the bed of my soul

I saw the light from a kettle gun
Sixteen days under a southern sun
And there were times when I thought that
I wouldn't mind it if I lost my mind out there
You wouldn't believe me if I told you so
The things I saw, were enough to make the man in me a man of me
Mm, make a man of me...

So come on, come on, I'm ready now
Go get your things out, honey, let's get ready to roll
Oh, I can feel a wave coming over me
I've been waiting for this day too long just to let it all go

As a child, I was wonder eyed
At the thought that I might know
A life in the ecstasy of rock n' roll, oh
Woah-oh, I'm not taking it slow, oh, oh
I'm an arrow in a bow, oh, oh
You think that I don't know, oh, oh
What it is that makes it glow, oh, oh...
