Black Cadillac LyricsRosanne, baby come on
It was a black Cadillac drove you away
Everybody's talkin', but they don't have much to say
There was a black sky of rain, none of it fell
One of us gets to go to heaven, one has to stay here in hell
Now it's a lonely world
Guess it always was
Minus you and minus blood
My blood
It was a black Cadillac like one you used to drive
You were always rollin', but those wheels burn up your life
Oh, it's a black heart of pain that I'm wearin', suits me just fine
Oh, there was nothin' I could do for you when you were still alive
Yeah, it's a lonely world
Just a numbers game
Well, a hundred years
Will find me feelin' just the same
Yeah, it's a lonely world
I guess it always was
Minus you and minus blood
My bloodEmbed
