Like a Wave LyricsMy memory is filling with smoke
Such a relief not to know
Except for the body and soul
There's nothing here I want to own
But I gave my love and it rolls like a wave
Back through my history on past the grave
My taxi is waiting outside
Sure we'll begin right on time
Now you are still writing your lines
But I will not open my eyes
But I gave my love and it rolls like a wave
Back through my history on past the grave
But I gave my love and it rolls like a wave
Back through my history on past the graveEmbed
