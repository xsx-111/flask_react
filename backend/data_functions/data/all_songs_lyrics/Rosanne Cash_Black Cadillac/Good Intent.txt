Good Intent LyricsI sailed in on the good intent with all intentions clear
A man without a mystery, a vision brought me here
The ocean gave me room to roam, but the shore is calling out
So I will marry, build a home, and see what that's about
Children came by dozens, then drifting south like rain
I worked the soil, I used the gun, the waves have to turned to grain
I tried to love this Arkansas with black and bleeding hands
But I will not survive this life, but I'll become a man
My brother sold my mother's house, I never shed a tear
I could watch the world in smoke, there's nothin' for me here
I've seen behind the darkened vail, it's all I want to know
So I'll sail off on the good intent to my true happy home
Yes, I'll sail off on the good intent, never more to roamEmbed
