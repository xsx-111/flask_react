World Without Sound LyricsI wish I was a Christian, I knew what to believe
I could learn a lot of rules to put my mind at ease
I wish I had the money to live just like a queen
With Demerols and Cashmere and every little thing
I wish the ones who loved me would never go away
They had to have my company every single day
But who do I believe in this world without sound?
Who do I believe once they put you in the ground?
Who do I believe when the night's fallin' down?
I wish I lived in Paris and dreamed in French each night
And had a dozen children and raised them up just right
I wish I was John Lennon, free as a bird
And all of you who sit and stare and hang on my every word
I wish I had the future tied up with a string
Then I would never feel the blows the revolution brings
But who do I believe in this world without sound?
Who do I believe once they put you in the ground?
Who do I believe when the night's fallin' down?
I wish I was a Christian, but I cannot believe
'Cause no one in the Bible craves my companyEmbed
