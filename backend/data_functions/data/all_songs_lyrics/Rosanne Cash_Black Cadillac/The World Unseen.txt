The World Unseen LyricsI'm the sparrow on the roof
I'm the list of everyone I have to lose
I'm the rainbow in the dirt
I am who I was and how much I can hurt
So I will look for you in stories of the kings
Westward leading, still proceeding to the world unseen
I'm the mirror in the hall
From your empty room, I can hear it fall
Now that we must live apart
I have a lock of hair and one-half of my heart
So I will look for you between the grooves of songs we sing
Westward leading, still proceeding to the world unseen
There are no gifts that will be found
Wrapped in winter, laid beneath the ground
You must be somewhere in the stars
'Cause from a distance comes the sound of your guitar
And I will look for you in Memphis and the miles between
I will look for you in morphine and in dreams
I will look for you in the rhythm of my bloodstream
Westward leading, still proceeding to the world unseenEmbed
