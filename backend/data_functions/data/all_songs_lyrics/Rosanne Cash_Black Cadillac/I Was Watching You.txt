I Was Watching You LyricsHeadlights on a Texas road
Hank Williams on the radio
Church wedding, they spent all they had
Now the deal is done to become Mom and Dad
And I was watching you from above
'Cause long before life, there was love
See those little girls dressed like china dolls
All for one, then one by one, they fall
High on a hill while the world passes by
You never came back, but I know you tried
'Cause I was watching you from above
When it all falls apart, there is love
All those years to prove how much I care
I didn't know it, but you were always there
Till September when you slipped away
In the middle of my life on the longest day
Now I hear you say "I'll be watching you from above"
'Cause long after life, there is love
Baby, I'll be watching you from above
Long after life, there is loveEmbed
