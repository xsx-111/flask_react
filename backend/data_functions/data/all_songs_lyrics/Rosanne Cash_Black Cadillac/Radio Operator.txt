Radio Operator LyricsRadio operator in a tiny foreign room
We can hear you now and later
Calling out and coming through
Radio operator, you're a voice so far from home
With a signal like a heartbeat
Not afraid, but so alone
Where are the messages for me?
The secret code for parts unknown
I'll ride the signal to the world
And to the girl in San Antone
Radio operator, do you ever think of me?
'Cause I'm a gleam on some horizon
Just too far away to see
Radio operator, there are still messages to send
From the future, from the present
And it never has to end
Where are the messages for me?
The secret code for parts unknown
I'll ride the signal to the world
And to the girl in San Antone
Radio operator, I am calling like a friend
From my future, from your memory
And it never has to end
This message will not endEmbed
