Dreams Are Not My Home LyricsThe waves are breaking on the wall
The queen of roses spreads her arms to fly, she falls
If I had wings, I'd cut them down
Live without these dreams so I could learn to love the ground
'Cause I wanna live inside the world
I wanna act like a real girl
I wanna know I'm not alone
And the dreams are not my home
The future is like a ringing bell
The road to good intentions wanders all the way through hell
The note that hangs in the gilded hall
The clanging of my empty rooms, I could learn to love them all
'Cause I wanna live inside the world
I wanna act like a real girl
I wanna know I'm not alone
And the dreams are not my home
The waves are breaking like they do
The spires of churches are the last place to enjoy the view
If I had wings, I'd use them now
I could follow you, then hope someone would pull me down
'Cause I wanna live inside the world
I wanna act like a real girl
I wanna know I'm not alone
And the dreams are not my
Dreams are not my
Dreams are not my home
