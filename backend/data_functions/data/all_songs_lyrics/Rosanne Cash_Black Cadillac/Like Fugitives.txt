Like Fugitives LyricsThe priest is prayin' for your soul
And the doctor for your heart
Someone tell me how to live
Now that we must live apart
Once we had a mother
But that's all over now
So wish her well and let her go
Just as soon as you know how
It's a strange new world we live in
Where the church leads you to hell
And the lawyers get the money
For the lives they divide and sell
And the only truth believed in
Is the one upon the screen
So we live our lives like fugitives
And we were born to live like queens
Once we all were daughters
Now we'll never hear thy name
I never think I could have learned
I just turned into the game
Don't send me no more letters
With your ignorance and rage
I don't want your tired religion
I am not a soul you need to save
It's a strange new world we live in
Where the church leads you to hell
And the lawyers get the money
For the lives they divide and sell
It's a strange new world we live in
Where the church sends you to hell
And the lawyers get the money
For the lives they divide and sell
And the only truth believed in
Is the one upon the screen
So we live our lives like fugitives
And we were born to live like queensEmbed
