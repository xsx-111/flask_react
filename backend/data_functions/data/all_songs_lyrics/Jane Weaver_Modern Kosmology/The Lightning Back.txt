The Lightning Back LyricsI love the way
You thrill me again
I love the way that
Were nothing then friends
And I'll be stupid
As you want me to
And I'll be stupid
As you want me to
And so they say that
I'm never the same
Incorporated
But I never changed
It's useless telling you
It's not today
Can I be stupid
Why is it not the same?
I love the way
That it's just us again
I'm concentrating
On being the same
So times not wasted
As you want it to
And I'll be used to yes
You want me to
It's my intention
That I crossed the new dimension
And the stars were all around me and
I didn't see the lightning
It's my intention
That I crossed the new dimension
And the stars where all around me and
Didn't see the lightningEmbed
