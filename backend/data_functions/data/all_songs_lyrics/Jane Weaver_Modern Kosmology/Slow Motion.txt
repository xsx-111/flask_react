Slow Motion LyricsIn this landscape we are fading
Shiny particles and shadings
Once continuous and clear through the skies
I always try to say it carefully
When language Isn't breezy that
We need some new equation for us now
Lets go outside
When it doesn't feel right
We can disappear
I disappear
Disappear
You really would
When it doesn't feel right
We can disappear
I disappear
Disappear
I want to feel the life we loved in the sun
Slow motion
And we do what we want to do
We'll never give up
Slow motion
And we do, and we do, and we do, and we do
Lets get together
We keep changing
Sometimes everything's amazing
Then the silence reminds us we are lost
Stop listening to other people whose agenda doesn't seem good
Then exception is the only thing we've got
Lets go outside
When it doesn't feel right
We can disappear
I disappear
Disappear
You really would
When it doesn't feel right
I can disappear
I disappear
Disappear
I want to feel the life we loved in the sun
Slow motion
And we do what we want to do
We'll never give up
Slow motion
And we do, and we do and we do
And we do, and we do and we do
Let's get together
We keep changing
Sometimes everything's amazing
And the silence reminds we are lost
Stop listening to other people whose agenda doesn't seem good
Then exception is the only thing
The only thing that we have gotEmbed
