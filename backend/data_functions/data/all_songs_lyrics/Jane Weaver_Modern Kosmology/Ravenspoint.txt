Ravenspoint LyricsTo dust
To dust
To dust
To dust
We're on the way to dust
And though it hurts my eyes
Not seeing your blue skies maybe?
And so awake it seems
It’s easy for you now
To see me in these tied up ways
For you
Now
Before the day is ours
You know it breaks my heart
And shivers down my backbone maybe
And though it's strange for you
It's easier to fly
And move around the room
Another dream
Another wall
Another dream
Another wall
Add to the tension
Another spectrum
Add to the tension
The spectrum
Another lie
We’re on our way to dust
We're on our way to dust
We're on our way to dust
We're on our way to dust
What is the fuss on our way to dust
We're on our way to dust
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyesEmbed
