Did You See Butterflies? LyricsI've been trying to find another map
For this love
For this love
Where the destinations still intact
To the sun
To the sun
And the patterns are confusing me
To this love
Don't be alone
Did you see
Butterflies
On the map
Changing light?
Images
Paradigm
Never fade
Fossilised
I've been trying to find another map
For this love
For this loveEmbed
