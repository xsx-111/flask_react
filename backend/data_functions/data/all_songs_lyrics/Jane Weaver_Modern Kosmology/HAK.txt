HAK LyricsThe salt of the earth
What is your impression?
The disparate lines
Cords into connections
The language we speak
Coded by the subjects
The spectral lines
I'm not your possession
I can't tell you where you're going
I can't tell I can't tell
I can't tell you where you're going
I can't tell I can't tell
Find the pattern where you're going
I can tell you I can tell you
Find the pattern where you're going
I can tell you I can tell you
Leave me by the beach
Moulded on the surface
Corroding the rocks
Fossilised and sun blessed
I can't tell you where you're going
I can't tell I can't tell
I can't tell you where you're going
I can't tell I can't tell
Find the pattern where you're going
I can tell you I can tell you
Find the pattern where you're going
I can tell you I can tell youEmbed
