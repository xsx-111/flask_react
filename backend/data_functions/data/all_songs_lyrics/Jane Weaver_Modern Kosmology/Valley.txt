Valley LyricsDo you think about the day?
The distance cloud would stay
So the colours we can see
Still warm in summer streams
When rocks are changing shape
The valley moves again
You gave the light to me
Complete the unity
I'm not that used to low
I'm just going off the threads
It's not that you would notice
Out of time again
I'm not that used to low
I'm just going off the threads
It's not that you would notice
Out of time again
Oh, meet me on the beach
By the magnetic sea?
To catch the butterflies
Suspend them in this time
And they will never fade
Or skeletons decay
And they won't make a sound
The threads are hanging down
I'm not that used to low
I'm just going off the threads
It's not that you would notice
Out of time again
I'm not that used to low
I'm just going off the threads
It's not that you would notice
Out of time again
Can I describe today?
And it will never fade
And they won't make a sound
The valleys calling now
Oh where should we land how?1Embed
