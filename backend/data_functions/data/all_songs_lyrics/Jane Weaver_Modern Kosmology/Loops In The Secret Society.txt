Loops In The Secret Society LyricsI was scared
I could hear a voice above
Chimes for you always
It's so good when
Energy is passing round
Unity, forming
Dynamic always
Dynamic always
I can see
Geometric big symbols
Shapes of things
Landscapes
This strange fruit
Curious botanicals
Science freaks always
I feel the fire fire fire
Is this in my soul
Or is it love love love
Does my blood run cold?
I couldn't move move move
When the feeling comes
It's so electro magnetic
Wheres the ceiling gone?
I feel the fire fire fire
Is this in my soul
Or is it love love love
Does my blood run cold?
I couldn't move move move
When the feeling comes
It's so electro magnetic
Wheres the ceiling gone?Embed
