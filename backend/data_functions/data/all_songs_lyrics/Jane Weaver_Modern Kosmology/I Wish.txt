I Wish LyricsAre you dreaming of something?
Are you dreaming of something that I don't know?
Cause you really did nothing
Cause you really did nothing to make it go
I've got a line to keep me straight
And a rhythm to match
To this undisputed mood
Never too much
And never too late
Let the rhythm do it all
Before it finally gets to you
I wish you were cool
I wish you were something
I wish you were cool
I wish you were something
So you really did nothing?
So you really did nothing of concern?
In the distance I'm humming
Are the whispers nothing?
Cause you have turned
Open your eyes
Is it too late?
There's a rhythm to match
To this undisputed mood
Never too much
And never too late
Let the rhythm do it all
Before it finally gets to you
I wish you were cool
I wish you were something
I wish you were cool
I wish you were something
I wish you were cool
I wish you were something
I wish you were cool
I wish you were somethingEmbed
