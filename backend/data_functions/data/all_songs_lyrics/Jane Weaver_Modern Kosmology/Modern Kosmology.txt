Modern Kosmology LyricsI saw your face I am unrecognisable
Beating my breast to release the power from the vault
Lets go out and see something
Thats something we can do
Lets go out and do something
Cancel what I've been through
And now I'm changing my world
And now I'm changing my world
Following charts but the threads would just dissipate
Modern kosmology let my love resonate
With the strength of the universe
Channeling interludes
I'm in debt to the test
While the branches hang over you
And now I'm changing my world
And now I'm changing my world
I want to do something good
So now I'm changing my world
I saw your face I am unrecognisable
Beating my breast to release the power from the vault
I'm obsessed with the mess and the skeleton of our muse
But the tension you mention like static between the grooves
And now I'm changing my world
And now I'm changing my worldEmbed
