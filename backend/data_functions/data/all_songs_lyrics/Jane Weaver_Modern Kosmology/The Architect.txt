The Architect LyricsYou are the architect
You are the architect
Don't suffer yourself
For the simple phrase
Where crediting lines
Are the proof that you lose
The blueprint you made
Has now taken shape
The formulas stolen
And patterns moved
And then we fight we fall
Amidst it all
We fight we fall and
Miss it all
And then we fight we fall
Amidst it all
We fight we fall and
Miss it all
You are The Architect
The energy spent
Can't be replicated
Visions in the sacred space
Not yours to choose
The static creates
Threads, I'll make it meta
Channeling the lines and the angles
To margins good
And then we fight we fall
Amidst it all
We fight we fall
And miss it all
And then we fight we fall
Amidst it all
We fight we fall
And miss it all
You are The Architect
You are The ArchitectEmbed
