Shook Down Lyrics
To collapse in a sugar cane
Suck it sweet to kill the pain
There was someone I was looking for
There is no more
My tongue is weak from a kick or two
The word is dry, I think of you
Tie my face to the back of a jet
To keep my essence there

And it's been a week
And it's been a week too long
There were several things
That I've been doing wrong
You see the time it takes for you
Is the time it takes for me
Oh, so don't agree

If it's late then I will go
Turn the lights out, turn it slow
Like you turned me upside down
And faced the ground
Spinning left, I spin at you
Listen girl, I think of you
Back up by the back of the chair
I left you there
And it's been a week
And it's been a week too long
There were several things
That I've been doing wrong
You see the time it takes for you
Is the time it takes for me
Oh, so don't agree

You could be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You could be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You could be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You could be my destiny
You can mean that much to me
You could be my destiny5Embed
