Get Away Lyrics
Break it down and then break it up again
Me and my guitar drowning down and 'round the bend
I'm ready when the pain kicks in
Tell me when the pain kicks in

Oh, I can't get away
Oh, I can't get away
Oh, I can't get away
No, I can't get away

Panoramic view, that's one thing I won't do
No shadow abuse from the corner of my mind
I'm ready when the pain kicks in
Tell me when the pain kicks in

Oh, I can't get away
Oh, I can't get away
Oh, I can't get away
No, I can't get away

Summer sun says get out more
I need you, I want you
But I can't get this feelin' off my mind
I want you, I need you

I can't get away
I can't get away
I can't get away
No, I can't get away

Summer sun says get out more
I need you, I want you
But I can't get this feeling off my mind
I want you, I need you
Summer sun says get out more
I need you, I want you
But I can't get this feeling off my mind
I want you, I need you4Embed
