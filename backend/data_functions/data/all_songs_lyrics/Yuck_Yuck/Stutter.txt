Stutter Lyrics
Seeing pictures of you in the beginning
Seeing pictures of you when you were swimming
Seeing pictures of you when you were in love
Like a full moon I was watching from above

Time is on the outside looking in
Time is on the outside looking in

Seeing pictures of you, I may have been dreaming
I'm seeing pictures of you, they keep me believing

Time is on the outside looking in
Time will be on our side, look and see

If I could send them on
If I could send them on
If I could send them on
To your heart and mindEmbed
