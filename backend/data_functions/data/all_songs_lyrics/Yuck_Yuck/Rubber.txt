Rubber Lyrics
If I put rubber in your head
Would you make something that time will stand
I've tried painting on the walls
But I've done nothing that stands alone

If I put rubber in your skin
Would you move around and rub it in
I've tried painting from the inside out
But I've done nothing that I can shout about

Should I give in
Should I give in
Should I give in
Should I give in
Should I give in
Should I give in
Should I give in
Should I give in

If I put rubber in your hand
Would you make me into a man
Put me on a chain and change my name
And lead me to the place that I need to go
Yes, I give in
Yes, I give in
Yes, I give in
Yes, I give in
Yes, I give in
Yes, I give in
Yes, I give in
Yes, I give in
