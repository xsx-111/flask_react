Cousin Corona Lyrics
Oh cousin Corona, I never wanted to know ya
It's just your blood was in my vein
It's just your name is in my name
Oh cousin Corona, will you get cremated?
'Cause when I see you you're so sedated
It's just a thought that I had

No, I don't need a vocation
No, I don't want a cremation

Oh cousin Corona, I saw your emptiness on TV
You will never seduce me
Cos I'm an antiseptic

No, I don't need a vocation
No, I don't want a cremation

I wanna go out on the weekend, I wanna hang out with my best friend
I wanna go out on the weekend, I wanna hang out with my best friend
I wanna go out on the weekend, I wanna hang out with my best friend
I wanna go out on the weekend, I wanna hang out with my best friend
I wanna go out on the weekend, (Oh cousin Corona)
I wanna hang out with my best friend (Oh cousin Corona)
I wanna go out on the weekend, (Oh cousin Corona)
I wanna hang out with my best friend (Oh cousin Corona)
I wanna go out on the weekend, (Oh cousin Corona)
I wanna hang out with my best friend (Oh cousin Corona)
I wanna go out on the weekend, (Oh cousin Corona)
I wanna hang out with my best friend (Oh cousin Corona)Embed
