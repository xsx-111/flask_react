Suck Lyrics
Every day was a Christian holiday
We held each other
When we prayed in our own way
Wait up, wait for me
I've had enough of being young and free
Everybody has a mild crucifixion
I first saw you as my benediction
I am sorry you became my addiction
My game, my cold affliction

Did you see the fire brigade
Steed heavy and filled with rage
Through the city, dissolve my fire
After dinner, I was burning with desire
They can never burn out my love for you

I heard you're used to makin' love on a Tuesday
He'd flip you over this way and that way
Everybody makes love in their own way
"It's just a word, haven't you heard,"
You said the other day
Hold my hand and rip at the seams
I'm not a Catholic but I know what it means
Edge of heaven is the edge of hell
That's what it felt like, the bottom of the wishing well
Did you see the fire brigade
Steed heavy and filled with rage
Through the city, dissolve my fire
After dinner, I was burning with desire
They can never burn out my love for you
Did you see the fire brigade
Nineteen, a girl of my age
Lipstick red and on the run
I take a look at what I've become
They can never burn out my love for you5Embed
