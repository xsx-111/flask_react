Soothe Me Lyrics
Only you know that I was so ashamed
We're playing a game, we are so arranged
Go where I go in this hell life that I know
Seek what I seek, in the peephole look to me

So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your drug

Baby I'm tired our love has expired
Baby I'm tired our love has expired
I give you a change and the back wits of my brain
I give you a change and all you give is pain

So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me

So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your oxygen
So soothe me, don't use me
I'm not your drugEmbed
