Doctors In My Bed Lyrics
If I have to go
And I will tell you so
And I will make my way
On a mystic holiday
If I have to go
And I will tell you so
'Cause I've been living in
A difficult situation

I've got doctors in my bed
I've got slow down in my head
I've got doctors in my bed
I'm just waitin' on one last breath

If I have to go
And I will tell you so
And I will have my say
On a coastal passageway
If I have to go (I know what you're eating, I know what you're eating)
And I will tell you so (It doesn't seem too much to me)
'Cause I've been living in (I know what you're eating, I know what you're eating)
A difficult situation (It doesn't mean too much to me)
I've got doctors in my bed
I've got slow down in my head
I've got doctors in my bed
I'm just waitin' on onе last breath
I've got doctors in my bed
I'vе got slow down in my head
I've got doctors in my bed
I'm just waitin' on one last breath

I've got doctors in my bed
I've got slow down in my head
I've got doctors in my bed
I've got slow down in my head
I've got doctors in my bed (I know what you're eating)
I've got slow down in my head (I know what you're eating)
I've got doctors in my bed (I know what you're eating)
I'm just waitin' on one last breathEmbed
