Operation Lyrics
I drove into the centre of town
To find a place that I can settle down
I just got back from a minor operation
I just got out but I didn't go right to you

I want to be well designed
I want to be your desire
Cause you talk and I just feel your soul
Cause you talk and I just feel your soul

I lie in bed cause I feel so low
I try to think but I just don't fucking know
I'd write a theme to the rhythm of your heart
And when you die I'll take it back to the start

I want to be well designed
I want to be your desire
Cause you talk and I just feel your soul
Cause you talk and I just feel your soul

I want to be well designed
I want to be your desire
Cause you talk and I just feel your soul
Cause you talk and I just feel your soul3Embed
