Suicide Policeman Lyrics
If you conjure up a fear
Make it loud so I can hear the tambourine
I just want to let you know
I could be your suicide policeman
Don't you go
'Til my eyes have left your face
Everybody hurts in ways
I can't believe
Everybody hurts in ways
I can't relate to my predicament

Brother, if you're feeling low
Tell me one thing I should know of your situation
I could stand out in the hall
I could be your suicide policeman
Arrest your fall
When you're afraid to hit the ground


If you take another drag
Of that cigarette would it be so bad
If your lungs are aching and your tongue still shaking
I could be your suicide policemanEmbed
