Coconut Bible Lyrics
I was damaged by a coconut carrying chicken
I could have figured out a coconut checkered position
I knew the only thing that you would say
Was don't co-carry away
I was challenged by coconut covered decision
I was swallowed by a milk ?? and coco collision
I knew the only thing that you would say
Was don't co-carry away

I need a minute now (Don't co-carry away)
I need a minute now

Gave money to the first fucker on the floor
I threw his head inside a gold-colored open door
I took his teeth out and said James won't be needing these
James was covered by a coconut colored spray
I pulled his finger and said coconuts are free today
I knew the only thing that he would cry was coco-cover my eyes

I need a minute now (Coco-cover my eyes)
I need a minute now
I want you
I got to
??? Jerusalem
I want you
I got it
I fell out a coco-colored sky

The scientific explanation of a coconut death
There is nothing in the world that I could suggest
You've gotta leave it all behind
In your coco-covered mind

Wait a minute now (Coco-covered mind)
Well I'm talking to you (Coco-covered, coco-covered)

I want you
I got to
??? Jerusalem
I want you
I've got it
??? Jerusalem
I want you
I've got it
??? Jerusalem
I want you
I've got it
I fell out a coco-colored sky
We are going to a coconut covered heaven
We are going to a coconut covered heaven
We are going to a coconut covered heaven
We are going to a coconut covered heavenEmbed
