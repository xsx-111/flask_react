Milkshake Lyrics
Back in June, I pulled the plug out
And pushed a penny in a pond
I am sorry, I admit that
Admit that what I did was wrong

I don't want to get you down
I just need to be around
But you can be so unkind
You're making a milkshake of my mind

In July I pull the plug out
And watch the water wash away
I get high to drain the pain out
And I get higher every day

I don't want to get you down
I just need to be around
Baby, you're so unkind
You're making a milkshake of my mind

Aaaaahhhhhhh
You're making a milkshake of my mind
Aaaaahhhhhhh
You're making a milkshake of my mind
Aaaaahhhhhhh
You're making a milkshake of my mind
Aaaaahhhhhhh
You're making a milkshake of my mind
A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mind
A milkshake, a milkshake, a milkshake of my mind
You're making a milkshake of my mindEmbed
