Holing Out Lyrics
Everybody says they can't get through to you
Everybody says you're just a point of view
Everybody says they can't get through to you
Everybody says you're just a point of view

Everybody says they can't get through to you
I think about the time I was close to you
Everybody says they can't get through to you
Everybody says you're just a point of view

All the times with you, wake me up tomorrow
And if my skull is empty, I'm holing out for you
All the times with you, wake me up tomorrow
And if my skull is empty, I'm holing out for you

Everybody says they can't get through to you
Everybody says you're just a point of view
Everybody says they can't get through to you
Holing out a brain and push a pencil through

All the times with you, wake me up tomorrow
And if my skull is empty, I'm holing out for you
All the times with you, wake me up tomorrow
And if my skull is empty, I'm holing out for you
All the times with you, wake me up tomorrow
And if my skull is empty, I'm holing out for you
All the times with you, wake me up tomorrow
And if my skull is empty, I'm holing out for youEmbed
