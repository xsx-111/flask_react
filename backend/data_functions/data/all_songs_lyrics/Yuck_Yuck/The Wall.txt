The Wall Lyrics
Trying to make it through the wall
Trying to make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall
Trying to make it through the wall
Trying to make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall
Looking over

Trying to make it through the wall
Trying to make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall
Trying to make it through the wall
Trying to make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall
Looking over

And I know that I'm in space
And I know that it's not real
It's just the way that I feel
It's just the way that I feel
And I know that I'm in space
And I know that it's not real
It's just the way that I feel
It's just the way that I feel
Looking over
Trying to make it through the wall
Trying to make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall
Trying to make it through the wall
Trying to make it through the wall
But you can see me if you're tall
But you can see me if you're tall
Looking over

Oh
Looking over
Yeah
Looking over
Yeah
Looking over
Yeah
Looking overEmbed
