The Base Of A Dream Is Empty Lyrics
Purified, you're my situation
Electrified, no time for hesitation
The base of a dream is empty
The base of a dream is empty

Terrified, I have been through to few
Simplified, everything you need to do
The base of a dream is empty
The base of a dream is empty

Drowning slower
Drowning life
Drowning slower
Miserable
Drowning slower
Drowning life
Drowning slower
Miserable with and without you nearEmbed
