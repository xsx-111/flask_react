Georgia Lyrics
I'm so tired
I'll fall asleep when I speak to you tonight
You're in my mind
In my dreams I look like you, alright

We've been dreaming differently
I say, baby, that's what you mean to me

Georgia, what's a girl to do
Georgia, I'm still in love with you
Georgia, what's a girl to do
Georgia, I'm still in love with you

No, the seer
They should not have messed with you, the seer
We'll feel alright
When we both go separate ways this time

We've been dreaming differently
I say, baby, that's what you mean to me
Georgia, what's a girl to do
Georgia, I'm still in love with you
Georgia, what's a girl to do
Georgia, I'm still in love with you

Georgia, what you gonna say
Wasted all this time away
Georgia, what you gonna say
I gotta hold myself
Wish you well, may all your dreams come trueEmbed
