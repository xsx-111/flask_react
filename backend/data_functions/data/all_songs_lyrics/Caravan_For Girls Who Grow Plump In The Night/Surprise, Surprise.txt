Surprise, Surprise LyricsAfter all this time it's got no better
And the words just seem to pass me by
So I think of you in the morning
Singing a song to fill my eyes
Here I go
Can you sing along?
Stopped to say hello
Something overcame me
Didn't want to go and pass you by
Looked at me so fair
Saw the sun upon you
Blow and slip through your hands
Summer stole away
All the breath within me
Leavin' me gaspin' for some air
Have so much to say
Hardly seem to matter
You were more than some one day
Didn't we believe we were so?
Didn't we believe we were something?
Didn't we believe we were more?
So much more than words can say
Suddenly sunshine, sudden love
When the years are gone
And we live on memories
Will you still remember me that way?
Like I do you too
No matter where I could be
Something's going to steal away
Didn't we believe we were so?
Didn't we believe we were something?
Didn't we believe we were more?
So much more than I don't know
Suddenly sunshine, sudden love
Didn't want to go
Didn't want to leave you
Something pulling me back hurt me so
Wakin' up I found feet upon the pillow
Head and shoulders on the groundEmbed
