Be All Right
Chance of a Lifetime LyricsBe All Right
Think of the days, in so many ways we used to talk
And how we would love to sing
Would you think twice of all the things nice your memory holds
And that's what your love could bring
But it's all right now, it's all right now
Don't think of me as something to see
I only have sunshine and love to bring
Somehow I feel there's something unreal
About the way money means everything
That'll be the fall of all of the worlds you love
Mummy, I said that thing
But it's all right now, be all right now
Don't think of me as something to see
I only have sunshine and love to bring
Think of the days in so many ways we used to talk
And how we would love to sing
Would you think of twice of all the things nice your memory holds
And that's what your love could bring
But it's all right now, it's all right now
Chance of a Lifetime
Think on the sunshine
Don't throw away
Chance of a lifetime to come
In a world that's not grey
You'll see there's diamonds in the skies
And a rainbow 'round your shoulder for all time
Think on the sunshine in your mind
Time has no meaning
There's a year in a day
And all the people you see
Will smile if you stay
Laugh and the whole world laughs with you
Worry and you'd all be in there trying too
See, there's no love lost in your mind
Look for the sunrise
It will shine upon you
It's always there in your mind
I'm searching there too
Don't live the life they want you to
Figure your own and then go see it through
Mind it's your mind, it's your mindEmbed
