Memory Lain, Hugh
Headloss LyricsMemory Lain, Hugh
If you get on the road that takes you back
There's a lot of things you ought to know
You're going where I want to be
If you get on the road you've got to take me
Can you see I don't care
For all those things and fancy strings
I just want the chance to try
And find me
I stopped having dreams some time ago
So now it seems I have to show
If there's a chance I've got to find me
Somewhere there's someone who can see
A broken-winged dove
Is all he has to show for love
Oh please help me please
To find me
Headloss
Has anybody seen I've got me a dream
Gonna be happy, yeah
Never knew that light could seem so bright
Couldn't you tell me, no?
Imagine me today
Thought they'd come to take me away, me away?
After all you choose, you've got win or lose
Whether to find me
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
(He's got love)
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
But it's all that I have and it's all that I want
Many years ago, I thought whenever it shows
Gonna be ready, yeah
Suddenly within my head beginnin' to spin
Gave it upon me
Had to be that way
At least that's what they taught me to say, me to say
If ever I get out, I'm gonna be makin' a shout
Gonna be happy
I've got my coat and I've got my comb
I'll be far gone, come tomorrow
(He'll be far away)
The moon comes out, I'll try to stare him out
And I'll dance to the light if he's chasing me home
I've got my pipe and I've got my song
And I've got love to keep me happy
(He's got love)
It's no surprise I've got bleary eyes
But it's all that I have and it's all that I want1Embed
