I Remember When I Loved Her LyricsShe seemed so cold to me
And I remember when I loved her
She seemed so cold to me
But I remember when I loved her

Now we are strange, no more in love
But I still wish that I could hold her
My dream of love has gone
And I remember when I loved her


Now we are strange, no more in love
But I still wish that I could hold her
My dream of love has gone
And I remember when I loved her

When I loved her
When I loved
