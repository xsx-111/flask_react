Woman Lyrics
Woman
When I walked with you last night
My mind
Saw that you'd soon hold me tight

I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me too

You don't
Realize what you can do
I just
Sympathize but still it's true

I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me too


Woman
When I walked with you last night
My mind
Saw that you'd soon hold me tight
I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me too
Oh, oh, oh


I want
You to understand my mind
Seems that
Girls that do are hard to find

I can't concede, no
I can't believe you love me tooEmbed
