I Got My Mojo Working Lyrics
I got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you

I got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
I got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
You know I want you so badly, I just don't know what to do

I'm going down to Lou-sana, gonna get me mojo there, yeah
I'm going down to Lou-sana, goin' get me mojo there, alright
I wanna get all the women, yeah, right under my chair

I got an old gypsy woman now, giving me good advice
I got an old gypsy woman, giving me good advice, alright
I got a whole lotta tricks, here right under my eyes, yeah, uh
I got my mojo working
(I got my mojo working)
I got my mojo working now
(I got my mojo working)
I got my mojo working now
(I got my mojo working)
I got my mojo working now, right now, yeah
(I got my mojo working)
I got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
(Oh oh)

(I got my mojo working)
I got my mojo working now

I got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, alright

I got my mojo working, right now, inside me
