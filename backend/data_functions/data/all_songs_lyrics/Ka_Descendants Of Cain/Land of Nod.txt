Land of Nod Lyrics
You can tell I'm in fact a native
I live this vivid shit, I ain't that creative
You can tell I'm in fact a native
I live this vivid shit, I ain't that creative

Had to repel calm to get things clickin'
Pack back to Belmont with slim pickins
Said "what up cuz, it's love" 'fore there was anything Crippin'
Did over forty foul winters, I ain't no spring chicken
No arrests, just a few court summons
Got someone to long for me after knowin' my shortcomin's
Death toll highest when hot, I'm wishin' for short summers
And trust is a must before we could talk numbers
I delete the doctrine of "retreat's an option"
Must defend, if up to them, we'd be locked, eatin' toxin
Flamin' tool in plain view, could never let the cops in
Least one foot in the square's what we revere as boxin'
String o' itchy trigger fingers, where they act rash
You could tell I had a wack past
The opponent every wakin' moment tryin' stack cash
Come through, bricks, new whip, equipped for backlash

You can tell I'm in fact a native
I live this vivid shit, I ain't that creative
You can tell I'm in fact a native
I live this vivid shit
Fiends took grams as we shook hands, 'cause neither had a fair shake
Already livin' with prisoners, I couldn't be scared straight
Didn't invite friends over, 'cause never had a spare plate
Anyone who made it out of here, I wouldn't dare hate
Generally outgoin', but around the decoy
Malaise most days, be years before I speak joy
What they profess is estrogen, and I don't eat soy
And I can't party when they party, tryna kill each boy
Moses to the hoes, learned from burnin' bush
Had to have some pull, before I should turn and push
Was on the corner by night confirmed as rooks
But made more in the job than was earned as crooks
Put part of me in the art, like I'm pendin' an appendage
Invested since the beginnin', in the end I want percentage
When night's over, might know it, dependent with descendants
Was always the same one word when my family got the sentence

You can tell I'm in fact a native
I live this vivid shit, I ain't that creative
You can tell I'm in fact a native
I live this vivid shit, I ain't that creativeEmbed
