Sins of the Father Lyrics
"These are the children of misery. The afflicted. The hopeless. The oppressed."

Still built my ark in the face of ridicule
The waste left a bad taste when the bitter duel
Was fumin', runnin' on E, ain't have a bit of fuel
Here repair was past affair, had to get a tool
Saw too much to have blind faith
Chow was laced with sour grapes, this ain't a divine place
Long lags of stagnation made the mind race
Being lost like this'll have you in a confined space
Of course for my life to alter, had to sacrifice
Days we was forced to fast, prayed for rapid nights
Truthfully, won't see the future movin' with parasites
If mentors ain't dispensed with war, you got bad advice
They say "rest in peace" the only peaceful gatherin'
Another track and field, leadin' with the javelin
Was only schemin', 'cause couldn't reason with my abdomen
Still bagged 'em all, Virgin Mary to Mary Magdalene
They used to call us devious
But if they was feedin' us, might've had obedience
You know my stock, was only good as my ingredients
The system only leaned on us, never showed us lenience

"My punishment is greater than I can bear!"
Reign in hell or serve in heaven
Take from the world or earn your blessings
I heard verbatim from an angel's message
My left shoulder there was Satan finessin'
I burnt the sage in the name of protection
Be James Evans or Rayful Edmond
It's a dirty game of chess and checkers
Get paid or be left naked and desperate
I lit a candle and played Jamaican records
Prayed and rested next to my favorite weapons
Saved my bread up and then made my exit
I'm going back and forth with thoughts of quittin' like table tennis
But what's the game if the players ain't in it?
Every pen ran out of ink on the day this was written
Cain killed Abel in prison, while upstate on a visit (Uh)
They so quick to trade and hate on a nigga
Nothin' my radar couldn't pick up
We overcame greater odds to be winners, harsh winters
No lookin' back we break the mirrors, gray spirits
We gave the devil a grace period
The weak is baptized in Lake Superior
My lady from Syria
My interior Siberia
My eyes still teary, nothin' could cheer me up
This is the criteria
From the 'Ville, still payin' for the sins of my father
From the Island, still payin' for his sins, he was wildin'
From the 'Ville, still payin' for the sins of my father
From the Island, still payin' for his sins, he was wildin'
Time for clemency, change the verdicts
Whatever he did, we ain't deserve this
Time for clemency, change the verdicts
Whatever he did, we ain't deserve this

"We have an iron motto. We live well... we die well!"5Embed
