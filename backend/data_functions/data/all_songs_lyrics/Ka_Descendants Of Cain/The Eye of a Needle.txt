The Eye of a Needle Lyrics

I sketch pictures of stress, picturesque
As boys try make noise with hits, start pitchin' less
From hurtin' blocks where workin' spots was big success
Stack digits, how you act when gettin's the biggest test
Alert nights, liftin' dirt bikes the kids impressed
Those full o' hustle pull a muscle or did a stretch
They mumble lessons in jungle sessions, sippin' blessed
All I heard was "don't sleep", I ain't get the rest

It's a penny for the thoughts
After dice, never gave a penny for them walks
It's a penny for the thoughts
Penny for the thoughts

My past bent me
See it half-empty
My theme's still tryin' to get clean from last century
Was true an' kids, grew and lived through some tryin' years
My road land me from nosecandy to pioneers
The style Ka utter, is highbrow gutter
Even though the sound's Brown, the crowds now hover
Can't appreciate winnin' if one never fails
Played all them games o' chance, now I gotta have the tails
It's a penny for the thoughts
In the summertime, I had a semi in my shorts
It's a penny for the thoughts
It's a penny for the thoughts
It's a penny for the thoughts
At ten, visit cousins in the pen, even then I had some hawks
It's a penny for some thoughts
It's a penny for the thoughts
It's a penny for the thoughts
Nickels with the grips, had dimes tell me that they love me
It's a penny for the thoughts
Nickels with the grips, had dimes tell me that they love me

What I bring is worth much


For our appetites, we burned major
Had to sacrifice all to earn favor
Fly visitors become food, never return flavor
It's a coarse life course, you don't get to learn later
We chose shortsighted goals, not sought far
Chalkin' up my tortures how I taught y'all
Losers die, winners caught a war scar
We only sayin' fuck what they enforce, got a sports car
In the dreams of cuttin' nets to move some nicks
Crossed many with the semi, did my time on the crucifix
Bleedin', all the grievin' made us extra grievous
Would've told Kev I love him if knew he was next to leave us
Powers that be tryin' deceive us, best believe us
Holdin' court, won't let the control and alt  delete us
To defeat us, the wicked brew poison blend
The skinniest toothpick grew quick from boys to men
While I scored, many felt the sword, not enjoyed the pen
Cold when it broil friend, I'm loyal 'til the voyage end
Rapidly keep my eyes movin', I couldn't fall in REM
Some equality, none in poverty, I'll be joyous then
I'll be joyous then
As long as I'm able-bodied
(And the Lord had respect until Abel and to his offering)
Put food on that table as long as I'm able-bodied
(But unto Cain and his offering he had not respect)1Embed
