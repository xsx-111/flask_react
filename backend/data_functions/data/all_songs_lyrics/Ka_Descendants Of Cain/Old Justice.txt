Old Justice Lyrics
“Then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.”

We was livin' in the livin' room
Can’t wait for it to come, need to get it soon
Cousin said he gon’ get off a ki', better get in tune
By next weekend, could be eatin' with a bigger spoon
Sold raw, no more scrapin' the bottom
Brave the corner where ain't no takin' asylum
Read all with aggression, assumin' they waitin' to rob him
Thought he was movin' solution, without equatin' the problem
When young in the flesh, hunger the best motivator
That’s word, get hurt out here if you don’t know the nomenclature
Shark slingers, only thing you couldn’t own was paper
Fam we bleed, ain't guaranteed stayin' home was safer
Masked bandit, I suggested, what I flashed demanded
Pull solo missions, wishin' to get off mass transit
Lettin' shit pass, that’s how you get your ass handed
All gaudy, thought he was fly, 'til he crash landed
Here cake exists only for those that take the risks
If the Lord offered, would you learn how, or take the fish?
No dandelions, I got handed irons to make a wish
Lived to hate, to the state was just another ape to frisk
Was begotten and forgotten, the covenant was rotten
Them days everything was grave, so we was plottin'
Never cupped my hand, fuck what Sam threw us out of guilt
We ain't ahk wit' that block of cheese and powdered milk
Graduated hard knocks, where there’s no diplomacy
Shine, hope dimes pay attention and cops don’t notice me
After grade sev', break bread, my friends ate
The cypher's muddied, the cycle bloody 'til all my men straight
'Til all my men straight
'Round here everybody know the truth
A body for an eye, a body for a tooth
That’s why I kept the shotty on the stoop
A body for an eye, a body for a tooth
This rule apply to all recruits
A body for an eye, a body for a tooth, uh

That’s why they did they 1-2, with 3 .45’s
1-2, with 3 .45’s
Did they 1-2, with 3 .45’s
1-2, with 3 .45’s
They kill you for the truth faster than the lies, man
1-2, with 3 .45’s
Being so close to death made us more alive
1-2, with 3 .45’s
1-2, with 3 .45’s, ha
1-2, with 3 .45’sEmbed
