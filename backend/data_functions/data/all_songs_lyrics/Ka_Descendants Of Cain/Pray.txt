Pray Lyrics
Must we all suffer for what one man has done?

What I see from my level, the devil's in a serious phase
For smart fight, God might have to stop workin' in mysterious ways
The ghetto's unfairness prepared us to live in a cage
Still tryin' to find that silver linin' from when niggas was slaves
It wasn't good where I stood at the precipice, lookin' for an Exodus
Was tryin', but tried to keep it alive durin' the death of this
Defined by most strenuous times, now told effortless
If urged for more proverbs, check my old testaments
I like to write righteous, even though it's secular
Birthed from the dirt like Adam, the pattern's in my molecular
She's in line to be mine, make sure she woke before I slept with her
It's not respected wise to heckle guys who got the Heckler
A past passion is what I pursued in my solitude
Was never gas, you can ask; I'm a solid dude
I learned to quiet my mind, I'm nice; we was out of food
A few times almost expired, should've been tired what I renew
The place I fell from, I embrace and welcome
Played bad cards bad? Can't be mad, whoever dealt 'em
If he ain't from the maelstrom, I never felt him
Friends that died, I feel would've survived if I was there to help 'em

As we bow our heads, may we Please Receive Any Yield
Please Receive Any Yield, for real
May we Please Receive Any Yield
With my last I ask me and my man's sacred matter
At the end, ascend Jacob's ladder
As youngin, had to be hunters, was the only way to gather
Was built prime in that filth time, now I'm tryna make it lather
Get banged tryna hang before you learn ropes
My brave folks stay cold (Stay cold), they was never turncoats
In the hood, handsome don't matter, girls want who earn most
Seen killers let off steam, then return to scenes as concerned folks
Price your brew, and whatever you decide to do
At the height of that ready rock, every block was volatile
Here to blast, any day could be your last, that was probable
They shot the guns, lot of sons never returned as prodigal
For what I anoint in my cup, they runneth over
The drive that kept me alive is my cunnin' motor
End of month, cops tend to front when they under quota
Where it's hard to walk that straight line drunk or sober

As we bow our heads, may we Please Receive Any Yield
Please Receive Any Yield, for real (Please)
May we Please Receive Any Yield (Please receive any yield)
As we bow our heads, may we Please Receive Any Yield
Please Receive Any Yield, for real
May we Please Receive Any YieldEmbed
