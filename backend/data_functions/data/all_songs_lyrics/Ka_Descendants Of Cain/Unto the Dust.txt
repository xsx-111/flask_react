Unto the Dust Lyrics
And the meaning of "Cain" is possession
Ya know I was thinkin' the other day, like
I wonder why none of my people just dyin' of natural causes, you know
Just passing away, you know what I'm sayin'?
You know what I'm sayin', none of my people ever, like, passed away

Had to man up (Man up), another man down (Down)
At the least we stand fast, never stand down (Never)
My tool's fire, move quiet, but the plan sound (Sound)
Born headfirst in that damned land, I want that damn crown (Woo)
The boys in blue clothes got new holds, new submissions
I give the grey youth straight truth, no euphemisms (No euphemisms)
Y'all played the Dozens, my favorite cousins spent they youth in prisons
They names known, came home; now, the house got two religions
Peace be with you (Be with you), wa alaikum salaam (Wa alaikum salaam)
Make sure that piece be with you, laced to your palm
No one here's linear, danger 'round every bend
On a path for power when half a dollar was hated by many men

Street live, we die, we don't pass away (Don't pass away)
Take any task if you got cash to pay
On this earth, brave known to earn
Birth to gravestone to urn
Descended from battered slaves, barricades only aggravate us
Friends and foe dying, no lying, grew up fightin' gladiators
Whoever left son soakin', it's unspoken; you gotta see 'em
We don't do a rest, 'til the death, rules of the coliseum
For those concerned, I learned from jailbirds (Jailbirds)
Not from no frail curbs; over here, the crack sales surged
Our engine binging for years, Black males purged
Want progress, now digest bullets, inhale words (Inhale these words)

On this earth, brave known to earn
(Gravestone to urn)

Before semis air, shot plenty fairs 'fore I shot a gun
My heroes taught take zero shorts, of course, I'm not the one
Mommy preached peace, but in grief, I’ma pop a son
Marshal the land that's never ran, man, even when the coppers come (Even when the coppers come)
Problem's we at the bottom, that's where all the tops is slung
Hate the pull, but in beef, take no bull, only ox is brung
They blessed me with twenty FD, pray I don't have a toxic lung (Toxic lung)
I'm from the seventies, men in Lees had us boxin' young
I don't levitate, I educate, you better ask around (You better ask around)
I'm taskin' babes passin' grades, what you passin' down?
Mm
Street live, we die, we don't pass away
Take any task if you got cash to pay
On this earth, brave known to earn
From birth to gravestone to urn, word
On this earth, brave known to earn
Yeah, on this earth, brave known to earn
Gravestone to urn, urnEmbed
