I Love (Mimi, Moms, Kev) Lyrics
I love (You)
I love
I love

Picked me up when I was at my lowest
Used to hardly could spell, now I'm held with the poets
That was all your doin'
Was filthy, you built me when I was all ruin
How you soaked me with compliments really helped out
Boasted all confidence in my self-doubt
Was dyin' from my thirst, you was clearly a well
It eventually made me empty, I was merely a shell
None observed, but was on the verge of crackin'
'Til you said I had a gift when you heard me rappin'
With your warm responses, I was taken aback
Former partners had me feelin' like what I was makin' was wack
Didn't offend me, saw somethin' in me I was blind to
Who knew to finish findin' me, I had to find you?
To close the thought, your support was life-savin'
Now death is minor, 'cause you got me livin' life major
I stayed forever, you make me better

I love
I love
Since birth, when hurt and sick, only person I see
Could write a play about strength on how you work in a week
Wanted to give you the world, I saw you here strugglin'
All praise to the Father, I had you here motherin'
Sorry for the times I was bellin' in my teens
But you know I had felon in my genes
Was bad man in badlands, chasin' desire
From viewin' what you went through, I learned grace under fire
Sayin' you proud of me, the sweetest words ever
Purest soul I know, moms, you deserve better
Whatever ailments, you nursed me back to health
Defend me even when the enemy's in fact myself
Showed me love when all I seen was hate
Said I was special, to impress you, wanted to be seen as great
This my kiss and thank you for the unconditional
And though I may not see you as much, I'm always missin' you
Sacrifice was our facts of life

I love
I love

Held me down when I needed it most
Whether shoulder to cry on, or I needed the toast
And would never let me go it alone
Everybody called it the slum, but we know it as home
From where we from, we supposed to be thug
Both shared a different dream, we was closer than blood
Learned from you how to pour my heart in a song
Way ahead of your time, was just hard to get on
Ain't gon' lie, just wanted to buy houses for the fam'
Move 'em out the hood, give 'em thousands and some land
Them night sessions of eternal life lessons
That I still use today when I'm uptight, stressin'
Always said we was veteran survivors
And even though you passed, you'll forever be the livest
Was an honor to see you shine, I was blessed, son
'Cause in the end, as far as friends, you was the best one
Gave so much and behaved so clutch, I love
I love
I love
I love

What we have so much more than they see
Health, prosperity, life to you2Embed
