Ferris Wheel Lyrics
Do I have reason to be sad?
Crying over something I never had
You borrowed my car a couple times
You don't like me, you just like my ride

You hide behind glasses and music and wit
You laugh at yourself and then roll cigarettes
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To show you that I've got the sadness too
To show you that I've got the sadness too

I talk about you like you're mine
My friends just laugh and roll their eyes
When I tell them I don't mind the way it feels
To ride an empty ferris wheel

You hide behind glasses and music and wit
You laugh at yourself and then roll cigarettes
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To show you that I've got the sadness too
To show you that I've got the sadness too
You hide behind glasses and music and wit
You laugh at yourself and then roll cigarettes
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To show you that I've got the sadness too
To show you that I've got the sadness tooEmbed
