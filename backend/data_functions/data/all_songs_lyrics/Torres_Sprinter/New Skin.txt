New Skin Lyrics
Lay off me would ya
I’m just trying to take this new skin for a spin
Pray for me would ya
I’m just nervous 'bout my family filing in
Ready to wrap me up
Ready to love me in this new skin I’m filling in

Who’s that trying to speak for me?
What is it that they claim to be?
A child of God much like yourself
You will find me right where I fell

I am a tired woman
In January, I will just be twenty-three
In Kansas City, I was undressed and bested by an airtight floor
Then it said, “By the power in me vested”
And wrapped me in this new skin I’m dying for

Who’s that trying to speak for me?
What kind of love do they claim to be?
A child of God much like yourself
You’ll still find me right where I fell
Who’s that trying to speak for me?
What kind of love do they claim to be?
A child of God much like yourself
You’ll still find me right where I fell

The darkness fears
What darkness knows
But if you’ve never known the darkness
Then you’re the one who fears the most
The darkness fears
What darkness knows
But if you’ve never known the darkness
Then you’re the one who fears the most
The darkness fears
What darkness knows
But if you’ve never known the darkness
Then you’re the one who fears the most
But if you do not know the darkness
Then you’re the one who fears the most
But if you do not know the darkness
Then you’re the one I fear the most2Embed
