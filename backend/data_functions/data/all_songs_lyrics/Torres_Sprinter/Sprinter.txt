Sprinter Lyrics
Word of life on severed tree
I picked it up and took a swing
My pastor told us, "Don't you worry
Even Zacchaeus found his glory"

I was a sprinter then
Living to see it end

Well, pastor lost his position
Went down for pornography
So I found myself some ground to stand
Bound to be the better man

'Cause I was a sprinter then
Living to see it end

Wound up, in a holding pattern
Circled my landing in a lather
Unnerved, I laughed, "I planned the snag!"
Then went down for a dipso jag
'Cause I was a sprinter then
Dying to see it end
I was a sprinter then
Dying to see it end

There's freedom to and freedom from
Freedom to run from everyone
There's freedom to and freedom from
Freedom to run from everyone
Well, what I did is what is done
The baptist in me chose to run
But if there's still time to choose the sun
I'll choose the sun, I'll choose the sun
I'll run it back, I'll choose the sun
I'll run it back to everyone
If there's still time, I'll choose the sun
And I'll run it back to everyone2Embed
