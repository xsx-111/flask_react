Cowboy Guilt Lyrics
We spent our only season
On a mattress sleeping with our best friend
We donned our winter livers with weary resignation
Three southern spines to the wind

Wrapped in my Sunday best with the king of Fort Worth, Texas
Wrapped in my Sunday best with the king of Fort Worth, Texas

You had us in stitches with your George W. impressions
You sang of reparations with the Native Americans
You donned your cowboy guilt
You donned your cowboy guilt
We drowned our winter livers with bleary expectation
Three southern spines to the end

I was green and protected
Wrapped in my Sunday best with the king of Fort Worth, Texas
I was queen and protected
Wrapped in my Sunday best with the king of Fort Worth, Texas1Embed
