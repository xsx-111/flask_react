Son, You Are No Island LyricsSon, you are no island
You don't get to choose what stays or goes
Son, you're not a man yet
Until your yes is yes and no's are no's
Son, you are no mountain
You and the sky aren't seeing eye to eye
Son, you're not a man yet
You're just a firstborn feeling left behind
Son, you are no ocean
No sunken gold pervades your salty bowels
Son, you're not a man yet
You dove to save a child who must be drowned
You'd drown to save yourself
You'd drown to save yourself
Son, you are no chasm
Your void holds no mystique to be unearthed
Son, you're not a man yet
No woman's arms could carry out your worth
No, not even hers
No, not even hers
Son, you are no river
Your currents don't run steady as she goes
Son, you're not a man yet
You fucked with a woman who would know
I would know
I would know
I would know
I would know
I would know
I would know
I would know
