A Proper Polish Welcome Lyrics
Oh January, keep a secret for me
Only Poseidon knows what I've seen
If you ask me, she was never there
Bela, how is it I carry you everywhere?
Everywhere

Heavy hands, she moved slowly, steadily
Pale legs straddling the sea
Aboard a floating savior
What does language mean?
It was a proper Polish welcome
A proper Polish welcome

A shift of the table, a slip of the tongue
Silence and then a muffled "Oh my God"
I was the first to laugh, she followed suit
Rocking and holy, we came two by two
We came two by two

Heavy hands, she moved slowly, steadily
Pale legs straddling the sea
Aboard a floating savior
What does country mean?
It was a proper Polish welcome
A proper Polish welcome
I wish I was the sea
I wish I was the sea
She was straddling the sea
I wish I was the sea

Heavy hands, she moved slowly, steadily
Pale legs straddling the sea
Aboard a floating savior
What does language mean?
It was a proper Polish welcome
A proper Polish welcomeEmbed
