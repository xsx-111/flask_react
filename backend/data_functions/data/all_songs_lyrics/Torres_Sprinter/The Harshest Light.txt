The Harshest Light Lyrics
Get in line, take your time
It's a lot to decide
Tell me, how much truth would you like to buy?
But chew and swallow it good
Coffee to chase the mirror down
Lost, I was not ready for what I found

It was all in my mind and my body was fine
But try as I might, I could not hide
And my eyes were wide
And I stepped into the harshest light, light

Rows of red and ill fame
All alone with my brain
Just a misguided woman in Amsterdam
Yahweh said, "Eat of my body
And you will see, but eat of that tree
And you will be free of me"

It was all in my mind and my body was fine
But try as I might, I could not hide
And my eyes were wide
And I stepped into the harshest light, light
I stepped into the harshest light, light
I stepped into the harshest light, light
I stepped into the harshest light, lightEmbed
