Drug-Stabbing Time Lyrics
Drug-stabbin' time
Better get workin' on the Ford line
A'payin' off the big fine
Drug-stabbin' time

Drug-stabbin' time
Is from nine to nine
Nobody wants a user
Nobody needs a loser
So kick him out that door
Don't answer it no more

Drug-stabbin' time
Better get workin' on the Ford line
A'payin' off the big fine
Drug-stabbin' time

Drug-stabbin' time
Yeah, it's a Greenwich Mean Time
Your friends all hate each other
You think you've got another
But who's at at the door?
Don't answer it no more
Drug-stabbin' time
Better get workin' on the Ford line
A'payin' off the big fine
Drug-stabbin' time


Drug-stabbin' time
In a bedroom cryin’
There's a tape recordin' on a telephone line
And it's ringin' from the floor
So don't answer it no more

Drug-stabbin' time
Better get workin' on the Ford line
A'payin' off the big fine
Drug-stabbin' time
Drug-stabbin' time
Better get workin' on the Ford line
A'payin' off the big fine
Drug-stabbin' time
Drug-stabbin’ time (Drug-stabbin’)
Drug-stabbin’ time
Drug-stabbin’ time (Drug habit)
Drug-stabbin’ time

Now, I was lyin' in my room
It was rainin' drugs all afternoon
I hear this car pull up outside
Comes to a stop like, skreeee
Someone's in a hurry
And someone better worry
‘Cause these four guys all had on their feet
A pair of black shoes, shinin' and neat, I thinks
Hmm, black shoes
Good lord, that's bad news
Yeah, here they come chargin' up the stairs
"Alright sonny, just tell us where!"

Drug-stabbin' time (“Don’t ask me, mate!”)
Better get on the Ford line (“You’re an officer?”)
A'payin' off the big fine (“Nasty, ain’t ya?”)
Drug-stabbin' timeEmbed
