Cheapskates Lyrics
I have been a washer up
And he has been a scrubber up
And I've seen him a pickin' up
Dog ends in the rain
And he has never read a book
Though I told him to take a look
He lifted his pool hall cue
For another game

But it isn't no modern miracle
That we found the golden rule
What you can't buy, ya' gotta steal
And what ya' say can't steal ya' better leave
I don't like to hang about
In this lonely room
'Cause London is for going out
And tryin' to hear a tune
But people come poncin' up to me
And say, "What are you doing here
You're supposed to be a star
Not a cheapskate bleeding queer?"
Like a load of rats from a sinkin' ship
You slag us down to save your hip
But don't give me the benefit of your doubt
Because I'll bite it off and spit it out
We're cheapskates anything'll do
We're cheapskates what are we supposed to do?

And we can rock, hey hey let's roll
And we can walk, and do the stroll

We're cheapskates, anything'll do
We're cheapskates, what are we supposed to do?
(?)

Just because we're in a group
You all think we're stinkin' rich
And we all got a'model girls
Sheddin' every stitch
And you think the cocaine's flowin'
Like a river up our noses
And every sea will part for us
Like the red one did for Moses
Well I hope ya' make it one day
Just like you always said ya' would some day
But I'll get out my money and make a bet
That I'll be seein' down the Launderette
We're cheapskates, anything'll do
We're cheapskates what are we supposed to do?Embed
