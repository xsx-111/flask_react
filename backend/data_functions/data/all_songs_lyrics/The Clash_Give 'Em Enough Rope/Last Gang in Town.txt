Last Gang in Town Lyrics
Everybody's lookin' for
Last gang in town
Ya' better watch out, boy
They're all comin' around

The sport of today is excitin'
The in-crowd are in for infightin'
When some punk sees your rock-olla
It's rock and roll all over
In every street and every station
Kids fight like different nations
And it's brawn against brain and knife against chain
But it's all young blood flowin' down the drain

The crops hit the stiffs and the spikes whipped the quiffs
They're all lookin' 'round
The crops hit the stiffs and the spikes whipped the quiffs
They're all lookin' 'round for the last gang in town

Meanwhile down in aâ€™ blacky town
Those old soul rebels are hangin' around
And when some punk come a'lookin' for sound
Rastafari goes to the ground
The white heart flipped the pocket dipped
Because a black sharp knife never slips
And they never say to one another
That tomorrow we might kill our brothers
The crops hit the stiffs and the spikes whipped the quiffs
They're all lookin' 'round
The crops hit the stiffs and the spikes whipped the quiffs
They're all lookin' 'round for the last gang in town

Oh, come on, come on
Yeah, Kentucky Fried Chicken
Yeah, come on, come on
Come on an' yell out, baby

Down from the edge of London
The Rock City rebels came
From another edge of London
Skinhead gangs call out their name
But not the Zydeco kids from the high rise
Although they can't be recognized
When you hear a Cajun fiddle then you're nearly in the middle
Of the last gang in town

The crops hit the stiffs and the spikes whipped the quiffs
Well, they're all lookin' 'round
The crops hit the stiffs and the spikes whipped the quiffs
They're all lookin' 'round for the last gang in town
Last gang in town
Where are they now? (Last gang in town)
Where are they now? (Last gang in town)
(Spoken simultaneously)
"Uh huh? Wanna know somethin'?"
"Well, Jimmy got married"
"Mark's in the slammer"
"Bullshit! "
" will give up!"
"Soon as I have"
"They're broken!"
"Useless!"1Embed
