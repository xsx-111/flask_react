All the Young Punks (New Boots and Contracts) Lyrics
Hangin' about
Down the market street
I spent a lot of time on my feet
When I saw some passin' yobbos
We did chance to speak

I knew how to sing, ya' know
An' they knew how to pose
An' one of them had a Les Paul
Heart attack machine

All the young punks
Laugh your life
'Cause there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts
Live it now
'Cause there ain't much to die for

Everybody wants to bum
A ride on the rock 'n' roller coaster
And we went out
Got our name in small print on the poster
Of course we got a manager
Though he ain't the mafia
A contract is a contract
When they get 'em out on ya'
You gotta drag yourself to work
Drag yourself to sleep
You're dead from the neck up
By the middle of the week

All the young punks
Laugh your life
'Cause there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts
Live it now
'Cause there ain't much to die for

You gotta drag yourself to work
Drug yourself to sleep
You're dead from the neck up
By the middle of the week

Face front ya' got the future shining
Like a piece of gold
But I swear as we get closer
It look more like a lump of coal
But it's better than some factory
Now that's no place to waste your youth
I worked there for a week once
I luckily got the boot
All the young punks
Laugh your life
'Cause there ain't much to cry for
All you young cunts
Live it now
'Cause there ain't much to die forEmbed
