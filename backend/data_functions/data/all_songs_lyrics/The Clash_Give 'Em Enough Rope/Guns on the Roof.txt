Guns on the Roof LyricsI swear by Almighty God
To tell the whole truth
And nothin' but the truth
Guns guns (x4)
They torture all the women and children
Then they've put the men to the gun
Because across the human frontier
Freedom's always on the run
Guns guns, a-shakin' in terror
Guns guns, killin' in error
Guns guns, guilty hands
Guns guns, shatter the lands
A system built by the sweat of the many
Creates assassins to kill off the few
Take any place and call it a court house
This is a place where no judge can stand
Sue the lawyers and burn all the papers
Unlock the keys of the legal rapers
A jury of a billion faces
Shouted out condemned out of hand
Guns guns, and nobody's kiddin'
Guns guns, or foolin' around
Guns guns, the violence is singin'
Guns guns, a silence the sound
And I like to be in Africa
A'beatin' on the final drum
I like to be in U.S.S.R
Makin' sure these things will come
I like to be in U.S.A
Pretendin' that the wars are done
And I like to be in Europe
Saying goodbye to everyone
Guns guns, guns on the roof
Guns guns, made to shoot (x5)1Embed
