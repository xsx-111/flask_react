Bluejean Bop Lyrics
Bluejean baby, with your big blue eyes
Don't want you looking at other guys
Got to make you give me, one more chance
I can't keep still, so baby let's dance

Well the bluejean bop is the bop for me
Well it's the bop that's done in a dungaree
You dip your hip, free your knee
Squeal on your heel baby, one two three

Well the bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won't you bop with Gene
Bop Blue Caps, bop!

Well bluejean baby when I bop with you
Well my heart starts a-hoppin' like a kangaroo
My feet do things they never done before
Well bluejean baby, give me more more more

Well the bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won't you bop with Gene
Rock again Blue Caps, go!
Well the bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, bluejean bop
Oh baby, bluejean bop, baby won't you bop with Gene
Blue Caps, bop with Gene, now let's go!

Well it's the bluejean, bluejean bop
Bluejean, bluejean bop oh baby
Bluejean, bluejean bop
Bluejean, bluejean bop
Bluejean, baby won't you bop with GeneEmbed
