Waltz of the Wind LyricsYou were there in my arms, alone in the moonlight
The trees played the waltz of the wind
It was there I knew I'd love you forever
We danced to the waltz of the wind
The stars up above you, look down in your eyes
And told me the night will never end
Now I' m dreamin' of you
Till we meet tomorrow
And dance to the waltz of the wind
The stars up above you, look down in your eyes
And told me the night will never еnd
Now I' m dreamin' of you
Till we meet tomorrow
And dance to thе waltz of the windEmbed
