Bop Street Lyrics(Talking intro by Dickie and Wee Willie:)
"Hey cat, where are ya goin' man?"
"Man, I'm going down to Bop Street"
"Tell me cat, where's that di-rection?"
"Man, ain't you heard? They got one of 'em in every town"
"Real cool"
Ba-a-op Street, Ba-a-op Street
Oh, it's the cat and kittens of ol' Bop Street
Jumpin' Jacks, they ain't no square
A green paint pants and great pair
On Bop Street they're the main attraction
'Cause they're the cats who crave the action
A-jumpin' here, a-jumpin' there
A-jump jump jumpin' everyhere
The Jumpin' Jacksons are hard to beat
'Cause they're the cats 'n' kittens of ol' Bop Street (Rock)
Well, a dreamy day when it starts at nine
A-rockin' and a-rollin' all the time
A-green blue jeans and crazy shoes
A-jumpin' on Bop Street, losing the blues
A-jumpin' here, a-jumpin' there
A-jump jump jumpin' everyhere
The Jumpin' Jacksons are hard to beat
'Cause they're the cats 'n' kittens of ol' Bop Street (jump, Jack, jump)
Well it's the street where the cool cats go
To spend their time and their hard earned dough
A-boppin' on Bop Street, goin' 'round
The juke box music with the rockin' sound
Well a-jumpin' here, jumpin' there
A-jump jump jumpin' everyhere
The Jumpin' Jacksons are hard to beat
'Cause they're the cats 'n' kittens of ol' Bop Street
Ba-a-op Street, Ba-a-op Street
"Come on man, let's get going"
"Yeah, let's go on down to Bop Street"
Ba-a-op StreetEmbed
