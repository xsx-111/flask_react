Who Slapped John? LyricsWell I heard John say, man, she's my gal
I heard another say, man, she my pal
Well John jumped up, then he screamed
Well-she's may gal, man, and that I mean
Well, who-who, who slapped John?
Who-who, who slapped John?
Baby, who slapped John when the lights went low-oh?
Who-who, who slapped John?
(Jump...go cats go, all you cats cool it, etc.)
Well, the lights went on, then went off
John got slapped tryin' to hold his own
Well, who-who, who slapped John?
Who-who, who slapped John?
Baby, who slapped John when the lights went low-oh?
Who-who, who slapped John?
(Jump...more of Dickie's adlibs)
Well I heard John say, man, she's my gal
I heard another say, man, she my pal
Well John jumped up, then he screamed
She's may gal, man, and that I mean
Well, who-who, who slapped John?
Who-who, who slapped John?
Baby, who slapped John when the lights were low-oh?
Who-who, who slapped John?
(Jump...go-go-go John go, etc.)
Well, the lights went on, then went off
John got slapped tryin' to hold his own
Well, who-who, who slapped John?
Who-who, who slapped John?
Baby, who slapped John when the lights went low-oh?
Who-who, who slapped John?Embed
