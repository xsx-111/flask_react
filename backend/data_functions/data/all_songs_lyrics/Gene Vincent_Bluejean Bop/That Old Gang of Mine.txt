That Old Gang of Mine LyricsNot a soul down on the corner
That's a pretty certain sign
Those wedding bells are breaking up
That old gang of mine
All the boys are singing love songs
They forgot sweet Adeline
Those wedding bells are breaking up
That old gang of mine
Well, there goes Jack, there goes Jim
Strollin' down lover's lane
Now and then, we meet again
But they don't seem the same
Life gets that lonesome feeling
Then I hear the church bells ring
Those wedding bells are breaking up
That old gang of mine
Well, there goes Jack, there goes Jim
Strollin' down lover's lane
Now and then, we meet again
But they don't seem the same
Life gets that lonesome feeling
Then I hear the church bells ring
Those wedding bells are breaking up
That old gang of mineEmbed
