I Flipped LyricsWell, I flipped-flipped, flipped-a-flipped
I flipped-flipped, flipped-a-flipped
I flipped-flipped, flipped-a-flipped
I flipped-flipped, flipped-a-flipped
I flipped my lane, I be in my town
When I get a-rollin' on a real cool bop
I flipped-flipped, flipped-a-flipped
I flipped-flipped, flipped-a-flipped
Well my baby wandered in about a quarter to nine
A-put it to me right on the line
She said you're square, join the ol' rat-race
And come on hit the beat at a rapid pace
My-oh-my and slow-girl-slow
A-come and get with it and go-girl-go
Go!
Well, I slipped-slipped, slipped-a-slipped
I slipped-slipped, slipped-a-slipped
I slipped-slipped, slipped-a-slipped
I slipped-slipped, slipped-a-slipped
I slipped her calm, I swivel my back
Makin' like a jumping Jack
I slipped-slipped, slipped-a-slipped
I slipped-slipped, slipped-a-slipped
