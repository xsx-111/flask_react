Jumps, Giggles & Shouts LyricsOh, I got a girl and her name is Jane
All the kids call her, "Couldn't Tame"
Always boppin' 'round the town
Every bit of all her pound
She jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts
Jump, Cliff, jump, jump
Oh, I got a girl and her name is Lizzy
Ah, man that woman sure is dizzy
Boppin' to the juke machine
Craziest cat you ever seen
She jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts
Jump, Jack, jump, jump
She jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts
Jump, Dickie, jump, jump
Oh, I got a girl and her name is Lizzy
Ah, man that woman sure is dizzy
Boppin' to the juke machine
Craziest cat you ever seen
She jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts
Jump, Cliff, jump, jump
She jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts, go
Jumps, giggles and shouts
Go, go, go, goEmbed
