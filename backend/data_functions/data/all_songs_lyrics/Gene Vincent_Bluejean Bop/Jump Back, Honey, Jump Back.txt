Jump Back, Honey, Jump Back LyricsWell, jump back, honey, jump back
Jump back, honey, jump back
Jump back, honey, jump back
Jump back, honey, jump back
Jump back, honey, jump back
Jump back (Rock cats, rock!)
Well, my baby seen me home last night
Jump back, honey, jump back
Held me long and squeezed me tight
Jump back, honey, jump back
Heard her sigh her little sigh
Seen the lovelight in her eye
Jump back, honey, jump back
Jump back, honey, jump back
Heard the wind blow through the pines
Jump back, honey, jump back
Mockingbirds were singing fine
Jump back, honey, jump back
And my heart was beating sore
When I brought her to the door
Jump back, honey, jump back
Jump back, honеy, jump back
I put my arms around her waist
Jump back, honey, jump back
Raised hеr lips and took a taste
Jump back, honey, jump back
Love me honey, dee-da-do
And she answered, 'course I doEmbed
