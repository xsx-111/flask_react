Up a Lazy River LyricsWell, up a lazy river, by the old mill run
The lazy, hazy river, in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind oak tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me
Well, up a lazy river, where the robin's song
Wakes a bright new morning, we can loaf along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me
Well, up a lazy river, where the robin's song
Wakes a bright new morning, we can loaf along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you can be
Up a lazy river with meEmbed
