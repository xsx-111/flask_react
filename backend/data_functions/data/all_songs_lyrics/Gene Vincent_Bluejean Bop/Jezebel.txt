Jezebel LyricsJezebel. It was you
If ever the devil was born
Without a pair of horns
It was you
Jezebel, it was you
If ever an angel fell
Jezebel
It was you
Jezebel, it was you
If ever a pair of eyes
Promised paradise
Deceiving me, grieving me
Leavin' me blue
Jezebel, it was you
If ever the devil's plan
Was made to torment man
It was you
Jezebel, it was you
If ever a pair of eyes
Promised paradise
Deceiving me, grieving me
Leavin' me blue
Jezebel, it was you
If ever the devil's plan
Was made to torment man
It was you
Night an' day, Jezebel
Oh, Jezebel, Jezebel, JezebelEmbed
