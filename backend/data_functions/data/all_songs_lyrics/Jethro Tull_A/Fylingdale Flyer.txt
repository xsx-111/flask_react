Fylingdale Flyer Lyrics
Through clear skies tracking lightly from far down the line
No fanfare, just a blip on the screen
No quick conclusions now, everything will be fine
Short-circuit glitch and not what it seems

Fylingdale Flyer, you're only half way there
Green screen liar, for a second or so we were running scared

On late shift, feeling drowsy eyes glued to the display
Dead cert alert, lit match to the straw
One last quick game of bowls, we can still win the day
Fail-safe, forget the things that you saw

Fylingdale Flyer, you're only half way there
Green screen liar, for a second or so we were running scared

They checked the systems through and they read a-okay
Some tiny fuse had probably blown
Sit back, relax and soon it will just go away
Keep your hands off that red telephone
Fylingdale Flyer, you're only half way there
Green screen liar, for a second or so we were running scared

Fylingdale Flyer, you're only half way there
Green screen liar, for a second or so we were running scaredEmbed
