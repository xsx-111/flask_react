Protect and Survive LyricsThey said protect and you'll survive
(But our postman didn't call)
8 lbs. of over-pressure wave seemed to glue him to the wall
They said protect and you'll survive
E.M.P. took out the radio
(And our milk-man didn't call)
Flash blinded by the pretty lights
Didn't see his bottles fall
Or feel the warm black rain arrive
Big friendly cloud builds in the West
(And our dust-men haven't called)
They left the dual carriageway at a hundred miles an hour
A tail wind chasing them away
And in deep shelters lurk below, sub-regional control
Who sympathise but cannot help
To mend your body or your soul
Self-appointed guardians of the race with egg upon their face
When steady sirens sing all-clear they pop up
Find nobody here
And so I watch two new suns spin
(Our paper man doesn't call)
Burnt shadow printed on the road
Now there's nothing there at all
They said protect and you'll surviveEmbed
