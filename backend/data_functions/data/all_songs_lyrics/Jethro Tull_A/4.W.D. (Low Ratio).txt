4.W.D. (Low Ratio) LyricsMet a man just the other day ---
Said his name was Jim. Boy, won't you take a look!
Got a car for you --- it's a real steal
Cleaned it right down --- new brakes, clutch and here's the hook
Yes, it's a 4.W.D. (low ratio)
Cash to Jim. I took it home
Through the deep mud. Plugged happy as a boy in sand
Fitted wide tyres, spotlight, a winch as well
And some brush bars up front to complete the plan
Now it's really a 4.W.D. (low ratio)
Take you down to the edge of town
Where the road stops, we start to hold the ground
Well, I'm blessed! Got traction in a special way
Hold the roll bar, slide back, feel me pull it round
Let me show you my 4.W.D. (low ratio)Embed
