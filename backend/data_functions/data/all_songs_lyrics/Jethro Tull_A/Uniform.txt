Uniform LyricsSee black, see yellow with little notebooks drawn
See grey stripes bowling down the street
Silver streaks and T-shirts so precisely torn
Strange foreign chaps in white bed-sheets ---
Uniforms
See golden halo'd men of high renown
Prance to the politicians' beat
Well tailored in unswerving elegance
With shoes by Gucci on their feet ---
Uniforms
How do you know who the hell you are?
Wake up each day under a different star
Dressed to the nines, meet yourself going home
Like a clone, smartly dressed in your pressed uniform
White battle dress on green pitch, proud eleven
Beneath the swelling box so neat
The teeming millions of the future fly ---
The spinning cricket ball to cheat
They're all uniformEmbed
