And Further On LyricsWe saw the heavens break and all the world go down to sleep
And rocks on mossy banks drip acid rain from craggy steeps
Saw fiery angels kiss the dawn
Wish you goodbye till further on
Will you still be there further on?
And troubled dynasties, like legions lost, have blown away
Hounds hard upon their heels call to their quarry --- wait and play
Before the last faint light has gone
Wish you goodbye till further on
Will you still be there further on?
The angry waves grow high --- cut icy teeth on northern shores
Brave fires that flicker, cough --- give way to winds
Through broken doors
And with the last line almost drawn --- wish you goodbye till further on
Will we still be here further on?Embed
