Batteries Not Included LyricsSix o'clock in the morning
Wake up by the bed
There sits a new Japanese toy
And I like it
See the name on the wrapping
Can't read yet but I know
It's made for me (lucky boy)
And I want it
Lights that flash, wheels that go round
Digital display
Fresh silicon chips to enjoy
And I need them
Where's the batteries?
Sitting silent and empty
Wish I could breathe life
In my new friend who's terribly still
And I like him
Just like me, perhaps he's hungry
Six volts make him smile
And twelve volts would probably kill
How I like him
Daddy, where's the batteries?
I can't find my batteries
Daddy, where's the batteries?
Where are they?
I can't find my batteries
Where are they?
(There's no batteries)
Seven o'clock in the morning
They find me by the bed
With my friend the Japanese toy
I am with him
Mummy, Daddy --- can't see you
Hear you. Batteries not
Included in this little boy
Where's my batteries?Embed
