First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love Lyrics
Gypsy, please
Won't you give me
The secret key
Of life's mystery?
Then she said

First hand experience
In second hand love
You need
First hand experience
In second hand love

Gypsy girl
Won't you unfurl
The flag of life
Before my eyes?
And she said

First hand experience
In second hand love
You need
First hand experience
In second hand love
Then she read my hand
Then she read my eyes
Said I am a man
Who must learn to cry
Then she took her cards
The Tarot pack of truth
Gazed towards the stars
Said I must learn to lose
Gypsy girl
Oh, can't you see
That you're the one
I really need?
She said I need

First hand experience
In second hand love
I need
First hand experience
In second hand love

Then she read my hand
Then she read my eyes
Said I am a man
Who must learn to cry
Then she took her cards
The Tarot pack of truth
Gazed towards the stars
Said I must learn to lose
Gypsy, please
I want to be
A part of you
Oh, tell me please
But she just said

First hand experience
In second hand love
You need
First hand experience
In second hand loveEmbed
