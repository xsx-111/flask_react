From Here to Eternity Lyrics
From here to eternity
That's where she takes me
From here to eternity
With love, with love, with love

Baby, baby, baby gives me loving
Leaves me needing nothing, nothing left to need
Baby, baby, baby's got me sighing
Nearly has me dying, dying of the need

From here to eternity
That's where she takes me
From here to eternity
She does, she does
She does, she does
From here to eternity
That's where she leads me
From here to eternity
With love, with love
With love, with love

Baby, baby, baby, makes me feel good
Feels good now she makes me love me once again
Baby, baby, loving her is easy
Easy how she loves me, love me once again
From here to eternity
That's where she takes me
From here to eternity
She does, she does
She does, she does
From here to eternity
That's where she leads me
From here to eternity
With love, with love
With love, with love
From here to eternity
That's where she takes me
From here to eternity
She does, she does
She does, she does
From here to eternity
That's where she leads me
From here to eternity
With love, with love
With love, with love

From here to eternity
That's where she takes me
From here to eternity
With love, with love, with love
Baby, baby, baby, babyEmbed
