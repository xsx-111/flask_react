Too Hot to Handle LyricsThe lady looks like she's been around
She's covered a lot of ground
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gamble
The lady knows love sure ain't no game
She's been through too much pain
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gamble
Too close for comfort, don't wanna get hurt
Too bad it's no good, I'd only lose
Lady's gonna make a fool of me
Gonna make a fool of me
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gamble
Lady's gonna let you think you'll win
Then she's gonna let you lose
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gamble
Too close for comfort, don't wanna get hurt
Too bad it's no good, I'd only lose
The lady's got a reputation here
Got a reputation there
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gamble
The lady's got a lot of satin charm
And that can do you harm, you harm
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gamble
Too close for comfort, don't wanna get hurt
Too bad it's no good, I'd only lose
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gamble
Too close for comfort, don't wanna get hurt
Too bad it's no good, I'd only lose
Too hot to handle, ain't gonna gambleEmbed
