The Emperor Lyrics
Come here, closer

Who do you
Who do you think you are?
Some kind of super star?
We'll see
Where do you?
Where do you think you are?
That shit won't get you far
With me

You're just so dashing
You marvel at the sound
Of your own voice, as you crash into the ground

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes

Just so you know
That's how it goes
You're bad
You're bad for my health
Because you make me sick
You prick
Don't you know?
Don't you know who I am?
You know I'd like your face
To kick

If your lips are moving I know you must be lying
You even suck the life out of dying

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes


The house of cards are falling
Luck is running thin
Father forgive him, being a punk is not a sin
You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes

You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
And everybody knows
Except you2Embed
