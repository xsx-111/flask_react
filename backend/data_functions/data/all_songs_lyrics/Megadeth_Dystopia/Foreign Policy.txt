Foreign Policy Lyrics
Eliminate the incompetents
Differences don't exist in harmony
Survival is superiority
We don't need no hands across the sea

We've got
Foreign policy
Foreign policy
Foreign policy

The lines are drawn
Establish the new order
Suspect everyone
Know your enemies

We've got
Foreign policy
Foreign policy
Foreign policy

We've got
Foreign policy
Foreign policy
Foreign policy

Hatred is purity
Weakness is disease
Where we bury you
It's manifest destiny

We've got
Foreign policy
Foreign policy
Foreign policy
Foreign policy
Foreign policy
We've got
Foreign policy
Foreign policyEmbed
