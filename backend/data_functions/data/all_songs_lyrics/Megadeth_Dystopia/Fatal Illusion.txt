Fatal Illusion Lyrics

Lost inside the system, locked away without a key
No one will ever miss a menace to society
A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite
A touchy hair-pin trigger and such a wasted life

Trying to break the mold of a broken family
Fight against your failure and living on his knees
Guilty of a crime of non-conformity
A hanging judge and jury handed down the penalty
A lethal injection, now they watch the body jerk
Exterminate the problem, except it didn't work

No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn't there
Coroner never checked because he didnâ€™t fucking care
Passing off the body, they all believed he died
Starting up the hearse now for a final drive
Like whistling past a graveyard, when walking by at night
It's a fatal illusion to think that evil ever dies

In a darkened mortuary reeking of formaldehyde
Aroused from deadly slumber
Something opened up his eyes
Spilling of their blood was a promise that he'd keep
Hate so strong revived him
From a deep necrotic sleep

Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed
He grabbed a knife
And set out on a vivisection spree

A butcher hell bent, massacring each one with his blade
From the first one to the last
He dispatched them to the grave

It's a fatal illusion
It's a fatal illusion
Evil never dies, It never dies5Embed
