Day-Dream LyricsLook at the sky with me
The clouds tell us a story
There is a lovely gypsy queen
It lives in rainbow land
One day a caliph came down from the rainbow
And saw the little gypsy
Sitting there among the coloured clouds
And she seemed to be very unhappy
So he ask her
Why do you look so sad
You live in rainbow land
And everyone is lucky here
And the gypsy replied
I like to know all about things
Happen in the world
But nobody will tell me
No one seems to know
Don't worry, little caliph said
I think I can help you
Take that little magic ball
When you look inside
You can see the whole world
And all things that happen in it
I will come to see after a year
To know if you'll be happier
And he vanished
In the secret of the universe
And he vanished
In the secret of the universe
In the secret of the universe
In the secret of the universe
In the secret of the universe
In the secret of the universe
In the secret of the universeEmbed
