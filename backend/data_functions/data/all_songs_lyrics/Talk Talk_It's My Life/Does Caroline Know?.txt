Does Caroline Know? Lyrics
Maybe when the heat's away, you're fine
To put another drink away
Is out of line
Out of line

So easy with a thief to blame
For breaking every pledge I've made
Does it matter if I can't say
Caroline knows?

Every little accident takes time
Forget about mistakes I've made
They're left behind
Left behind

So easy with a thief to blame
For breaking every pledge I've made
Does it matter if I can't say
Caroline knows?
Caroline knows

So easy with a thief to blame
For breaking every pledge I've made
Does it matter if I can't say
Does it matter if I can't say
Caroline knows?Embed
