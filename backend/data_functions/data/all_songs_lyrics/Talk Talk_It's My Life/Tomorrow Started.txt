Tomorrow Started Lyrics
Don't look back until you've tried
A line so openly a lie
'Outside of you, it's just tomorrow starting'
I've said I'm wrong when I've been right
I've seen times when I've been sure but still I find

I'm just the first that you take
Are there reasons everybody pays
They never seem to be any use
They never seem to be any use
It's just tomorrow starting

Don't look back until you've tried
With time you'll endlessly arrive
Outside of use with just tomorrow starting
See my eyes tell me I'm not lying

I'm just the first that you take
Are there reasons everybody pays
They never seem to be any use
They never seem to be any use
It's just tomorrow started

See my eyes tell me I'm not lying
I'm just the first that you take
Are there reasons everybody pays
They never seem to be any use
They never seem to be any use
It's just tomorrow started1Embed
