The Last Time Lyrics
One by one
Every courtesy is gone
And the show begins
Bring on the clowns
Pain is quiet
I've laughed at silence
For the last time

Let the show begin
For the last time

Sometimes one
Sometimes each of us is wrong
But the show begins
Bring on the clowns
Blind to reason
These eyes are dreaming
For the last time

Let the show begin
For the last time
Let the show begin

Bring on the clowns
Smiling sweetly
Doubt may leave me
For the last time

Let the show begin
For the last time
Let the show begin
Let the show begin
For the last time
For the last time
Let the show begin
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
For the last timeEmbed
