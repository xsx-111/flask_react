Hey Porter Lyrics
Hey porter, hey porter would you tell me the time?
How much longer will it be 'til we cross that Mason Dixon Line?
At daylight would you tell the engineer to slow it down?
Or better still, just stop the train 'cause I want to look a round

Hey porter, hey porter what time did you say?
How much longer will it be 'til I can see the light of day?
When we hit Dixie would you tell the engineer to ring his bell?
And tell everybody that ain't asleep to stand right up and yell

Hey porter, hey porter please, go on and get my bags for me
I don't need nobody to tell me now that I'm in Tennessee
We're not so far from home, you know, and it's a-getting light outside
This old train is a-puffin' smoke and I have to strain in my eyes

Hey porter, hey porter please open up the door
When this train stops I'm gonna get off first 'cause I can't wait no more
Tell the engineer I say, "Thanks a lot and I didn't mind the fare"
I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil, I'm gonna breathe that Southern airEmbed
