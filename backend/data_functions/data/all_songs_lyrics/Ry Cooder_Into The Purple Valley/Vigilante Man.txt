Vigilante Man Lyrics
Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've been hearin' his name all over the land

Rainy nights down in the engine house
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse
A man come along, chase us out in the rain
Was that a vigilante man?

Well, I rambled around from town to town
Now, I rambled around from town to town
And they herded us around like a wild herd of cattle
Was that the vigilante man?

Well, why does a vigilante man
Tell me, why does a vigilante man
Carry that sawed-off shot-gun in his hand?
Would he shoot his brother and sister down?

Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've been hearin' his name all over the landEmbed
