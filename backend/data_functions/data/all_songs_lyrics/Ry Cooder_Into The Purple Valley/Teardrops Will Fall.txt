Teardrops Will Fall Lyrics
I read your letter and tears filled my eyes
All of your promises fading, was nothing but lies
So I turned your photograph over, face to the wall
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight
Teardrops will fall

Teardrops will fall tonight
Tears I can't hide
Tears that I tried to keep
Deep down inside
Tears fall, a love that's gone
Beyond re call
And when I dim the lights in my room to night
Teardrops will fall


I'm gonna pray tonight, baby
Hoping you will hear
Maybe you'll right the wrong, now
And dry each tear
I'll sit alone tonight hoping you will call
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight
Teardrops will fall
Teardrops will fall tonight
Tears I can't hide
Tears that I tried to keep
Deep down inside
Tears fall, a love that's gone
Beyond re call
And when I dim the lights in my room to night
Teardrops will fallEmbed
