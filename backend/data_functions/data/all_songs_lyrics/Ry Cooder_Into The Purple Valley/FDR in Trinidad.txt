FDR in Trinidad Lyrics
When Roosevelt came to the land of the hummingbird
Shouts of welcome were heard
Roosevelt came to the land of the hummingbird
Shouts of welcome were heard
His visit to their island is bound to be
An epoch in local history
Definitely marking the new era
Keeping Trinidad in America

For this great man jubilation
Was evinced by the entire population
Friendship for the U.S.A. was shown
And from his house the stars and the stripes were flown
For the state to open the gate
To the president of these United States
In fact everybody was glad
To welcome Roosevelt to Trinidad

We are privileged to see the democratic
President of the great republic
With his charming and genial personality
And his wonderful urbanity
We were struck by his modest style
And was intrigued by the famous Roosevelt smile
No wonder everybody was glad
To welcome Roosevelt to Trinidad
Now we understand that the president has just been
On a visit to Brazil and the Argentine
Mr. Cordell Hull in attendance
They took part in a peace conference
To stop war and atrocity
And make the world safe for democracy
The greatest event in the century
In the interest of suffering humanityEmbed
