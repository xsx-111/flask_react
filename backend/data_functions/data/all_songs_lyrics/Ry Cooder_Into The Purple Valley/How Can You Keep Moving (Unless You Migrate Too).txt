How Can You Keep Moving (Unless You Migrate Too) Lyrics
How can you keep on moving unless you migrate too
They tell ya to keep on moving but migrate, you must not do
The only reason for moving and the reason why I roam
To move to a new location and find myself a home

I can't go back to the homestead, the shack no longer stands
They said I was unneeded, had no claim to the land
They said, "Come on, get moving, it's the only thing for you"
But how can you keep moving unless you migrate too

Now if you pitch your little tent along the broad highway
The Board of Sanitation says, "Sorry, you can't stay"
Come on, come on, get moving it's the everlasting cry
Can't stay, can't go back, can't migrate, so where in the hell am I

How can you keep on moving unless you migrate too
They tell ya to keep on moving but migrate, you must not do
The only reason for moving and the reason why I roam
Is to move to a new location and find myself a homeEmbed
