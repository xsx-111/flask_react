Money Honey Lyrics
Well, the landlord rang my front door bell
I let it rang for a long, long spell
Went to the window, peeked through the blind
Asked him to tell me what was on his mind
He said, "Money honey, money honey, money honey
If you wanna stay here with me"

I was clean and screened and so hard pressed
I called the woman that I love the best
Finally found my baby 'bout a quarter to three
She said, "I'd like to know what you want with me!"
And I said, "Money honey, money honey, money honey
If you wanna get along with me"


Well, she screamed and said
"What's wrong with you?! From this day forward
Our romance is through!"
I said, "Tell me baby, face to face
How could another man take my place?"
And she said, "Money honey, money honey, money honey
If you wanna get along with me"
I've learned my lesson and now i know
Sun may shine, wind may blow
Women may come and women may go
But before I tell 'em that I love 'em so
I want money honey, money honey, money honey
If you wanna get along with me2Embed
