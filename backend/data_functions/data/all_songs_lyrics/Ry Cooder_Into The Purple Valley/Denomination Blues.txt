Denomination Blues Lyrics
I wanna tell you people it's a natural fact
Every man don't understand the Bible alike
And that's all, I tell you that's all
But you better have Jesus
I tell you that's all

Well, the denominations have the right to fight
They ought go on and treat each other right
And that's all, I tell you that's all
You better have Jesus
I tell you that's all

It's right to stand together, wrong to stand apart
When none shall enter heaven but the pure at heart
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all
'Cause you better have Jesus
I'll tell you that's all

Well, the Primitive Baptists they believe
That you can't go to heaven 'less you wash your feet
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all
'Cause you better have Jesus
I tell you that's all
Well, the African Methodists, they believe the same
'Cause they know denomination ain't a thing but a name
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all
'Cause you better have Jesus
I tell you that's all

Well, people that jump from church to church
You can bet their conversion don't amount too much
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all
'Cause you better have Jesus
I tell you that's all

Well, you can go to your college, you can go to your school
But if you ain't got Jesus, you's an educated fool
And that's all, I'll tell you that's all
'Cause you better have Jesus
I tell you that's allEmbed
