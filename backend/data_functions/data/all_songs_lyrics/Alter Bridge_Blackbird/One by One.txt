One by One Lyrics
Underneath the desert sun
They bid my brother's blood to run
Many miles away
Hell has come today
Fire raining from the sky
See the face of fear asking one last time
Let me get home safe
Before it's too late

One by one
The brave will fall (Brave will fall)
Life is lost again
They gave it all (Gave it all)

Deep within the castle walls
So many grieve as funeral songs
Echo endlessly
Ode to memories
This sacrifice of flesh and blood
For a promised land that may not be won
Let us not forget
The hero laid to rest
One by one
The brave will fall (Brave will fall)
Life is lost again
They gave it all (Gave it all)

And they gave it all
A price we can't ignore
Is there hope in what they're dying for?
For every hero born
From every family torn
We will honor you forever more

One by one
The brave will fall (The brave will fall)
Life is lost again (Life is lost again)
They gave it all (Gave it all)
One by one
The brave will fall (The brave will fall)
Life is lost again (Life is lost again)
They gave it all (Gave it all)
They gave it allEmbed
