The Damage Done Lyrics
I won't waste away
I won't let this take me down
I can survive as long as I keep it around
I wish it would fade
But it'll just sell me out
Over and over and over I cry out loud

Somebody save me
Somebody save me

The race I run
It keeps me further from the man I could become
The damage done
I wanna wash the filth away till there is none

How long till I break
From the weight of what's killing me
Confused to the day
I'll suffer, afraid to speak
I carry the shame and beg for the remedy
How long must I live with the damage of my disease
Somebody save me
Somebody save me

The race I run
It keeps me further from the man I could become
The damage done
I wanna wash the filth away till there is none


The race I run
It keeps me further from the man I could become
The damage done
I wanna wash the filth away till there is noneEmbed
