New Way to Live Lyrics
In your head, monsters call
In the end, you find there was none there at all
But you keep them alive
Paralyzed, you cannot run, you only crawl

So find a new way to live
Before you die in the cold
And though the sky's caving in
The fear must not gain control
And do not worry, my friend
Or make this call by your soul
And find a new way to live
Before your fate's set in stone

Will it come to an end
What you fear you must confess is what you want
Will you ever survive
All the monsters of the mind where all is wrong

So find a new way to live
Before you die in the cold
And though the sky's caving in
The fear must not gain control
And do not worry, my friend
Or make this call by your soul
And find a new way to live
Before your fate's set in stone
It pulls me down like the heaviest of stone
And I am only flesh and bone
And so I walk through this valley all alone
I can't take this anymore, no


{I just can't take this anymore}
{I just can't take this anymore}

So find a new way to live
Before you die in the cold
And though the sky's caving in
The fear must not gain control
And do not worry, my friend
Or make this call by your soul
And find a new way to live
Before your fate's set in stoneEmbed
