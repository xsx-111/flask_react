White Knuckles Lyrics
Are you still lost tonight
Living but dead inside
This is a proclamation
This is a call to rise
Are you abused, alone?
Walking with broken bones
If you feel you've been forgotten
Let this song guide you home

We are the disillusioned
We've been left wanting more
Before every aspiration
Hits the floor

Hold on for your life
All we feel is so far from alive
The damned are done believing
And the cursed can dream no more
So hold on for your life
Because only the strong survive

They tell you what you should be
They sell you their plastic dreams
Opinions are all provided
But nothing is what it seems
I dare you to take control
Just empty your hands
And bruise all the souls
Of those who show no resistance
And those who are weak below
We are the disenchanted
We die with each passing day
And no one here understands us
So I say..

Hold on for your life
All we feel is so far from alive
The damned are done believing
And the cursed can dream no more
So hold on for your life
Because only the strong survive

How would it feel?
To live a lie
Until your dying day
When nothing is real
As we sacrifice
Bending until we break
It's been revealed
Hold on for your life
Dreams are not theirs to take
Your dreams are not theirs to take
Hold on for your life
All we feel is so far from alive
The damned are done believing
And the cursed can dream no more
So hold on for your life
Because only the strong
I said only the strong surviveEmbed
