Before Tomorrow Comes Lyrics
I couldn't sleep, I had to listen
To a conscience, knowing so well
That nothing comes from indifference
I look inside of myself
Will I find some kind of conviction?
Or will I bid the hero farewell?
Or will I be defined by things that could've been?
I guess time will only tell
I guess time will only tell

So don't let it be
Before tomorrow comes
Before you turn away
Take the hand in need
Before tomorrow comes
You can change everything

I curse my worth and every comfort
That blinded me for way too long
Damn it all, I'll make a difference from now on
Cause I'm wide awake to it all
Cause I'm wide awake to it all
So don't let it be
Before tomorrow comes
Before you turn away
Take the hand in need
Before tomorrow comes
You can change everything

Does anyone care
It ain't right, what we're doing
Does anyone care
It ain't right, where we're going
Does anyone dare
Justify how we're living
Does anyone here care at all?

So don't let it be
Before tomorrow comes
Before you turn away
Take the hand in need
Before tomorrow comes
You can change everything

We could be so much more than we are
We could be so much more than we are
We could be so much more than we are
Oh this much I knowEmbed
