Coming Home Lyrics
You Think You Know Me (Edge Version Only)

As I peel away
All the years of pain
I've discovered what's been all along
You were so right (You were so right)
I was so wrong (I was so wrong)
Every shooting star
They all fall so hard
They all fade like a played out song
Now is the time (Now is the time)
Before all is lost

I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)

So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I'll rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
I'm coming home
Rushing back to me
As the city sleeps
So afraid of what I will find
Memories they haunt (Memories they haunt)
From deep inside
Every broken man
Comes to understand
That he'll never find paradise (Never find paradise)
When all that he wants
Was there all the time

I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)

So I'm coming home
Lost on a road I don't belong
I'll rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I called my own
So I'm coming home
Back to a world left long ago
And now I know I'm coming home
I'll find my way back, I'm letting go
I'm coming home
We've come to find
What we take for granted
Keeps us alive in the end
So don't let time
Leave you empty-handed
Reach out tonight and make amends

So I'm coming home
Back to the place where I belong
I'll rest my soul, I'm so alone
Far from the streets I call my own
(I'm coming) So I'm coming home
Back to a world left long ago
And now I know I'm coming home
I'll find my way back, I'm coming home

I'm coming home
(I'm coming home)
I'm coming home
(I'm coming home)1Embed
