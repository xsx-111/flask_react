Wayward One Lyrics
And they cry
And they call
As the wayward walk alone
City lights
Urban sprawl
In a place no one should know

Show no grace
Show no love
These mean streets are meant for none

Take them back to the start
Let the purest of heart
Know their worth is still spoken
As they fight to exist
We neglect and resist
Let the circle be broken

Broken homes, broken lives
They repeat themselves in time
It's passed on (It's passed on)
Down the line (Down the line)
Till we heal the wounds inside
It's not too late (not too late)
To make things right (make things right)
Dress the wounds with
Loves pure light

Take them back to the start
Let the purest of heart
Know their worth is still spoken
As they fight to exist
We neglect and resist
Let the circle be broken

They're still waiting
They still cry
They want to know they'll be all right
All I'm saying, can we try
To bring the wayward ones back home tonight
Bring the wayward ones back home tonight

Take them back to the start
Let the purest of heart
Know their worth is still spoken
As they fight to exist
We neglect and resist
Let the circle be brokenEmbed
