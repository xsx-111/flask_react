Ties That Bind Lyrics
I tear on the leash that keeps me contained and controlled
Let me go, I want to break free and bite my way out of this hole

One last hope to rise and break away
Above the faded line, way beyond the ties that bind
This I know - the risk is worth the gain
It's worth the sacrifice, way beyond the ties that bind

I run but the chains pull me right back to the floor
You control, I rattle the cage, I won't be your slave anymore

One last hope to rise and break away
Above the faded line, way beyond the ties that bind
This I know - the risk is worth the gain
It's worth the sacrifice, way beyond the ties that bind

You broke me into pieces, don't tell me what to be
Damn you all, I'm gonna find my way

One last hope to rise and break away
Above the faded line, way beyond the ties that bind
This I know - the risk is worth the gain
It's worth the sacrifice, way beyond the ties that bind
