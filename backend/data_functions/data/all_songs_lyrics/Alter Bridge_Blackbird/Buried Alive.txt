Buried Alive Lyrics
I twist and turn in the darkest space
Can't find my worth as I numb the pain
Glass to the sky with a black tooth grin
This whiskey smile takes me down again

I'm cold and I'm so afraid
That I'm too weak and I can't change

I've been buried alive and I don't want to be here anymore
Reached out a thousand times for a hand to pull me from below
I've been buried alive in a world of constant sorrow
Reached down tonight and set me free, save tomorrow

Another shot, slip into the haze
Another night, soaked in my disgrace
Toast to the lie, I'll raise my glass and run
A wasted life, what've I become?

I've been buried alive and I don't want to be here anymore
Reached out a thousand times for a hand to pull me from below
I've been buried alive in a world of constant sorrow
Reached out tonight and set me free, save tomorrow
Save tomorrow
Save tomorrow


Let me breathe again and show me where I begin
To find a will to change before I lose everything

I've been buried alive and I don't want to be here anymore
Reached out a thousand times for a hand to pull me from below
I've been buried alive in a world of constant sorrow
Reached out tonight and set me free and I will follow

I've been buried alive
I've been buried alive
I've been buried aliveEmbed
