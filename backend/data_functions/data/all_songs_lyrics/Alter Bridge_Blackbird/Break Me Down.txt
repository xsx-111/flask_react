Break Me Down Lyrics
It's too late
The time has come
I kept this inside me for way too long
Silence will leave me cold
Lost on a highway
That never takes me home

I wanna step aside
I wanna give it up, before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down
Well there will come a time
When I will come undone, and you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind
Before you break me down

The weight of a thousand lies
And promises broken
Haunt me all the time
You say that you're sure to change
But that black heart reveals that
You'll always stay the same (Always stay the same)
I wanna step aside
I wanna give it up, before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down
Well there will come a time
When I will come undone, and you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind
Before you break me down

And I've realized
Forgiveness is calling
And it's calling
And I deny the reason
I'm falling
Yeah I'm falling
So let go

I wanna step aside
I wanna give it up, before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down
But there will come a time
When I will come undone, and you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind
Before you break me downEmbed
