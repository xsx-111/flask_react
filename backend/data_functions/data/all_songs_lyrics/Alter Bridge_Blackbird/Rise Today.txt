Rise Today Lyrics
The wind is blowing cold
Have we lost our way tonight
Have we lost our hope to sorrow
Feels like we're all alone
Running further from what's right
And there are no more heroes to follow

So what are we becoming
Where did we go wrong

Yeah, oh yeah
I wanna rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh, won't you rise today
And change this world

The sun is beating down
Are we ever gonna change
Can we stop the blood from running
Our time is running out
Hope we find a better way
Before we find we're left with nothing
For every life that's taken
So much love is wasted

Yeah, oh yeah
I wanna rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
So won't you rise today
And change

This world
Only love can set it right
This world
If only peace would never die
It seems to me that we've got each other wrong
Was the enemy just your brother all along

Yeah, oh yeah
I wanna rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh won't you rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
I wanna rise today
And change this world
Yeah, oh yeah
I wanna rise today
And change this worldEmbed
