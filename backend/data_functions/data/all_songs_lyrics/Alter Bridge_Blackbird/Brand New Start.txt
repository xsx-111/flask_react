Brand New Start Lyrics
Against the sky, streams of light call out to me and you
We leave as one, we've just begun to find the solace we're due

This is the life we must choose

We will make a brand new start from the pieces torn apart
The break of day is before us
Cast your sorrows to the wind, let the highway take us in
As we escape the disorder

This desert road that we call home, this is our destiny
We chase the setting sun as we outrun a life of agony

God, how we ache to be free

We will make a brand new start from the pieces torn apart
The break of day is before us
Cast your sorrows to the wind, let the highway take us in
As we escape the disorder

We will make a brand new start from the pieces torn apart
The break of day is before us
Cast your sorrows to the wind, let the highway take us in
As we escape the disorder

We'll make our way, we'll make our way
We'll make our way, we'll make our wayEmbed
