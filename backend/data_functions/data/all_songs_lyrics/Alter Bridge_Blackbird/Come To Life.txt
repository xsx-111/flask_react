Come To Life Lyrics
Hey, tore away the veil of weakness
The enemy now lies beneath us, I think we're safe
Hey, won't be held down any longer
No disgrace and no dishonor, keep us chained

There's nothing we should have to fear (And nothing else)
It's alright, we've come to life (Come to life)
We'll never shed another tear (And nothing else)
It's alright, we've come to life

Hey, the bulletproof are so resilient
To every fool with an opinion, they never break
Oh, by the way, we always scream to find a reason
Never doubt or stop believing and escape

There's nothing we should have to fear (And nothing else)
It's alright. we've come to life (Come to life)
We'll never shed another tear (And nothing else)
It's alright, we've come to life

Now wicked tongues can speak and rewrite history
But you can't keep the truth contained
And like the song was sung, just realize we're one
And don't forget we're here to stay

There's nothing we should have to fear (And nothing else)
It's alright, we've come to life (Come to life)
We'll never shed another tear (And nothing else)
It's alright, we've come to lifeEmbed
