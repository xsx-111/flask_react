Before You Start Your Day Lyrics
Open the slits in your face and start your day
You don't have much time to make your slits look just right

I'm in your mind
I'm singing
I'm in your mind
I'm singing

La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da-da

Look in the mirror and ask your soul if you're alright
Put on the glitter that your soul hides behind

You're in my mind
I'm singing
You're in my mind
I'm singing

La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da-da
Know you were made holy
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing

And in your mind
You're singing
La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da
La-da, la-da-da37Embed
