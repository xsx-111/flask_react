It Was Fear Of Myself That Made Me Odd Lyrics
(Breathe in all the air)

Spinning, arms spread
Crushing the tops
Of mountains
With my hands
As I dive in
To the Pacific
I flood the shorelines
And I exhale
Causing
The ocean's endless waves
As I emerge
Shaking the wreckage
From my head
With my hands

I want
To breathe
Life into the dead sea
As this rain
Forest falls beneath my knees
I want to breathe
Life into the dead sea
Below!
Where is your boat?
You are slow
You are slow
I will play until the sky is black (You...)
Breathe in all the air
Exhale
And choke the land with carbon (...are so slow, slow)
Burn it all
Looking down
From where I stand
I can see the curvature of the Earth
And I want to make it flat

I will play
The sky is black
I will play
Sky is black7Embed
