White Devil LyricsHey kids, we got a new white devil
And it goes in your fucking nose
That's right we got a new white devil
That's how the story goes, story goes
Watch out
Glorify, glamorize
Try to forget your sunken eyes
Your dead fad is a disaster
Your fashion is my fucking cancer
Not so fun, nose is sore
Bloody Kleenex all over the floor
But don't worry, who gives a shit?
All your friends will think you're really hip
Go, go
Your dead fad is a fucking disaster
Go
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in, yeah
Addiction is in, I guess addiction is in this year
You look so good
Convulsing on the floor, ya sugar
And the blood from your nose
Matches your lipstick shade
Go, go, go
What a fucking nightmare
Go, go, go
Look what you have become
White devil, white devil, white devil
Look what you have become
White devil, white devil, white devil
Look what you have become
White devil, white devil, white devil
White devil, white devil, white devil, white devil
White devil, white devil, white devil, white devil
