Side Walk When She Walks Lyrics
Dressed to kill, you look so right
I am drunk with lust tonight
Your wounds are opening wide
And they might be just my size

Now I'm afraid of open water
But I often bathe in sin
Let's be honest
You know you shouldn't bother
Cause with me, it's impossible to win

Dressed to kill, you look so right
I am drunk with lust tonight
Your wounds are opening wide
And they might be just...

There
Was always
Warmth
Between us
There
Was always
Warmth
Between us
Dressed to kill, you look so right
I am drunk with lust tonight
Your wounds are opening wide
And they might be just my size (just my size)
And they might be just my size (just my size)
And they might be just my size (just my size)

Just my size
Just my size
Just my size
Just my size
Just my size1Embed
