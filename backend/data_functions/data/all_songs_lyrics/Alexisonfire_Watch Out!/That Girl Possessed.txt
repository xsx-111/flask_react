That Girl Possessed Lyrics
We won't forget
That girl possessed
We won't forget
That girl possessed
Possessed

Who knew her legacy
Would destroy
Her future?
You had such promise
Before your rape
You had such promise
Before your rape

Born innocent
But something had to give
Exploitation
Erotica and horror
Even a spread
In *Oui* magazine
And your habit of
Getting caught
What a frightful night
Born innocent
But something had to give
We won't, we won't, we won't
We won't forget you
What a frightful night
We won't, we won't, we won't
We won't forget you
What a
Frightful night

You painted a
Picture so graphic
That no one could
They can't see past it
You painted a
Picture so graphic
That no one could. 
They can't see past it

We won't, we won't, we won't
We won't forget you
What a frightful night
We won't, we won't, we won't
We won't forget you
What a frightful night
We won't, we won't
Forget you
What a frightful night
We won't, we won't
Forget you
What a frightful night
We won't forget
That girl possessed
We won't forget
That girl possessed
