Get Fighted LyricsSo make sure you love
Like you've never been hurt
And when you dance, dance
Like there's no one watching you
'Cause you can waste your time
(redefining the day that music died)
Or you can spend your life
(guilt free and ostracized)
'Cause all the fashion
(in the world can't save you now)
It's something, I'll write it down for you
Because this shit is not about pants
And this shit is not about shirts
And this shit is definitely not about hair
This shit is about having a good fucking time
Maybe music isn't dead, maybe music isn't dead
Maybe we all just forgot what it fucking sounded like
'Cause you can waste your time
(redefining the day that music died)
Or you can spend your life
(guilt free and ostracized)
'Cause all the fashion
(in the world can't save you now)
It's something, I'll write it down for you
My greatest gift to you
Is a dance floor
