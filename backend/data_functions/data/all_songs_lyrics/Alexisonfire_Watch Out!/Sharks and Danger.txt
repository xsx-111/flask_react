Sharks and Danger Lyrics
*Phone rings*
St. Catharines Psychiatric Help Line, this is Nancy
"I'm sure this is all gonna sound really ridiculous
And uh...
I don't exactly expect anyone to believe all this
Uh... for the last little while
I've been keeping correspondence with my sanity, and uhh…
I really get the feeling that
I’m starting to lose interest in the letter-writing process
The pieces of the letters
Just get progressively shorter and shorter
Until it’s not even a reply
I uhh... the whole thing makes me really nervous
I just wish I could show you what a huge problem this is"

As life hangs beside me
I gather all that I can
You were never one for confrontation
But now, it lies all in your hands
Your hands, your hands...

"I kind of have this... Really terrible habit of asking myself all these stupid questions, right? Like what if uhh… what if there's a spot on my body that I can touch to keep my heart from beating? or like what if, what if there's this uhh... stray bullet out there that’s gonna come through my window and take me out? like what if uhh... what if there's this huge unstoppable comet that’s just gonna like, destroy the Earth and all of us? Like what... what if that’s happening right now? How can I avoid all these questions if I don't have that? Like, who is gonna be here? Why... who is gonna be there... in the hospital? Who is gonna tell me that all this is bullshit... it's a dream? Just a dream. This is not a joke. And uhh... I'll never sleep."
Who will be
There to tell
Me how stupid
I am?
Who will be
There to tell
Me how stupid
I am?
Who will be
There to tell
Me how stupid
I am?
Who will be
There to tell
Me how stupid
I am?

Who will keep me from lashing out?
Lashing out
Anxiety chokes me like razorwire
Razorwire
Who will keep me from lashing out?
Lashing out
Anxiety chokes me like razorwire
Razorwire
Now it's all in your hands, in your hands
Now it's all in your hands, in your hands
Now it's all in your hands, in your hands
Now it's all in your hands, in your hands
Anxiety
Chokes me like
Razorwire
Anxiety
Chokes me like
Razorwire
Razorwire...
