Vincent Price Lyrics
Lightning flashing on heavy iron gate
Scares me to death but I just can’t wait
Deep in a dungeon there's a rattling of chains
Mad Dr. Phibes, he’s going to eat my brain

It feels so good to be afraid
Vincent Price is back again

Heart pumping louder, the music's out of time
The vampire’s dying, he’s got to have wine
Red blood dripping, she doesn’t have a prayer
I know it’s not real but I just don’t care


I want seven screaming virgins on a sacrificial altar
Howling dogs, creaking doors, and zombies to die forEmbed
