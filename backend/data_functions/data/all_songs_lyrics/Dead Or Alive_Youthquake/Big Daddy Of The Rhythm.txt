Big Daddy Of The Rhythm LyricsTurn your head around...
If I was the greatest dancer
Would I get a chance with you
To turn you head around
If I was the greatest dancer
Would I get to know you
Well, let's burn our love into the ground
Everybody's got to need somebody
Everybody's got to have someone to love
Everybody's got to need somebody
Everybody's got to have someone to love
Big big daddy of the rhythm
I can feel you comin'
Big big daddy of the rhythm
Oh you know you got me runnin'
Big big daddy of the rhythm
Oh you know I'm not complainin'
Big big daddy of the rhythm
I'll send this sloppy kiss to you ... mwah!
If I was a smoother talker
Would I get to talk with you
And talk about it, talk about it
Let's go home and talk about it
Feel that rhythm comin' through
And bein' home will never do
And shout about it, shout about it
Let's get down and shout about it
Everybody's got to need somebody
Everybody's got to have someone to love
Everybody's got to need somebody
Everybody's got to have someone to love
Big big daddy of the rhythm
I can feel you comin'
Big big daddy of the rhythm
Oh you know you got me runnin'
Big, big daddy of the rhythm
Oh, you know I'm not complainin'
Big, big daddy of the rhythm
I'll send this sloppy kiss to you
Love me, need me
Say you'll never leave me
I want your affection
Love me, need me
Say you'll never leave me
Give me your protection
Big big daddy of the rhythm
I can feel you comin'
Big big daddy of the rhythm
Oh you know you got me runnin'
Big, big daddy of the rhythm
Oh, you know I'm not complainin'
Big, big daddy of the rhythm
I'll send this sloppy kiss to you
Big big daddy of the rhythm
Oh you know I'm not complainin'
Big big daddy of the rhythm
I'll send this sloppy kiss to you ... mwah!Embed
