In Too Deep LyricsI could offer to you a thousand things
But with a lot of them you wouldn't bother
I could buy you ten real diamond rings
But I'm sure that you would want another
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away
You have brought me a lot of things
But the main one that you've brought was trouble
You put your finger to the trigger and you shot my heart
Well now I'm really gonna burst your bubble
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away
But I'm in too deep there's no getting out of it
In too deep no doubt about it
In too deep there's no getting out of it
In too deep no doubt about it
Too deep
Too deep
I could call you a lot of things
I could say there'll never be another
Ev'ry time the situation feels like it is close
I've got to turn around and say: don't bother
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away
But I'm in too deep there's no getting out of it
In too deep no doubt about it
In too deep there's no getting out of it
In too deep no doubt about it
Too deep
Too deep
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away
I could offer to you a thousand things
But with a lot of them you wouldn't bother
I could buy you ten real diamond rings
But I'm sure that you would want another
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away
But I'm in too deep there's no getting out of it
In too deep no doubt about it
In too deep there's no getting out of it
In too deep no doubt about itEmbed
