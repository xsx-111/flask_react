Cake And Eat It LyricsI'm told my idea of seduction
Is a bit passe'
I hear you like to try it
So I'll try it anyway
I would try anything
I swear I'd try it here and now
I might impress you
With a Rudolf Valentino bow
I tell you to get your attention
I'd do anything
I would work night and day
For all the joy that she could bring
I'd like to be the hunter
Who gets captured by the game
Oh won't you run your fingers through my mane!
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
I want fun I gotta run to you
To me you look just like
A treasure chest of pretty things
I already told
I would buy you ten real diamond rings
Oh let me tell you
I got lots of things that you could use
So don't reject it or I'll get
The love rejection blues
Any wish of yours is my command
I'd pay you money
If you'd only say you'd hold my hand
I'd speak in languages
That only you could ever hear
Oh baby, take me
Won't you please come here!?
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
I want fun I gotta run to you
I said I'd pay you money
If you'd only hold my hand
I hear you like to try it
So I go ahead as planned
I hear my smoochie talkin'
Might just be a bit old hat
So I'll watch what I'm sayin'
I don't think you'd go for that
A little birdie told me
That you just might feel the same
If you do then all you have to do
Is call my name
I would do anything
I swear I'd do it here and now
I might impress you
With a Rudolf Valentino bow
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!1Embed
