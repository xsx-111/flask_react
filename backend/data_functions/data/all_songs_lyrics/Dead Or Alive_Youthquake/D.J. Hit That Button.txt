D.J. Hit That Button LyricsThe way I have to look
I want more than anybody possibly can
The way I have to go for it
It makes me stand up, shake
And feel like humming
I feel just like a radio
And when the D.J. hits that button
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!
Anyone can have the beat
Ooh, but they got to learn to use it
There's a special channel here
So treat it gently or you lose it
I feel just like a radio
And when the D.J. hits that button
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!
Hit that button, hit that button
Hit that button, hit that button
The way I have to look
I want more than anybody possibly can
The way I have to go for it
I've got to stand up, shake
And feel like humming
I feel just like a radio
And when the D.J. hits that button
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!
That's the way it was meant to be, yeah!
That's the way it feels right for me , yeah!Embed
