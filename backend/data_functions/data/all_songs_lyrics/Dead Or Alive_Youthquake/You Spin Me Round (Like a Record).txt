You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) Lyrics
If I, I get to know your name
Well if I, could trace your private number, baby

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some

I set my sights on you
(And no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby

All I know is that to me
You look like you're havin' fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
I, (I, I, I) I got to be your friend now, baby
And I, (I, I, I) would like to move in just a little bit closer (To move in just a little bit closer)

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round

I want your love
I want your love

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round

You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round (You spin me like a record)
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round (I want your love)
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round (You spin me like a record)
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round (I want your love)

You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round (I need your love)
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby, right 'round (I need your love)
Like a record, baby, right 'round, 'round, 'round18Embed
