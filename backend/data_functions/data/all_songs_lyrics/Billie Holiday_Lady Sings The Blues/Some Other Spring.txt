Some Other Spring LyricsSome other spring
I'll try to love
Now I still cling
To faded blossoms
Fresh when worn, left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I mourn
Some other spring
When twilight falls
Will the nights bring
Another to me?
Not your kind, but let me find
It's not true that love is blind
Sun shines around me
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story unfold twice?
Some other spring
Will my heart wake?
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Can love with some other spring?
Sun shines around me
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story be told twice?
Some other spring
Will my heart wake?
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Can love with some other spring?Embed
