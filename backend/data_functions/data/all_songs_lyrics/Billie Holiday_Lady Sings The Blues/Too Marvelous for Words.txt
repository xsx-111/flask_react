Too Marvelous for Words LyricsYou're just too marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the phrase
That says enough, tells enough
I mean just aren't swell enough
You're much too much, and just too very very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for wordsEmbed
