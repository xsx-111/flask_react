Love Me Or Leave Me LyricsThis suspense is killin' me
I can't stand uncertainty
Tell me now, I've got to know
Whether you want me to stay or go
Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
You won't believe me, I love you only
I'd rather be lonely
Then happy with somebody else
You might find the night time
The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today to give back tomorrow
For your love is my love
There's no love for nobody elseEmbed
