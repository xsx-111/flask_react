Hold On Lyrics
Thinking ahead of time
Why don’t you spend the night?
I know you love me
Pick up and roll the dice
Reading between the lines
I know you love me
We can book a flight
Wake up in paradise
Sun up above us
Tell me you down to ride
And you can bet your life
No one above you

Said hold on, can’t stop love
Said hold on, can’t stop la (can’t stop, yeah, yeah)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said hold on, can’t stop la

And as long as you’re with me
I’m definitely
Yours for the takin’
Don’t be mistakin’
And as long as you’re wit’ it
I’ll be committed to you
(Ay, aw, yeah) I’ll show you what I know
You’ll give me what I need
Not saying I’m a pro
But you could learn from me
We go another round
Before we fall asleep
You got me on a cloud nine, baby
Feels almost like a dream
Something ‘bout your body (yeah, yeah)
La

(Yeah, yeah) Said hold on, can’t stop la (yeah)
I think you better hold on, can’t stop la (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (yeah, yeah)
I think you better hold on, can’t stop la (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I think you better hold on
I’m not ready to go
I hear you sayin’ don’t stop
I’d rather take it slow
I see you tryna hold on
But we aren't lettin’ go
You let me take control now
You’re ready to explode
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)

Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)


(Oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh-oh-oh, yeah)
And when you’re done just say enough (enough)
When your breath just can’t keep up (keep up)
‘Cause it’s bedtime baby (yeah, yay)

La
Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)
Said hold on, can’t stop la (holding on, holding on)
