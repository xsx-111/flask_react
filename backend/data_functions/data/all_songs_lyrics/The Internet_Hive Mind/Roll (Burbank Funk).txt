Roll (Burbank Funk) Lyrics
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heart
What's it sayin'?

Star shine so bright (Hear it in your heart)
They're up so high (Hear it in your heart)
I wanna fly (Check your voicemail)
Hear your heart go

Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Hear your heart go

As you're coming down
Where'd your heart go?

Star shine so bright (It's all in your heart)
They're up so high (It's all in your heart)
I wanna fly (Look no further)
Let your heart flow
(Let your heart flow)

Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll
Let your heart flow
Roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll (all night), roll (all night), roll (all night)
Let your heart flow

All night, all night, all night, all night
All night, all night, all night, all night7Embed
