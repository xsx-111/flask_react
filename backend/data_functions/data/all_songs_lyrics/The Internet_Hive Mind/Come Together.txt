Come Together Lyrics
And I want those eyes
Only in one side
Only in the wide
Girl I'm in the rush

I can't be sure
Not anymore
Today or tomorrow
What we gon' do
What we gon' do

They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together

I forget my pride
Stronger than your lies
Wanna get so high
Wanna live my life

I can't be sure
Not anymore
Today or tomorrow
What we gon' do
What we gon' do
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together

They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together
(They gon' get us to come together)
(They gon' get us to come together)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
They gon' get us to come together
They gon' get us to come together3Embed
