The Baby Screams Lyrics
Heaven, give me a sign
Waiting for the sun to shine
Pleasure fills up my dreams
And I love it, like a baby screams

It's so useless, how can you be proud?
When you're sinking into the ground
Into the ground, fills up my dreams
And I love it, like a baby screams

Couldn't ask for more, you said
Take it all and strike me, strike me, strike me dead
Strike me, strike me dead

Waiting again, waiting like I waited before
Waiting again, waiting here for nothing at all
Heaven fills up my dreams
And I love it, like a baby screams

Couldn't ask for more, you said
Couldn't ever let it end
Take it all, take it all
Then strike me, strike me, strike me, strike me
Strike me dead
Strike me, strike me dead
Strike me, strike me dead
Strike me, strike me, strike me dead

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
