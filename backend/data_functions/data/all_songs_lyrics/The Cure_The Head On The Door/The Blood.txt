The Blood Lyrics
Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back?
You can never forget how it used to feel
The illusion is deep
It's as deep as the night
I can tell by your tears you remember it all

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
Never stop

How it feels to be dry
Walking bare in the sun
Every mirage I see is a mirage of you
As I cool in the twilight
Taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears, all the broken words

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
Never stop
When the sunset's glow drifts away from you
You'll no longer know if any of this was really true at all

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
Never stop

Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back?
You can never forget how it used to feel

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
Never stop
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
Never stop4Embed
