In Between Days Lyrics
Yesterday I got so old, I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old, it made me want to cry
Go on, go on, just walk away
Go on, go on, your choice is made
Go on, go on and disappear
Go on, go on away from here

And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her inbetween without you
Without you

Yesterday I got so scared, I shivered like a child
Yesterday, away from you, it froze me deep inside
Come back come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me

And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her in between without you
Without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you6Embed
