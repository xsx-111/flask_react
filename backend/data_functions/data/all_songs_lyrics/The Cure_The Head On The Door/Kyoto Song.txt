Kyoto Song Lyrics
A nightmare of you of death in the pool
Wakes me up at quarter to three
I'm lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me
A nightmare of you of death in the pool
I see no further now than this dream
The trembling hands of the trembling man
Hold my mouth to hold in a scream

I try to think to make it slow
If only here is where I go
If this is real, I have to see
I turn on fire and next to me

It looks good, it tastes like nothing on earth
It looks good, it tastes like nothing on earth
It's so smooth, it even feels like skin
It tells me how it feels to be new
It tells me how it feels to be new
A thousand voices whisper it true
It tells me how it feels to be new
And every voice belongs, every voice belongs to you
A nightmare of you of death in the pool
Wakes me up at quarter to three
I'm lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me

It looks good, it tastes like nothing on earth
It looks good, it tastes like nothing on earth
It's so smooth, it even feels like skin
It tells me how it feels to be new
It tells me how it feels to be new
A thousand voices whisper it true
It tells me how it feels to be new
And every voice belongs, every voice belongs to you1Embed
