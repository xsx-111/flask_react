Push Lyrics
Go, go, go
Go, go, go
Push him away
No, no, no
No, no, no
Don't let him stay

He gets inside to stare at her
The seeping mouth
The mouth that knows
The secret you
Always you
A smile to hide the fear away
Smear this man across the walls
Like strawberries and cream
Its the only way, its the only way to be
(Its the only way to be, yeah)

Exactly the same clean room
Exactly the same clean bed
But I've stayed away too long this time
And I've got too big to fit this time
