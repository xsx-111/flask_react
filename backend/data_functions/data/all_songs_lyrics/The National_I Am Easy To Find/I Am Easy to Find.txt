I Am Easy to Find Lyrics
How long have we been here?
Am I ever coming down?
I need to find some lower thinking, if I'm going to stick around
I'm not going anywhere
Who do I think I'm kidding?
I'm still standing in the same place where you left me standing

I am easy to find

"Towers to the skies, an academy of lies"
You never were much of a New Yorker
It wasn't in your eyes
If you ever come around this way again
You'll see me standing in the sunlight
In the middle of the street

I am easy to find
I am easy to find

There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape
There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape
I am easy to find
I am easy to find

There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape
There's a million little battles that I'm never gonna win anyway
I'm still waiting for you every night with ticker tape, ticker tape1Embed
