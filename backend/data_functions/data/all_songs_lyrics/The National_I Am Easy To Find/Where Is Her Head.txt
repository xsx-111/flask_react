Where Is Her Head Lyrics
Is she outside?
Is she looking out?
Is she standing up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where are her feet?
Where is her head?
Is she outside?
Is she looking out?
Is she standing up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
Is she looking out?
Is she standing up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where are her feet?
Where is her head?
Is she outside?
Is she looking out?
Is she standing up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
What is she thinking?
Is she sleeping?
What did she say?
Is she looking out?
Is she standing up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
Is she looking out?
Is she sleeping?
I think I’m hittin' a wall
I hate loving you as much as I do, I think I'm runnin' away, I
Feel the dark storm you bring, I can't take another day
I think I'm hittin' a wall, I think I'm hittin' a wall
(Is she outside?)
I hate my looks, I hate 'em all
(Is she looking out?)
I think I'm runnin' away
(Is she standing up?)
The storm you bring, can't take another day
(Where are her hands?)
I think I'm hittin' a wall, I think I'm hittin' a wall
(Where are her eyes?
Where are her feet?)
I hate loving you as much as I do
(Is she outside?)
I think I'm runnin' away, I think I'm runnin' away
I think I hate my looks, I hate them all
I think I’m hittin' a wall

Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
What is she thinking?
Is she sleeping?
And I will not come back the same
(Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
What is she thinking?
Is she sleeping?)
And I will not come back the same
(What did she say?)
And I will not come back the same
(Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
What is she thinking?
Is she sleeping?
What did she say?)
And I will not come back the same

Is she growing up?
Is she looking out?
Is she standing up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where are her feet?
Where is her head?
Is she outside?
Is she looking out?
Is she standing up?
Where are her hands?
Where are her eyes?
Where is her head?
What is she thinking?
Is she sleeping?
What did she say?
Is she growing up?
Is she growing up?
Is she growing up?2Embed
