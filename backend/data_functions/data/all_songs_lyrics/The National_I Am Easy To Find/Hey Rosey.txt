Hey Rosey Lyrics
I'm your angel when it rains, dear
Heaven picks the place
I'm a child in that way, dear
Please do it again

Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is

I was hoping you wouldn't see me like this
I hate to fall before your feet again
I'm the rocks they weigh down the angels with
Help me see it won't always be like this

Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is

You said you got to let me escape myself
You said I don't know how not to want something else
If I held your hand again, would you be here down on your knees like this?

Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
Hey Rosey, I think I know just what the feeling is
I will love you like there's razors in it
And she'll love you like a radiant flame
There's never really any safety in it
Please do it again
There's never really any safety in it1Embed
