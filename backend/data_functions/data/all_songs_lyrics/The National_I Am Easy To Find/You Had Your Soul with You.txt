You Had Your Soul with You Lyrics
You had your soul with you, I was in no mood
Drift away, and I could forget
I had only one last feather left
I wore it on the island of my head
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet

You felt like heaven stood up in you
You said love fills you out
It moves you from the skeleton and pulls you around
I got it worse than anyone else
And I just can't find a way to forgive myself
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet

I have owed it to my heart, every word I've said
You have no idea how hard I died when you left
If I yield to my trances, will I get up close again?
I had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet
I had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet

You had your soul with you, I was in no mood
You had your soul with you, I was in no mood1Embed
