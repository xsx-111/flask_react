Roman Holiday Lyrics
I'm your hospital, I’m your silver cross
Tell me what to be, tell me how to talk
Patti wasn't lonely, Robert wasn't lost
Put me on a rope, take me for a walk

Roman holiday
Every time it rains
Roman holiday
I’ll take away your shame

I'm not afraid to tell you what I want
I'm not afraid of anything, I want it all
Never leave me out here for too long
Put me in your movie, pin me to your wall

Roman holiday
Every time it rains
Roman holiday
We're all Rainey anyway

She said, "Please, think the best of him
Please, think the best of me
There are police in the museum
Roman holiday
Every time it rains
Roman holiday
We don't feel the pain

She said, "Please, think the best of him"
Please, think the best of me

There are police in the museum
She said pleaseEmbed
