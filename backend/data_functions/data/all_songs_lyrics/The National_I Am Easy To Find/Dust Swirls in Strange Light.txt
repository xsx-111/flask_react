Dust Swirls in Strange Light Lyrics
Her father's voice
Her mother's heartbeat
The orange color inside her eyelids
The sunlight on her skin
Dust swirls in strange light

The feeling of the rug on her body
The hum from the speakers
She learns how to lie

Her father's voice
Her mother's heartbeat
The orange color inside her eyelids
The sunlight on her skin
Dust swirls in strange light

The feeling of the rug on her body
The hum from the speakers
She learns how to lie
She learns how to lie
She learns how to lie
She learns
The feeling of anger
The end of her street
Time in buildings
Time in cars
Could she run forever?
Could she run forever?

Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange light
Dust swirls in strange lightEmbed
