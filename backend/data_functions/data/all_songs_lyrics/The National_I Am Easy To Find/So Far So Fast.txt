So Far So Fast Lyrics
Lay down in the doorway in front of me
And make yourself impossible for me to leave
I remember a kid in the water, I remember a world on fire
I was just coming out of it, it was so hot all summer

I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast

The storm, the blackout, the quiet sea
You went running right into it, away from me
We have friends in good houses, we have kids in the trees
Now I have nothing but sleepless nights, about everything
I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast

Don't you know someday somebody will come and find you?
If you don't know who you are anymore, they will remind you
We don't see you around here anymore, it's okay
I will say your name out loud and you will be home
There are so many things that drive me crazy
What you think I am, it's never been me
Hearing you talk always saves me
Can you get away and talk to me?
I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast
I get so far, so fast1Embed
