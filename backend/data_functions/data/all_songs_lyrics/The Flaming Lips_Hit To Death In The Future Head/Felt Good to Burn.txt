Felt Good to Burn Lyrics
I didn't care when that guy ripped us off
We borrowed a gun to get him, we were so pissed off
We shot his leg
He was a dick, anyway

It felt good to burn
It felt like a movie star
When you hold my slippery brain
Kiss my forehead

And all summer long we refused to die
We just slept and fucked and got high
And all we'd steal
We made love on the Ferris wheel

It felt good to burn
It felt like a movie star
When you hold my slippery brain
Kiss my forehead

And all your dreams
And oh, God blessed your soul
I saw you were holding your head
But we couldn't have been dead
Cause you stood up and moaned and said
"I wasn't waving goodbye, I was saying hello"
It felt good to burn
It felt like a movie star
When you hold my slippery brain
Kiss my forehead1Embed
