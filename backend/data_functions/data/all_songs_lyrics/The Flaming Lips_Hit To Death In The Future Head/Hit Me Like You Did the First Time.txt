Hit Me Like You Did the First Time Lyrics
Go, people wanna know
All the pleasures of
I've got my favorite place
You know just what to say
Hit me like the first time

All of your friends go there
They're not like me
I got my favorite place
You know just what to say
Kill me like you did the first time

Come on now 
Hit me like the first time

Mount this heavy snow
It's warm like a winter coat
That's my favorite place
Cause you know just what to say
Kiss me like you did the first time

Come on now Embed
