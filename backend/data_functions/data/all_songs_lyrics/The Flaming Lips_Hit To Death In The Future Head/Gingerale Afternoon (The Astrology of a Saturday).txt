Gingerale Afternoon (The Astrology of a Saturday) Lyrics
I've seen sunrise the size of my head
It freaks you up like ghouls from the dead
I feel like I'm ready to run through your room
It's gonna be another ginger ale afternoon

And I'm feeling like
I'm leaving' much too soon

Got a pocket full of capsules and some chocolate ice cream
Both make me cool but one makes me dream
I feel like I'm ready to race through your room
It's gonna be another ginger ale afternoon
