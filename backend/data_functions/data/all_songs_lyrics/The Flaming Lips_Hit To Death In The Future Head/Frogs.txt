Frogs Lyrics
There you are
Infected with the water strain
Wash your car
Fish and thoughts come screaming down like rain

There you are
Wash your hands and wash your face
Water's gone
It's vaporized and gone to outer space

I'm lookin' at the sky
I'm waitin' on the rain
I'm waitin' for the frogs to fall
Down on meEmbed
