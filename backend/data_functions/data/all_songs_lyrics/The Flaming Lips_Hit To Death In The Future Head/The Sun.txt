The Sun LyricsAnd the sun goes over me
And the sun goes over me
And the sun goes over me
And the sun goes over me
And the sun goes over me
And the sun goes over me
It'd be so kind to see your face in my door
It wouldn't have to last very long
It'd be so kind to see your face in my door
I wouldn't have to ask anymoreEmbed
