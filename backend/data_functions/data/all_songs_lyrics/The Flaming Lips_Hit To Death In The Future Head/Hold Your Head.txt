Hold Your Head Lyrics
We didn't come to negotiate
We didn't come so we could wait
We didn't come to change the world
We didn't come to fuck girls

We didn't come to see if it's true
We're not like you
Hold your head, now it's over

It's gettin' harder than it used to be
Time was slower than it used to be
We didn't come to imagine this
It's better to feel than to be like thisEmbed
