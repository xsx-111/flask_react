All Day Sucker Lyrics
Play as funky as you can, slim

Come on up, you say
'Cause you can feel your love comin' down
I find myself rushin' over to
Do something for your love
I knock on the door (Yeah)
You answer askin' what am I there for? (Yeah)
I say I thought you wanted me to
Do something for your love

I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something, but to get none of your love

All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love

You call me up to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day
And could I come over today to
Do something for your love?
One knock gets me in (Yeah)
But then you say how very nice it's been (Yeah)
That lets me know that I will once again (I)
Get nothin' from your love
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something, but to get none of your love

All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love

You drop by to say
You're sorry for what went down the other day (Yeah)
And if I had some time later in the day
To do something for your love
Anyone else would say (Say)
No, that's okay
But maybe by now, she'll see things my way
And ask me to stay
To do something for her love (Sucker)
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something to get nothing
I'm an all-day sucker
Coming to give something, but to get none of your love

All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (To get none of your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (You're being stingy with your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (Baby)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (I'm an all-day sucker for your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (Giving none of your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (To an all-day sucker for your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (To get none of your love)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your love (Baby)
All-day sucker for your love, all-day sucker for your loveEmbed
