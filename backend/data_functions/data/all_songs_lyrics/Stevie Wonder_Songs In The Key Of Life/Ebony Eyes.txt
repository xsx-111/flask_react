Ebony Eyes Lyrics
She's a miss beautiful supreme
A girl that others wish that they could be
If there's seven wonders of the world
Then I know she's got to be number one

She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

She's the sunflower from nature's seed
A girl that some men only find in their dreams
When she smiles, it seems the stars all know
'Cause one by one, they start to light up the sky

She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love ya, baby

Saxophone, right here
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto streets
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes
When she starts talking soft and sweet
Like birds of spring, her words all seem to sing
With a rhythm that is made of love
And the happiness that she only brings

She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
I love you, baby

Saxophone, one more time
Girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
Devastating beauty
Pretty girl with ebony eyes

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty Black beauty
Beauty, beauty, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a girl that can't be beat
Born and raised on ghetto street
She's a devastating beauty
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
Ebony eyes
