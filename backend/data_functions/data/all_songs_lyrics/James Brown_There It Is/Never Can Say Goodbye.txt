Never Can Say Goodbye LyricsWhat's goin' on? Tell me
Ya ya ya ya ya ya, I got to know now
Ooh, I got to know, ya ya ya ya ya ya
What's goin' on? What's goin' on?
Sure pretty, play it again, fellas
Alright
You know it sure is a groove when you got your girl
And you're parked at a trunk dark spot
Two miles away from the park, deep in the woods
And all of a sudden, you try to, you to be mellow, cozy and sweet
And she freeze up and go into her ignorant bag
But for somehow, some reason
You know, you've probably knowing the young lady for a long time
You're going to school together, and you're probably still going to school together
You wanna back up but you just can't quit, you just can't quit
You wanna leave but something keep pulling you back, ain't it nice?
I don't like to rain as I much as I like the dusk dark thing, you understand?
The sun is down real low
I just can see the brothers now in ham
Fellas in ham, I know what they're doing - Danny know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Play it again, brothers, play it sweet, play it sweet and soft
Play it sweet
Sure sounds goodEmbed
