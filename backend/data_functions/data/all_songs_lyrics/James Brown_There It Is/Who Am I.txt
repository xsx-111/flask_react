Who Am I LyricsWho am I to make decisions
And try to change, change your way?
Who am I to pretend that things are going good
When they're getting worse every day?
Who am I to say who's gonna take you out
Where you're going and what you should do?
Who am I to sit right down, sit right down and cry
Because I just can't stop, I can't stop loving you
Who am I to take the time to answer, do you hear me?
And who am I to take the time to care?
Who am I to know that I love, love, love you so, yeah?
And who am I to worry at all?
Let me ask you one more time
Who am I to say when you're wrong, I'm right?
Who am I to say who's gonna take you home at night?
I'm your man, baby, that's who I am
I'm, I'm just your man
Do that mean something to you? Alright
I'm just your man
I'll be there beside when the going get tough
And things get so rough
When you can't find a friend nowhere, yeah
When you drop your head and say "I'm sorry," I'll understand
'Cause baby, let me tell you one more time, I'm your man
Hey, do you understand it when I take your hand, I'm your man?
I worry when you worry, and grieve when you grieve
I got, I got understanding and in you I'll always believe
I'll understand, 'cause I'm your man
Can't you understand me? Can't you understand me?
Do you know what it means when you got someone to love you?
Oh baby, yes baby, I'm your manEmbed
