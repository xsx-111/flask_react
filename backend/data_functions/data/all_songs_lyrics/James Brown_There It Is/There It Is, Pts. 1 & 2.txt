There It Is, Pts. 1 & 2 LyricsOw, there it is!
Hey, soul, soul
Need a taste
Mind is right, yeah
In the right place
You're doing your do
Like you want to be
Give up trying
To run the game on me
Then dig it
From the real side
Stand, sho nuff
To be satisfied
Meet be at the big house
Get down
Let everybody know
Let everybody know
My main squeeze
Just hit the town
Get up and do what, what you can
Get up and do what you can
For the world to see
Games don't mean nothing to me
You can't run a game on me
Don't mean a thing to me
Don't mean a thing
Hey, hit it, come on, uh, uh, ow
Laying in the cut
Job is done
Wipe the sweat
Gonna have some fun
Time's getting short
We got to move
But in the meantime
Mama, we got to groove, hey
Long as you see
Can't run a game on me
Long as you see
Games don't mean a thing to me
Long as you see
Hey, huh, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hit it

Hit it, hit it
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Then dig it
From the real side
Stand, sho nuff
And be satisfied
Meet at the big house
Where we all get down
Let everybody know
My main thang just hit the town, huh
I got a mean thang
We got a mean thang
I want to see the thang scream
I got a mean thang
Then get up and do what you can
Get up, do what you can
For the world to see
You can't run a game
It means nothing to me
The game won't do it
The game won't do it
You got to know it
So you can pursue it
Lay in the cut
The game won't do it
The game won't, hey, hit it!
Ow, uh, uh, hey, get down, get down, get down, get down
Laying in the cut, job is done
Weekend, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...
I wanna bite but have some fun, hey
Time to get tough, sho got to move
Get up in the meantime, I need to groove, hey hey hey
Got time, time, time, time
Time getting short, ain't got the time to think
Uh, hey, hey, hit it!
Hey, uh, get it, come on
Hey hey, hey hey, hey, uh, hey, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Hey, hit it!
Uh, good God, uh, get down, hey
Uh, hey hey hey...Embed
