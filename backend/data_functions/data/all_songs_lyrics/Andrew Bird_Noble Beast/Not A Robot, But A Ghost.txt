Not A Robot, But A Ghost LyricsI run the numbers through the floor
Here's how it goes: I crack the codes
I crack the codes that end the war
I crack the codes that end the war
The hour...
I pushed a note under your door
Here's how it goes: things come to blows
But we don't want this anymore
No, we don't want this anymore
We don't want this anymore
I crack the codes, you end the war
I hear the clockwork in your core
Time strips the gears till you forget what they were for
I push the numbers through your pores
I crack the codes
I crack the codes to end the war
How's my living
You can call
Encrypted numbers
On bathroom stalls
There's something burning
It casts a pall
It's melting numbers
Right off the walls
I run the numbers through the floor
Here's how it goes: I crack the codes
I crack the codes, you end the warEmbed
