Tenuousness Lyrics
Tenuous at best was all he had to say when pressed about the rest of it, the world that is
From proto-Sanskrit Minoans to porto-centric Lisboans
Greek Cypriots and Hobis-hots
Who hang around the ports a lot
Here's where things start getting weird
While chinless men will scratch their beards
Tool their minds to sharpened axes
Brush up on the Uralic syntaxes
Love of hate acts as an axis
Love of hate acts as an axis
First it wanes and then it waxes
(So procreate and pay your taxes)

Ten you us ness less seven comes to three
Them you us plus eleven
Thank the heavens for their elasticity
And that's for those who live and die for astronomy

When Copraphagia was writ
Know when to stand know when to sit
Can't stand to stand can't stand to sit and who would want to know this
Click click click
Who wants to look upon this
Who wants to look upon this
Pray tell
Who wants to look upon this
Who wants to look upon this
Pray tell
Pray tell

Tenuousness less seven comes to three
Them you us plus eleven
Comes just shy of infinity
And that's for those who live and die for numerology4Embed
