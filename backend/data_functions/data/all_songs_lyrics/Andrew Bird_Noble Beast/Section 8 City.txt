Section 8 City Lyrics

Section 8 city, section 8 city
Have you lied to us?
And something gets in it
Well something gets in it
Is it alright with us?

Section 8 city
Have you lied to us?
Something gets in it
It's not alright with us

And you're not so sure you want to go through with this
Not so sure
With this live thing
It's a trifling, oh, it's a trifling sight


Oh - have you lied to us?
Oh -Embed
