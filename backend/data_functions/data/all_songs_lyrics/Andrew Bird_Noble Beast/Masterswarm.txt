Masterswarm Lyrics
Come what may
Lay your eggs where it's warm
We come here to swarm
Come by sea
Swarm like smoke in the dung
We were the young
We were the swarm
Radiolarians
Midges and Moths
Cut from a cloth
We were the young
We were the swarm

Flailing feudal fleas
Feeding from the arms of the master
Burrow into me
This is sure to misspell disaster
Oh and their young
In the larval stage
Orchestrating plays
In vestments of translucent alabaster
So, they took me to the hospital
They put my body through a scan
What they saw there would impress them all
For inside me grows a man
He speaks with perfect diction
As he orders my eviction
As he acts with more conviction than I

Burrow into me
This was sure to misspell disaster
Burrow into me
Feeding from the arms of the master

We were the young
We were the swarm
We were the young radiolarians
Come what mayEmbed
