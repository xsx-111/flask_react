Fitz and the Dizzyspells Lyrics
Comes and goes
Like in fits and dizzy spells
Like the weather
And it blows
Like it knows what's going wrong
Like it's clever

Has a name
But the name goes unspoken
Weather vanes
Were all twisted and broken

So soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on
Soldier on

Flailing to the whir of a snack machine
And muted screams of an old regime
And then oh
Something gets in it
The nightshade gets in it
We were all fast asleep
We were all so fast asleep
But you woke us
You woke us from the strangest dream that an aubergine could ever know
Would ever know
Would ever know

Lava flows over crooks and craggy cliffs to the ocean
And explodes in a steam heat fevered cyclical motion

Has a name
But the name goes unspoken
It's in vain
Cause the language is broken

So cast your own, cast your own
Cast your own
Cast your own
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on
Soldier on, soldier on3Embed
