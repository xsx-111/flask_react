Souverian LyricsThough bells will ring
Church steeples were catchin fire
And if you promise spring
Then I'll know you are a liar
Cause in the spring
Tender grasses won't burn easily
Though thrushes sing
Still my lover won't return to me
Wild parsnips, they still scald my lungs
While thistles will burn my feet
And if you join our chorus
You will never fear any more
So here comes the chorus
We will meet on a fatal shore
Souverian Souverian the elder
Souverian Souverian was free
Souverian Souverian we felled her
So very young so very young were we
Birds will sing
Still my lover won't return to me
You promise spring
Still my lover won't return to me
Wild parsnips scald my lungs
And thistles are burning my feet
So here comes the chorus
You'll never fear any more
If you join a chorus
We will meet on a fatal shore
Under the elders
The older get younger
The younger get over
Over their elders
Under the elders
Pretend that you're older now
Under the elders
The older get younger
The younger get over
Over the elders
Under the elders
Bending your branches down
We who are so very young
Still my lover won't return to me
Thrushes sing
Still my lover won't return to me
Wild parsnips, they still scald my lungs
While thistles still burn my feetEmbed
