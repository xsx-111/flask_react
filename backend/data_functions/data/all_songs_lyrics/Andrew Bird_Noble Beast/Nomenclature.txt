Nomenclature LyricsJust think of the lives you could swap with your own
While you're selling your coats, you're sewing your own
And though it's not the easy way
Sometimes we've got to pay to play
With finger paints and macram√©
It's time we asked the See 'n Say
Could you bring a different nomenclature?
Now the colors have bled to gray
To ones that don't exist in nature
A nomenclature's washing away, washing away
A nomenclature's washing away, washing away
But did it carry you away, carry you all away?
Did it carry you away, carry you all away?
Nomenclature's washing away, oh it's washing us all away
Nomenclature's washing away, oh it's washing us all awayEmbed
