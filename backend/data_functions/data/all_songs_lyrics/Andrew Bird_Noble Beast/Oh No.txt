Oh No Lyrics
In the salsify mains of what was thought but unsaid
All the calcified arithmatists were doing the math
And it would take a calculated blow to the head
To light the eyes of all the harmless sociopaths

Oh arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths
Oh, arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
Calcium mines are buried deep in your chest
Oh the calcium mines you buried deep in your che-e-est

Ooh
We’re deep in a mine
Ooh
A calcium mine
O-o-oh

Let’s get out of here
Past the atmosphere
Squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
Past the silver bridge
Oh, the silver bridge wearing nothing but a onesie and a veil
Ooh
We’re deep in a mine
O-o-oh
Ooh
A calcium mine
O-o-oh

Oh arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths
Oh, arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
Calcium mines are buried deep in your chest
Oh the calcium mines you buried deep in your chest
Oh, no, no

Ooh
We’re deep in a mine
Oh no
Ooh
A calcium mine
Oh, no
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
So let’s get out of here
Past the atmosphere
Squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
Past the silver bridge
Oh, the silver bridge wearing nothing but a onesie and a veil

Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!
Oh no!2Embed
