I said I got a jonz in my bonz, yeah
I said this feelin' that I got goes on and on, on and on

All my natural life I've been waiting
I've been holding on to everything that belongs to me, oh
Fooled, misled by every single possibility
What I wouldn't do to get next to the things that were meant foâ€™ me
Oh, oh

I said this feeling that I got won't leave me 'lone (Yeah, yeah, alone)
I said I got a jonz in my bonz (Got a jonz, yeah)
