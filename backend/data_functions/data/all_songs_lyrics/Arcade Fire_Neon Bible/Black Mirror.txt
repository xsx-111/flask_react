Black Mirror Lyrics
I will walk down to the ocean
After waking from a nightmare
No moon, no pale reflection
Black mirror, black mirror

Shot by a security camera
You can't watch your own image
And also look yourself in the eye
Black mirror, black mirror, black mirror

I know when the time is coming
All the words will lose their meaning
Please show me something that isnâ€™t mine
But mine is the only kind that I relate to
Le miroir casse
The mirror casts mon reflet partout
Black mirror, black mirror, black mirror

Black mirror knows no reflection
It knows not pride or vanity
It cares not about your dreams
It cares not for your pyramid schemes
Their names are never spoken
The curse is never broken
The curse is never broken
Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: miroir noir!
Black mirror!
Un! Deux! Trois! Dis: miroir noir!
Black mirror!
Black mirror, black mirror
Their names are never spoken, the curse is never broken
Their names are never spoken, the curse is never broken
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, show me where them bombs will fall
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, show me where them bombs will fall
Black mirror! Black mirror! Black mirror! Black mirror!
Black mirror! Black mirror! Black mirror!6Embed
