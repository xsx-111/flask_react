The Well and the Lighthouse LyricsI'm serving time all for a crime I did commit
You want the truth?
You know I'd do it all again
Left for dead,
Heaven is only in my head!
I heard a voice calling from down inside a well
"See that silver shine?"
She said to come claim what was mine
So down I fell, down into the water black
My prison cell, only the moon was shining back!
If I seem lost, well, I weighed the cost
And chose my crime--
Now it's mine, all mine!
I heard the voice calling from just outside the well
She said "You fool, now that you know your end is near;
You always fall for what you desire or what you fear!"
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse,
If you leave, them ships are going to wreck
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse,
The lions and the lambs ain’t sleeping yet
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse,
Can you see the funny side? The ships are going to wreck
Resurrected, living in a lighthouse,
The lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain’t sleeping yet
The lions and the lambs ain’t sleeping yet12Embed
