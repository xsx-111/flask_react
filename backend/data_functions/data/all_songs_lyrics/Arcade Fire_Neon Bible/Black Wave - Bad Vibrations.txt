Black Wave / Bad Vibrations LyricsBLACK WAVE:

We can reach the sea
They won't follow me
Shadows, they fear the sun
We'll make it if we run!

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent

Left my name with the border guards
A name that I don't need
Ce sera un long voyage
Sur les vagues de l'oubli

Run from the memory
Je nage, mais les sons me suivent
BAD VIBRATIONS:

Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
So, stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you
For me
It's always for you
Stop now before it's too late
Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
Stop now before it's too late
Your lover was for hire, have you noticed he's been late?
Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's got to be
There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea
For me
For you
For me
It's always for you

The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet7Embed
