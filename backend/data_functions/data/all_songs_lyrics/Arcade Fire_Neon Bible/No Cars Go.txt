No Cars Go Lyrics(Hey!)
(Hey!)

We know a place where no planes go
We know a place where no ships go

(Hey!) No cars go!
(Hey!) No cars go!
Where we know

We know a place no spaceships go
We know a place where no subs go

(Hey!) No cars go!
(Hey!) No cars go!
Where we know

(Go!) No go!

(Hey!) Us kids know
(Hey!) No cars go!
Where we know
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream
Between the click of the light and the start of the dream

Little babies, let's go!
Women and children, let's go!
Old folks, let's go!
Don't know where we're going8Embed
