Slipstream LyricsWell, the lush separation enfolds you
And the products of wealth
Push you along on the bow wave
Of their spiritless undying selves
And you press on God's waiter your last dime
As he hands you the bill
And you spin in the slipstream
Tideless, unreasoning
Paddle right out of the mess
And you paddle right out of the mess1Embed
