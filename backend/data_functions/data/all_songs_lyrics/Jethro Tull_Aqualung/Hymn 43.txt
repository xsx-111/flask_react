Hymn 43 Lyrics
Oh Father high in heaven
Smile down upon your son, hey-hey
Who's busy with his money games, oh!
His women and his gun
Oh Jesus save me!

And the unsung Western hero
Killed an Indian or three, hey hey hey
And then he made his name in Hollywood, oh!
To set the white man free
Oh Jesus save me!

If Jesus saves, well He'd better save Himself
From the gory glory seekers who use His name in death, oh!
Oh Jesus save me!


If Jesus saves, well He'd better save Himself
From the gory glory seekers who use His name in death, ow!
Oh Jesus save me!
Well, I saw him in the city
And on the mountains of the moon, yeah
His cross was rather bloody, oh!
And he could hardly roll His stone
Oh Jesus save me!2Embed
