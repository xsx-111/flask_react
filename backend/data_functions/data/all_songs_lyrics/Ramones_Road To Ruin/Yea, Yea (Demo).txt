Yea, Yea (Demo) Lyrics
Yea, yea, there's a girl I know
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, well, I love her so
Yea, yea, yea, yea

Well, she's a little of this, a little of that
She makes my heart go flippity flap
Oh, baby, baby, I just love her so
Yea, yea, well, she's the most
Yea, yea, yea, yea
The coolest chick on the whole East Coast
Yea, yea, yea, yea
She makes my heart spin like a tilt-a-whirl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's my kind of girl
Whoa, baby, baby, I just love her so
We could go to a drive-in
It doesn't matter, ya know
She's the kind of girl that I love so

Yea, yea, when she holds me close
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, well, she's the most
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Well, she's a little of this, a little of that
She makes my heart go flippity flap
Oh, baby, baby, I just love her so
We could go down to E Street
It doesn't matter ya know
She's the kind of girl that I love so

Yea, yea, there's a girl I know
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, well, I love her so
Yea, yea, yea, yea

Well, she's a little of this, a little of that
She makes my heart go flippity flap
Oh, baby, baby, I just love her so
Oh yea, baby, I just love her so
Oh yea, baby, I just love her so
Oh yea, baby, I just love herEmbed
