Spare-ohs Lyrics
The finches and sparrows build nests in my chimney
What remains of the small flightless birds
That you failed to protect
But their yolk isn't easy, in fact it's a drag
As they're blowing through cornfields and mountains of rags
All over the suburbs, across the great lawns
And they're crop dusting gardens all over this town

But nobody cares when it gets in their hair
It gets in their lungs as it floats through the air
It gets in the food that they buy and prepare
But nobody cares when it gets in their hair

Across the great chasms and the schisms
And the sudden aneurysms
Where the black ink will drip across the crespice of your eyes
And your teeth are worth more than you can spare
Oh, don't tell me that it just isn't fair
Don't speak about the cycles of life
Cause your thoughts are so soft
I could cut 'em with a spork or a bride's knife

And the wine made our mouths too loose
Such a reckless choice of words
When you told me I was too abstruse
I just thought it was a kind of bird
I swear, I just stood there not saying a word
Not saying a word, not saying a wordEmbed
