Scythian Empires Lyrics
Five day forecast brings black tar rains and hellfire
While handpicked handlerâ€™s kid gloves tear at the inseams
Their Halliburton attache cases are useless
While Scotch Guard Mackintoshes shall be carbonized

Now they're offering views of exiting empire
Such breathtaking views of Scythian empires
Scythian Empire, horsemen of the Russian steppes
Scythian Empire, archers of an afterthought

Routed by Sarmatians
And thwarted by the Thracians
Scythian Empire
Kings of Macedonia
Scythian Empire

Scythian Empires, exiting empires
Scythian Empires, exiting empires
