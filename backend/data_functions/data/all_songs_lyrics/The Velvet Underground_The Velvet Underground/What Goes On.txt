What Goes On Lyrics
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am upside down

Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright

I'm going up, and I'm going down
I'm going to fly from side to side
See the bells up in the sky
Somebody's cut the string in two

Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright

One minute born, one minute doomed
One minute up and one minute down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down

Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright3Embed
