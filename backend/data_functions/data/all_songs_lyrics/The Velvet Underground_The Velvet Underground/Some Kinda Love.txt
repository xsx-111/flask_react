Some Kinda Love Lyrics
Some kinds of love, Marguerita told Tom
Between thought and expression lies a lifetime
Situations arise because of the weather
And no kinds of love are better than others

Some kinds of love, Marguerita told Tom
Like a dirty French novel combines the absurd with the vulgar
And some kinds of love, the possibilities are endless
And for me to miss one would seem to be groundless

I heard what you said, Marguerita heard Tom
And of course you're a bore but in that you're not charmless
'Cause a bore is a straight line that finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love are mistaken for vision

Put jelly on your shoulder let us do what you fear most
That from which you recoil but which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder baby, lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression let us now kiss the culprit, move it on

I don't know just what it's all about
But put on your red pajamas and find out1Embed
