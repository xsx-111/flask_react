Jesus Lyrics
Jesus, help me find my proper place
Jesus, help me find my proper place
Help me in my weakness
'Cause I'm falling out of grace
Jesus, Jesus

Jesus, help me find my proper place
Jesus, help me find my proper place
Help me in my weakness
'Cause I'm falling out of grace
Jesus, Jesus

Jesus, help me find my proper place
Jesus, help me find my proper place
Help me in my weakness
'Cause I'm falling out of grace
Jesus, Jesus1Embed
