Shut Up and Talk to Me Lyrics
Now love is never gonna be a solid bet
It's kinda like working without a net
Donâ€™t be afraid to let your feelings out
Hey, that's what loving is all about
Come on, baby, and give me a break
It's how do you feel, not what do you think

Stop rattling your keys
Shut up and talk to me
Shut up and talk to me now

You know I've known you long enough to know
There's nothing you can hide that still don't show
You ain't fooling anyone but you
When you put me through what you put me through
Come on, honey, and tell me the truth
Give me chicken-fried steak, not a Baby Ruth

I'm not that hard to please
Shut up and talk to me
Shut up and talk to me now
Well, you can talk about the weather till it drives me nuts
Hey, you can rattle on about who, why, what
A little conversation wouldn't hurt that much
A little something with a human touch, hey

Now, if you're hurting, baby, tell me so
If you need attention, honey, let me know
I'm not the one that you're hiding from, you know
It doesn't matter what the ever you done
You can have your cake and you can eat it too
Hey, that's the kinda stuff I want from you

How hard can it be?
Shut up and talk to me
Hey, shut up and talk to me now

Well, you can talk about the weather till it drives me nuts
Hey, you can rattle on about who, why, what
A little conversation wouldn't hurt that much
A little something with a human touch, hey

Shut up and talk to me, darling
Tell me the truth
Shut up and talk to meEmbed
