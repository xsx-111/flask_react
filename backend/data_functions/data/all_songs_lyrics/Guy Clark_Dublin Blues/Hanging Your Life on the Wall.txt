Hanging Your Life on the Wall Lyrics
I used to be Juanita's old boyfriend
We sure gave 'em some stories to tell
Now I can't even find her picture
Looks like I'm finally through fooling myself

I used to be an ex-bull rider
Living on the edge of life itself
Now I can't even find my buckle
Looks like I'm finally through fooling myself

So hang on just as long as you can
Get up whenever you fall
Shake it off, boys, and go round again
Don't be hanging your life on the wall

Well you know that old dog of mine, Caesar
He was my road manager
And he could tell time and he could drive a Volvo
But I never should have let him drive that day

I used to be forever chasing fire trucks
I sure could raise me some hell
I don't know why I like to do that kind of stuff
I guess I wasn't through fooling myself
I used to have a smoking little fastball (yeah he did)
I sure could show 'em some stuff
Now I can't even make it on the church team anymore
I guess I'm finally through fooling myself

Hang on just as long as you can
Get up whenever you fall
Shake it off, boys, and go round again
Don't be hanging your life on the wall
Hang on just as long as you can
Get up whenever you fall
Shake it off, boys, and go round again
Don't be hanging your life on the wall
Shake it off, boys, and go round again
Don't be hanging your life on the wall
Yeah I used to be an ex-bull riderEmbed
