The Cape Lyrics
Eight years old with a flour sack cape
Tied all around his neck
He climbed up on the garage
He's figuring what the heck?
Screwed his courage up so tight
That the whole thing come unwound
He got a running start and bless his heart
He's headed for the ground

Well, he's one of those who knows
That life is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
And always trust your cape

Now, he's all grown up with a flour sack cape
Tied all around his dreams
And he's full of piss and vinegar
And he's busting at the seams
So he licked his finger and he checked the wind
It's gonna be do-or-die
He wasn't scared of nothing, boys
He was pretty sure he could fly
Well, he's one of those who knows
That life is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
And always trust your cape

Now, he's old and gray with a flour sack cape
Tied all around his head
And he's still jumping off the garage
And will be till he's dead
All these years, the people said
He was actin' like a kid
He did not know he could not fly
So he did

Well, he's one of those who knows
That life is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
And always trust your cape

Well, he's one of those who knows
That life is just a leap of faith
Spread your arms and hold your breath
And always trust your cape1Embed
