Hank Williams Said It Best Lyrics
One man's hawk is another man's dove
One man's hug is another man's shove
One man's rock is another man's sand
One man's fist is another man's hand
One man's tool is another man's toy
One man's grief is another man's joy
One man's squawk is another man's sing
One man's crutch is another man's wing
One man's pride is another man's humble
One man's step is another man's stumble
One man's pleasure is another man's pain
One man's loss is another man's gain
One man's can is another man's grail
One man's anchor is another man's sail
One man's right is another man's wrong
One man's curse is another man's song

For every father's daughter, for every mother's son
The only thing the same is that it ain't for anyone
Hank Williams said it best, he said it a long time ago
Unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw

One man's deuce is another man's ace
One man's back is another man's face
One man's reason is another man's rhyme
One man's dollar is another man's dime
One man's tree is another man's post
One man's angel is another man's ghost
One man's rain is another man's drought
One man's hope is another man's doubt
One man's false is another man's fair
One man's toupee is another man's hair
One man's hand is another man's stub
One man's feast is another man's grub
One man's dread is another man's dream
One man's sigh is another man's scream
One man's water is another man's wine
One man's daughter leave another man crying
For every father's daughter, for every mother's son
The only thing the same is that it ain't for anyone
Hank Williams said it best, he said it a long time ago
Unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw

One man's famine is another man's feast
One man's pet is another man's beast
One man's bat is another man's ball
One man's art is another man's scrawl
One man's friend is another man's foe
One man's Joseph is another man's Joe
One man's hammer is another man's nail
One man's freedom is another man's jail
One man's road is another man's rut
One man's if is another man's but
One man's treasure is another man's trash
One man's landing is another man's crash
One man's word, another man's lie
One man's dirt, another man's sky
One man's skin is another man's color
One man's killer is another man's brother

For every father's daughter, for every mother's son
The only thing the same is that it ain't for anyone
Hank Williams said it best, he said it a long time ago
Unless you have made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throwEmbed
