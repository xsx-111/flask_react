Dublin Blues Lyrics
I wished I was in Austin in the Chili Parlor Bar
Drinking Mad Dog Margaritas and not caring where you are
But here I sit in Dublin just rolling cigarettes
Holding back and choking back the shakes with every breath

So forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought
I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye

Now I am just a poor boy, work's my middle name
If money was a reason, well, I would not be the same
I'll stand up and be counted, I'll face up to the truth
I'll walk away from trouble, but I can't walk away from you

Forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought
I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye

I have been to Fort Worth and I have been to Spain
I have been too proud to come in out of the rain
I have seen the David, I've seen the Mona Lisa too
I have heard Doc Watson play "Columbus Stockade Blues"
Forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought
I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye

Well I wished I was in Austin, hmm, in the Chili Parlor Bar
Drinking Mad Dog Margaritas and not caring where you are2Embed
