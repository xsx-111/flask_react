Black Diamond Strings Lyrics
Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Drinking 1 W. Harper
Playing Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Are like white flour and grits
You play Black Diamond strings
'Cause it's all you can get

Black Diamond Strings on a catalogue guitar
That‘s pretty high cotton whoever you are
You break one, you change one, that‘s as good as it gets
You can play all year long on two or three sets
J.W. Crowell was a hell of a man
He played two nights a week in a hillbilly band
He played at the Ice House on Telephone Road
And he played in the yard just to lighten his load

Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Drinking 1 W. Harper
Playing Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Are like white flour and grits
You play Black Diamond strings
'Cause it's all you can get
Say hey, J.W, come on, play that frog line
Let old Rodney sit in, hell, he's going on nine
His fingers are bleeding, but he's keeping good time
Playing Black Diamond strings, and he'll never quit trying
And Cosette, she told 'em both
She said, "You boys pack it up, it's time to go home
We got church in the morning and it's coming up dawn
Don‘t make me say it again or I'm gone
You can stay here forever, but you‘re gonna walk home"

Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Drinking 1 W. Harper
Playing Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Are like white flour and grits
You play Black Diamond strings
'Cause it's all you can get

Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Drinking 1 W. Harper
Playing Black Diamond strings
Black Diamond strings
Are like white flour and grits
You play Black Diamond strings
'Cause it's all you can getEmbed
