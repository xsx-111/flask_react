Baby Took a Limo to Memphis LyricsShe did not want to drive
She did not want to fly
She did not want to wait
For a bus to come by
She did not want to hassle
She did not want to hurry
She didn't want to know
What it cost, don't worry
Baby took a limo to Memphis
Seemed like the thing to do
Baby took a limo to Memphis
She did it 'cause she wanted to
She was not looking back
But she was looking good
She was not in the mood
To be knocking on wood
She knows what she wants
She knows how to get it
She knows what it takes
Just to do it, don't regret it
Baby took a limo to Memphis
Seemed like the thing to do
Baby took a limo to Memphis
She did it 'cause she wanted to
The shortest distance
Between two towns
Is riding in a limo
With the windows down
Don't ask why she's going
She might let you know
Don't ask when she's coming back
Hey she don't know
Don't let her fool you
She's nobody's fool
She knows what's tacky
She knows what's cool
Baby took a limo to Memphis
Seemed like the thing to do
Baby took a limo to Memphis
She did it 'cause she wanted to
Baby took a limo to Memphis
Seemed like the thing to do
Baby took a limo to Memphis
She did it 'cause she wanted to
That's right, yeah
