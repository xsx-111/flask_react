Lies Lyrics
You said the moon was ours
Yeah, you said the moon was ours
To hell with the day
The sunlight is only going to take love away
Raise up suspicions and, and alibis
But I can see through tear-blinded eyes

Lies, lies, lies, oh, lies
Da da da da da
Oh oh oh

I got a stone where my heart should be
I got a stone where my heart should be
And nothing I do will make you love me
I'll leave this town, break all my ties
Be no more use for any disguises

Lies, lies, lies, oh, lies
Da da da da da
Oh oh oh

I want to die without pain, yeah
I want to die, oh, without pain
All this deception I just can't maintain
The sun, moon, stars in the sky
It'd hurt me too bad if you said goodbye
Lies, lies, lies, oh, lies
Da da da da da
Oh oh oh6Embed
