Oceans & Streams Lyrics
With guilt that no man should carry
Heavy enough for me to get buried
I feel death on the road tonight
It's gotten me to where I want to run and hide

Oh, I used to dream
Of oceans and streams
Flowing and growing strong
Where have all those days gone?

These days I am so slow
All those thoughts and nowhere to go
My aim, it used to be so true
My world had a place in it darling, just for you

Oh, I used to dream
Of oceans and streams
Flowing and growing strong
Where have all those days gone?

'Scuse me, now, I got to go
Can't stand to be here anymore, no
I'm sick and I got to go to bed
If I stay now, I'm better off dead

Oh, I used to dream
Of oceans and streams
Flowing and growing strong
Where have all those days gone?1Embed
