Psychotic Girl Lyrics
I heard you throw your man around
Pick him up just to let him down
It is a shame, baby, but I always knew
Just the way you are going to do, oh

Oh no
Just a psychotic girl
And I won't get lost in your world

Friday night in the party lights
You were acting like everything was alright
Till later on with no one around
Had me fighting for air, laying on the ground, oh no

Oh no
Just a psychotic girl
And I won't get lost in your world

I thought you would change, but I should have known
You would play nice for a time and then you do me wrong
I thought long and hard about what I should I say
And when I was through it just came out this way, oh no
Oh no
Just a psychotic girl
And I won't get lost in your world7Embed
