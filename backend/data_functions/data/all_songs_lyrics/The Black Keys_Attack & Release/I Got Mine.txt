I Got Mine Lyrics
Yeah!

I was a moving man in my younger days
But I have grown out of my rambling ways
I left that road so far behind
Now I know, oh baby

I got mine
I got mine
I got mine
Oh baby, I got mine

So baby when I rolled, I rolled deep
So much so, I couldn't get no sleep
Rock and roll hustle all the time
Now I know, oh baby

I got mine
I got mine
I got mine
Oh baby, I got mine
Whoa, I got mine
I got mine
I got mine
Oh baby, I got mine
