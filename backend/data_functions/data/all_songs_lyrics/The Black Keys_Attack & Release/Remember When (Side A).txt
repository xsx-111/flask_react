Remember When (Side A) Lyrics
It happened when I heard her name
Same old thoughts crept back again
Oh and grow, they grow

And somewhere in my, my sorry state
Lightning struck that old iron gate
It's true yes, it's true

With snow in tow, the winter winds
Smacks you on your cheeks again
Oh, it stings, it stings

Mmm
Oh, oh
Ahh, ahhEmbed
