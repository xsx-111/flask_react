All You Ever Wanted Lyrics
You're just like time
Except you can still feel the same
All hands on deck now
The sea is getting rough again
You see him out your window
Even when you close the blinds
And all you ever wanted
Was someone to treat you nice and kind

Take a step before running
Take a breath now before you dive
When you work the streets, Darling
Make sure your sneaker laces, they get tied
I will be your black bird, Darling
Hanging on your telephone wire
Flap my wings on it
And set your heart afire1Embed
