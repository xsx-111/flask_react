Same Old Thing Lyrics
It don't matter where you have been
The people try to do you in
Every day 'til dawn
There's some thievin' goin' on

Oh, oh no
Hurt me so

Just the same old thing
Just the same old thing
No matter how much love you try to bring
Just the same old thing

You got a callous heart
From being torn apart
Now you labor every day
Love life drifts away

Oh, oh no
Hurt me so
Just the same old thing
Just the same old thing
No matter how much love you try to bring
Just the same old thing1Embed
