Moon Shines On Trubble LyricsMoon shines hard on trouble
Check your watch by the lake city shuttle
And she tries hard not to decide
Are you gonna tell him where you go nightly?
When you're dressed so brightly
Is the money gonna come without a price?
A hundred holes and bubbles
You gotta avoid trouble
Just waiting for something to arrive
And all your daydream heroes
Are losing their hair, teeth and halos
Who're you gonna fall into tonight?
Pay the bills for uncle Ted he's a nutter
Lives on bananas and peanut butter
Keeps his teeth in a glass of Long Island tea
And are you gonna tell him where you go nightly?
And that the kids are tucked in tightly?
Is the city big enough for you to hide?
A hundred holes and bubbles
You gotta avoid the trouble
Of waiting for a way out to arrive
All your daydream heroes
Are losing their hair, teeth and halos
Who're you gonna fall into tonight?
Are you gonna tell him where you go nightly?Embed
