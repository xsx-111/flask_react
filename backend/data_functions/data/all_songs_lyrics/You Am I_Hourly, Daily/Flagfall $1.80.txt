Flagfall $1.80 LyricsIf I'm so unpopular out on the highway
Why is everybody waving at me?
See if they even knew ya
Wouldn't you find that a little peculiar?
Six pack, cheaper domestic to keep
The council's road works protected
Mopping up puke for
All the high school kids getting soaking
Ripping off stickers off dashboards
Preventing me from smoking
We ain't going west of the city
But I'll take you to the station
'Cause your girlfriend's pretty
Six pack, cheaper domestic to keep
The council's road works protected
I can get you where you want
Start at $1.80 add the extra
But for that late night AM talk back line
Don't use my mirror for your hairdo
If you don't mind
I can get you where you want
Start at $1.80 add the extra
But for that late night AM talk back line
Don't use my mirror for your hairdo
If you don't mindEmbed
