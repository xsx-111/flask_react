Dead Letter Chorus LyricsEveryone talks so fast and walks so slow
Suddenly in a town they don't know
Last stop and strangers drink
And admitting me in the midnight show and
Two kids sweat
As he's trying to get his lips to her neck
It's all up to him, it's a concession film
But what do you do?
Where have I been lately?
Dirty water interrupted by
A bridge that's not too sore on the eye
Guy in the better looking pants
Is ruining the other's night and
Will he hurt
As the air conditioning dries out his shirt
It's all up to him, it's a concession film
But what do you do?
Where have I been lately?
It's if nothing I said knows new
It's if you've never heard anything true
But we will try 'til the next time or the last time
Everyone talks so fast and walks so slow
Suddenly in a town they don't know
Hours come and minutes fly
The fifteen stories window high and
Two kids sweet
As he tries to stare his shame to his feet
'cause you owe it to him, it's a concession film
But what do you do?
Where have I been lately?
It's if nothing I said knows new
It's if you've never heard anything true
But we will try 'til the next time or the last timeEmbed
