Mr. Milk LyricsI'm sure could make your hand fit mine (woo, woo)
If I deliver these custard trays on time (woo, woo)
Four thirty a.m. ding dong rise (woo, woo)
Kiss her photo with the beam from ash tray light (woo, woo)
I'm sure I could deliver better
If I pretended I'd never met her
She said she'd love me sweeter
If we made it to the pier for dinner
Seven months in a ditch while the ring kept for her to decide (woo, woo)
If my milk truck's gonna be her chariot ride (woo, woo)
Four thirty a.m. ding dong rise (woo, woo)
Morning sun makes my sour heart pasteurise (woo, woo)
I'm sure I could deliver better
If I pretended I'd never met her
She said she'd love me sweeter
If we made it to the pier for dinner
Welsh rarebit with a new dress on
If that ain't enough to make you smile
Every Kintail Road kid knows
When she's around then cheese goes dry
Da,da,da,da,da,da....etcEmbed
