Heavy Comfort LyricsDid you catch her in the window?
Do-right woman, do-right man
Praying for heavy comfort
To fill his pockets with his hands
Men in chip shops, milk bars, postmen
Used to fork out for your mouth
And now the compliments have stopped
Since every asset's headed south
He was a sharp one what a looker
The last drunk to hang around
Get well shickered-colour knickers
Just for the mirror now
Had a dream once it was morning
In a dress that never frayed
And now your friends are like eyelashes
Too many dropping off these days
For forty seconds today
I was sure that we were feeling the same way
For forty seconds today
I was sure that we were feeling the same wayEmbed
