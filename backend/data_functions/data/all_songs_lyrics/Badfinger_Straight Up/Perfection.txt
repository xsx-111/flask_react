Perfection Lyrics
There is no real perfection
There'll be no perfect day
Just love is our connection
The truth in what we say

There's no good revolution
Just power changin' hands
There is no straight solution
Except to understand

So listen to my song of life
You don't need a gun or a knife
Successful conversation
Will take you very far

There is no real perfection
There'll be no perfect man
Just peace is our connection
Forgivin' all you can

There's no good kind of killin'
Just power taking life
It's all good blood that's spillin'
To make a bigger knife
So listen to my song of life
You don't need a gun or a knife
Successful conversation
Will take you very far
Successful conversation
Will take you very far


So listen to my song of life
You don't need a gun or a knife
Successful conversation
Will take you very far
Successful conversation
Will take you very far
Successful conversation
Will take you very farEmbed
