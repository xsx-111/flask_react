Flying Lyrics
Feel like I'm flyin', I'm dyin' to say
Want you forever and easy
Be where you are, where I want you to stay
Don't you know what I'm sayin'? Believe me

Feel like I'm fallin', it's all I can do
Lyin' and dyin' is lonely
Deeper and darker, no way to forgive
No way to believe what you told me
Way to believe what you told me
Way to believe

Kings in their castles wound up in their wine
Drinkin' their confidence daily
Wish I could be into that peace of mind
Wish I could be into crazy
Wish I could be into crazy
Wish I could beEmbed
