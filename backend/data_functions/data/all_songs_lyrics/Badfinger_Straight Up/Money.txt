Money Lyrics
Money stole my lady
Fools have a way of makin' me crazy
Money buy you freedom
Rules have a way of makin' me lazy

So we grow a little older
With another tale to tell
So we grow a little colder
With another tale to tell

Money make you feel unhappy
Fools have a way of makin' me crazy

So we grow a little older
With another tale to tell
So we grow a little colder
With another tale to tellEmbed
