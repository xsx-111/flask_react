Name of the Game Lyrics
Saw the railway master and I looked him in the eye
I said, "Would you go much faster if you thought that you would die?"
He said, "Not me, sir.  I could not care.  In fact, I would not try
For protest would not take me far
It's different, me not bein' a star"
Locked my feelings in a jar until another day

Oh, comfort me, dear brother, won't you tell me what you know?
For somewhere in this painful world is a place where I can go
Oh, long awaitin' mother, is it time to make a show?
And take your babies to your breast
No, we never passed the test
All our sins should be confessed before we carry on

Oh, don't refuse me
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame
No, don't confuse me
For I know it's the name of the game

I got up off my pillow and I looked up at the sun
I said, "You can see quite clearly now the things that we have done
We burned your sacred willow and our battles we have won
But did we get so very far?
It's different, me not bein' a star"
Locked my feelings in a jar until we go away
Oh, don't refuse me
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame
No, don't confuse me
For I know it's the name of the game
Oh, don't refuse me
If you choose me, you'll follow my shame
No, don't confuse me
For I know it's the name of the gameEmbed
