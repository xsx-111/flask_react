Sweet Tuesday Morning Lyrics
Sweet Tuesday mornin' came on your smile
All of my fears, they have left me

Sweet Tuesday mornin' came on your smile
Love is the answer you gave me

I've been to places all around, astound me
Seen the breakin' of the souvenir
In a brightness I can feel surround me
It's the first time I've felt it for years

Sweet Tuesday mornin' came on your smile
Love is the answer you gave me

Been to places all around, astound me
Seen the breakin' of the souvenir
In a brightness I can feel surround me
It's the first time I've felt it for yearsEmbed
