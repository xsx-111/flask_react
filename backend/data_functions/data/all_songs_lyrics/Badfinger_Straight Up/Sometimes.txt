Sometimes Lyrics
Sometimes, I'm only waitin' for your smile
Sometimes, I'll only wait a while
Sometimes, a feelin' makes me wanna cry
Tell me why

Sometimes I'm foolin', playin' for my time
Sometimes, the days are always fine
Sometimes, a cloudburst puts me out of line
It's a crime

There's always tomorrow, the end of your sorrow and pain
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain)
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain)
There's always a reason you always believed in my soul
(My soul)

There's always tomorrow, the end of your sorrow and pain
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain)
(Ooh pain, sorrow and pain)
There's always a reason you always believed in my soul
(In my soul)
Yeah, sometimes, I'm only waitin' for your smile
Sometimes, I'll only wait a while
Sometimes, a feelin' makes me wanna cry
Yeah, tell me why

Gotta find out why (Why, why)
Tell me why
Find out whyEmbed
