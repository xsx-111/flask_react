Baby Blue Lyrics
Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waitin' there too long, my love
All that time, without a word
Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget
Or I'd regret

The special love I have for you
My baby blue

All the days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong?
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realise that I would know
I would show

The special love I have for you
My baby blue

What can I do, what can I say?
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you? Show me a way
Don't you know the times I've tried?
Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feelin' just grows stronger everyday
Just one thing before I go
Take good care, baby, let me know
Let it grow

The special love you have for me
My Dixie dear12Embed
