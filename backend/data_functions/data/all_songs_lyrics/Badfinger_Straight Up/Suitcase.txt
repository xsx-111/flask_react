Suitcase Lyrics
Suitcase, suitcase, follow me 'round
Bootlace, bootlace, tie me down
Money for fun, yeah, golden crowns
It's all inside a game we've been playin' so long

Driver, driver, go too fast
Miser, miser, make it last
Butcher, butcher, on the run
It's all inside a game we've been playin' so long

Well, I'm sorry to be leavin'
That's all I get to say
Sorry to be leavin' today

Well, I'm sorry to be leavin'
That's all I get to say
Sorry to be leavin' today

Driver, driver, go too fast
Miser, miser, make it last
Butcher, butcher, on the run
It's all inside a game we've been playin' so long (So long)
So long (So long)
So long (So long)
So long (So long)
Ooh long (So long)
Yeah, long (So long)
Oh, long (So long)
Yeah, long (So long)
Ooh, long (So long)
Yeah, long (So long)
Oh, long (So long)
Yeah, long (So long)
Yes (So long)
Ooh (So long)
(So long)
(So long)Embed
