Friendship Lyrics
Jolene, you were the best friend I ever had
Beyond me how you could go and treat me oh so bad
Somebody get me a doctor, yeah

Who is your one true friend?
Who is your one true friend?

You're jealous and it's all because of one thing
You know that you'll never have
And I don't really care if you could hurt me
I'm going to take as much as I can grab

Who is your one true friend?
Who is your one true friend, in the end?
You'll have to come to your own defense

Jolene, you were the best friend I ever had (woo!)
Jealous and it's all because of one thing, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I don't really care if you could hurt me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, in the end, your one true friend has to come to your defense
In the end, your one true friend has to come to your defenseEmbed
