Delivering Maybes Lyrics
What you did after what you said (what you said)
Will never mean a thing to anyone
And what you wrote and then what I read (and what I read)
Could sugar-free the oldest kids instead

But I'm alright whenever you get out
When you'll be looking up to me
You're so uptight whenever you make out

Innocence is an accident
Even if it comes by two or three
And in a sense, it's a consequence
Of everything you took away from me
But I'm alright, I said when I got out
That nothing ever came for free
I'm up all night pretending to make out


Remember the time when you called me out from my school
(My school, that day at my school)
And we got caught by the cops but we'd never go to prison
'Cause we made the rules
Well, alright, whenever you get out
You'll be looking after me
And we'll be making it right, alright?
On and on we roam around this world
And on and on we roam around this world
Delivering babies, and maybe it's not that bad now
On and on we roam around this world
Delivering babies, and maybe it's not that bad now

What you did after what you said (well, what'd you say?)
Will never mean a thing to anyone
And what you wrote and then what I read (and what I read)
Could sugar-free the oldest kids instead

(On and on we roam around this world)
'Cause you remember the time when you saw me smiling at you
(At you, that day at my school)
(On and on we roam around this world)
And with December in mind we'll keep the pilots filing
Their rusty nails all around (delivering babies)
And maybe it's not that bad now

On and on we roam around this world
Delivering babies
And maybe it's not that bad now
(On and on we roam around this world)
On and on we roam around this world
Delivering babies
And maybe it's not that bad now
(On and on we roam around this world)
Delivering maybes
And baby, it's not that bad now
(On and on we roam around this world)
Delivering maybes
And baby, it's not that bad nowEmbed
