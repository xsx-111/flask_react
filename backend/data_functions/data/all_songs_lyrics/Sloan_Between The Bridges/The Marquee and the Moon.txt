The Marquee and the Moon Lyrics
Cabaret license, I haven't been by since
It goes against all that I've learned
But it seems that the tables have turned
But could we have stopped it? We all get co-opted
To some kind of system it seems
But they can't take away, can't take away all our dreams

Like the one where I'm in a balloon
Floating above, I can see the Marquee and the Moon
The monkey, the dog, and Neptune
They're all in good spirits, I'm happy to hear it
But haven't the sweetest idea
To me buzz is onomatopoeia
Will something be happening soon
To settle the difference between the Marquee and the Moon?
They're passing the torch, knife, and spoon

And so it goes, I guess there are those
Who want to get out like me, yeah, oh
Their clientele can go to Hell if they want to get in for free
But Hell ain't a bad place to be, yeah, yeah
Am I any different than either the Moon or Marquee? (Yeah)
Oh, not a lot if you ask me
Cabaret license, I've been coming by since
The action continued past two
Before this what did we used to do, what did we used to do?Embed
