The N.S. Lyrics
Free for all so choose your places well
But you won't believe all the things we're telling you
End it all before the curtain falls
Because all time will tell is that everything is a lie

I lost the fight but won the war
And no one really knows what it is we're fighting for
You lost the fight but won the war
And no one really knows what it is we're fighting for

But if you think that it's cold when you're swimming in the ocean
It's hard to believe you're a Nova Scotian boy
Have you considered the cost of abusing your devotion?
And if we get lost we can find out
Where it was we used to be when time stood still for you

You or I could tell a story well
But attention fell before the lights came on again
Without the sense of hearing, my thoughts are disappearing
And all time will tell is that anyone can decide

I lost the fight but won the war
And no one really knows what it is we're fighting for anyway
You lost the fight but won the war
And no one really knows what it is we're fighting for
But if you think that it's cold when you're swimming in the ocean
It's hard to believe you're a Nova Scotian boy
Have you considered the cost of abusing your devotion
And if we get lost we can find out

Where it was we used to be, we're following signs to the sea
So take your time if you're leaving before me
And say goodbye, say bye-bye (bye-bye)Embed
