Sensory Deprivation Lyrics
Don't take it from me
But Altered States scared me

Shoulda realized it
It's when he tore apart the lab with the monkey on his back
I never recognized him
And now he'll never give up until security can pull him aside

The goats don't mind
Only the doctors disagree
Playing his lover like a broad mind
And now it's happening to me


Don't take it from me
Everyone can try to save his life
'Cause evidently he's unable

Shoulda realized it
It's when he tore apart the lab with the monkey on his back
I never recognized him
And now he'll never give up until security can pull him asideEmbed
