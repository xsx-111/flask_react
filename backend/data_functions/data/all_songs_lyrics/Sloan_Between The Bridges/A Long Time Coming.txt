A Long Time Coming Lyrics
Oh, I walk the line for you
Each and every day
And there's a bullet with my name on it
Or at least that's what they say

You take me for granted
And it's such a cryin' shame
Because I would gladly give my life for you
Each and every day

It's been a long time coming
It took a long time to get to me
It doesn't matter which side I'm on
I always feel like I'm in the wrong
It doesn't matter which side I'm on
It just keeps losing

I walk the line for you (I walk the line for you)
Each and ever day (each and every day)

It doesn't matter which side I'm on
I always feel like I'm in the wrong
It doesn't matter which side I'm on
It just keeps losing
It's been a long time coming
It took a long time to get to me
It's been a long time coming
It took a long time to get to me
(Long time, long time coming)
It's been a long time coming
Long time, long time coming
Long time, long time comingEmbed
