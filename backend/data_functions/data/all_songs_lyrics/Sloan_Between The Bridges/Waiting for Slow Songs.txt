Waiting for Slow Songs Lyrics
When you and your cast of friends arrive
And the party reaches a new high
Don't you think it'll last too long?
Before you know it, baby, they break out into that song
That I know I've heard it once or twice
From where, I just can't be precise
Even though it's irrelevant, it's as if I've woken from
A confused and cloudy dream

But you write the saddest song
Turn around and make it a singalong
The heart-scratched melody
Means there's more than this for you and me, yeah

When you wait by the door, look for your ride
Where the shoes are piled up on the side
And the dancing's out of hand
Don't leave just 'cause they won't play your favourite band
And the night it goes on and on
And I'm waiting for slow songs
But I block out most of the singing
Replaced by bells, is that your ride?
(You only just arrived)
Could you write the saddest song
Turn around and make it a singalong?
The heart-scratched melody
Means there's more than this for you and me, yeah

And the night, it goes on and on
I'm through waiting for slow songs
But I block out most of the ringing
Replaced by thoughts unjustified
(I wish that I could write)

Could you write the saddest song
Turn around and make it a singalong?
The heart-scratched melody
Means there's more than this for you and me, yeah

If words could be combined
To describe your trademark look tonight
I'd write it out to boost my career
But you know that writing always takes me yearsEmbed
