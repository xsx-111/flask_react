At the Edge of the Scene Lyrics
Well, you've got your bags together
And you're off into the new world
The mother is impatient with four sons
She wanted four girls
The father's wrapped in memories
Of European relations
Counting flurries on the window
As he dials another station coming home

It's black upon black, he's still cutting the track
Old Ireland's heart may still call him back
At the edge of the scene, the old glasses were round
The siren is heard, and it's the cue for his sound

Well, alright
Well, alright

As sovereign of all, he's likely second to none
Well, the change is complex and it's only take one
At the edge of the scene, he's revered by the most
Not just under our feet but from here to the coast
Alright
Well, alright

The ties that are loose are the ones that he binds
If we wander off track, well, he'll keep us aligned
At the edge of the scene not unlike in D.C
It's the sound from down there years ago set him free

Well, alright
Well, alright

My story is tame, no, it's not very wild
Expectations were debated for this only child
At the end of the scene when our secret's revealed
You know it's my life and it's the way that I feel

Well, alright
Well, alright

When you're miles above Pacific Ocean waters
Without angel's wings will help with getting closer
When my headphone cord untangles
Oh, pilot, can you hear me?
Our destination beckons
Counting raindrops on the windshield
Yet skies are clear, he reckons, for tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
