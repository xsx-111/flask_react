All by Ourselves Lyrics
Say what you want about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what you want about me right now

All by ourselves
She wanted to show we can do anything all by ourselves
You can read all about it in the book that's been flying off the shelves
There's dozens of sales but they say that all good things come in twelves
And that is scary at times

Say what you want about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what you want about me right now

All in good time
This story could work as a tellable tale all in good time
The do-it-yourselfers want to do it so they can see a dime
Chances are you could see us selling as south as Anaheim
Keep dreaming, if you know me well, then you know that I'm
Willing to take that chance

Keeping in mind, I believe that we're history makers
(Please tell me who you think you're affecting)
But the do-it-yourselfers are preparing for that one, too
(Keep dreaming 'cause I know you're collecting)
I only hope we can make it in time but nothing's for sure, is for sure
Oh, yeah
Say what you want about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what you want about me right now

Say what you want about me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say what you want about me right now

Turning and tearing, tearing and turning, turning and tearing out
Tearing and turning, turning and tearing, tearing and turning out
Turning and tearing, tearing and turning, turning and tearing outEmbed
