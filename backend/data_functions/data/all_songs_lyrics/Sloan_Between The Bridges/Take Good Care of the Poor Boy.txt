Take Good Care of the Poor Boy Lyrics
You've got lots to say, don't take this too seriously
(There's plenty of believers)
We hang on every word, almost deliriously
(Yes, we're the believers)
You could say it's borderline fanatic
Hit the chord, we're basically ecstatic
Can't afford to lose you, can't you see?

Take good care of the poor boy
Oh, well, he's new in town and he won't settle down
Take good care of the poor boy
Oh, well, he's new in town and he won't settle down

You won't sit around waiting for it to happen to you
(There's plenty who will listen)
If you hide yourself away, your country may honour you
(A brighter future glistens)
Pulled alarm shows of mere defiance
Draw the looks, don't choose this reliance
Crown of our creation, we're on our knees, Lord

Take good care of the poor boy
Oh, well, he's new in town and he won't settle down
Take good care of the poor boy
Oh, well, he's new in town and he won't settle down
Good luck saving the the poor boy
Oh, when the city's down, and he's gone underground
Ooh, if you leave us behind
Your songs they will stand for all time
And ooh, if you leave us behind (yeah!)
There'll be streets with your name on the sign (yeah)
And oh, Lord

Take good care of the poor boy
Oh, well, he's new in town and he won't settle down
Take good care of the poor boy
Oh, well, he's new in town and he won't settle down

Hey poor boy, hey poor boy, he'll never settle down
(Never settle down)
Hey poor boy, hey poor boy, he'll never settle down
(Never settle down)
Hey poor boy, hey poor boy, he'll never settle down
(Never settle down)
Hey poor boy, hey poor boy, he'll never settle down
(Never settle down)
Ah...Embed
