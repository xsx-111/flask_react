Losing California Lyrics
You hit rock bottom and everybody knows it
But does anybody care how you got there?
Admit to yourself that everything's a problem
But when it comes down what do you care?

They're losing California
Inch by inch, sit back and watch it go
Coming in clearly
Dance, dance, dance to the radio

And everybody loves it but
Nobody knows what it stands for
Get into yourself in dark sunglasses
And elevate it all 'til it means more

And move out to California
Inch by inch is all you need to go
Coming in clearly
Dance, dance, dance to the radio

Sometimes it's too much
You want to get right out of your mind
Sometimes it's too much
You're gonna go right out of your mind
You hit rock bottom and everybody knows it
But does anybody care how you got there?
Admit to yourself that everything's a problem
But when it comes down what do you care?

Sometimes it's too much
You want to get right out of your mind
Sometimes it's too much
You're gonna go right out of your mind

California
Inch by inch, sit back and watch it go
Coming in clearly
Dance, dance, dance to the radio
California
Inch by inch, sit back and watch it go
Coming in clearly
Dance, dance, dance to the radioEmbed
