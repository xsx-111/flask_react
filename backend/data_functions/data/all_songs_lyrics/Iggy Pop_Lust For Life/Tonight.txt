Tonight Lyrics
I saw my baby
She was turning blue
Oh, I knew that soon
Her young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be all right, tonight
Everything will be all right, tonight
No one moves, no one talks
No one thinks, no one walks, tonight
Everyone will be all right, tonight
Everyone will be all right, tonight
No one moves, no one talks
No one thinks, no one walks, tonight
Tonight

I am going to love her to the end
I am going to love her to the end
I will love her until I die
I will see her in the sky, tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
