Turn Blue LyricsSee a black El Dorado
Oh, rolling along down below my window
That black girl in the back looks pretty good
Christ, she's beautiful!
Know how soft she is?
Just what you feel like
Oh, I'm so far away from her
Jesus, this is Iggy
Leave...
You might as well come with me
When you ride the ride
There's talk, but I don't want to talk
Oh mamma, I shot myself down
Oh mamma, I shot myself down
Oh mamma, I shot myself down
Oh mamma, yeah mamma, I tell you, I shot myself down
They're stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts
I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts
Damn, I don't know why
They're stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts
Can't you see?
Oh no, stepping on our hearts
How come the blacks, how come they
They copy you so good?
They get off on you so... sexually!
If you want to make it
Young man, you got to make somebody come
Come out of your black
Come out of your black
Black and strong and black
Black and strong and black
Black! Strong! Black!
Jesus, it's cold in this room, it's really cold
You know, I never, I never told you about this but there's one guy
Somebody I really love, he's never around
Well, he's taken things that could be alright, that could be nice
And he make them so ugly, so damn ugly
And we put out the lights on them
Yeah, we'd make it dark, we put out the lights on them
It's idiots like you that screw me up
I know there's nothing to you
And I don't know why I treat you so kind
Come down and dance with me, dance with me
You got nobody left but me
Oh accept me, don't reject me, don't forget me
Mamma, what color will the lights be?
Will they turn blue on me?
Mamma, what color will the lights be?
Will they turn blue on me?
Mamma, I shot myself up
Whoa mamma, I shot myself up
Mamma, I shot myself up up up up up
Mamma, I shot myself up, down, up, down
Mamma, up up up up up
Mamma, I didn't know what I was doing
And I didn't mean to but I did it, I shot myself up
Ma- ma- I- shot- my- self-Embed
