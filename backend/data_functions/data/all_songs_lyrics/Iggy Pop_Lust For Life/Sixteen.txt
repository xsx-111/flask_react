Sixteen Lyrics
Sweet Sixteen in leather boots
Body and soul I go crazy
Baby, baby I'm hungry Sweet Sixteen
Funky bar all full of faces
Pretty faces, beautiful faces
Body and soul, body and soul, I give to you
I am an easy mark
With my broken heart Sweet Sixteen
Show you my explosion Sweet Sixteen
Go out to the funky bar
I get hurt, crying inside
Because everybody's so fine and
And they don't need me
Tell me, what can I do, Sweet Sixteen?
I give you my body and soul Sweet Sixteen
I must be hungry
Because I go crazy
Over your leather boots
Now baby, I know
That's not normal
Well, I love you, I love you, I love you
Sweet Sixteen
Everywhere I go, I'm lonely...1Embed
