Glass & Patron Lyrics
Whisper in tongues
Heal me with your hands
Double knot my throat, mother
Double knot my throat, mother
In words I lose
Don't be mad
Advocating every second, every minute
To my mind it's so sweet
And I wish you could see it
I'll be home soon
I'll be there

Do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
Are you watching me cause I move alone?
Look a little harder
Everything I hold is wet
And I've never tasted glass and patron
I wait all week for a moment's break
Away from being told who I am
So do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
I can't wait to make your body my own
1, 2, 3...
Now hold that pose for me
1, 2, 3...
Now hold that pose for me

Do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
Are you watching me cause I move alone?
Look a little harder
Shut your eyes and feel the rush
Will you fuck me while I stare at the sun?
We wait all week to
Hear gods talk
When you've got a front row seat to the stars
Do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
Cause I've never tasted glass and patron

1, 2, 3...
Now hold that pose for me
1, 2, 3...
Now hold that pose for me
Know what you want, what you need
But only when you're tasting doubt
Teach yourself to rise from ashes built from lust and hurt
You are phoenix, you are fire, you are everything
I just want for you to love you
Your child plays a wicked game
Swallow spartans for the pain
Let her hold him to his choice

Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Hold that pose for me
Know what you want, what you need
But only when you're tasting doubt
Teach yourself to rise from ashes built from lust and hurt
You are phoenix, you are fire, you are everything
I just want for you to love you
Your child plays a wicked game
Swallow spartans for the pain
Let her hold him to his
Hold him to his choice

1, 2, 3...
Now hold that pose for me
1, 2, 3...
Now hold that pose for me

Now hold that pose for me
Now hold that pose for me
Now hold that pose for me32Embed
