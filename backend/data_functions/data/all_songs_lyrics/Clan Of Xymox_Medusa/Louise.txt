Louise Lyrics
Louise, it seemed a long time ago
Louise, I'll always remember that day
I crawled on my knees
Begging you to stay
You made me shiver, Louise
You made me quiver

I do the strangest things
I think such lonely thoughts
Forgetting all
Just forgetting you, Louise
Anything at all
Not to think of you
Anything at all
Don't deny it's not true, Louise

I feel I'm getting weaker
A life blue on gloomy waves
I feel I'm diving deeper
Into the darkest caves
There's nothing at all to find a way
Louise, Louise, Louise
My heart used to beat
Now it only weeps
Louise, Louise, Louise
Uncaring, the city sleeps
I'm twisted in the streets

I am shivering (I feel)
I am quivering (I feel)
Into the strangest things
Lonely thoughts, forgetting you, Louise
And you promised me, you told me
You told me empty lies
Louise, Louise
Leave me, leave me (my only cord is not to adore)
No longer interfere (I have to say)
Louise, Louise (it is my only way)Embed
