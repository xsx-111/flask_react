Medusa Lyrics
Finally
I have seen the lights in your eyes
And now
I'm gloryfing my tragic destiny
Dreams can be wholesome for me
Life is a tormented dream for me

Mesmerize me, enchant me
Mesmerize with your eyes, now
Enchant me, hypnotize me
Enchant me, mesmerize me
Enchant me, hypnotize me

I found the lies in your words
And now
I'm gloryfing my tragic destiny
Dreams can be hard and mean
I still wonder if you are aware of this
Dreams can be hard and mean
Life is a tormented dream, now

Medusa, Medusa
Medusa
Enchant me, mesmerize me
Enchant me, mesmerize me
Enchant me, hypnotize me
Enchant me, mesmerize meEmbed
