Agonised by Love Lyrics
I crawled through the forgotten house
In open air I know a beast
Brooding like something torn up
A terraced hill
They seem swallowed by the Sun
They seem swallowed by the Sun
It's even hot
It's even hot under the blue Moon
I can't sleep

I'm deeply agonized by you
Deeply agonized by love
Deeply agonized by you
Deeply agonized by love

Matting clouds in my view
Squiggle myself underneath
I say
The stream flows, sky blows
As a sultry breeze
And matting clouds
Still in my view
I think (I think)
I'm deeply agonized by you (I'm deeply agonized by you)
I'm deeply (I'm deeply)
Agonized by you (agonized by you)
By your love


She comes
She comes my way
She comes
She comes my way
A black moon draws a shadow on my face
The black sea dashed like the thunder in my ears
I'm deeply agonized by you
By your loveEmbed
