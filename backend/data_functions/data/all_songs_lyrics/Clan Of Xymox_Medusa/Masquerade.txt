Masquerade Lyrics
I'm here
Laying underneath
Where there's nothing left to say
You slowly went your way from me
Felt your softness
Fade away
Who am I
Who am I to make you stay

Oh here we go again
Entering the masquerade
This is the place
Dreams will shatter
Cover your face
And care no more - care no more
Oh and here she goes again
Scattering dreams
She don't care no more - care no more
She don't care no more

These narrowed eyes, I don't know
Nothing's there behind
The mask you wear
Now it feels
So unreal
Cold as ice
Cold as ice
This face I see

Masquerade, masquerade - let me out
Masquerade, masquerade - care no more
Masquerade - she don't care no more
Masquerade, masquerade
Let me out to save herEmbed
