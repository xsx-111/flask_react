Back Door Lyrics
I'm shrouded in darkness
I crouch in wasted years
I linger, I can't get through
Dazzled between far and near
Like the Elegies relate to days beyond recall
I linger in many memories

And again I stumble through the back door
Seeing you, a misty shadow
I feel my repression
I can't go on
And again I am falling backwards
Tomorrow, I'll be here again
A silent mute of a black desire
Tomorrow, I will be here again
Tomorrow, I'll be here again
Be here again
Be here again

I am tired of tears and laughter
Or what may come hereafter
I'm weary of days and hours
Desires, dreams and powers
Although it makes me weep
It's you
I wanna keep
