Movie Magg Lyrics
Now let me take you to the movies Magg
So I can hold your hand
Oh it ain't that I don't like your house
It's just that doggone man
And that double barrel behind the door
It waits for Carl I know
Oh climb upon ol' Becky's back
And let's ride to the picture show

I only see her once the week
And that's when my work is through
I break new ground the whole week long
With my mind set straight on you
And I've polished up my ol' horse Becky
And she looks good I know
So climb upon ol' Becky's back
And let's ride to the picture show

Now won't you let me take you to the show
So I can hold your hand
Oh it ain't that I don't like your house
It's just that doggone man
And that double barrel behind the door
It waits for me I know
So climb upon ol' Becky's back
And ride to the picture show

Well I break new ground the whole week long
With my mind set straight on you
And every time I try to smile
My heart it breaks in two
Oh I slick myself up Saturday night
'Cause there's one thing I know
I'm a-gonna take my Maggie dear
To the western picture show

Now won't you let me take you to the show
So I can hold your hand
Oh it ain't that I don't like your house
It's just that doggone man
And that double barrel behind the door
Lord, it waits for me I know
So climb upon ol' Becky's back
And let's ride to the picture showEmbed
