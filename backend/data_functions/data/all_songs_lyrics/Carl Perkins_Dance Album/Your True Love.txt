Your True Love Lyrics
True love (Your love)
True love (Your love)
True love, baby
That's what you give to me

True love (Your love)
Your love (Your love)
True love, baby
That's what you give to me

God made the world, and He made it round
I got my baby, and I'm glad I found
Her love was meant for me
And my baby she'll always be

She gives me true love (Your love)
True love (Your love)
True love, baby
That's what you give to me

Ah-ooh, true love (Your love)
Ah, your true love (Your love)
True love, baby
That's what you give to me
True love (Your love)
Your love (Your love)
Your love, baby
That's what you give to me

Love was made, I don't boast
When He made you He made the most
You've got that certain touch
To me, baby, you mean so much

You give me true love (Your love)
Ah, true love (Your love)
True love, baby
That's what you give to me

Well, alright

True love (Your love)
Your true love (Your love)
True love, baby
That's what you give to me
Well, the big, the little, young and old
They all need something to have and hold
When I found you, I found that
You gave me lovin' I can't forget

You gave me true love (Your love)
Your true love (Your love)
True love, baby
That's what you gave to me

Oh-whoa, true love, baby
That's what you gave to meEmbed
