Wrong Yo Yo LyricsRight string, baby, but the wrong yo-yo
You tryin' a-do me like you did before
No need hangin', baby, 'round my door
You got the right string, baby, but the wrong yo-yo
Right string, baby, but the wrong yo-yo
There's no need to hang-a, hang around my door
I used to love you, but I, I don't no more
You got the right string, baby, but the wrong yo-yo
Well, Saturday night, I'm stayin' at home
You got your mind out, oh, you wanna roam
You settle down and leave the others alone
You gonna love me little baby or you'll never be my own
You got the right string, baby, but the wrong yo-yo
You never do the things you do before
You say you love me but you can't no more
You got the right string, baby, but the wrong yo-yoEmbed
