Only You LyricsOnly you
Can make this world seem right
Only you
Can change the darkest night
Only you
And you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart
With love for only you
Only you
Can make this change in me
For it's true
You are my destiny
Now when I hold your hand
I understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only you
Only you
Can make this change in me
For it's true
You are my destiny
Oh, when I hold your hand
I understand
The magic that you do
You're my dream come true
My one and only youEmbed
