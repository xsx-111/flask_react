Matchbox LyricsWell, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I got a long way to go
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home
I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home
Guess I'll never be happy
Everything I do is wrong, yeah
Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog come
When the big dog gets here
Show him what this little puppy done
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
Yeah, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
I got no matches
Got a long way to go
Let 'er go boy, go, go
Well, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
Baby, I'm sitting here wondering
Will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got no matches
Got a long way to go1Embed
