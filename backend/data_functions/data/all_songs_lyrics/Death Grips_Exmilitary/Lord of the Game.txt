Lord of the Game Lyrics
Into the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing
Fuck that, I'm the Lord of the Game
I rule this empire
I am the God of Hellfire!
Lord of the Game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
'Cause no one has came even close to the train
Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver
Whippin' the wheel
Flippin' donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base; where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more, and chill while I feel it so much
My gut burns like the tires
Movin' this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done
For the real ones packin' real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war
Marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come, fuckin' cowards
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
Lord of the Game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
'Cause no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
Which we maintain like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
War is never done, think it is you die
Where was I now?
Like I said before, hear someone knockin' at my front door
Who could it be?
Should I ignore the knockin' or see what could be in store for me if I leave the safety of the shore?
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia? (Is it real?)
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel?
When they ask if you can make it
And you don't wanna go
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
When they tell you, "you must make it"
And you think "hell no!"
Got a bad feeling, and can't shake it
Hits so low
It's like I'd rather be stuck naked
Hits so low
Than waste my time like the last time
And every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time
When you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind you of the last time you
Said you'd never go back
Fuck where you're from
Fuck where you're goin'
It's all about where you're at
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah28Embed
