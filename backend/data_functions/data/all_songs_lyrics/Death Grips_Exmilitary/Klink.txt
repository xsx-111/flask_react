Klink Lyrics
Agh, agh
Agh, agh
Agh, agh
Agh, agh

What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain’t never done shit
Stash what you got cause they're comin' through
Best get rid of that quick
Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip

Minding my own business (Mind)
Minding my own business (Mind, mind)
Minding my own business (Mind)
Minding my own business

Try to hem me up like for life
Stuck in the klink, haters in blue
How they set me up? Should I test my luck?
Here they come, they're in pursuit (Agh)
What did I do? What haven't I done?
You want to see my I.D.? Um
Well, okay, where I'm coming from? Just on my way, not on the run
What you want me to say? Are you just 'bout done?
Power trippin', asshole lickin' haters
Notice how they strut through the spot
Like anybody wants to see a cop
Man, everybody knows they suck
I got to be somewhere, man, fuck
Why the hell you always stoppin' me
Round the clockin' me, like what?
What ya gonna do when they come for you?
A gang of hatin' pigs
What have they ever really done for you?
Ain’t never done shit
Stash what you got cause they're comin' through
Best get rid of that quick
Cause when they get here you know what they're gonna do
All they ever do is trip

Six feet deep below the street
So they can't never say shit again
Fuck the man with a thick broomstick
And put a black flag on the end (Agh)
Got to watch my back or just like that
I’m bound to get locked up
The law's watching me constantly
Too close and way too much
Looking over my shoulder
And checking in the rear view mirror
Cause I'm never not but a moment
From getting taken to jail

They're knocking at my door, down my door
They're shining lights in my eyes
Exactly what do they stand for?
Ever asking more of I, man, why? (Agh)
Like it matters why I chose to ignore
All the laws I've been told to abide
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Think I’m on parole, thinking I just stole
Some shit, you got an A.P.B out on-
But no, you're wrong as usual
Hell no, it wasn't me
Have the nerve to ask me if I'm drunk
When I’m pissing in the middle of the street
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my shoulder
Looking over my- (Woo)
By the way, why they always acting?
Like they know how to size me up?
Ignorant bastards coming after me
All the time on mine, had enough
Why they always wanna hassle me?
Pigs all up on my nuts (Agh)
Like they have to be, like I can't see 'em
Tryin' to play shade tree in the cuts
By robbing me of my dignity
So in the end, I never say much
But ain’t a time pass I don’t wish I could flash
On Penelope like fuck
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

Shot this for everyone who's been there
For my real ones who understand
What it feels like to have your rights read to you
By the-
In the land of the funk
Raised up through the hip hop and the punk
You can see it from, near south sac man
You're gon' feel my mental when I-
