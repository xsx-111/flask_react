Demi Moore Lyrics
Take a dirty picture, babe
I can't sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
Tell me what you'll do, please

I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore

It got quiet on the other line
Said the sun was coming up, and I
Laughed until I couldn't breathe
Now I'm too tired to go to sleep
Now I can't breathe, and I can't sleep

I don't wanna be stoned
I don't wanna be stoned anymore
I don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore

I've got a good feeling
I've got a good feeling
It doesn't happen very often1Embed
