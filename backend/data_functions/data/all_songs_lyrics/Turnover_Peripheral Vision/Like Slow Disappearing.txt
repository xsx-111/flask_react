Like Slow Disappearing Lyrics
Three sixteen's of an inch
Disappear right behind your lips
We were waiting and watching the light in the sky
And it hurt my eyes
I guess that it must have been then
We slipped out of our cagey heads and got
Tangled and lost and dove further out into it all again

And I was afraid
But you were glowing like the most relieving light
You were my revealing light

I closed my eyes and suddenly we were attached
You stayed with me after the moment passed
I felt you buried deep under my chest
Like my lungs when I'm breathing in
And I was not myself when I opened up my eyes again

Over our heads in a daze
We sat and watched while the setting changed into
Something I read in a book that I loved when I was young
I fixed my stare to the screen
A show with a monster was on the TV
It was early October, and all of the yards were alive with lights
And I was afraid
But you were glowing like the most relieving light
You were my revealing light

I closed my eyes and suddenly we were attached
You stayed with me after the moment passed
I felt you buried deep under my chest
Like my lungs when I'm breathing in
And I was not myself when I opened up my eyes againEmbed
