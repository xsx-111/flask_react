Cutting My Fingers Off Lyrics
I found a picture that we took when we brought in the new year
It's hard to see, but I remember
You wore a cocktail dress, ignored the goosebumps on your neck
The namesake of your outfit to keep you warm

You always said that every thought I had was geometric
I couldn't think outside my own lines
I hope you're alright love, I'm sorry that I wasted your time
Never had the intention to make you go
Ooh oh-oh oh


To make you go
To make you go, to make you go
I never wanted to make you go
You might be a stranger now
And I just wanted to let you know
That I meant what I said
And every dream I've ever had has been of myself
And every dream I've ever had's been of a

Better view with a ten-month summer
Losing you is like cutting my fingers off
And even with that summer
Without you, I'd rather cut my fingers off3Embed
