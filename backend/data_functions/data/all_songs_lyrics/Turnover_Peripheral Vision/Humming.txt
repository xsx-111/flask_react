Humming Lyrics
Carelessly you pass the hours
Humming songs you heard when you were young
Positively unattached
Na√Øve and unattracted to the buzz
Elated with your lack of interest
What a wonderful and different song
Show me why you're always smiling
Laugh again and make me fall in love

Oh, just take me where you go
When it gets dark, without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight, I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive

Let me know your secret
Tell me how you color all the empty space
Drawn outside the lines
Your world's a vibrant illustration you create

Chasing you, I'm falling through the rabbit hole
Deep down into an old slope
Evenly, you're pulling me ever faster as we go
Spinning out of control
Oh, just take me where you go
When it gets dark, without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight, I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive
Just take me where you go
When it gets dark, without you I won't make it out
I don't think I'll make it out alive
I wanna run and hide
With you tonight, I know that I can make it out
With you I know I'll make it out alive1Embed
