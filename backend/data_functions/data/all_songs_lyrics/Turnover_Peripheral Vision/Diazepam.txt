Diazepam LyricsI know you're probably sick
Of always sorting me out
It's like I've always got the taste
Of orange nails in my mouth
I know you've probably been exhausted
Cause I haven't slept a wink in a week
Your father doesn't like me
Cause I'm not into sports
And your mother won't approve
Because I'm not of the cross
I took an upper before your sister's wedding
Just to help me pretend
And I don't know what I need
I don't know if I'll be there for you
Down on your knees
I don't know if I'll be there for you
I know you always feel you're by yourself in the house
This is the only night this week I haven't slept on the couch
I hope you know it breaks my heart
That I'm the reason for your sleeping alone
Cause it was always a dream just to know you
Sometimes I find I can hardly speak your name
I know one day I'll come home and I'll find you
It's just a matter of time 'til you break from the strain
And I don't want to go outside
Don't want to make it home tonight
If it's not you in my heart
I don't want to carry it on
And I don't know what I need
(And I don't want to go outside)
I don't know if I'll be there for you
(Don't want to make it home tonight)
Down on your knees
(If it's not you in my heart)
I don't know if I'll be there for you
(I don't want to carry it on)
And I don't know what I need
(And I don't want to go outside)
I don't know if I'll be there for you
(Don't want to make it home tonight)
Down on your knees
(If it's not you in my heart)
I don't know if I'll be there for you
(I don't want to carry it on)Embed
