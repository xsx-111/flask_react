Dizzy on the Comedown Lyrics
Up and down like a red rubber ball
You're always back and forth like the clock on the wall
I want to know about you
I'm spinning all around you
If I stay, do you think that we could change your routine?
I know a trick, I've always got a few up my sleeve
This life is controlled confusion
It's just a grand illusion

And you ask me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you ask me
"How do you pass the days?"

Sing along to a song that I know
It goes bah-bah-bada, sing it over and over
Let it hypnotize you
I'm still here right beside you
Hold my hand, you can follow my lead
You're like a ballerina twirling 'round on your feet
And watching is so fantastic
I want to ask you
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again

Now collapse, take delight in the fall and catch your breath
I know you feel the ring from it all
So try and collect yourself now
It's just a euphoric comedown

And you asked me
"How do you feel when you're away?"
And you asked me
"How do you pass the days?"
'Cause I can still remember when you were afraid of the dark
And I told you to come
And you followed where I asked you to go
You'd go
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again
Would you come here and spin with me?
I've been dying to get you dizzy
Find a way up into your head
So I can make you feel like new again7Embed
