I Would Hate You If I Could Lyrics
I hear you've been telling all your friends that you're done with me
Like you always knew things wouldn't work out
And I've been hearing things from people that I don't want to talk to
Like it matters who you're sleeping with now
Can I erase from my mind anything that you said
Or any time that we spent with each other?
I don't want to waste away another cell on a memory
When you're just another meaningless lover

Forget the nights that we spent laughing
'Til the morning on your bedroom floor
Without a thought about your roommate asleep down the hall
Forget the days we'd waste in bed
Tangled, the smoke still on your breath
Undressed, and pinning you up to the wall

And I swore I heard you talking when I was tossing in my sleep
You were always trying to walk in circles around me
I was out one night when I saw you, and you froze me where I stood
I would hate you, I would hate you if I could

Forget the nights that we spent laughing
'Til the morning on your bedroom floor
Without a thought about your roommate asleep down the hall
Forget the days we'd waste in bed
Tangled, the smoke still on your breath
Undressed, and pinning you up to the wall
I would hate you
But  I'm not finished yet
I would hate you
But I'm not finished yet
Even you, up on that pedestal
The time will come
When you will deconstruct yourself
And remake what you are
When it does you'll remember me
And the words I spoke
And wonder how you ever could have strayed so far
Even you, up on that pedestal
The time will come
When you will deconstruct yourself
And remake what you are
When it does you'll remember me
And the words I spoke
And wonder how you ever could have strayed so far7Embed
