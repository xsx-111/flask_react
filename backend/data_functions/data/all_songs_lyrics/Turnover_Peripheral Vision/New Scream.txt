New Scream Lyrics
Can I stay at home? I don’t want to go
I don’t want to wake up 'til the sun is hanging low
Stay up through the night, sleep away the light
Just another dream I had that's better than my life

Adolescent dreams gave to adult screams
Paranoid that I won’t have all the things they say I need
What if I don’t want a pattern on my lawn?
All I know is something's wrong, because every day, I'm

Craving that new scream
Lusting for more than just old dreams
I’ve been dying to feel alive
And I’ve been wasting all my time
Chasing the high

Can I reset my brain? If not, I’ll go insane
I swear to God that I don’t think I can go another day
Am I the only one? Is this in all of us?
I hate the thought that I’m alone, but I hope that you're not

Craving that new scream
Lusting for more than just old dreams
I’ve been dying to feel alive
And I’ve been wasting all my time
Chasing the high
Still craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust, and I’ve been waiting still
Craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust, and I’ve been waiting still
Craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust, and I’ve been waiting still
Craving more than just the same as how it was
I’ve been collecting dust, and I’ve been waiting still
