Intrapersonal LyricsI can see you beside me
In my peripheral vision
Always right there
Always aware
Of this manic depressive condition
There's a fever burning up in me
I'm tangled up inside a sinking feeling
Slipping out of touch with the controls
It's all intrapersonal
Lay my head down
Try and sleep now
Can't slow down my mind
Close my eyes, try to find
A train of thought I can hop
Out of the mess I grew in my head
Afraid I won't know how to stop
And I want to know
And I want to know
And I want to know
Native delirium
Are you a daughter of
This new insomnia
My hypochondria?
Wilt me just past the bloom
Pull up my deepest roots
A graceful poison like
A wave of vile blight
There's a fever burning up in me
I'm tangled up inside a sinking feeling
Slipping out of touch with the controls
It's all intrapersonalEmbed
