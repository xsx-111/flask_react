Hello Euphoria LyricsThinner at the waist line
I feel thinner at the waist line
I'm getting old in the face
Everyday there’s another new line, new line
Thinner at the waist line
I feel thinner at the waist line
I'm getting old in the face
Everyday there’s another new line
You're looking thinner, are you alright?
Yeah I'm just busy all of the time
I'm just a little more tired
Every day I really don't know why
(I'm just so far, I feel so far away)
(I'm just so far, I feel so far away)
There's really nothing like the first time
There's really nothing like the first time
It's a long way down when you fall
And you're missing cloud nine
I wish I was more afraid
I made all the same mistakes they told me I'd make
And now it's different everyday
They make me, they break me
I'm just so far, I feel so far away
I'm just so far, I feel so far away
I'm just so far, I feel so far away
I'm just so far, I feel so far away
You call my name
And then it pulls me in
You call my name
And then it pulls me in
You call my name
And then it pulls me in
You call my name…
I'm just so far, I feel so far away
I'm just so far, I feel so far away4Embed
