The Walls of Babylon LyricsAs the sun comes up for a new day
Beams of light that shattered through the night
Explodes into fragments of a razor sharp morning
Melts away the past
But fails to melt the coldest heart
But fails to melt the coldest heart
So you think you're back on the right line
Turning water into wine, silver into gold
A thousand crimes will all be told
So you want a drive on the white line
Throwing caution to the wind, shooting arrows from your bow
A thousand mysteries to be solved
So you think you're back on the right line
And I know what you're thinking
Dream what you're dreaming
Walls of Babylon come tumbling down
Babylon's burning in my mind
Look sideways for the very first time
Struck by lightning for my crime
Acting strange and I don't know why
And I can dream what you're dreaming
Feel what you're feeling
Never ever let yourself down
So you think you still got enough time
Turning swords into knives, playing with lives
The walls of Babylon all come tumbling down
Babylon's burning in my mind
Look sideways for the very first time
Struck by lightning for my crime
Acting strange and I don't know why
Babylon's burning in my mind
Looks sideways for the very first time
Struck by light, name for my crimes
Acting strange and I don't know why
Babylon kisses like an angel dressed in black
Bleeds its victims turning diamonds into dust
And the shards will cut your feet
And stab you in the back
