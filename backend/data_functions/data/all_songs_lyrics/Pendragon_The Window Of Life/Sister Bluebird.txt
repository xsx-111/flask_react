Sister Bluebird LyricsSister bluebird with eyes so full of hope
Of what the world might hold if you
Could always hope
Some rays of sunshine throw some light
Upon your floor
And you sit and you watch in fear
But you can't wait too long here
For the shadows of the night to fade
And the moon reflects in your eyes
With these hands I'll help you never
Give up the fight
With these hands I'll make your soul
Dance through the night
With these hands I'll help your troubles
Disappear
With these hands I'll carry you far away
From here
Sister bluebird with eyes so full of hope
Of what the world might hold if you
Could always cope
Some rays of sunshine throw some light
Upon your world
Some sense of danger lurks at the
Doorway of your mind
Of your mind
With these hands I'll help you never
Give up the fight
With these hands I'll make your soul
Dance through the night
With these hands I'll help your troubles
Disappear
With these hands I'll carry you far away
From here
