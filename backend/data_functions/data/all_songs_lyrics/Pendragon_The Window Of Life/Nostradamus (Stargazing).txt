Nostradamus (Stargazing) LyricsLooking out over golden fields
Wondering what the world will be tomorrow
Like sleepwalkers we go fumbling in the dark
Looking back over golden years
Wondering where the dream will be tomorrow
When spirits rise and we might march on
Hailey's comet came blazing across the sky
I heard of one who saw the whole thing in the night
To gaze upon a world that nobody could know
Just like a nightmare lying waiting to unfold
We live and learn
We learn to live
The power and glory
When you go stargazing
Looking round I heard a voice and someone say
Here tomorrow just as likely gone today
I heard a prophet watch reflections in a pool
But surrounded by intolerance and fools
We live and learn
We learn to live
The power and glory
When you go stargazing
Stargazing
Goundbreaking
Dream making
Breathtaking
