Breaking the Spell LyricsLike a shooting star that comes once in every lifetime
You came to me out of the blue
And blue is your colour
When the whole world falls into the sea
There's still you and me
Through the wind and the rain and the snow
I'd follow you up mountains, round the moon and the stars and back again
And I'll always be waiting for you
And when we cast that final spell
We'll meet in our dreams, a place that no one else can go
Don't ever let your love die
Don't ever go breaking the spell
Through the wind and the rain and the snow
I'd follow you up mountains, round the moon and the stars and back again
And I'll always be waiting for you
And when we cast that final spell
We'll meet in our dreams, a place that no one else can go
Don't ever let your love die
Don't ever go breaking the spellEmbed
