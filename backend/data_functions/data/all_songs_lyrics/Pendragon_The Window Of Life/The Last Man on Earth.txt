The Last Man on Earth LyricsPart 1: Skylight
She kneels before the grave, holding flowers frail
But still holding onto life
Placed in a vase, she has to let go
She knows how to let go
Skylight's now open to you, friend
Like a swallow you can swoop and dive
Skylight's now open to you, friend
So you can see through the window of life
So he traveled far away, passing places
Passing faces we don't know
With still so much to do
Why he left she'll never know
It seems it happened so long ago
Skylight's now open to you, friend
Like a swallow you can swoop and dive
Skylight's now open to you, friend
So you can see through the window of life
Skylight's now open to you, friend
Like a swallow you can swoop and dive
But I'm never gonna lose your precious heart
Now you can see through the window of life
In this dense forest of neverending darkness
I walk to the light, you walk out of sight
Then a hand reaches up to take me (to pastures new)
Is here to save me
Alone in this desert, is this God's land I've heard of
I look for a place, some kind of well-known face
To take me back home (to pastures new)
Am I the last man on Earth
(gotta let go the real and take the unknown)
Part 2: Paradise Road
Walking down Paradise Road
Is this a dream, a crazy dream edged with roses
Paradise Road, the land of milk and honey
Or the kiss of death
And people, people all around me
They're pointing to a doorway, telling me to look out
With a stroke, one blinding stroke, the scythe sweeps the land
The millions fall to their knees and finally set free
Might magic fireflies you glow so bright and will not fade away
Is that you, is that really you ?
On Paradise Road you're never alone
Welcome to the crazy world, welcome to the show that never ends
Join me here
It's taken many years to see your face again
I can hold you, feel you, the real you
I remember your hands, your eyes light shot diamonds
Skylight's now open to you, friend
Like a swallow you can swoop and dive
But I'm never gonna lose your precious heart
And the fight that we fight and we know we'll be right in the end
Skylight's now open to you, friend
Like a swallow you can swoop and dive
But I'm never gonna lose your precious heart
And the fight that we fight and we know we'll be right in the endEmbed
