Lowdown (Rare Japanese Stereo 45 Version) Lyrics
Oh my
Life has passed me by
The country I was brought up in
Fell apart and died
Oh no, ooh
Love's no longer there
Cold wind blew away the sun
That used to warm the air

Lowdown, ooh
Feelin' pretty bad
Feelin' like I lost the best friend
That I ever had
Lowdown
I got to find a way
Got to make the people see
The way I feel today


Yeah yeah
Oh no
Love's no longer there
Cold wind blew away the sun
That used to warm the air
Lowdown, ooh
Feelin' pretty bad
Feelin' like I lost the best friend
That I ever had
Lowdown, oh
I got to find a way
Got to make the people see
The way I feel todayEmbed
