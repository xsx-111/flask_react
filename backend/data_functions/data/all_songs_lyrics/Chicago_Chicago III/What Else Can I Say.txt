What Else Can I Say Lyrics
Where are you taking me?
I can't follow you there
What do you have in mind?
You know that I don't care (Ooh ooh)
Where do you think I'm at? (Ooh ooh)
I thought I made it clear (Ooh ooh)
Please don't follow me back down (Ooh ooh)
While I'm standing here

Early in the morning
Waiting for me to rise
The light of the new day dawning
Catches the sun in her eyes
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm standing here
And it's clear
I miss her
Tonight
She's so far away
What else can I say?
'Cause I know that she'll never let me down
And I know that she's gonna love me too (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm standing here
And it's clear
I need her
Tonight
She's so far away
What else can I say?
'Cause I know that she'll never let me down
And I know that she's gonna love me too (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)Embed
