Mother Lyrics
Driving down the concrete beams
Looking around and it now seems

Mama Earth is nowhere
Gone from your eye-eye-eyes
Hidden in the crust
Of man's scientific dreams
She is gone


Natural man took her natural face
Made it a strange and alien place

You can't bear to look up
She ain't there-ere-ere
Our Mother has been raped
And left to die in disgrace
She is goneEmbed
