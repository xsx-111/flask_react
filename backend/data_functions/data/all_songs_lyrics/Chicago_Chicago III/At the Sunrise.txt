At the Sunrise Lyrics
How could I be happy
Without her by my side?
Without her smiling face?
At the sunrise?
How could I keep living
With emptiness inside?
With no one there to touch?
At the sunrise? Oh

She gave meaning to my words, our funny words
(Meaning to my words)
And I know that I will never ever leave her, yeah
(Meaning to my words, hey hey hey hey)
She helped me find my way, I've been astray
(Helped me find my way)
That's the thing, you know she really really helped me
(Helped me find my way, hey hey hey hey)


The time I had to leave her
Leave her all alone
The way she looked at me
Made me cry
Oh oh oh
I know she understands me
She knows I'm feelin' bad
Until I'm back beside her
At the sunriseEmbed
