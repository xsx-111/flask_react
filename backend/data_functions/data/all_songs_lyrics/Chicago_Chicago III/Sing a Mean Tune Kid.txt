Sing a Mean Tune Kid Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Sing a mean tune, kid
Sock them in the gut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing a mean tune, kid, oh yeah
Sock them in the gut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you ever let your mama catch you crying, yeah
Hoo hoo yeah!

Play the bad song, kid
Everyone's the blues, yeah, yeah, yeah
Play the bad song, kid
Everyone's the blues, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the people never know you're only lying, yeah
Woo hoo! Hoo!
Yeah


Such a scary song, kid
Never heard before, yeah, yeah, yeah
What a scary song, kid
Never heard before, yeah, yeah, yeah
Soon those groupies will start rolling by your door, oh
Look out!
Oh yeah!

Burn the groove to death, kid
Nail 'em to the cross, yeah, yeah, yeah
Burn the groove to death, kid, oh yeah
Nail 'em to the cross, yeah, yeah, yeah
Until you're not a super pop star any more, yeah
Hoo hoo! Hoo! Oh yeah!
