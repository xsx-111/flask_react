Flight 602 Lyrics
You are, you are on a plane now
And on you way up north
Canada is so far from where you want to be
Be in California, with sunshine in your heart

But you know there are people that
You have to be
Have to be, have to be
What they say you are
What you always wanted to be
Wanted to be, wanted to be
Just a man fulfilled, but a little more free
A little more free

La da da da da (Ooh)
La da da da da (Ooh)
Oh oh oh oh (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

You are, you are in a hotel
And in your room alone
Lying there, but not knowing where
You're s'posed to be
Be thinking of B-3's and Leslies going 'round
And you know there are people that are going to be
Goin' to be, goin' to see
What they say you are
What you've always wanted to be
Wanted to be, I only wanted to be
Just a man fulfilled, but a little more free
A little more free
A little more free

Do do do do ooh oohEmbed
