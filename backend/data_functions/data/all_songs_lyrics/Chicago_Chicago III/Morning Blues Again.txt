Morning Blues Again Lyrics
(Oh no)

Oh oh no
So when you wake up this morning
And those blues are hangin' 'round, yeah
Just listen baby
And I'll tell you what to do
Just reach underneath your bed
And turn on your electric friend, yeah
Woah, and turn your thoughts to me
'Cause you know where I'll be
And then you can join me, yeah
In my hour in the shower
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Join me in my hour in the showerEmbed
