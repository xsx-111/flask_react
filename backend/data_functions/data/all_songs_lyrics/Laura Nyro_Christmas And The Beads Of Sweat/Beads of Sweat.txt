Beads of Sweat LyricsCold jade wind
Not an angel in the sky
Just cold jade restless wind
Somethin's comin' I know
To devastate
My soul
I pricked my fingers
On the thorns
And this rain is a rainin hard
This sky's gonna beckon mariah
To match my soul
Rain in the river
Rain in the river
Rain on the river banks
Down my neck
Beads of sweat
Rain on the highway
Running clear cross new york
A windsong through the barren trees
Wild lavender heather
By the railroad sways
Listen to the wailin'
Of the rain in the river
Rain on the river banks
Roll, roll
River rock his soul
She's callin you
Rainclouds
Rainclouds
Roll, roll
River rock his soul
She's callin you
Rainclouds
Rainclouds
Down his neck
Down his neck
Down his neck
Beads of
Beads of beads of
Beads of sweat
Five boys standing on the banks of the river
Waiting for the virgin snow
Searching for a miracle
A pearl in an oyster
And we all looked up to God
Although He is the color of the wind
Listen to the wailing
Of the rain in the river
Rain on the river banksEmbed
