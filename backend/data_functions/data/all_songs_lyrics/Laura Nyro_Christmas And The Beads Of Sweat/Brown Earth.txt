Brown Earth LyricsMorning, came to the windows of the street
Selling red watermelon, five cents a piece
Merry boat on the river, freedom
Fresh dreams to deliver, freedom
Over and over and over
I call out your name
God standing on the brown earth
Get up, mama hollers
Shooflies in the doorway
White doves gonna come today
White doves gonna come today
Oh, what a morning, I feel so good
Oh, what a morning of brotherhood
Hold me by the light
Kittens run the neighborhood through
Ragamuffin boys
All the world is new by the light of day
Give with your heart and love will come to you
Kids come in all shapes and colors
To the cool morning dew
Merry boat on the river, freedom
Fresh dreams to deliver, freedom
Over and over and over
And over and over and over
God standing on the brown earth
Lovelight in the morning
Shooflies in the doorway
White doves gonna come today
White doves gonna come today
White doves gonna come today
White doves gonna come today
White doves gonna come today
White doves gonna come todayEmbed
