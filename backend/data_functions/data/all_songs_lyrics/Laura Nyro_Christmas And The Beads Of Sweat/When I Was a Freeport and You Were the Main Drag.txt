When I Was a Freeport and You Were the Main Drag LyricsYou took my heart, misery. You taught me blues
Well I got a lot of patience baby, that's a lot of patience to lose. I'm crying
I'm mad at my country, now I've been treated bad
When I was a freeport and you were the main drag
Broken blues, I just don't know. Little bird flying by my window, take me when you go
I looking at these times and its bound to drive me mad
When I was a freeport and you were the main drag
What did I do? Everybody's putting me down, I keep running but the law kept coming around
So fare thee well, happiness, cause I've got blues
And I got a lot of patience baby, that's a lot of patience to lose
I'm a woman waiting for due time, I've been treated bad
When I was a freeport and you were the main dragEmbed
