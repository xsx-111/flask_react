Blackpatch LyricsInvitations to my party, send Jones an inviting card
He got his mean streak from the gutter, got his kindness from God
Now tugboats paint the river, carry coal to the city in white dock liners
Happiness on the uptown side at my party in the morning tide
Oo, la, la, la, blackpatch. Oo, la, la, la, blackpatch. Oo, la, la, la, blackpatch
In blackpatch, in blackpatch
Clothespins on wash ropes, window to window tie
Socks and bells and nightgowns, tassels in the morning, tassels in the morning sky
People are you ready (ready ready)â€¦
Womanchild on the side street, flashing in blackpatch
Lipstick on her reefer, waiting for a matchEmbed
