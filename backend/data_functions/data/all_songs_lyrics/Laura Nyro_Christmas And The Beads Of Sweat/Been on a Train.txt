Been on a Train LyricsBeen on a train, baby did you hear the whistle blow?
Been on a train north, baby did you hear the whistle blow?
I saw a man, take a needle full of hard drug and die slow
Been on a train and I'm never gonna be the same
There's a bright light in the north wind, gonna bring you home
Mister there's a bright light in the north wind, it's gonna bring you home
He said, "Sweet darling woman, leave me alone"
Been on a train and I'm never gonna be the same
You got more tracks on you baby than the tracks of this train
You got no guts, no gospel and you got no brain
He said, "I got just one thing, gonna soothe my pain"
No, no, damn you Mister and I dragged him out the door
No, no, damn you Mister and I dragged him out the door
He died in the morning sun and I ain't going north no more
I suspect there's a train going north in a month or two
I still hear his words he said, "There's nothing left to say or do"
But Mister you were wrong and I'm gonna sing my song for you
Been on a train and I'm never gonna be the sameEmbed
