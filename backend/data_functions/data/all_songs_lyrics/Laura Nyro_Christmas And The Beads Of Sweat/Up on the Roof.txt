Up on the Roof LyricsWhen this old world starts getting me down
And people are much too much for me to take (up on the roof)
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof, the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Up on the roof
When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (up on the roof)
I get away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise down in the street
At night the stars put on a show for free
Darling, you can share it all with me
Let's go
I keep a-telling you
Right smack dab in the middle of town
I've found a paradise that's trouble proof
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two
Up on the roof
Up on the roof (up on the roof)
Come on, baby, come on, baby
Up on the roof
Up on the roofEmbed
