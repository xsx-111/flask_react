Judgement Day LyricsWhat you gonna do on judgement day
Time runs out, baby, and you can't stay
Screamin' and cryin', you got to go
Hey St.Peter, won't you open the door
Yes, I'm coming, Yes, I'm coming
Yes, I'm coming, and it's like my time ain't long
When I die you can bury me dead
The tombstone-women set my face and head
Fold my arms across my chest
And tell my friends that I'm gone to rest
Yes, I'm coming, Yes, I'm coming
Yes, I'm coming, and I know my time ain't long
Now, when I'm dead, drafted in my grave
You gonna be sorry that you treat me like a slave
And there's no one to take my place
And you gonna cry your blues away
Yes, I'm coming, Yes, I'm coming
Yes, I'm coming, and it's like my time ain't longEmbed
