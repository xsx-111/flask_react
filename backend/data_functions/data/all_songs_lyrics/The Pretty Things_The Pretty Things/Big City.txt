Big City LyricsWell I used to be simple living countryboy
Didn't even know the time of day
Till I bought a ticket on a southboundtrain
Got my blues, I was going to stay
Big city, big city
Well you ain't quite big enough for me
I used to go out fishing on a sunny day
Catch myself a child or two
But there are bigger fish in a city pool
I should know cause I got myself you
Big city, big city
Yeah you ain't quite big enough for me
I soon forgot the faith my mother told me
I being good in everything
For there are things in the city design
Cause I know why women roll of the dieEmbed
