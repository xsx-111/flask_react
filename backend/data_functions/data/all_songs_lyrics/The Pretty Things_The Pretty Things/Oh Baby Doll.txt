Oh Baby Doll LyricsBaby Doll, when bells ring out the summer free
Oh Baby Doll, will it end for you and me ?
We'll sing our old Alma Mater and think of things that used to be
I remember it so well back when the weather was cool
We used to have so much fun when we were walking to school
If we stopped off to hear the latest songs they sing
And we just make it in before the bells would ring
Oh Baby Doll, when bells ring out the summer free
Oh Baby Doll, will it end for you and me ?
We'll sing our old Alma Mater and think of things that used to be
Oh Baby Doll, when bells ring out the summer free
Oh Baby Doll, will it end for you and me ?
We'll sing our old Alma Mater and think of things that used to be
When the teacher was gone that's when we'd have a ball
We use to dance and play all up and down the hall
We had a portable radio we was ballin' the jack
We'd be all back in order when the teacher got back
Oh Baby Doll, when bells ring out the summer free
Oh Baby Doll, will it end for you and me ?
We'll sing our old Alma Mater and think of things that used to beEmbed
