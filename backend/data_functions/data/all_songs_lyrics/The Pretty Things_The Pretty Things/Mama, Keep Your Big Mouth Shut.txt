Mama, Keep Your Big Mouth Shut LyricsHey Mama
Keep your big mouth shut
Hey Mama
Keep your big mouth shut
I'm in love with your little girl
And your little girl is in love with me
I'm happy most all the time and that's how we're gonna be
Hey mama
Keep your big mouth shut
Hey Mama
Keep your big mouth shut
I said hey Mama
Keep your big mouth shut
Yeah, shut
Come on and shutEmbed
