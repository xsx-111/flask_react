Rosalyn LyricsYeah Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Oh Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Every night and every day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin
Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn
Oh Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Yeah Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
When I'm holding you so tight
I don't wanna say goodnight
It's you I love now can't you see?
Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Oh Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Yeah Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Now I'm holding you so tight
I don't wanna say goodnight
It's you I love now can't you see?
Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn?
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn
Yeah RosalynEmbed
