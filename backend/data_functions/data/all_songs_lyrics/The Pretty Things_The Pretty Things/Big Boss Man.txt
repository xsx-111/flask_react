Big Boss Man LyricsBig boss man
Can you hear me when I call
Big boss man
Can you hear me when I call
Oh, you ain't so big
You're just tall, that's all
You got me working, boss man
Working 'round the clock
I want me a drink of water
You won't let me stop
You big boss man
Can you hear me when I call?
Oh, you ain't so big
You just tall, that's all
Gonna get myself a boss man
One gonna treat me right
Work me hard in the day time
But I'll sure rest easy at night
Big boss man
Can you hear me when I call?
Oh, you ain't so big
You just tall, that's allEmbed
