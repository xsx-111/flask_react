The Moon is Rising LyricsThe moon is risin'
This time goin' down
I feel kinda lonesome
My babe not around
You know that I need ya
Ya can't be found
Been lookin' for ya baby
All over town
Ya went away and left me
All alone
It wasn't you darlin'
But it was me, was wrong
Don't tell me where ya goin'
Tell me where ya been
Ain't had no lovin'
Since you, you done went and left meEmbed
