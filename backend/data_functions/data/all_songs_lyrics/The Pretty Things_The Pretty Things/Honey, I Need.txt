Honey, I Need Lyrics
If you don't want paying for
You'd better set me free
I just can't come to your feet
And live in misery
I tell you baby just the time
I don't know where you by
If you miss me then just before me
You give alibi

Oh honey
I need your love
All the time
All the time
And don't
Ever leave me
Or be unkind
Or be unkind
Wa ha bed

I don't you love the things to try
Kill my love so bad
But every time I've felt a chill I
Left them on the shelf
The things you try to do to me
I'm doing them myself
Every time I come on home
You deal with someone else
Oh honey
I need your loving
All the time
All the time
And don't
Ever leave me
Or be unkind
Or be unkind

Oh honey
Need your loving
All the time
All the time
And don't
Ever leave me
Or be unkind
Or be unkindEmbed
