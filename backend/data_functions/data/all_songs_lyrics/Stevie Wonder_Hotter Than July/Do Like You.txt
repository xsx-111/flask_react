Do Like You Lyrics
Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say
Before his father said, "Hey boy, get right back in that bed"

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, hey

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogie the best
But his mama said, N"o
Keita's much too young to go"
But his sister said, "Please let him go so the world can see"
When they saw him they said, "He must be crazy
Look at him, he ain't nothing but a baby"
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it, oh oh oh oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, hey, oh
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Please show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you, yeah
