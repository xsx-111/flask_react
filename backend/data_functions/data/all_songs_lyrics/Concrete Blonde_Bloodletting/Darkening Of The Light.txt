Darkening Of The Light LyricsLike a ghost (like a ghost)
Is the curtain (is the curtain)
In the white light of the morning
Dancing (dancing)
In the morning (in the morning)
Are you there? Are you there?
And a shadow (and a shadow)
Like a sadness (like a sadness)
Falling all across the garden
Dancing (dancing)
In the garden (in the garden)
Are you there? Are you there?
Shine on friend. Goodnight
Why, then, the darkening of the light?
And the leaves (and the leaves)
At my feet (at my feet)
Whisper sounds so familiar
Whisper (whisper)
So familiar (so familiar)
Are you there? Are you there?
Where the clouds (where the clouds)
Pull apart (pull apart)
Where the moon changes faces
In the quiet (in the quiet)
Secret places (secret places)
Are you there? Are you there?
Shine on friend. Goodnight
Why, then, the darkening of the light?
Shine on friend. Goodnight
Why, then, the darkening of the light?
The darkening of the light
The darkening of the light
The darkening of the lightEmbed
