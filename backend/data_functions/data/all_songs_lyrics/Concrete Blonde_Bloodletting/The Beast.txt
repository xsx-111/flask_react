The Beast LyricsThe prey of the beast
Screamed bloody murder
The line is so fine
Between hoping and hurting
Former believers they beg for release
As love looking down on them
Smiles and picks his teeth
Trapped in between Heaven and hell
He knows all the secrets
You don't want to tell
There's nowhere to run
And there's nowhere to hide
Love knows you all too well
He will find you
Love is the ghost
Haunting your head
Love is the killer
You thought was your friend
Love is the creature
Who lives in the dark
Sneak up and stick you
And painfully pick you apart
Love is a poet
Love sings the songs
Pointing his finger
You follow along
Voices are calling
The monster wants out of you
Paws you and claws you
You try not to fall
Love is the leech
Sucking you up
Love is a vampire
Drunk on your blood
Love is the beast
That will tear out your heart
Hungrily lick it
And painfully pick it apart
Love is the leech
Sucking you up
Love is a vampire
Drunk on your blood
Love is the beast
That will tear out your heart
Hungrily lick it
And painfully pick it apart
Love is the ghost
Haunting your head
Love is the killer
You thought was your friend
Love is the creature
Who lives in the dark
Sneak up and stick you
And painfully pick you apartEmbed
