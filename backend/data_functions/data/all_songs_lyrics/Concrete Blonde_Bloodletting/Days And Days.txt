Days And Days LyricsThe dirty leaves are sailing
On a hot wind ocean
And the summer comes and the summer goes
And always has and will
And something, somewhere that you said
Goes ricochet all through my head
And flashing like a neon sign, the time stood still
Hours of forever
Running all together
Like the crossroads of a minute
And you and me were in it
And I never saw it coming
Never saw it fade away
Today, today, today
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
And still the whining of the wheels
Is closest to the way I feel
And winter comes and winter goes
And always has and will
Another hour, another day
Another year you pissed away
Remember walking in the rain
I'm walking there still
That’s hours of forever
Running all together
Like the crossroads of a minute
And you and me were in it
And I never saw it coming
Never saw it fade away
Today, today, today
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
Like every heart to beat before
And every wave to kiss the shore
I'm not the first, I'm not the last
And soon to be your past
But every morning
When the light comes
Creeping in around my eyes
Another future falls behind
The one I had in mind
It’s hours of forever
Running all together
Like the crossroads of a minute
And you and me were in it
And I never saw it coming
Never saw it fade away
Today, today, today
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days
Days and days and days and days and days and days and days and daysEmbed
