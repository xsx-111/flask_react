Lullabye LyricsWhen the sky has fallen
Like a blanket on your shoulder
And the moon is like a mother
Looking over you forever
And the dawn is so familiar
You were meant to be together
Like a fog around a mountain
Forever
So softly
So sweetly
Surrounding you completely
Sing you a lullabye
Lullabye to you
Lullabye
Lullabye to you
When your breathing is the wind
And your crying is the rain
Well I know you will remember
Because the music is forever
The living of a lover
And the loving of another
Like a sister and a brother
Like a father and a mother
So softly
So sweetly
Surrounding you completely
Sing you a lullabye
Lullabye to you
Lullabye
Lullabye to you
When the sky has fallen
Like a blanket on your shoulder
And the moon is like a mother
Looking over you forever
And the dawn is so familiar
You were meant to be together
Like a fog around a mountain
Forever and ever
So softly
So close to me
You're surrounding me so beautifully
Lullabye
Lullabye to you
Lullabye
Lullabye to you
Lullabye
Lullabye to you
Lullabye
Lullabye to youEmbed
