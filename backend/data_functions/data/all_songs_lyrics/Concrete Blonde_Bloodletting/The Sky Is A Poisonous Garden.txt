The Sky Is A Poisonous Garden LyricsThe stars above shine down below
The fever you hold on this night, deathly cold
He can feel from his side of the door
He could feel Eleanor
He said, sun don't rise
He said, sun don't shine
He said, don't bring tomorrow
To justify tonight
The moon is full and the stars are bright
And the sky is a poisonous garden tonight
Sip your tequila, give me some time
To unlearn all I've learned, for the spring to unwind
And then came his sweet gentle mouth
I began to move mine
They knew with the dawn, they knew with the day
They knew what they had would be young naked prey
And attacked from all sides by a world
Full of poison and hate
Out of this world
Out of this time
Out of control
They were out of their minds
The moon is full and the stars are bright
And the sky is a poisonous garden tonight
Eleanor trembles, Eleanor moans
Somehow, this body is someone she always has known
She cries tears on his chest
Oh so silent and slow
She said please don't go
(Please don't go)
He said please don't go
(Please don't go)
And she sighed and she died in his arms
And he cried, "Nevermore"
The moon is full and the stars are bright
And the sky is a poisonous garden tonight
The sky is a poisonous garden tonight
The sky is a poisonous garden tonight
The sky is a poisonous garden tonightEmbed
