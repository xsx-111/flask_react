Tomorrow, Wendy (Live) LyricsIt is complete now the two ends of time are neatly tied
A one-way street, she's walking to end of the line
And there she meets the faces she keeps in her heart and mind
They say, "Goodbye"
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Underneath the chilly gray November sky
We can make believe that Kennedy is still alive and
Were shooting for the moon and smiling Jackie's driving by
They say, "Good try"
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
I told the priest, don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked the first time he came down here slumming
He had the balls to come, the gall to die and then forgive us
No, I don't wonder why, I wonder what he thought it would get us
Hey, hey, good bye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Only God says jump, so I set the time
'Cause if he ever saw her, it was through these eyes of mine
And if he ever suffered it was me who did his crying
Hey hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to dieEmbed
