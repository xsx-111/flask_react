Tomorrow Wendy LyricsIt is complete, now
Two ends of time are neatly tied
A one-way street
She's walking to end of the line
And there she meets
The faces she keeps in her heart and mind
They say, "Goodbye"
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Underneath the chilly gray November sky
We can make believe that Kennedy is still alive
And we're shooting for the moon
And smiling Jack is driving by
And they say, "Good try"
Tomorrow, Wendy you're going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
I told the priest
Don't count on any second coming
God got his ass kicked
The first time he came down here slumming
He had the balls to come
The gall to die and then forgive us
No, I don't wonder why
I wonder what he thought it would get us
Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Hey, hey, good bye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Only God says, "Jump"
So I set the time
Cause if he ever saw it
It was through these eyes of mine
And if he ever suffered
It was me who did his crying
Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
(Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die)
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
(Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die)
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Hey, hey, goodbye
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to die
Tomorrow, Wendy is going to dieEmbed
