Bloodletting (The Vampire Song) LyricsThere's a crack in the mirror
And a bloodstain on the bed
There's a crack in the mirror
And a bloodstain on the bed
Oh, you were a vampire
And baby, I'm the walking dead
Oh, you were a vampire
And baby, I'm the walking dead
I got the ways and means
To New Orleans
I'm going down by the river
Where it's warm and green
I'm gonna have a drink and walk around
I got a lot to think about
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
There's a rocking chair by the window
Down the hall
I hear something there in the shadow
Down the hall
Oh, you were a vampire
And now I am nothing at all
Oh, you were a vampire
And now I am nothing at all
I got the ways and means
To New Orleans
I'm going down by the river
Where it's warm and green
I'm gonna have a drink and walk around
I got a lot to think about
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
They used to dance in the garden
In the middle of the night
Dancing out in the garden
In the middle of the night
Oh, you were a vampire
And I may never see the light
Oh, you were a vampire
And I may never see the light
I got the ways and means
To New Orleans
I'm going down by the river
Where it's warm and green
I'm gonna have a drink and walk around
I got a lot to think about
I got the ways and means
To New Orleans
I'm going down by the river
Where it's warm and green
I'm gonna have a drink and walk around
I got a lot to think about
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah1Embed
