Little Wing LyricsWell she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running around
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams and fairy tales
That's all she ever thought about
Running with the wind
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles, you know she sets me free
It's alright you know it's alright
Take anything you want from me, anything
When I'm sad, you come to me
With a thousand smiles you know you set me free
It's alright you know it's alright
Take anything you want from me, anything
Fly on little wing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing2Embed
