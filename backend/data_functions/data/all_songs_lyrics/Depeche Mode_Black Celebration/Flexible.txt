Flexible Lyrics
Fame can have strange effects
Money can have strange effects

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals

Drink can alter you
Girls can have strange effects, too

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals


We all know boats don't last
We all know cars are fast

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals

I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals
I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in
Open the window and out go ideals
I ask myself, "Is it a sin?"
To be flexible when the boat comes in1Embed
