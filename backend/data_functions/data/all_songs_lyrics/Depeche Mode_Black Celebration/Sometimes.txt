Sometimes Lyrics
(Sometimes)

Sometimes, only sometimes
I question everything
And I'm the first to admit
If you catch me in a mood like this
I can be tiring, even embarrassing
But you must feel the same
When you look around
You can't tell me honestly
You're happy with what you see
Oh sometimes, only sometimes
You must be
You must be
As embarrassing as me
Ooh, sometimes1Embed
