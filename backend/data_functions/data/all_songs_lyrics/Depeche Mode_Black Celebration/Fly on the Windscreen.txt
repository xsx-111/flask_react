Fly on the Windscreen Lyrics
Death is everywhere
There are flies on the windscreen for a start
Reminding us
We could be torn apart tonight

Death is everywhere
There are lambs for the slaughter waiting to die
And I can sense
The hours slipping by tonight

Come here, kiss me now
Come here, kiss me now

Death is everywhere
The more I look, the more I see
The more I feel
A sense of urgency tonight

Come here, kiss me now
(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Come here, kiss me now
(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
There are flies on the windscreen
There are lambs for the slaughter
There are flies on the windscreen

Come here, kiss me now
(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Come here, kiss me now
(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)

(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)

Come here, kiss me now
(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Come here, kiss me now
(Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)1Embed
