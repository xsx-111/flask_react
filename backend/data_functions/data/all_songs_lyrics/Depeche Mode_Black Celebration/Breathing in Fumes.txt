Nothing on this

(You're breathing in fumes I taste when we kiss)


Let me see you stripped down to the
(I taste when we kiss, I taste when we kiss)
Let me see you stripped down to the
(I taste when we kiss, I taste when we kiss)
Let me see you stripped down to the
(Come back to the land, come back to the land)
Let me see you stripped down to the bone

Breathing in fumes, I'm breathing in fumes
(Breathing in fumes, you're breathing in fumes)1Embed
