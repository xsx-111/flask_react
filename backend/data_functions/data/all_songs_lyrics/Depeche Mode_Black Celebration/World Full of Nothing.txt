World Full of Nothing Lyrics
Close, naked, skin on skin
Tears are falling
Tears of joy
Her first boy
His first girl
Makes a change

In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love, it means something

She's lonely
And he says it's for her only
That he lusts
She doesn't trust him
Nothing is true
But he will do

In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love, it means something

It's easy to slip away and believe it all
It's easy to slip away and believe it all
It's easy to slip away and believe it all
It's easy to slip away and believe it all
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something
Though it's not love, it means something2Embed
