Woman Oh Woman Lyrics
Search through the years
And you wipe away the tears
To find a woman, not a girl
Just that feeling, like the beginning of the world
Beginning of the world

And your love flows like a river
Until it reaches down to the sea
And it's then, you start to thinking
Will the water, will the water cover me?

Woman, oh woman
Don't bury me alive
Just make me feel
I've the right to survive
Woman, oh woman
I hope that you can see
This is nothing like
Our love was meant to be
Love was meant to be

You search through the years
And you wipe away the tears
To find a woman, not a girl
But a feeling, like the beginning of the world
Woman, oh woman
Don't bury me alive
Just make me feel
I've the right to survive
Woman, oh woman
I hope that you can see
This is nothing like
Our love was meant to be

Woman, oh woman
Woman, oh woman
Woman, oh woman
Woman, oh woman
Woman, oh woman
Oh woman1Embed
