Headknocker Lyrics
He drives a '57 coupe
Walks with a stoop
Swears James Dean isn't dead
He's a dedicated rocker
A real headknocker
Don't look at his lady again
Because if he catches you messin'
He's going to teach you a lesson
Don't make me say it again
Headknocker, headknocker
You're coming on strong, a real showstopper
Headknocker
He might like to fight, oh but boy does he love to play
Ooh, headknocker, headknocker
Ooh, headknocker
He's got an old fender strat
Plays behind his back
While he sings out Louie, Louie
He's a backseat mauler
A barroom brawler
I think he's going to blacken your eye
If that don't teach you a lesson
Might show you his Smith & Wesson
Don't let me say it again1Embed
