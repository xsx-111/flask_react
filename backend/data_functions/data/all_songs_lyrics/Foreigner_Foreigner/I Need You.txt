I Need You Lyrics
Selling your soul isn't the right way of giving
Oh with you I could change
This misguided goal I've been living
Anything, anything, you might need or desire
Just call on me, because my heart's on fire

And I need you
Do you need me too?
Yes I need you, yes I need you

Many is the time I've cursed the Lord's creations
Ah but you touched my hand
I loved this new sensation
It was very strange, what a change
Of you I did not tire
So call on me, my heart's on fire

And I need you
Do you need me too?
Yes I need you, yes I need you

Yes I need you
Oh I need you
And I need you
Say you need me too
Yes I need you
Oh I need
Say you need me too
Yes I need you
And I need you
Oh I need
Yes I need you
Oh I need
Say you need me too
Say, say baby
Say you need me too
Yes I need you
Oh I need you too
And I need youEmbed
