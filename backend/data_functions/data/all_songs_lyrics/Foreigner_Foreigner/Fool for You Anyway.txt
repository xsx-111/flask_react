Fool for You Anyway Lyrics
Well I miss you honey
A little more every day
And I know if I kissed you
You'd be coming back home to stay
Because I know I was wrong
But how long do I have to pay?
You know you belong here beside me
I'm a fool for you anyway
Because I'm a fool for you anyway
Well I cried for you so long
My river of tears ran dry
And I tried to be so strong
But grew weaker as time went by

You know your love left a mark on me
I don't think it will fade away

I'll sit here and wait until you come home
Because I'm a fool for you anyway
I'm a fool for you anyway
Fool for you anyway


Fool for you anyway
Fool for you anyway
Because I'm a fool for you anyway
A fool for you anyway
Fool for you anyway
I'm a fool for you anywayEmbed
