Take Me to Your Leader (Stereo Demo) LyricsTake me...
To your leader...
Give me a chance...
To state my case...
You can make me do what you want to (yeah)
Tell her I'll give her the world just to look at her face
Can't you see how much I need her and there ain't no disgrace (no disgrace)
Fill me...
With your potions...
Use me, abuse me but don't send me away
If you will play with...
My emotions
I'll pray with my heart baby I'll get to see her someday
Here I stand...
With no defenses
And there ain't no disgrace (no disgrace)
Take me...
To your leader...
There ain't no reason on earth I asked to be your slave
Can't you see how much I need her? There never ain't no disgrace. Ain't no disgrace
Take me... to your leader
I won't need her place... I won't need her place... I won't need her place... I won't need her place...Embed
