Morningrise LyricsI cross the field and watch the sun go down
A million people clap, it makes me frown
Looking 'round, I see you slip away
You seem more beautiful than yesterday
The devil takes my mind but I don't care
He gives me all his love, he gives me air
Don't pay it any mind
I'm losing all the timeEmbed
