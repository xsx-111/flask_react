Avalyn I LyricsSilence grows
My feelings flow
I’m dreaming now
Of all the things I know
I am here
I think of you
My feelings flow around
All the things I know
I am here
Rivers flow
In my mind
I’m swirling now
(I know)
I’m not alone
The city flows
My climax grows
I’m drifting now
I’m all the girl I know
I die
I’m here on my own
I’m here on my own
