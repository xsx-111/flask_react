Slowdive Lyrics
I hear your voice, but it can't bring me back
I'm chasing all the things I ever thought I had
I'm pushing down, I'm diving deep, yeah, slowdive to my dream
I'm feeling good, yeah, I'm feeling free

Slowdive
You can't touch me now
Slowdive
You can't touch me now

I close my eyes and let the ground slip from my mind
I'm falling now, I'm diving now, I'm gliding in the sky
Graceful birds will whisper as I sadly pass them by
He's feeling good, yeah, he's feeling free

Slowdive
You can't touch me now
Slowdive
You can't touch me now

(Slowdive)
(You can't touch me now)
(Slowdive)
(You can't touch me now)
(Slowdive)
(You can't touch me now)
(Slowdive)
(You can't touch me now)2Embed
