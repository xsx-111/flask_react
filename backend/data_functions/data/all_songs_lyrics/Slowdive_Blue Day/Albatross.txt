Albatross LyricsLooks like rain again
Can't remember
Can't remember
What I'm missing
I'm feeling now
I'm missing
Wishing
For the sun
Don't turn away
You're feeling
Feeling
Something new
Feels like yesterday
I can't believe
Can't believe
It's true
Looks like rain again
Can't remember
Can't remember
What I'm missing
I'm feeling now
That I'm wishing
Wishing
For the sunEmbed
