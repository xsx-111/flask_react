Matter vs. Space Lyrics
Nose down, what you gonna do when
Parties fade and your makeup starts to smear?
Only scene is a grand entrance
Silver screen is another brand new year

In a sea of talcum powder
Kids swim and they lose their color
Clock strikes twelve
Say, don't ya feel so well yet?

As the confetti falls (confetti falls)
Timed with your tears (slow down)
No one wants to hear (wants to hear)
About your hardwood floors

In stalls of the magic markers
Boys and girls come and go like coats of paint
All you've got is a pretty name
You shouldn't be killed off in the very first scene

On the porch with the smokers
Party talk gets much older
Clock strikes twelve
Say, don't ya feel so well yet?
As the confetti falls (confetti falls)
Timed with your tears (slow down)
No one wants to hear (wants to hear)
About your hardwood floorsEmbed
