Sunday Under Glass Lyrics
The scenery rides by just like floats lost in a parade
Where the palms and tumbleweeds sail
Right past the homes they stretch and they fade
Rolling like movie credits far beneath the clear skies

How wary does the West carry?
So many sights, yeah, let's see the sights
Slow prayers with no answers
Must go somewhere, fall away
And the Wild West is a slow pan
And the sunshine is fake
And the ocean is just painted
On a backdrop downtown

The miniature sprawls blur from the set lights and the heat
Where the summer's path with charades
Right where the sidewalks crack and they meet
Just like a sad, sad actress right before her last scene

How wary does the West carry?
So many sights, yeah, let's see the sights
Slow prayers with no answers
Must go somewhere, fall away
And the Wild West is a slow pan
And the sunshine is fake
And the ocean is just painted
On a backdrop somewhere downtownEmbed
