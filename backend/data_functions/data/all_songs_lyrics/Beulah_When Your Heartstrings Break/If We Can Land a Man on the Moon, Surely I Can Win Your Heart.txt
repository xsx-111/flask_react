If We Can Land a Man on the Moon, Surely I Can Win Your Heart Lyrics
I'll fight if you want me to fight
I'll laugh if you want me to laugh
And cancel out the sun
I will, I will, you know I surely will
'Cause all you need is a pretty song

And if you want to sing, tell me what you want to sing
And I'll play, yeah, I'll play
Speed it up or slow it down, if you want we'll change our sound
We'll play, yeah, we'll play
Anything that you want
All we want from you is a word or two

And even though we don't show
We cast our nets like missionaries
If we sell out, oh well
Our only fan will be changing costumes
And you'll see it's much the same
So sing our songs
And for applause, we'll get up, get up

If you want to sing, tell me what you want to sing
And I'll play, yeah, I'll play
Speed it up or slow it down, if you want we'll change our sound
We'll play, yeah, we'll play
Anything that you want
All we want from you is a word or two

I've been worth a ton
And I've been worth, I don't need you now
The words you write make my heart race and start
Then just quit
Yeah, we'll do anything as you want (yeah, yeah yeah, ooh)
So please don't go and break our hearts (yeah yeah, ooh)
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, ah-ah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, ah-ah
I'll fight, if you want me to fightEmbed
