Warmer Lyrics
Okay, fine
When she starts to sway, the floor is blacker than the sea
She says, "Oh well, oh well, you'll do just fine
Just spin and drift and try to stay in time with me
Pretend there's casters rolling on your feet"
Ah, ah, ah

Boys are staring and they wait for dances
In lines as long as country miles
Good girls' voices drift like anesthesia
And the smiles can last for days and

On and on
When we go to sleep and wake to another brand new day
She says, "Oh well, oh well, you'll do just fine
Just dream and wish and try to close your eyes, think of me
Pretend that we're both older than we seem"
Ah, ah, ah

Boys are staring and they wait for dances
In lines as long as country miles
Good girls' voices drift like anesthesia
And the smiles can last for days and
The lost cause kids are okay
No, they wouldn't be long
Stay, keep sweet and quite insane
So, so insaneEmbed
