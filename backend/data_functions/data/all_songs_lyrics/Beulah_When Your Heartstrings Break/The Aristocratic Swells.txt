The Aristocratic Swells Lyrics
And hey "Mr. For Real," sir
We're in it for fun
And have you heard the news, sir?
We're in it for free

And with a kiss, yeah, you'd be so sure
We'll put a laughtrack on for you, dear
A million and one excuses
The homes are full of spies

And we're all over waiting
And we're in it for fame
And hey, slow coronation
Repeat the same themes

Devil takes a bite out of this here land
Every hour on the hour
The good kind of suicide, dear
The adjectives they

Pile next to pageants
For those who never place
For those who come in second
A mistress all your life
Our lullabies will never move you to tears
The jokes that bounce right off you
All next to pageants
For those who never place
For those who come in second
A mistress all your life
Our lullabies will never move you to tears
The jokes that bounce right off you
Like dirty words
And anecdotes that we share
Been told before
Our destination's still unknownEmbed
