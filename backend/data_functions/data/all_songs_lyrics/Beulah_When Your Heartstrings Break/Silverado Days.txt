Silverado Days Lyrics
Me and I, yeah, we're going your way
Sound the trumpets and open the gates
No angels there to greet me
They can't breathe, and they won't see me

And I'll do, I'll do
But a little won't help you now
I'll do

I was a kid and you were my hero
Bathed in rhinestones and brand new chinos
I was young, drunk, and easy
We would duel, but our holsters were empty

And I'll do, I'll do
But a little won't help you now
I'll do

Along the wayside gonna change our names
They're easily replaced
It comes on heavy like a symphony
At the cinema
'Cause even though we don't mean what we say
We throw our words like bombs and hand grenades

Arms are waiting like a monument
That comes and goes in time
Like highway signs we post along the way
We'll wonder where they've gone

'Cause even though we don't mean what we say
We throw our words like bombs and hand grenades1Embed
