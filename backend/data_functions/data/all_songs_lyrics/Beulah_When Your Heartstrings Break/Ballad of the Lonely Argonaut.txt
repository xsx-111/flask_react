Ballad of the Lonely Argonaut Lyrics
Half by sea
Through the isthmus or the cape they're rounding
Over land
I follow the shallow ribbon of the Platte
An El Dorado waits like an avalanche
And the boys are off to see the elephant

How does it feel
To roam this land like Hart and Twain did?
How, how, how does it feel?
A thousand miles closer to Hell

And over land
They passed Scottsbluff and crossed the basin
Half by sea
They follow the coast and through the gate where

Gold is coated with gold on the languid hills
Where they wait for hours and hours
Cool gray ladies from Shirley's learn us cheer
And they sat for hours and hours
The luck of the roaring camp and how they taught
The outcasts of the flats in their poker face
Cannot hide the fever of fhe children's crusade
Slow, slower than slow, days spill into one another

Gold is coated with gold on the languid hills
Where they wait for hours and hours
Cool gray ladies from Shirley's learn us cheer
And they sat for hours and hoursEmbed
