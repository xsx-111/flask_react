Calm Go the Wild Seas Lyrics
Everything's alright
It takes a  strength beyond strength to smile
I'm missing you like hurricanes
I give them names but their waves keep rolling

On and on and on and on
My sails are tattered, they're worn bone-thin

I will be the king
All I need is the comfort of a stage
Smile and take a drag
Laugh and say we're only having fun

I watch the winter pass
From under the umbrella you left
The winds are dying a slow death
Cut my heart out but it's still beating

On and on and on and on
My sails are tattered, they're worn bone-thin
You will be the queen
You will be guilded by the sword
My prints are unique
You've been touched time and time againEmbed
