Lonesome Roads LyricsWhere did I go wrong
You know I've never had a clue
I must have just been born no good
'Cause bad's the best that I can do
Was it just my fate in life
To end up here this way
Lost and all alone
One more black lamb
That's gone astray
Lonesome roads are the only kind I ever travel
Empty rooms the only place I ever stay
I'm just a face out in the crowd that looks like trouble
Poor ol' worthless me's the only friend I ever made
(x2)
Poor ol' worthless me's the only friend I ever madeEmbed
