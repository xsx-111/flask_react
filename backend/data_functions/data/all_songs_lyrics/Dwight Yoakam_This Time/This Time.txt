This Time LyricsThis time
Is the last time
That'll I'll ever call her name
This time
Is the last time
That'll I'll ever play her game
And this time
Is the last time
That I'll endure this pain
'Cause this time
Is the last time
She'll ever hurt me again
I tell myself each morning
That we're through
But every night I see
That it's not true
I run out
And track her down
Just so I can hang around
And cry
(Chorus)
Come on heart let's make believe we're fine
We'll both agree the pain's just in our mind
I'll close my eyes and try not to hear
The things I'll say when she appears
To haunt me
(Chorus)
Yeah, this time
Is the last time
That she'll ever hurt me againEmbed
