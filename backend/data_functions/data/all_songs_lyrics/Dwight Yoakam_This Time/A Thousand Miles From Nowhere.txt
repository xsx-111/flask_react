A Thousand Miles From Nowhere Lyrics
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel, cruel things that you said

I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
Oh, I...
I've got bruises on my memory
I've got tear stains on my hands
And in the mirror, there's a vision
Of what used to be a man

I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

Oh, I...
I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
I'm a thousand miles from nowhereEmbed
