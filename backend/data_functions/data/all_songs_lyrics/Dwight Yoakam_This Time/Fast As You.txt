Fast As You Lyrics
Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's tough
You'll be the one who's got it rough
It won't be long and
Maybe I'll be real strong

Maybe I'll do things right
Maybe I'll start tonight
You'll learn to cry like me
Baby let's just wait and see
Maybe I'll start tonight
And do things right

You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Uhhh

You'll control me
And oh so boldly
Rule me 'til I'm free
'Til the pain that shakes me
Finally makes me
Get up off of my knees
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts too
But I think that you'll slow down
When your turn to hurt comes around
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts
And be as fast as you
Ah, sookie

Maybe someday I'll be strong
Maybe it won't be long
I'll be the one who's strong
You'll be the one gonna cry
You're gonna cry like me
We'll just, uh, wait and see
Maybe I'll be as fast as you
Maybe I'll break hearts tooEmbed
