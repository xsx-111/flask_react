King Of Fools LyricsAs you look into my eyes
And tell those empty lies
I'll pretend they're true
'Cause that's a'what I do
As you sit and hold my hand
And smile at other men
I'll pretend I'm blind
'Cause I'm just that kind
I'm the king of fools
And I'll always reign
Over loneliness and pain
The king of fools
Wears his crown
Wherever misery
Can be found
(Chorus)
As you walk away with him
And I lose in love again
I'll pretend to see
That you're still with me
But I'll be there all alone
Like a king upon a throne
Because I'm the king of fools
Yes, I'm the king of foolsEmbed
