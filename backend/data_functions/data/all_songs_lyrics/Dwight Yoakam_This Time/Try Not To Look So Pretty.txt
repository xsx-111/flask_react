Try Not To Look So Pretty LyricsTry not to look so pretty
Next time that we meet
Please don't look so pretty
And I won't act so weak
Please don't look so pretty
You're lovely but it's just cruel
Try not to look so pretty
And I'll try not to be your fool
You walk in and steal my mind
Oh, but who gave you the right
To treat me like some useless thought
You throw away each night
(Chorus)
You make it hard on me
Oh, but I'll try to pretend
That you're just a lovesick dream
That always has to end
(Chorus)
Try not to look so pretty
And I'll try not to be your foolEmbed
