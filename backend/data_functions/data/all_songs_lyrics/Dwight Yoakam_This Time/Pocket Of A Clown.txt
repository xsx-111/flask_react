Pocket Of A Clown LyricsInside the pocket of a clown
Is a sad place to hang around
Just watching smiles turn into frowns
Inside the pocket of a clown
Inside the heartache of a fool
You'll learn things they don't teach in school
And lessons there can be real cruel
Inside the heartache of a fool
Hollow lies, make a thin disguise
As little drops of truth fall from your eyes
Hollow lies, make a thin disguise
As little drops of truth fall from your eyes
Inside a memory from the past
Lives every love that didn't last
Sweet dreams can start to fade real fast
Inside a memory from the past
It's a real sad place to hang around
Inside the pocket of a clownEmbed
