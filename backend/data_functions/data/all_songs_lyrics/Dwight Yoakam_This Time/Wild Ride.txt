Wild Ride LyricsI walked in
There sat Slim
Cleaning up his memory with some Sapphire Gin
Mr. Paine grabbed my arm
Pulled me aside
And said "Kid are you ready for the wild ride?"
I looked up
There she stood
I said, "If you didn't look so great
I'd say you look good"
She took her hand
Ran it up my thigh
And said "Cowboy you ready for the wild ride?"
Come on now Junior take the wild ride
See can you make it on the wild ride
Don't try no shakin' on the wild ride
'Cause things start breakin' on the wild ride
Layin' on the highway
I saw my mind
In tiny little pieces thrown from side to side
My heart was shattered along with my pride
Guess you can't keep 'em on the wild ride
(Chorus)
I was crawlin' 'cross the floor
I was tryin' to leave
When I felt something tuggin' what was left of my sleeve
I heard a little voice with a gold-plated vibe
Say I bought a ticket for the wild ride
Come on now junior take the wild ride
See can we make it on the wild ride
Let's try to shake it on the wild ride
We might just break it on the wild ride
(Chorus 2)
Come on come on
Take me on the wild ride
See can you make me on the wild ride
Come on an' shake me on the wild ride
You might just break me on the wild rideEmbed
