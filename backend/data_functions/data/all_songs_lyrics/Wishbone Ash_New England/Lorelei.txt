Lorelei LyricsYou shone out of the darkness
The light in your eyes
I could not help myself
I did not want to try
Like the singing of the Lorelei
Your voice rang clear and true
Mystery and danger was all I got from you
Oh, you mesmerized me, oh, you tantalized
Like the singing of the Lorelei
And you knew everything
There was to know about me
Like the singing of the Lorelei
Your voice rang clear and true
Mystery and danger was all I got from you
Oh, you mesmerized, oh, you tantalized
Like the voice of the LoreleiEmbed
