Roll Over Beethoven Lyrics
Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local DJ
Well, it's a jumpin' little record I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, gotta hear it again today

You know, my temperature's risin', need a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, my heart's beatin' a rhythm, shakin' out rhythm and blues
Roll over Beethoven, rockin' in two by two

Well, if you feel and like it
Go get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up now
Go for cover and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey, diddle diddle, gonna play my fiddle
I ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

Well, she wiggles like a glow-worm, she dances like a spinnin' top
Yeah, she got a crazy partner, you should have seen her reel and rock
Long as she got a dime, the music will never stop
Well, if you feel and like it
Go get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up now
Go for cover and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?

Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, dig these rhythm and blues?
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over BeethovenEmbed
