Kuiama Lyrics
My, my Kuiama, she came in the morning
She smiled but the tears on her little face
Showed the pain that had been in that far-off place
So sad, treated so bad

My, my Kuiama, don't break your heart tryin'
To say how your ma and your pa passed away
And they left you to wander the ruin and decay
Real mean, that bullet machine

See here Kuiama, now ten thousand miles
Is a long, long way and you're here today
And you won't go back so you might say
"Hello, how do you do?"

Kuia, stop your cryin', there's no bombs a-fallin'
No horsemen in the night a-ridin'
Through your dreams and tearing at your life
Baby, goodnight

No more silver rain will hit your ground
And no more guns will sound
No more life be drowned
No more trenches where the soldiers lie
And no more people die
Beneath that big black sky
Wake up, Kuiama, I got somethin' to tell you
It's just that I mean, well, that is to say
That I'm trying to explain but I'll start again
For you, I must be true

Kuia, in this country, they got rules with no reason
They teach you to kill and they send you away
With your gun in your hand, you pick up your pay
So cool, that no mercy tool


Kuia, please believe me, I just couldn't help myself
I wanted to run but they gave me a gun
And they told me the duty I owed to my fatherland
I made my stand

Kuia, I just shot them, I just blew their heads open
And I heard them scream in their agony
Kuiama, she waits there for me
True blue, you saw it throughEmbed
