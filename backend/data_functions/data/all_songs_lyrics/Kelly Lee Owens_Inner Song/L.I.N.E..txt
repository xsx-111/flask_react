L.I.N.E. Lyrics
Don't speak up too much
Stay in line
Keepin' it small, frail
I know this isn't who I am
But love can be blind
Death begins with compromise

In love with the potential of what this could be
You'd think I'd learn by now that this shit's not easy
Lined it all up without no possibility
That's what you get for wearing your heart on your sleeve

Love is not enough to stay
I'd rather be on my own
Gonna trust my speed and show him
Love is not enough alone
Alone

Less of who I am for you
In case I offend you
With something like the truth
I know this isn't what I planned
But love is so blind
Then you start with compromise
In love with the potential of what this could be
You'd think I'd learn by now that this shit's not easy
Lined it all up without no possibility
That's what you get for wearing your heart on your sleeve

Love is not enough to stay
I'd rather be on my own
Gonna trust my speed and show him
Love is not enough alone
