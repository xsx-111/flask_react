Night Lyrics
Feel what's right only in the night
Feel what's right only in the night
See what's right only in the night
Feel what's right only in the night
Feel what's right only in the night
See what's right only in the night
Feel what's right only in the night

It feels so good to be alone
It feels so good to be alone
It feels so good to be alone
It feels so good to be alone
It feels so good to be alone
It feels so good to be alone
It feels so good to be alone
It feels so good to be alone

With you
With you
With you
With you
With you
With you
Yeah, with you
See what's right only in the night
Feel what's right only in the nightEmbed
