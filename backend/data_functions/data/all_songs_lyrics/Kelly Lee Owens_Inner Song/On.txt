On Lyrics
Head and heart in unison
We can't go forward
Can't go forward
Can only love as deeply as you see yourself
And you don't see me
You don't see me

And so, let go of the hope
That it could, that it could be
That it could, that it could be
That it could

So, this is how it must go
And now I am moving on
Now I am moving on
So, this is how it must go
And now I am moving on
Now I am moving on

Right or wrong, no difference
We don't move forward
We don't move forward
Can only love as deeply as you see yourself
And you don't see me
No, you don't see me
And so, let go of the hope
That it could, that it could be
That it could, that it could be
That it could

So, this is how it must go
And now I am moving on
Now I am moving on
So, this is how it must go
And now I am moving on
Now I am moving on
So, this is how it must go
And now I am moving on
Now I am moving on

On, on
On, onEmbed
