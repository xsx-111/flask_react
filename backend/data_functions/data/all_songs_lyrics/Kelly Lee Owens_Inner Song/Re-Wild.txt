Re-Wild Lyrics
Felt the power in me
Things are different in me
Watch your eyes open me
Watch your eyes open you

Taking release, taking release
Taking release, taking release

(Ah) Re-wild, re-wild
(Ah) Re-wild, re-wild, re-wild
(Ah) Re-wild, re-wild
(Ah) Re-wild, re-wild

See the freedom in me
Allow the freedom in you
Free yourself with the truth
That's already in you

Facing release, facing release
Facing release, facing release
(Ah) Re-wild, re-wild
(Ah) Re-wild, re-wild, re-wild
(Ah) Re-wild, re-wild
(Ah) Re-wild, re-wildEmbed
