Wake-Up Lyrics
Losing our minds for the short term gain
Short term everything
No king, no king
Swipe to the next frame
Swipe to the next phase
Another new face

Never pausing to take it in
Always avoiding your sense of dread

Wake up
Repeat again, again, again
Wake up
Repeat again

Losing your mind for the short term fame
Short term every day
Okay, okay
Swipe to the next game
Swipe to your new fate
Another new face
Never pausing to take it in
Always avoiding your sense of dread

Wake up
Repeat again, again, again
Wake up
Repeat again

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake upEmbed
