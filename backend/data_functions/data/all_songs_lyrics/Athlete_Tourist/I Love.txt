I Love LyricsFire on the hill
Fire in me still
I feel out of my league
But you turn around and you say to me that
I love everybody here
And I agree
I love everybody here
Sun has long gone out
Sun comes up like it's been about a year
I don't mind if we
Drink again my friend
'Cause there is so much left to say
There is so much left to say
There is so much left to say
There is so much left to say
People for miles, opening up
People for miles, in focus and not
We'd be OK if
We had answers to questions in rhymes and in reasons
You leave it to me to be all of four seasons
I love everybody here
And I agree
I love everybody here
I love everybody here
I love everybody here
I love everybody here
I love everybody here
Life is beautiful for sure
'Cause I love everybody hereEmbed
