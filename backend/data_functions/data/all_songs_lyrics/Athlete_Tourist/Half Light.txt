Half Light Lyrics
Sun got stuck
As it's making its way back down
We find ourselves
In a familiar part of town

And all that I've seen
Means nothing to me
Without you

So when I see you next we'll make the most of it
Tell the sun to start moving again
The taste of your kiss I've still got on my lips
And I'll take you there with me

Head crashed down
Air condition myself to sleep
A great night out
That will continue to the end of the week

And all that I've seen
Means nothing to me
Without you
So when I see you next we'll make the most of it
Tell the sun to start moving again
The taste of your kiss I've still got on my lips
And I'll take you there with me

It's you and me connected to a satellite
It's you and me and love through a machine
It's you and me connected to a satellite
It's you and me and love through a machine

So when I see you next we'll make the most of it
Tell the sun to start moving again
The taste of your kiss I've still got on my lips
And I'll take you there with meEmbed
