Trading Air Lyrics
Covered ground
Just to reach your house
I know we need to talk
But I can't catch my thoughts
Insides gripped
Scared of what you'll think
Words I can't repeat
Could change all we've got

Set it off
Someone better hit the alarm
Set it off
Someone better help me

Disarm myself
I don't want no-one else
All I want is you
All I want is you

Trading air
Once more from the start
I can't open up
A thousand paper cuts
People hear
What they want to hear
But they won't change a thing
No they won't change a thing
Set it off
Someone better hit the alarm
Set it off
Someone better help me

Disarm myself
I don't want no-one else
All I want is you
All I want is you

Disarm myself
I don't want no-one else
All I want is you
All I want is youEmbed
