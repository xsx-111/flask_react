Modern Mafia LyricsTell me something I don't know
'Cause we've been there ten times before
Make it up as we go along
In so deep it can't be wrong
It's obvious that
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
It's time for us to redefine
So fix your eyes, fix your eyes
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
I don't want to be on my own
I need a home, I need a home
There's a look that's in your eye
Dancing like a Samurai
In silence you're still listening
'Cause somewhere something's happening
It's obvious that
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
It's time for us to redefine
So fix your eyes, fix your eyes
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
I don't want to be on my own
I need a home, I need a home
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
It's time for us to redefine
So fix your eyes, fix your eyes
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
I don't want to be on my own
I need a home, I need a home
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
It's time for us to redefine
So fix your eyes, fix your eyesEmbed
