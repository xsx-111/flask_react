Yesterday Threw Everything at Me LyricsSwitch on the light between each other
Elevated to your side, now I'm nervous
It's time to tell you honestly
So we can alter history
You are first on my list
When everything around is gone, I know
You are first on my list
When everything is shown up for what it is
Plastic flowers that fight for colour
Shadows floating on the ground, that always follow
Like international acclaim
It comes and goes never the same
You are first on my list
When everything around is gone, I know
You are first on my list
When everything is shown up for what it is
And I will run with it
And sunlight will break into my eyes
And it seems like you plugged the world in
'Cause sunlight is streaming from your eyes
You are first on my list
When everything around is gone, I know
You are first on my list
When everything is shown up for what it is
Let's take our time
It won't change overnight
We got a chance we didn't have before
Let's take our time
It won't change overnight
We got a chance we didn't have before
You are first on my list
When everything around is gone, I know
You are first on my list
When everything is shown up for what it isEmbed
