Wires Lyrics
You got wires going in
You got wires coming out of your skin
You got tears making tracks
I got tears that are scared of the facts

Running down corridors
Through automatic doors
Got to get to you
Got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I've seen Christmas lights reflect in your eyes

You got wires going in
You got wires coming out of your skin
There's dry blood on your wrist
Your dry blood on my fingertip

Running down corridors
Through automatic doors
Got to get to you
Got to see this through
First night of your life
Curled up on your own
Looking at you now
You would never know
I see it in your eyes
I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
I see it in your eyes
I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
Alright

Running down corridors
Through automatic doors
Got to get to you
Got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I've seen Christmas lights reflect in your eyes

Down corridors
Through automatic doors
Got to get to you
Got to see this through
First night of your life
Curled up on your own
Looking at you now
You would never know4Embed
