Tourist Lyrics
This European air, it always warms my face
I wish I could buy some
I will bring you stories and bleary eyed photos
Like a regular tourist

We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing

Suitcases down our street are rolling once again
I roll away with them
5 days inside New York to lose myself with friends
I'm nowhere without you

We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We will never go breaking down
I feel like nothing
Just want to be with you my baby
Just want to be with you my baby
Just want to be with you my baby
Just want to be with you my baby

I'm counting up the cost of time
And we'll embrace our time away
We cannot save ourselves alone
Or rely on a mobile phone
Just want to be with you my baby
(I'm counting up the cost of time)
Just want to be with you my baby
(And we'll embrace our time away)
Just want to be with you my baby
(We cannot save ourselves alone)
Just want to be with you my baby
(Or rely on a mobile phone)
Just want to be with you my baby
Just want to be with you my baby
Just want to be with you my baby
Just want to be with you my babyEmbed
