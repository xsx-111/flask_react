If I Found Out LyricsOut of energy
I don't know what to do with myself
Made it eventually
And now I'm resting on the very last breath
All I needed was this one
To get me back on my way
It wasn't long before I realised
There was no time to waste
There was soul all around me
Everybody let go
It wasn't long before we realised
There was no time to waste
Like I'm eleven again
I was the highest kid in the world
Reached a point with no end
Just looking out so I can take it all in
All I needed was this one
To get me back on my way
It wasn't long before I realised
There was no time to waste
There was soul all around me
Everybody let go
It wasn't long before we realised
There was no time to waste
All I needed was this one
To get me back on my way
It wasn't long before I realised
There was no time to waste
I thank you for soul
No point unless you got soul
This world has got to have soul
Looking around for your soul
Digging down to your soul
I found out you got soul
Holding out all your soul
Lifting up all your soul
I thank you for soulEmbed
