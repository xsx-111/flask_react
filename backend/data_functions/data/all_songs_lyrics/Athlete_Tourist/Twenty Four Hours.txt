Twenty Four Hours LyricsPeople rushing left to right
There's pretty faces left to right
I'm just frozen staring into space
Faster than the speed of light
I'm holding on I'm holding tight
'Cause stars are gonna crash into this place
And it's caught wide screen so we don't miss a thing
Now I'm standing clear
'Cause all I waited for is
Closing in
Still got twenty four hours
We're closing in
Still got twenty four hours
This is more than daily bread
It's three degrees, it's something else
And you just take it all into your stride
Couldn't be an accident
'Cause I can't see no ambulance
I know that we will work it out this time
And it's caught wide screen so we don't miss a thing
Now I'm standing clear
'Cause all I waited for is
Closing in
Still got twenty four hours
Now we're closing in
Still got twenty four hours
Closing in
Still got twenty four hours
Now we're closing in
Still got twenty four hours
It's not over
It's not over
Still got twenty four hours
It's not over
It's not over yet
Still got twenty four hoursEmbed
