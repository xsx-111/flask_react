No Good Lyrics

Can't fight the temptation
When you get the vibration
Won't do you no good
It won't do you no good
You better start running
When you hear the man coming
Won't do you no good
It won't do you no good
No we don't mind
If you don't mind
Hell I never mind

Don't let the mold break you
Let the feeling come take you
Won't do you no good
Won't do you no good
And you know I got fevers
When you hit me right, you know you might as well
Won't do you no good
Said it won't do you no good
And I said, kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright!
Heaven knows they wanna break you apart, yeah
Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright!
You never know unless you give it a try, oh baby
Said do you no good

Can't fight the temptation
When you get the vibration
Won't do you no good
It won't do you no good
And you can tell I got fever
You try to shake it off, try it all you want
It won't do you no good
Said it won't do you no good
And I said, kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright
Heaven knows they wanna break you apart, yeah
Kiss your baby goodbye
Come on, love, it's alright
You never know unless you give it a try, oh yeah!

Yeah, yeah!
Whoooa, yeah!
No, no, baby
Yeaaaah!
Whoa yeah!
Want my sweet little baby
Whoa you're no good babe
Yeah!
I said yeah
One day yeah, baby!
Ah yeah!
Woo!
Ooooh yeah!6Embed
