Save Yourself Lyrics
It weighs heavier on one's heart
I could tell right from the start that sweet ones are hard to come across
Well there is more than meets the eye
Heart like yours is rare to find
Someone else's gain will be my loss
Woah, woah, oh oh
Oh woah, woah
Woah woah oh
Hey hey

Well little things that make you smile
Dancing barefoot in the dark
If only I had strength to change your mind
Oh for what you need
You will not see
Choose your words before you speak
Can you see that all you've got is time?

Woah now
Save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Oh darling save yourself for someone else
Yeah, save yourself
Oh darling save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself from someone else
Woah
Don't give in to their feelings
Don't give in darkness and faith
You should be safe, yeah, with someone else

Tell your secrets to the night
You do yours and I do mine
So we won't have to keep them all inside
Oh, for one so pure
Count these off
Let your feelings take control
Hold on to the world that he's begging for

Woah now
Save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Go on and save yourself for someone else
Yes darling save yourself
Oh won't you save yourself
Go on and save yourself for someone else
Woah are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Woah aren't you going to take me?
Yeah are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Woah what's it going to take?
Yeah, are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Are you going to break?
Are you going to break?8Embed
