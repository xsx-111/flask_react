A Line in the Sand Lyrics
How to stop the murdering?
By now we should have learned
If we don’t then we’re a sham
Bad overwhelms the good
Bad overwhelms the good

What I’ve seen
Yes, it’s changed how I see humankind
I used to think progress was made
We could get something right
We could get something right

Enough is enough
A line in the sand
Seven or eight thousand people
Killed by hand
They stepped off the edge
They did not step back
If we have not learnt
By now
Then we’re a sham

When we first got to the camp
Supplies were not enough
I saw a displaced family
Eating a cold horse's hoof
A, a cold horse's hoof
We sent up tents, brought in water
Air drops were dispersed
But I saw people kill each other
Just to get there first
Oh, just to get there first

Enough is enough
A line in the sand
Seven or eight thousand people
Killed by hand
They stepped off the edge
They did not step back
If we have not learnt
By now
Then we’re a sham

What we did?
Why we did it?
I make no excuse
We got things wrong
But I believe
We also did some good
What we did?
Why we did it?
I make no excuse
I believe we have a future
To do something goodEmbed
