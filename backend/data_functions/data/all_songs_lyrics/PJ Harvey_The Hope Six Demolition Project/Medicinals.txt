Medicinals Lyrics
I was walking through the National Mall
Thinking about medicinals
How they used to grow there
When the ground was a marshland
Undisturbed by human hands
And I heard their voices

The Sumac said "We are always here"
The Witch Hazel - "We are always here"
The Sassafras - "We are always here"
The bluestem grasses - "Always here"

I looked about, what did I see?
Medicinals growing round' me
Rising from the gravel
Sumac and the Witch Hazel
Come to soothe our pain, our sores
Come to soothe our troubles

The Sumac said "We are always here"
The Witch Hazel - "We are always here"
The Sassafras - "We are always here"
The Bluestem grasses - "Always here"
But do you see that woman
Sitting in the wheelchair?
With her Redskins cap on backwards
What's that she's singing?
As from inside a paper wrapper
She sips from a bottle
A new painkiller
For the native peopleEmbed
