River Anacostia Lyrics
Oh, my Anacostia
Do not sigh, do not weep
Beneath the overpass
Your Savior's waiting patiently

Walking on the water
Flowing with the poisons
From the naval yards
He's talking to the broken reeds

Saying "What will become of us?"
"What will become of us?"
Oh...

Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water

A small red sun makes way for night
Trails away like a tail light
Is that Jesus on the water
Talking to the fallen trees?
Saying "What will become of us?"
"What will become of us?"
Oh...

Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water

Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water
Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water
Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water
What will become if God's gonna trouble waters?
Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water
What will become if God's gonna trouble waters?
Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water
What will become if God's gonna trouble waters?
Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the water
Wade in the water, God's gonna trouble the waterEmbed
