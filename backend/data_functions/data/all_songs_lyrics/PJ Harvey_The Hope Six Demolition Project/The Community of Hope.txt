The Community of Hope Lyrics
They took one of the old notorious housing projects, and they leveled it and rebuilt it as "Mixed Income Housing". It's called "Hope Six," and it's supposed to... sort of rejuvenate everything. It certainly looks a lot better

Here's the Hope Six Demolition Project
Stretching down to Benning Road
A well-known "pathway of death"
At least that's what I'm told
And here's the one sit-down restaurant
In Ward Seven, nice
OK, now this is just drug town
Just zombies, but that's just life

In the Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope, hope, hope, hope

Here's the highway to death and destruction
South Capitol is its name
And the school just looks like a shit-hole
Does that look like a nice place?
Here's the old mental institution
Now the Homeland Security Base
And here's God's Deliverance Centre
A deli called M.L.K
In The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope
The Community of Hope, hope, hope, hope

They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here
They're gonna put a Walmart here2Embed
