The Wheel Lyrics
A revolving wheel of metal chairs
Hung on chains, squealing
Four little children flying out
A blind man sings in Arabic

Hey little children don’t disappear
(I heard it was 28,000)
Lost upon a revolving wheel
(I heard it was 28,000)

Now you see them, now you don’t
Children vanish ‘hind vehicle
Now you see them, now you don’t
Faces, limbs, a bouncing skull

Hey little children don’t disappear
(I heard it was 28,000)
All that’s left after a year
(I heard it was 28,000)
A faded face, the trace of an ear
(I heard it was 28,000)
A tableau of the missing
Tied to the government building
8,000 sun-bleached photographs
Faded with the roses

Hey little children don’t disappear
(I heard it was 28,000)
Lost upon a revolving wheel
(I heard it was 28,000)
All that’s left after a year
(I heard it was 28,000)
A faded face, the trace of an ear
(I heard it was 28,000)

And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade out
And watch them fade...7Embed
