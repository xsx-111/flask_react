Nature of Inviting (Black Light Odyssey remix) LyricsThe surrender to the power
Makes me born again
The fixation on every sign
I cannot explain
I worship intoxication
At your open play
The appetite that you find
That you throw away
Is a vice of gold and dreams
You try to escape from
But you surrender to the power
To the only way
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
That's the nature of inviting
To your recklessness and pleasure
I purely commit
Because everything that you are
Is everything there is
It's a vice of gold and dreams
You try to escape from
But you surrender to the power
To the only way
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
It's the nature of invitingEmbed
