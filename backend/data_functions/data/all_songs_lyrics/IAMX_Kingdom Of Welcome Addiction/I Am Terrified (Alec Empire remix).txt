I Am Terrified (Alec Empire remix) LyricsYou look good in leather in bars
Breaking things, breaking hearts
You look good in pleasure, in hotels
Loneliness is the key to break that spell
I am terrified, I think too much
I get emotional when I drink too much
I buy every cry, 'cause I don't trust
I am terrified, I think too much
In your blood, the fetish
The prize of a million teasing moments blind
Will release you from the circus, the railway
But the gravity between us will keep us safe
I am terrified, I think too much
I get emotional when I drink too much
I buy every cry, 'cause I don't trust
I am terrified!
I am terrified, I think too much
I get emotional when I drink too much
I buy every cry, 'cause I don't trust
I am terrified!
I am terrified!
I am terrified!
'Cause I drink too much
'Cause I drank too much!Embed
