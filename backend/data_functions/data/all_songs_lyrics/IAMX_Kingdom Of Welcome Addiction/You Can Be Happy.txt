You Can Be Happy Lyrics
You walked into the world
As a super human boy and girl
In the blinking of your eyes
I was born and sold by your manifesto

It's a cruel world for small things
But with lies and luxuries
In the in-between
You can be happy

You put me in a cage
In the daily maze of flesh and rage
But I will follow every truth
I won't let you go, I want every tomorrow

It's a cruel world for small things
But with lies and luxuries
In the in-between
You can be happy

And now I am afraid
You will blossom soon and grow and change
There is so much I can't take
But I will understand, I will open my hand
You can be happy
You can be happy
You can be happy
You can be happy (It's a cruel world for small things)
You can be happy (But with the lies and luxuries)
You can be happy (In the in-between)
You can be happy (You can be happy)
You can be happy
You can be happy
You can be happy

There's an open window
And I can go through
Into the life of others
There's nothing I can't do
There's an open window
And I can go through
Into the life of others
There's nothing I can't do (fight)
There's an open window (fight)
And I can go through (fight)
Into the life of others (fight)
There's nothing I can't do (fight)
There's an open window (fight/you can be happy)
And I can go through (fight/you can be happy)
Into the life of others (fight/you can be happy)
There's nothing I can't do (fight/you can be happy)
Fight/you can be happy
Fight/you can be happy
Fight/you can be happy
Fight/you can be happy
You can be happy (ooh)Embed
