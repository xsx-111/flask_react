The Stupid, the Proud Lyrics
God is dead
We get to sleep tonight
Walk with me into the truth
Out of your lies
Man equals woman
I'm just the messenger, don't shoot me down
The armies of faithful
The killers of reason, the grief for the crown
The stupid, the proud
They blow our houses down
The stupid, the proud
They blow our houses down

Exalt yourself
Do it to stay alive
Serve your duty
You must demand, they must abide
Queer is the universe
Habit the liberty, destructive in time
Hunt down your future
And everything you know is not enough to survive

The stupid, the proud
They blow our houses down
The stupid, the proud
They blow our houses down1Embed
