Kingdom of Welcome Addiction Lyrics
Do you remember your coming down?
Forced to take sides
Your taunted charm and your broken smile
Touched me unexpectedly

So long, so long you've waited in line
Desire is a gift in life
So long, so long you've left and arrived
It's time for you to stay a while

If you chose life, you know what to fear is like
If you welcome addiction, this is your kingdom

Your fight for power, for memories
Answers and signs
Will bring you through the dark to light
Clear and redefine

Too long, too long ungracefully
Commercially sucking life
Too long, too long you've wasted and bribed
It's time for you to recognise
If you chose life, you know what to fear is like
If you welcome addiction, this is your kingdom

If you chose life, you know what to fear is like
If you welcome addiction, this is your kingdom1Embed
