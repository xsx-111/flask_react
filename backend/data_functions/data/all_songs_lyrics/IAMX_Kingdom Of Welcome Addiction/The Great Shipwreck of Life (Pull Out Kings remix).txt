The Great Shipwreck of Life (Pull Out Kings remix) LyricsWe can make you understand
We can make you understand
Play with me
You can make the love, I’ll make the money
Stay with me
Shut out the world, live underneath the city
Release cold gender bombs
On colonial closet middle England
Stay with me
I’ll be Peter Pan and you just be pretty
To the brave and the petrified
We all fall down
To the slave and the civilised
We all fall down
To the lovers we left behind
The bad days, the good nights
In the great shipwreck of life
We all fall down
Born we are
Between the hard black rock and the code of the immortal
Torn from cars
From the flames of the brave and the bosom we can’t return to
We light up the bars of the world
With the decadent essence of innocence
Free but sharp
We can be the satellite guiding through the dark
To the great and the petrified
We all fall down
To the slaves and the civilized
We all fall down
To the lovers we left behind
The bad days, the good nights
In the great shipwreck of life
We all fall down
We can make you understand
We can make you understand
We can make you understand
We can make you understand
To the great and the petrified
We all fall down
To the slaves and the civilized
We all fall down
To the lovers we left behind
The bad days, the good nights
In the great shipwreck of life
We all fall down
We can make you understand
We can make you understandEmbed
