My Secret Friend Lyrics
You have loved
You were not alone
You have braved the weather
When the storm cut you to the bone
There was always shelter

My secret friend
I'll take you to the river
My secret friend
So we can swim forever

In your skin
To die a little death
This time there's no code word
When everyday frays in hollow ends
Dream sweet love submersive

My secret friend
Oh, take me to the river
My secret friend
So we can swim forever
Break my deepest promise
I will break your promise

My secret friend
Oh, take me to the river
My secret friend
So we can swim forever2Embed
