Tear Garden Lyrics
I saw bright open common sense
I do evil things, and evil things return
And I'm praying now
Praying for me
You can't hide, I remove from you
Every tiny strength in everything you do
And I'll kick you down
I'll break you with a tender touch

And then the tears cried in the tear garden
Will be for life

In the West, they have made a plague
We have built the ship that sailed it to our veins
And God forbid
Anything should break that chain
At our root, we're connected through
A biology, a universal cruelty
Send me home
Return me to a lonely womb

And then the tears cried in the tear garden
Will be for life1Embed
