Think of England Lyrics
In the grip of a winter came love and greed
Insane with faith, I took the driving front seat
In the lowlight comfort of Berlin streets
A calm from emptiness duetted with my body heat

And I was alone at the frontline
The message I was taught was a triumph and the joy of a lifetime

I just can't think of England
I can't see the picture
I'm still running from the fire, the fire
I just can't think of England
I can't see the picture
I'm still running from the fire, the fire

In the twilight hours of nervous rest
I bought the peace before believing the threat
In a foreign field, I cut all regrets
But the poison stories just repeat themselves in a fucked up mess

And I was alone for the first time
The message I was taught was a triumph and the joy of a lifetime
I just can't think of England
I can't see the picture
I'm still running from the fire, the fire
I just can't think of England
I can't see the picture
I'm still running from the fire, the fire

I just can't think of England
Can't see the picture
I just can't think of England
Can't see the picture
I just can't think of England
Can't see the pictureEmbed
