Running LyricsYou sing for me my friend
Brave and confident
And there is comfort between your breaths
A na√Øve sense to help
But when the days beneath me
Scream into my present
I must always run the race on my own
Your warmth is in my bed
Your voice above the stairs
And when the touching becomes regret
Becomes my mercy chair
Even when the sun is burning
Saving graces
I must always run the race on my own
Oh the sinking and descent
Of every sailing word
And the destruction of all convention
And all corrupted thought
Dig their nails into my optimistic shell
I must always run the race on my own
I must always run the race on my own
I must always run the race on my ownEmbed
