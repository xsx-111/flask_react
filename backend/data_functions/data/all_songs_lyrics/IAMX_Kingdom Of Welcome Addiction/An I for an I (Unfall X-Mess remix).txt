An I for an I (Unfall X-Mess remix) LyricsWe owe it to the willing souls
To the white lie
The double bluff and fever
An I for an I
We owe it to the TV
To the motherland smile
Apocalypse and rapture signing in
An I for an I
If you’re not with us you’re against
An I for an I
We owe it to disaster
To the black fire T
The anger and enclosure of desire
An I for an I
We owe it to the sex toys
To the icons of our time
Humility an touch is in decline
An I for an I
If you're not with us you're against
An Eye for an Eye
If you're not with us you're against
Eye for an Eye
Eye for an Eye
We owe it to the TV
To disaster
To the motherland smile
To the willing souls
To the willing souls
To the willing souls!Embed
