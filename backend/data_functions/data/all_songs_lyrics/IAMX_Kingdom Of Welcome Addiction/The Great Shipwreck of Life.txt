The Great Shipwreck of Life Lyrics
We can make you understand
We can make you understand

Play with me, you can make the love, I'll make the money
Stay with me, shut out the world, live underneath the city
Release cold gender bombs on colonial closet middle England
Stay with me, I'll be Peter Pan and you just be pretty

To the brave and the petrified, we all fall down
To the slave and the civilised, we all fall down
To the lovers we left behind, the bad days, the goodnights
In the great shipwreck of life, we all fall down

Born we are between the hard black rock and the code of the immortal
Torn from cars from the flames of the brave and the bosom we can't return to
We light up the bars of the world with the decadent essence of innocence
Free but sharp, we can be the satellite guiding through the dark

To the brave and the petrified, we all fall down
To the slave and the civilised, we all fall down
To the lovers we left behind, the bad days, the goodnights
In the great shipwreck of life, we all fall down
We can make you understand
We can make you understand
We can make you understand
We can make you understand

To the brave and the petrified, we all fall down
To the slave and the civilised, we all fall down
To the lovers we left behind, the bad days, the goodnights
In the great shipwreck of life, we all fall down

We can make you understand
We can make you understand4Embed
