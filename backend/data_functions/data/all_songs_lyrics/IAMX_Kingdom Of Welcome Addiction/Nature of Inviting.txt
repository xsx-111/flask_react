Nature of Inviting Lyrics
The surrender to the power makes me born again
The fixation of every sign, I cannot explain
I worship intoxicated at your open play
The appetite that you find that you throw away
It's a vice of gold and dreams you try to escape from
But you surrender to the power
To the only way

I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
That's the nature of inviting

To your recklessness and pleasure I purely commit
Because everything that you are is everything there is
It's a vice of gold and dreams you try to escape from
But you surrender to the power
To the only way

I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you
That's the nature of invitingEmbed
