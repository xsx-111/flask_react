An I for an I Lyrics
We owe it to the willing souls
To the white lie
The double bluff and fever
An I for an I
We owe it to the TV
To the motherland smile
Apocalypse and rapture signing in
An I for an I

If you're not with us, you're against
An I for an I

We owe it to disaster
To the black fire
The anger and enclosure of desire
An I for an I
We owe it to the sex toys
To the icons of our time
Humility and touch is in decline
An I for an I

If you're not with us, you're against
An I for an I
If you're not with us, you're against
An I for an I
I for an I
We owe it to the TV
To disaster
To the motherland smile
To the willing souls
To the willing souls
To the willing soulsEmbed
