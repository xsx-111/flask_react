Road Movie to Berlin LyricsWe're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of Bourbon
And we'll go
We were once so close to Heaven
Peter came out and gave us medals
Declaring us the nicest of the damned
Time won't find the lost
It'll sweep up our skeleton bones
So take the wheel and I will take the pedals
We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of Bourbon
And we'll go2Embed
