Hot Cha LyricsHot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?
First time hot Cha went away
A floating island was his home
Then the phone rang off the hook
And hot Cha had to come back home
Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?
Second time he went away
Left the bathtub running over
Stereo on and cooking bacon
Never came back to tell us why
If that honey would come back
We would throw such a party
Drink and cook the prodigal son
Fondue forks for everybody
Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So, hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?3Embed
