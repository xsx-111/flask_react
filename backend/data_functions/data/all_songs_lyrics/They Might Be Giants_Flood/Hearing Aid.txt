Hearing Aid LyricsFrosty the supervisor
Lives by himself
Sometimes I feel sorry for him
Usually I can't
I've turned off my hearing aid
Don't say the electric chair's not good enough
For king-lazy-bones like myself
More coffee for me boss
'Cause I'm not as messed up as I want to be
I've turned off my hearing aid
Don't say the electric chair's not good enough
For king-lazy-bones like myself
Because
