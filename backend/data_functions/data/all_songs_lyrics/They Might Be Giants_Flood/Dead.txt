Dead LyricsI returned a bag of groceries
Accidentally taken off the shelf
Before the expiration date
I came back as a bag of groceries
Accidentally taken off the shelf
Before the date stamped on myself
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
Torches as my head fell in the basket, (large procession)
And was everybody dancing on the casket? (dance?)
Now it's over, I'm dead, and I haven't (now it's)
Done anything that I want (over)
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
I will never say the word "Procrastinate" again
I'll never see myself in the mirror with my eyes closed
I didn't apologize
For when I was eight and I made my younger
Brother have to be my personal slave
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
Torches as my head fell in the basket, (large procession)
And was everybody dancing on the casket? (dance?)
Now it's over, I'm dead, and I haven't (now it's)
Done anything that I want (over)
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
So I won't
Sit at home anymore
And you won't see my head in the window
And I won't be around ever anymore
And I'll be up there on the wall at the store
I returned a bag of groceries
Accidentally taken off the shelf
Before the expiration date
I came back as a bag of groceries
Accidentally taken off the shelf
Before the date stamped on myself
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
Torches as my head fell in the basket, (large procession)
And was everybody dancing on the casket? (dance?)
Now it's over, I'm dead, and I haven't (now it's)
Done anything that I want (over)
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
Now it's over, I'm dead, and I haven't (now it's)
Done anything that I want (over)
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do4Embed
