Women & Men LyricsWhen the ship runs out of ocean
And the vessel runs aground
Land's where we know the boat is found
Now there's nothing unexpected
About the water giving out
"Land's" not a word we have to shout
But there's something beside the shoreline
Moving across the beachhead
Coming up from the shipwreck
Making as if to say:
Women and men
Women and men
Women and men
Women and men
(Women and Men) Bringing with them messages of love
And everywhere they go love will grow (love will grow)
(Women and Men) When you see the faces of the women
And the men, you too will know (you will know)
Women and Men have crossed the ocean
They now begin to pour
Out from the boat and up the shore
Two by two they enter the jungle
And soon they number more
Three by three as well as four by four
Soon the stream of people gets wider
Then it becomes a river
River becomes an ocean
Carrying ships that bear
Women and men
Women and men
Women and men
Women and men2Embed
