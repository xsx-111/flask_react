Letterbox LyricsI'll never know what you'll find
When you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know
What you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O
If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time
You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about
When you took a bite out of my spine
I would have a lot of eyes on me by this time, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't that just be fine?
Too late or soon to make noise about love and there's no time for sorrow
Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow
I'll never know what you'll find
When you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O3Embed
