Lucky Ball and Chain Lyrics
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

She threw away her baby-doll
I held on to my pride
But I was young and foolish then
I feel old and foolish now

Confidentially, she never called me baby-doll
Confidentially I never had much pride
But now I rock a bar stool
And I drink for two
Just pondering this time bomb in my mind

I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
I could shake my tiny fist and swear I wasn't wrong
But what's the sense in arguing when you're all alone?
Sure as you can't steer a train
You can't change your fate
And when she told me off that day
I knew I'd lost my home

Confidentially, I never told you of her charms
Confidentially, we never had a home
But this railroad apartment was the perfect place
When she'd sit and hold me in her arms

I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on

She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door3Embed
