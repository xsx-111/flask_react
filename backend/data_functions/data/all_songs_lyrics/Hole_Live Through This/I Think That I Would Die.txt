I Think That I Would Die Lyrics
He's stupid
I'm smarting
He's stupid
I'm smarting

I want my baby
Where is the baby?
I want my baby
Who took my baby?

Rose white, rose red
Rose up in my head
Rose white, rose red

Yeah, yeah
I want some
Yeah, yeah
There is none

I want my baby
Where is the baby?
I want my baby
There is a baby
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
Rose white, rose red
Rose up in my head
Rose white, rose red
Oh! No!

She lost all her innocence
Gave it to an abscess
She lost all her innocence
She said, "I am not a feminist"
It's not yours
Fuck you!

There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!
There is no milk!3Embed
