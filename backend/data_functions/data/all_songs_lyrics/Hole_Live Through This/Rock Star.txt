Rock Star Lyrics
Well, I went to school, oh
Well, I went to school, ha ha!

Well, I went to school in Olympia
And everyone's the same
What do you do with a revolution?
When I went to school in Olympia
And everyone's the same
We look the same
We talk the same, yeah

Don't you, please, make me real
Fuck you, make me sick
Fuck you, make me real
Fuck you

Well, I went to school in Olympia
Everyone's the same
And so are you, in Olympia
Everyone's the same
We look the same
We talk the same, yeah
We even fuck the same
Well, I went to school in Olympia
Don't you, please, make me real
Come on, make me sick
Come on, make me real
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it for the kids, yeah
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it for the kids

(No, we're not done!)
Well, I went to school in Olympia
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye3Embed
