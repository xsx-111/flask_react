Softer, Softest Lyrics
I tell you everything
And I hope that you won't tell on me
And I'd give you anything
I know that you won't tell on me

Pee girl gets the belt
Your milk makes me mind
Your milk is so sour
And I can only cry
And I can only cower
And I can only cry
You have all the power

I‘ve got a blister from
Touching everything I see
The abyss opens up
It steals everything from me

Pee girl gets the belt
Your milk makes me mind
Your milk is so sick
Your milk has a dye
Your milk has a dick
Your milk has a dye
Your milk has a dick
Burn the witch
The witch is dead
Burn the witch
Just bring me back her head

Pee girl gets the belt
Your milk makes me mind
Your milk is so mean
Your milk turns to crime
Your milk turns to cream
Your milk turns to cry
Your milk turns to cream
Your milk turns to cry
Your milk turns to cream
Your milk turns to cry
Your milk turns to cream2Embed
