Doll Parts Lyrics
I am doll eyes, doll mouth, doll legs
I am doll arms, big veins, dog bait

Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, they really do
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, and I do too

I want to be the girl with the most cake
I love him so much, it just turns to hate
I fake it so real, I am beyond fake
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
Someday you will ache like I ache

I am doll parts, bad skin, doll heart
It stands for ‘knife’ for the rest of my life

Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, they really do
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, but I do too
I want to be the girl with the most cake
He only loves those things because he loves to see them break
I fake it so real, I am beyond fake
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
Someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache

Someday you will ache like I ache17Embed
