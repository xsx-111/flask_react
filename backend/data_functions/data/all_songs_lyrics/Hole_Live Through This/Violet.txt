Violet Lyrics
And the sky was made of amethyst
And all the stars were just like little fish
You should learn when to go
You should learn how to say, "No"

Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever

When they get what they want
And they never want it again
When they get what they want
And they never want it again

Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to

And the sky was all violet
I want it again, but violent, more violent
Yeah, I'm the one with no soul
One above and one below
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever
Might last a day, yeah
Mine is forever

When they get what they want
And they never want it again
When they get what they want
And they never want it again

Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I dare you to

Well, I told you from the start
Just how this would end
When I get what I want
And I never want it again

Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
It's my lie
You're mine, you're mine

Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything, I want you to
Go on, take everything
Take everything
Take everything
Take everything16Embed
