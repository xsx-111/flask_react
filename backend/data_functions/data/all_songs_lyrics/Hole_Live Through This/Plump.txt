Plump Lyrics
Shakes his death rattle
Spittle on his bib
And I don't do the dishes
I throw them in the crib

I'm eating you
I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick

Now I've stumbled here
Failed to make it mine
They say I'm plump
But I threw up all the time

I'm eating you
I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick

Do you fake it for me like I?
Do you fake it for me like I?
Do you fake it for me like I?
My baby's in her arms
Crawling up her legs
Like a liar at a witch trial
You look good for your age

I'm eating you
I'm overfed
Your milk's in my mouth
It makes me sick6Embed
