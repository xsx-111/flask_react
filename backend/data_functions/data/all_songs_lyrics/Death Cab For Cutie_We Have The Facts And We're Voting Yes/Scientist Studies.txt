Scientist Studies Lyrics
What ghosts exist behind these attic walls?
There's got to be a simpler explanation
'Cause I scrimped and I saved just to find

Promises of payments were
Upon your shoulders constantly
But don't forget to entertain
'Cause this is your first defense

Four-year offense to the devoted type
I may have got an invitation, but I wasn't invited
But I thought that this meant something more
Than broken hearts and new addictions
We'll leave our sins within the carpet twine
Our bodies will dissolve the chemicals in due time

Promises of payments were
Upon your shoulders constantly
But don't forget to entertain
'Cause this is your first defense
This is your first defense
This is a first defense
This was a first defense
This is my last defense1Embed
