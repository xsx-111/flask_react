Photobooth LyricsI remember when the days were long
And the nights when the living room was on the lawn
Constant quarreling, the childish fits
And our clothes in a pile on the ottoman
All the slander and double-speak
Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof
Was your lips touching mine in the photobooth
And as the summer's ending
The cool air will push your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on
Cup your mouth to compress the sound
Skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town
And everything that I said was true
As the flashes blinded us in the photobooth
Well, I lost track, and then those words were said
You took the wheel and you steered us into my bed
And soon we woke and I walked you home
And it was pretty clear that it was hardly love
And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on
And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
As the alcohol drained the days
And as the summer’s ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that’s left
The empty bottles, spent cigarettes
So pack a change of clothes, 'cause it’s time to move on1Embed
