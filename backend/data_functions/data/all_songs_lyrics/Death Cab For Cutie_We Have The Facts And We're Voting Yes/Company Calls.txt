Company Calls Lyrics
I'll take the best of your bad moods
And dress them up to make a better you
'Cause all the company calls amount to one paycheck
I'd squeeze a heart through my fingertip
But I type too slow to make expressions stick
And it's like TV with a microchip

Set your sights, destroy this party line
'Cause it's so tired
Set your sights, destroy this mock shrine
'Cause it's so tired

Let's cut our losses at both ends
And aim your car away from all our friends
Leaving the dishes stacked in the sink

Set your sights, destroy this party line
'Cause it's so tired
Set your sights, destroy this mock shrine
'Cause it's so tired

I'd keep my distance 'cause the complications cloud it all
And mail a postcard sending greetings from the Eastern Bloc
Synapse to synapse, possibilities will thin or fade
And your wedding figurines, I'd melt so I could drink them in
And drink them in, and drink them in
I'll take the best of your bad moods
And dress them up to make a better you
'Cause all the company calls amount to one paycheck

Set your sights, just end this party line
'Cause it's so tired
Set your sights, destroy this mock shrine
'Cause it's so tired
Set your sights, destroy this party line
'Cause it's so tired
Set your sights, destroy this mock shrine
'Cause it's so tiredEmbed
