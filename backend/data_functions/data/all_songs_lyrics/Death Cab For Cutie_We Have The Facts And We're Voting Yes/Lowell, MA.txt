Lowell, MA Lyrics
You've been forewarned of the shake-shakedown
Opinions stamped on the pulp of the tabloid newsstand
Gossip that stacks at your door
You swallowed the last of free M.A
Car starts, four windows lowered away
Last views of cityscapes crumbling

Skyscrapers sink into the ground
All static, no noise, turn the radio down
Those bandwidth signals can't reach this far

Don't go holding
Out on me now
Don't go holding

I thought that you had come to expect
I thought that you had come to expect more
I thought that you had come to expect
I thought that you had come to expect more

You've been forewarned of the shake-shakedown
Opinions stamped on the pulp of the tabloid newsstand
Gossip that stacks at your door
Don't go holding
Out on me now
Don't go holding
Out on me now
Don't go holding
Out on me now
Don't go holdingEmbed
