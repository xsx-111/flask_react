For What Reason Lyrics
This won't be the last you hear from me
It's just the start
I hope that he keeps you up for weeks
Like you did to me

I will hold a candle up to you
To singe your skin
Brace yourself, I'm bent with bitterness
And can't foresee

When your apologies fail to ring true
So slick with that sarcastic slew
Of phrases like, "I thought you knew"
While keeping me in hot pursuit

Tracing the plot finds
Skin touching skin
Absence follows

In the end, I win every time
As ink remains
Sour tastes prevail as you play back
The tape machine
When your apologies fail to ring true
So slick with that sarcastic slew
Of phrases like, "I thought you knew"
While keeping me in such hot pursuit

Tracing the plot finds
Skin touching skin
Absence follows1Embed
