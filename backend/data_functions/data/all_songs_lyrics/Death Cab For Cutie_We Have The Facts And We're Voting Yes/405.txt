405 Lyrics
I took the 405 and drove a stake down into your center
And stated that it's never ever been better than this
I hung my favorite shirt on the floorboard, wrinkled up
From pulling pushing and tasting, tasting

You keep twisting the truth
That keeps me thrown askew

Misguided by the 405, 'cause it lead me to an alcoholic summer
I missed the exit to your parents' house hours ago
Red wine and the cigarettes
Hide your bad habits underneath the patio, patio, patio, patio

You keep twisting the truth
That keeps me thrown askew
You keep twisting the truth
That keeps me thrown askew1Embed
