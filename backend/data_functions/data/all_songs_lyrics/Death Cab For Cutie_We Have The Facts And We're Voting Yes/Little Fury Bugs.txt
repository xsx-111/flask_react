Little Fury Bugs Lyrics
You'll discover that casual friends
Kept notes in their pockets to remember your name
And all these places we went to see sights
Just gave them excuses to get into the game

And there's a look in the faces tonight that's untrustable
As the hope that you'll never return in a while
But you're always on time, so...

Sleeping soundly, the back of the car felt more like a home
Than I'd have ever have thought
And through the evening, the engine kept on
Until we hit Chicago and decided to stop

And there's a look in the faces tonight that's untrustable
As the hope that you'll never return in a while
But you're always on time, so...
There's a look in the faces tonight that's untrustable
As the hope that you'll never return in a while
But you're always on time, so...Embed
