The Employment Pages LyricsWe spread out and occupy the cracks in the urban streets
Idle now, I rearranged the furniture as you sleep
As you sleep, as you sleep
It's so appropriate
The way we amplify the sound
And then the neighbors drop by
And they ask to turn it down again
We spread out and everyone is frightfully more aware
So impressed, the cocktail politics and obscure details
It's so appropriate
The way we amplify the sound
And then the neighbors drop by
And they ask to turn it down again
And it was true that I was truly failing
You were gone and I was home calling around
But nothing was found worthwhile
We spread out and occupy the cracks in the urban streets
Idle now, I rearranged the furniture as you sleep
As you sleep, as you sleepEmbed
