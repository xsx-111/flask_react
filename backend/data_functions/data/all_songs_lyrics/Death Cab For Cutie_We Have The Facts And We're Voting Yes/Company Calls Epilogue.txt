Company Calls Epilogue Lyrics
Synapse to synapse, the possibility's thin
I'm dressed up for free drinks and family greetings
On your wedding, your wedding, your wedding day
The figures in plastic on the wedding cake that I took
Were so real

And I kept a distance, the complications cloud
The postcards and blips through fiber optics
As the girls with the pigtails were running from
Little boys wearing bowties, their parents bought and "I'll catch
You this time"

Crashing through the parlor doors
What was your first reaction?
Screaming, drunk, disorderly
I'll tell you mine

You were the one but I can't spit it out when the date's been set
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately

Synapse to synapse, the sneaky kids had attached
Beer cans to the bumper so they could drive
Up and down the main drag
People would turn to see who's making the racket, it's not
The first time
And when they lay down, the fish will swim upstream
And I'll contest, but they won't listen
When the casualty rate's near 100 percent
And there isn't a pension for second best or for hardly moving

Crashing through the parlor doors, what was your first reaction?
Screaming, drunk, disorderly, I'll tell you mine

You were the one, but I can't spit it out when the date's been set
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately

You were the one, but I can't spit it out when the date's been set
The white routine to be ingested inaccurately1Embed
