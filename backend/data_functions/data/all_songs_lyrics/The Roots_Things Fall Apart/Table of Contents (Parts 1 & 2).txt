Table of Contents (Parts 1 & 2) Lyrics

Is this fast or normal speed?
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, table of contents
Are you fuckin' with it? One two
It's the table of contents, come on, come on
Are you fuckin' with it? Uh-huh
It's the table of contents, one two
Are you fuckin' with it? Aw yeah
Uh huh, yo, check it out

You're now in-tuned to the sounds of the
R to the, double-O to the
T-S and I stretch limits of this profession
My voice physically fit, tracks I'm bench-pressin'
The mic chord is an extension of my intestine
Delicate MC's sliced in my delicatessen
My mind state is that of the S-P connection
Pennsy a part of me, South Philly through my arteries
Thought the dark one, fearsome, slump son
My vocal just a knuckle that sucker punched the drum
Hip-hop, yo, that's my hustle and it kill a kingdom
That Fall Apart to drastic proportion
Lost ones out there, you better stand clear
The Fifth Dynasty, it be a world premiere
Cuttin' through, like attorneys at law that's car chasin'
You stargazing, but the force y'all facin'
It's the R-to the, double-O to the, T-S and
Y'all niggas in the mix, keep guessin'
The world traveler in the flesh without question
Last seven years on tour without restin'
Yo, the kind of rapper you should reconsider testin'
Supreme simply, official Dundee
What I bring'll motivate to move your whole country
Throw your hands up if y'all want me to proceed with
And carry out strategic plans to leave with
The title that I'm watchin', Roots we run-ting
My Dundee attire for MC huntin'
Step up and out the ring
Y'all niggas on some other, y'all loud as Don King
But wine drink within the danger zone loungin'
You need to be more aware of your surroundings
Reality at times is astounding enough to get your heart poundin'
It's safe to assume, in all confidence
That I'm one of the illest in the seven continents
Yo, you on my dick, thanks for the compliments
You be fucked up by my table of contents
Bad lieutenant, yo, I been rhymin' since
The fuckin' past tense, fuck no delayin' or playin'
Takin' your wing way back in the day of, yo
Know what I'm sayin'? Kick it, baby you know
Motherfucking mic, what
Motherfucking mic, yeah, yeah

It's the R-to the, double-O to the
T-S and, damn, yo, yo
It's the R to the, double-O to the
T-S and, yo

When I strike to excite, I just aim, I never miss
Embrace you with a hug of death, give your ass a slight kiss
Toxic words that spill over pages, for ages
Impacts like M-16's to twelve gauges
The rage is still in me, never actin' too friendly
Scully down creepin' while you tilted off Henny
Many man begin pure, but in this world of sin, you're
Holdin' tight, your morale will be injured
And scramble, because this game life is the gamble
Vandalize your terrain, go against the grain
Invade your brain wit the collision, causin' division
Sweep your sector, leavin' you niggas for stool-pigeons
Sweep your sector, leavin' you niggas for stool-pigeons
Sweep your sector, leavin' you niggas for stool-pigeons
My religion is a way of life, but the trife replays
'Cause niggas actin shiest these days
Wagin' wars, usin' dynamics cause I'ma slam it
You talkin' all this out out your mouth, you satanic
Roam the planet, always takin' bullshit for granted
Just a cool type of cat, but you still can't understand it
You told to sit back, stand still and chill
Niggas bound to clap shots 'cause they all act ill
With a sour-ass taste, smilin' up in your face
I'm like trust, never leavin' no trial or no trace
Disappear wit the wind, prostration shows the discipline
Twenty-five years of my life, I learned to miss 'em and
Peep the structure of a whole empire
Smuggled sealed tai, pack lyrics like Kaya
Verbal messiah, when I cross, I set a fire
Whack an MC for ten thou' 'cause I'm for hire1Embed
