In the Forest LyricsI've just stepped outside of a dream
Where nothing ever is as it seems
The wind keeps whistling the same old tune
You lay asleep in the light of the moon
So silently I peer through the trees
My misery was in her beauty
Her hair hung long and her eyes were closed
That very moment she stole my soul
I'm in the forest
So rare and divine
This is the place where you lose your mind
From all of the feelings that are making you blue
You'll never know how much I'you
When she awoke and walked downstream
Stuck outside of that same old dream
I need to leave but my minds intrigued
Follow close but she doesn't see me
Out of the forest to the church's gate
By her grave she awaits her fate
My only crime was to want too much
I could look but I could not touch
I'm in the forest
So rare and divine
This is the place where you lose your mind
From all of the feelings that are making you blue
You'll never know how much I'youEmbed
