Eskimo Lament LyricsRain, rain, go away
Leave me here alone again
Where weary eyes and hollis tales play
Heavy on my mind
Rain, rain, don't dismay
Come back on a better day
Where weary eyes and hollis tales play
I've left them all behind
Some say I'm a fool
And see me on a beggar's stool
But all my truths are lied
All my secrets have been told
Rain, rain go away
Come back on a better day
When all my lies are gone and
All my burdens have been soldEmbed
