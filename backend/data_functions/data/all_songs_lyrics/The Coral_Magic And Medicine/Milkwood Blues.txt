Milkwood Blues LyricsSaw myself through another's eyes
What did I see to my surprise?
Nuts and bolts, rows of shops
Black Crow nights and chimney tops
And one too many sad songs
Bible black and captain cat
Keeps the world inside his hat
With deep dry wells and cockled shells
He holds his wife beneath his paws
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3, 2 many 1 herEmbed
