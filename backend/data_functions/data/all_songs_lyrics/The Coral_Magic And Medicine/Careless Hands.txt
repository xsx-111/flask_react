Careless Hands LyricsDon't put your heart in careless hands
Those careless hands they don't understand
Sugar and spice and all things nice
You won't think twice about sacrifice
You'll put your heart in careless hands
Those careless hands they don't understand
They lift you up and they'll...
Put you down
Have you running around this one horse town
Those careless hands
Won't understand
Those careless hands
Don't warm your hands in his cold heart
Cos his cold heart won't play that part
Choice was yours to hesitate
Threw his line and you took the bait
And warmed your hands in his cold heart
But his cold heart won't play that part
Open your eyes and look around
Any chance they get they'll put you down
With careless handsEmbed
