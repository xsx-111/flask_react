Confessions of A.D.D.D. Lyrics
On this here street where I do sit
Lives a man we can't forgive
His felony was jealousy
An impossible personality

And if you think it's you then let me know

He wasn't rich, he wasn't poor
Though how he longed for so much more
At night he dreamed of buccaneers
Pirate ships and privateers

And if you think it's you then let me know

His window was his favourite seat
For watching history repeat
Was he cursed or was he blessed
In the end well he confessed

And if you think it's you then let me know
This is what he said...

The warning signs are on my wall
There's no feelin' anymore
Has it always been like this?
Signed and sealed without a kiss
Well I know it's there
It's just something that I missed

And through the tears of madness
Souvenirs of sadness
Is all he sees, all he sees
So how do I begin to end this tale?
Of a time when all was well
And he'd laze on summer days down by the lake
Where the seagulls play what a way to waste his days

Who is to blame?
Have I been framed? yeah!
Who is to blame?
Have I been framed?
For the death of these days?
For the death of these days? (For the death of these days?)
For the death of these days? (For the death of these days?)
For the death of these days? (For the death of these days?)
For the death of these days?Embed
