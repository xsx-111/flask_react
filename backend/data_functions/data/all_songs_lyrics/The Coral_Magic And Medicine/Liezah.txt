Liezah LyricsI had a girl, her name was Liezah
She had only one desire
To walk the cobbled streets alone
Heading anywhere but home
With Crowley as her close companion
His diaries went hand in hand with
All the men that she has known
She leaves their silver but keeps their gold
So lawyers, doctors, please beware
Of that girl with wavy hair
For she will cut you down to size
Reveal the truth behind your disguise
Liezah, just passed by yer
Now you're standing empty handed
Liezah, can't despise her
She'll change your look, she'll have you hooked
The city sleeps as she's arriving
Tongue tied and twisted was her timing
Her eyes glazed in deep despair
Those crocodile tears, they don't care
Don't turn your back 'cause she'll be gone
Chasing shadows in the sun
All along the dusty road
Where she goes, well we'll never know
And everytime I think of Liezah
I break down and I start crying
Although she tore me apart
There's still a place for that girl in my heart
Liezah, just passed by yer
Now you're standing empty handed
Liezah, can't despise her
She'll change your look, she'll have you hookedEmbed
