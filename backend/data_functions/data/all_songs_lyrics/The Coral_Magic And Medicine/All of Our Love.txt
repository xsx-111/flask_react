All of Our Love LyricsAll of our love we give to you
Can you see what we see, can we see it too?
All of our hate we give to you
Can you do what we do, can we do it too?
All of our joy we give to you
Can you say what we say, can we say it too?
All of our pain we give to you
Can you be what we be? Can we be it too?
All of our love we give to you
All of our hate, we give you that too
All of our joy, we give to you
All of our pain, we give you that too
All of our love, all of our hate
All of our joy, all of our pain
Love, hate, joy, pain
Love, hate, joy, pain
Love, hate, joy, pain
Love, hate, joy, pain
Love, hate, joy, pain
Love, hate, joy, pain
Love, hate, joy, pain
Love, hate, joy, painEmbed
