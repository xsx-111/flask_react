Secret Kiss LyricsSecret kiss reminding me of what I miss
Some kind of forgotten bliss
On this summers eve
Though the seasons deceive
Corrupt my honesty
You still make me believe
Is this the rock that you're daring me to cross
Down the river to the docks that's where we'll meet
Where the pale light creeps into her majesty
You still make me believe
So far away
So far away
Can't get away
So far away
But that's alright
That's alright
Jewels and pearls and all the wonders of the world
Mean nothing until I return in time for tea
Sat on my settee lost in my memories
You still make me believe
You make me believe
You make me believeEmbed
