Reasons to Be Beautiful Lyrics
Love hangs herself
With the bed sheets in her cell
Threw myself on fires for you
Ten good reasons to stay alive
Ten good reasons that I can't find

Oh, give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
Oh, give me one reason to be beautiful
Oh, and everything I am

Love hates you
I live my life in ruins for you
And for all your secrets kept
I squashed the blossom and the blossom's dead

Oh, give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
Oh, and I will make myself so beautiful
Oh, and everything I am

Miles and miles of perfect skin
I swear I do, I fit right in
My love burns through everything
I cannot breathe
Miles and miles of perfect sin
I swear, I said, I fit right in
I fit right in your perfect skin
I cannot breathe
Hey, baby, take it all the way down
Hey, baby, taste me anyway
Oh, you were born
So pretty, oh, summer babe
We'll never know
And fading like a rose

Give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
I'll give you my body just sell me your soul
Oh, and everything I am will be bought and sold
Oh, and everything I am will turn hard and cold

And they say in the end
You'll get bitter just like them
And they steal your heart away
When the fire goes out you better learn to fake
It's better to rise than fade away

Hey, you were right
Named a star for your eyes
Did you freeze? Did you weep?
Turn to gold, baby, sleep
Hey, honey mine
I was there all the time
And I weep at your feet
And it rains and rains1Embed
