Use Once & Destroy Lyrics
It's the emptiness that follows you down
It's the ache inside when it all burns out
It's poisonous, it muscles, it aches
It's everything you had when it breaks

It's the emptiness that's all you have left
Too terrified of your frozen breath
It's a bitter mouth, it's buttered and knifed
It's the awful truth you fight for your life

It might as well, it might as well hurt
It might as well, it might as well

I went down to rescue you
I went all the way down
Fill your hungry wretched life
Here they come it's closing time

It's the bitter root, it's twisted inside
It's the heart you used to have when it died
It's the emptiness, it poisons, it lies
It's everything that you'll never find
It might as well, it might as well hurt
It might as well, it might as well

I went down for the remains
Sort through all your blurs and stains
Take your rapture, blister burns
Stand in line, it's not your turn

All dressed in red, always the bride
Off with her head, all dressed in white
Off with her head

I went down to rescue you
I went all the way down
I went down for the remains
Sort through all your blurs and stains

Ooh, I will follow you
Anytime, anywhere
Ooh, when they come for you
Just say you don't care2Embed
