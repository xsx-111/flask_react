Awful Lyrics
Swing low
Sweet cherry, make it awful
It's your life
It's your party, it's so awful
Let's start a fire
Let's start a riot, yeah, it's awful
It was punk
Yeah, it was perfect, now it's awful

They know how to break all the girls like you
And they rob the souls of the girls like you
And they break the hearts of girls

Swing low
Cherry, cherry, yeah, it's awful
He's drunk
He tastes like candy, he's so beautiful
He's so deep
Like dirty water, God, he's awful
You're lost
Oh, where's your daddy? It's so awful

And they royalty-rate all the girls like you
And they sell it out to the girls like you
To incorporate little girls
Hey, run away with the light
Run away, it's divine
Let's run away, yeah, tonight
And we'll steal the light of the world

Swing low
Sweet cherry, yeah, it's awful
You're ripe
For the picking, it's so awful
You've got your youth
Don't waste your money, yeah, its awful
I was punk
Now I'm just stupid, I'm so awful

Oh, just shut up, you're only sixteen
Oh, just shut up, you're only sixteen

If the world is so wrong
Yeah, you can break them all with one song
If the world is so wrong
Yeah, you can take it all with one song
Swing low
Sweet cherry, make it awful
They bought it all
Just build a new one, make it beautiful, yeahEmbed
