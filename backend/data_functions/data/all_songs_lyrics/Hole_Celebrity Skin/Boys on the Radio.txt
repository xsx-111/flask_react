Boys on the Radio Lyrics
Do what you want
Cause I'll do anything
And I'll take the blame
What's mine is yours
You can't have all of it
And I'll learn to beg

All the boys on the radio
They crash and burn
They fold and fade so slow

In your endless summer night
I'll be on the other side
When you're beautiful and dying
All the world that you've denied
When the water is too deep
You can close your eyes and really sleep tonight
Tonight

I want what's yours
Oh, I'd give anything
And I'll take the pain
I wait alone
For what will never come
And I'll throw it all away
All the boys on the radio
They crash and burn
They fold and fade so slow

In your endless summer night
I'll be on the other side
When you're beautiful and dying
All the world that you've denied
When the water is too deep
You can close your eyes and really sleep tonight
Your beauty blinds

If I let you in under my skin
And risen every angel slain

He said he'd never, ever, ever go
And heavens, heavens, heavens know
And never, ever, ever go away
Baby, I've gone away

In your endless summer night
I'll be on the other side
When you're beautiful and dying
All the world that you've denied
When the water is too deep
You can close your eyes and really sleep tonight
Your beauty blinds
I know what you are running to
Please come back
Oh, come back again
I hear the truth
It's coming from you
Oh, come back
Won't come back again

In your endless summer night
I'll be on the other side
When the water is too deep
I will ease your suffering
When the glitter fades in morning
Turn away and you will find my empty eyes
Your beauty blinds

I know that you are rotten to the core
I know that you don't love me anymore
I know that you are rotten to the coreEmbed
