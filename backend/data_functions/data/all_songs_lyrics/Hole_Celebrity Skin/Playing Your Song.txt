Playing Your Song Lyrics
Hey you, you're way ahead of me
You're drunk on apathy, you burned right out
Hey you, you're just a cripple now
We sell for millions now, they sold you out

And, oh, I had to tell them you were gone
I had to tell them they were wrong
And now they're playing your song

Hey you, don't take it out on me
You're bored of everything, you burned right out
Hey you, so bored and cynical
It's fucking wonderful, they sold you out

And, oh, they've bought and sold it all, it's gone
They've taken it and built a mall
And now they're playing your song

Ooh, their innocence tastes like candy, yeah
Get so fat on it, it's a tragedy, yeah
I can help you come to me, yeah
Just bring your innocence to me, yeah
Hey you, don't you dare blame me
You trusted everything, they sold you out
Hey, you, now when they call it cool
It's just so mean and cruel, they sold you out

And, oh, they bought and sold it all, it's gone
And every note of it is wrong
And now they're playing your song
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And, oh, they've bought and sold it all, it's gone
They've taken it and built a mall
And now they're playing your song

They're playing, playing your song
They're playing, playing your song
They're playing, playing your songEmbed
