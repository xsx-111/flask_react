Heaven Tonight Lyrics
Here comes the sun in the form of a girl
She's the finest sweetest thing in the world
Take you to heaven tonight
I feel the horses coming galloping
In the summer rain
Take you to heaven tonight
'Cause I love you for what you are

I'll gallop to you, tonight, tonight
We'll ride, I'll give it to you
We'll go to heaven tonight
Tonight

Out on the winding road I can't wait
Oh baby, I was afraid
Headed for heaven tonight
I'll go to heaven tonight
I feel the horses coming galloping
I will never grow old
I'll go to heaven tonight, oh
Because I love you for what you are

I'll gallop to you tonight, tonight
We'll ride, I'll bow down to you
We'll go to heaven tonight
Tonight
I can't believe that I could be happy
Summer will come again
I could be happy
Oh, stop your crying
You can be happy
Go to heaven when you make me happy

Here comes the kiss that I never had
Nothing feels like this
Headed for heaven tonight, ah, ah
I love you
Here comes a storm in the form of a girl
She's the finest sweetest thing in the world
I'll go to heaven tonight for what you are

I'll gallop to you tonight, tonight
We'll ride, I'll bow down to you
We'll go to heaven tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Take it tonight
Take it tonight
Take me tonight
Tonight
