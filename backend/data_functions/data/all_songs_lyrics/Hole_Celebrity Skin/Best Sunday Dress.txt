Best Sunday Dress Lyrics
Put on my best Sunday dress
And I walk straight into this mess of mine
Yeah, put on my best Sunday dress
And I walk straight into this mess

And watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, oh

Pale blue eyes, so young
Pale blue eyes, so far away
Watch me with his sorrow
Forgive me, all his pain

And I've come here to confess
To the wind and the rain and the glorious fame
And I've come here all undressed
For the numb and the dumb and they're all the same the name

Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, oh
Pale blue eyes, so dumb
Pale blue eyes, so far away
Take him to the river
Forgive us, all his pain

Ooh, ooh, I'm coming undone
He comes from the coal mine
I see you shine like a diamond
And curse us all goodnight

And put on my best Sunday dress
And I walk straight into this mess of mine
And I've come here all undressed
All the poison and pain and I take what is mine

And you burn, ah, ah
And you burn, ah

Pale blue eyes, so young
Pale blue eyes, so far away
Take me to his sorrow
Forgive us, all his pain
Watching you burn, ah, ah (put on my best Sunday dress)
Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, ah, ah (put on my best Sunday dress)
Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, ah, ah (put on my best Sunday dress)
Watching you burn, ah, ah
Watching you burn, ah, yeah (put on my best Sunday dress)

Put on my best Sunday dressEmbed
