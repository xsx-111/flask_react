Hit So Hard Lyrics
Put me up above the boy
The one I love, I should destroy
My sweet tooth has burned a hole
Forget about it all

He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

He's cold, give him a candycoat
He can't swim but he can float
One by one, they all fall down
I look at him and drown

He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

(I saw God) Just one big shiny flash
(God) Your secret's safe tonight
(God) So much, so much to lose
(God) So glad that we're alive
He's so candy, my downfall
Melts in my mouth 'till he's nothing at all
This keeps me, I can't sleep
He rages to be true

He hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

(I saw God) Just one big shiny flash
(God) Oh, set me straight tonight
(God) Look at the pretty lights
(God)

Oh, man, he hit so hard
I saw stars
He hit so hard
I saw God

I saw GodEmbed
