No Hope LyricsI've lived my life on the edge of a knife
And I can't give it up
In the fast lane of misery and pain
And I can't give it up
I've had a good time on the weeds and the wine
And I can't give it up
I've been up and down, below and above ground
And I can't give it up
And I can't give it up
Better under the table than under the ground
And I can't give it up
I like what I take, but my life's a mistake
And I can't give it up
It all went wrong the day I was born
And I can't give it up
I've tried to invest, but I was a mess
And I can't give it up
And I can't give it up
It's hard to refuse, when there is nothing to lose
And I can't give it up
I need to drink more, cause my life's such a bore
And I can't give it up
I've had my fill and I made out my will
And I can't give it up
I drink all I can cause it makes me a man
And I can't give it up
And I can't give it up1Embed
