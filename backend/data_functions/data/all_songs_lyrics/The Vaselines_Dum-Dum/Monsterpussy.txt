Monsterpussy LyricsMonsterpuss, monsterpuss
Meow, my monsterpuss
Monsterpuss, monsterpuss
Meow, my monsterpuss
I'm gonna skin it and wear it as a hat
On my head, everyday when it's dead
I'm gonna skin it and wear it as gloves
On my hands, everyday when it's dead
I'm gonna skin it and wear it as a scarf
Around my neck, everyday when it's deadEmbed
