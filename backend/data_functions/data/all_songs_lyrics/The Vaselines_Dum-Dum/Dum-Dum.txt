Dum-Dum LyricsI'm a real dum-dum, I'm a real son of a gun
I was born to run but I wanted to walk
I'm a real dum-dum, I even left my mom
Cause I get on my knees, and I do what I please
Dum-dum
Dum-dum
Dum-dum
Dum
Dum-dum
Dum-dum
I'm a real dum-dum, but I don't mind
I got a dum-dum girl, we're two of a kind
I'm a real dum-dum, I'm gonna find the sun
I'm gonna do what I want, everyday that I please
I'm a real dum-dum, just look at the fun
I'm gonna get my pics on Route 66
I'm a real dum-dum, hey, I don't care
If you wanted to know, I'm a don't-care-bearEmbed
