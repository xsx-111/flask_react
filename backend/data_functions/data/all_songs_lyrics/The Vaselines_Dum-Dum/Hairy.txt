Hairy LyricsI don't want to look like you
Greasy hair and ugly too
I just want to live in peace
To lie in bed and stay asleep
I don't need your company
I'm so hungry and I can't sleep
I'm real tired to even whine
So don't come up and offer man!
I can do without you
I've come this far on my own
I don't need any helping hand
Cause I'm, I'm a manEmbed
