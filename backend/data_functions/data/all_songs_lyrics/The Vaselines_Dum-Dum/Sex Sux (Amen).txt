Sex Sux (Amen) LyricsI was born of Original Sin
By a two-timing hustling virgin
Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
I'm the Sacred host, with the most
I was born on Christmas day
And all my people turned me away
They said I'd be the one
Borrow the life of the chosen son
Doing the cross was not for me
Screw this life of chastity
I was born on Christmas day
And all my people turned me away
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I got one thing to say, SEX SUX AMEN!Embed
