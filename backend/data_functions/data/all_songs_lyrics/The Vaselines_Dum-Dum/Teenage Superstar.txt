Teenage Superstar LyricsI'm a teenage Jesus superstar without a mighty cross to bear
And when mom complains about my hair
I say hey mom I just don't care
I'm in hell and the angels cry cause I'm trying to sell my soul
And when mom complains about my clothes
I say hey mom leave me alone
Come on little girl, it's gonna be alright
Come on little girl, it's gonna be alright
I got one thing on my mind girl
I got one thing on my mind and I don't care
I'm a teenage Jesus superstarEmbed
