Slushy LyricsLong brown hair, eyes were green
Prettiest girl I've ever seen
And you'll never miss what you never had
Oh, you'll never miss what you never had
Long brown hair, eyes were gray
Tried and tried to stay away
And you'll never miss what you never had
Oh, you'll never miss what you never had
I do, I do
I really miss you
And if I'd only ask your name again1Embed
