Oliver Twisted LyricsOnce I had a friend called Oliver Twisted
Who used to think he was a brand and gifted
Stupendisly handsome, Beautifully smart
He had no heart
On his own he was all alone
He wanted more than he ever got
Once I had a friend called Oliver Twisted
Who took life so slow that he occasionally missed it
Permanently senseless, never on his brain
He had no brain
Once I had a friend called Oliver Twisted
Who lived on the edge or so he insisted
Inteligently careless, hated rock and roll
He had no soulEmbed
