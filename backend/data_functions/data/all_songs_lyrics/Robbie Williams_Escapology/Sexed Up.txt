Sexed Up Lyrics
Loose lips, sunk ships
I'm getting to grips
With what you said
No, it's not in my head
I can't awaken the dead day after day

Why don't we talk about it?
Why do you always doubt
That there can be a better way?
It doesn't make me wanna stay

Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut
Praying they won't stray
And we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

You say we're fatally flawed
Well, I'm easily bored
Is that okay?
Write me off your list
Make this the last kiss
I'll walk away
Why don't we talk about it?
I'm only here, don't shout it
Given time, we'll forget
Let's pretend we never met

Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut
Praying they won't stray
And we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away

Screw you
I didn't like your taste anyway
I chose you
And that's all gone to waste
It's Saturday, I'll go out and find another you

Why don't we
Why don't we break up?
There's nothing left to say
I've got my eyes shut
Praying they won't stray
And we're not sexed up
That's what makes the difference today
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
I hope you blow away
Blow away
Blow away
Just not todayEmbed
