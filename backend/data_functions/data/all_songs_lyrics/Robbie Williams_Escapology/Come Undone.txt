Come Undone Lyrics
So unimpressed but so in awe
Such a saint but such a whore
So self aware, so full of shit
So indecisive, so adamant

I'm contemplating, thinking about thinking
It's overrated, just get another drink and

Watch me come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I come undone
I come undone

So rock 'n roll, so corporate suit
So damn ugly, so damn cute
So well-trained, so animal
So need-your-love, so fuck-you-all
I'm not scared of dying, I just don't want to
If I stopped lying, I'd just disappoint you

I come undone
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
If I ever hurt you your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
And I'm your son
I come undone

So write another ballad
Mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday
Buy a yacht by Saturday
It's a love song
A love song
Do another interview
Sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities that I despise
And sing love songs
We sing love songs
So sincere
So sincere
They're selling razor blades and mirrors in the street
I pray that when I'm coming down you'll be asleep
The young pretend you're in the clouds above the sea
I've come undone
I am scum
Love your son
You've gotta love your son
You've gotta love your son1Embed
