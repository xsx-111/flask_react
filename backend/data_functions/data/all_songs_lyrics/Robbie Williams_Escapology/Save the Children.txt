Save the Children LyricsAhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Things got weird
Like a three year old with a beard
Like a vision of Britney Spears
Like a tuna always seared
Do you like it a lot?
Guess what's on the clock?
I'd rather fanny about on a yacht
Stop staring at the stars
Save the children
Save the children
Things got weird
Like a three year old with a beard
Like a vision of Britney Spears
Like a tuna always seared
Do you like it a lot?
Guess what's on the clock?
I'd rather fanny about on a yacht
Stop staring at the starsEmbed
