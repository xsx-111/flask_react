Love Somebody Lyrics
Always and forever, is forever young
Your shadow on the pavement, the dark side of the sun
Got to dream the dream all over and sleep it tight
You don't wanna sing the blues in black and white

And it's hope that springs eternal for everyone
If it ain't broke then break it
Oh, the damage done

Try and love somebody
Just wanna love somebody right now
There's just no pleasing me
Try and love somebody
Just want to love somebody right now
Lady, lay your love on me

Violet in the rainbow just melts away
There's not enough minutes in the hour or hours in the day
A song played in a circle that never skips a beat
A stranger in a country that I have yet to meet

And it's hope that springs eternal for everyone
Your lifetime in a second
All the damage done
Trying to love somebody
Just wanna love somebody right now
Guess there's just no pleasing me
I wanna love somebody
Just wanna love somebody right now
Lady, lay your love on me

It'll come in your sweet time, Lord
I've just got to let you in
The blind leading the blind, Lord
Getting underneath your skin
I can feel you in the silence
Saying let forever be
Love and only love will set you free

I wanna love somebody
Wanna love somebody right now
There's just no pleasing me
I wanna love somebody
Just wanna love somebody right now
Lady, lay your love on me

It'll come in your sweet time, Lord
I've just gotta let you in
The blind leading the blind, Lord
Getting underneath your skin
I can feel you in the silence
Saying let forever be
Love and only love will set you freeEmbed
