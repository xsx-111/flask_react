Cursed LyricsDig your polished nails into the dirt
Rip your skirt off, wipe the hurt off
You know it tears my heart out when you
Flirt with danger and any stranger
You're not as stupid as I look
Before I could read, you wrote the book
Cursed, since your birth dear
And your worst fears have all come true
Held my hand when I got my first tattoo
I was naked when it penetrated
Told everyone I'd slept with you
Thought you'd like it, knew you wouldn't deny it
St Peter's gonna be unfaithful
Tell God he's got a dirty angel
Cursed, since your birth dear
And your worst fears have all come true
Babe you're not the first here on earth dear
'Cause I'm still here and I'm cursed too
Cursed like you
Hush, baby sleep now
We all love you we always did
Cursed, since your birth dear
And your worst fears have all come true
Babe you're not the first here on earth dear
'Cause I'm still here
And I'm cursed too, cursed like you
Hush, baby sleep now
We all miss you, we always willEmbed
