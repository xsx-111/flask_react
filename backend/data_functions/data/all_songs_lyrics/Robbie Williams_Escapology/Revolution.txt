Revolution Lyrics
Dont fight the feeling, relax
Oh, child the knots' in your back
'Cause you've been holding on
I feel you when you're reaching out
I'll talk you through memories
Just keep breathing with me
It's time to hold my hand
And walk in to the revolution

When there's no one to touch
And you've been thinking too much
You only hurt yourself
When it's all about retribution
I see the pain in your face
And paying rent for the space
It's time to lead you on
Come on, into revolution

When you can't keep on keeping on
And everything you lean upon is all but gone
Everybody falls sometimes but love shines on
And on and on and...
With love in your eyes
And a flame in your heart
You're gonna find yourself some resolution
A million miles with one step
You'll find yourself there
Walking with the revolution

(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Talk about a revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Rockin' with the revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Taking you high, yeah

Oh, love lingers on
You're just feeling it wrong
I know you're tired but when it's time to sleep
You're gone forever
Make friends with your past
Then you can leave it at last
It's time to find yourself
Walking with the revolution
When you can't keep on keeping on
And everything you lean upon is all but gone (all but gone)
Everybody hurts sometimes but love shines on
And on and on and...

Time and tide's on your side
There's no need to hide
I feel your pain
Don't talk to me about evolution
A milion miles with one step
You'll find yourself there
When you're walking with the revolution
Walking the the revolution
A milion miles with one step
And you'll find yourself there
When you're walking with the revolution

(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Walking with the revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Can't warn you  the revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Get it on
It's all about resolution
Talk about the revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Talk about the revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Lead you on to the revolution
(Get it on get it on get it on get it on)
Talk about the revolution, babyEmbed
