NO FUN Lyrics
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun

Fuck my friends, they're gone
They all left one by one
And now that summer's done
They don't need no more fun
Yeah, I drive around on my own
I'm rich, but my A/C broke
Don't check no mail, no phone
And I tell them I'm not home

And I keep to myself
Fuck with no one else
And I know it's my fault
But I don't care
And I keep to myself
Who are you to pretend?
And I know it's my fault
It'll never end

Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Drive around on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
All they do is nothin'
Yeah, all my friends no—
(No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun)
Yeah, I can't get no sleep
I look so good in green
I run, I run, I run (I run, I run)
And I don't have no more dreams
I drive around on my own
Feel dead, but I feel my bones (My bones)
I hide out on my throne (My throne)
Open up, now my cover's blown
Yeah, now my cover's blown
Yeah, now my cover's blown
Oh, now my cover's blown
Oh, now my cover's—

Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Drive around on my own
Yeah, all my friends no f—
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Drive around on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
All they do is nothin'
Yeah, all my friends no—
No fun, no fun, no—
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun35Embed
