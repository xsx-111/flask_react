Rhapsody in Pink LyricsI spent the day under the water, today
I was a big pink ball at the bottom of the sea
The broad green sea
The fish came and looked at me
Looked at me at the bottom of the sea
There I was for all the fish to see
Sitting on the yellow sand at the bottom of the sea
The broad green sea
The sea is a big, green lens
The birds looked down at me
Sitting on the sand at the bottom of the sea
The broad green sea
And the waves rolled in
The waves rolled in
And I rolled in
The waves rolled out
And the waves rolled out
The waves rolled out and I rolled out
Back & forth
And back & forth at the bottom of the sea
The broad green sea
I spent the day under the water
I spent the night on the beach
I was beached
Beached!
Then I got bleached
Bleached!
Washed up
Bleached white as a bone
So...
So, that's my story
Sad but trueEmbed
