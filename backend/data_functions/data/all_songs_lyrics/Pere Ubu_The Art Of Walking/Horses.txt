Horses LyricsIn my heart
If that is where one feels
I surely feel
Your head lying back sending peals
Of laughter to ring a bell
The bell I ring to call you here to me
Telephone, telephone, please
Bring me news when I'm alone
If it can be done I would be very grateful
Is that a horse whose
Footsteps I hear approaching
On the run from some strange unknown danger
Or just my heart beating so noisily?
One never really knows
It's not too late to see
It's the sun I wait for in the morning
And the moon
I long to see setting in the evening
When night lies ahead
And day is through
I'll spend some time with youEmbed
