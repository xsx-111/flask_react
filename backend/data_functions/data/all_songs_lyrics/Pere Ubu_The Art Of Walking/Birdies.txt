Birdies LyricsI gotta get holda myself
I gotta pull myself up by my socks
I gotta grab myself by the collar and shake!
The birdies are singing
The birdies are saying what I want to say
Now watch this close
(Oh, I should say 'closely.')
Here we go!
The foot goes up
And the foot goes down
And so I move along
And actually get somewhere
Actually get somewhere
And when the feet
The big feet get tangled...
Bang!
And I fall down on the ground?
Well, I get back up
I get right back up!
A tree
A dog
A cat
A house
A car
Fireplug
Mailman
Dumpdee dump
Dumpdee da
Look at me!
I've got my feet on the ground
And my head in the air
And I'm moving along
The wind's going through
And my hair's standing straight out behind
And I'm moving along
I'm standing up
And I'm going Some-WhereEmbed
