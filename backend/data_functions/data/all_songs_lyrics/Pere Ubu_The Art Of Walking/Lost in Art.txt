Lost in Art LyricsGimme, gimme!
I'm cookin' now
I want shoes
And I'm gonna walk, walk, walk
Here I go. Listen to me!
Gimme, gimme!
I want it all, now
Now, I'm gonna sing sweet
Now, I'm gonna sing pretty now
Ooaaaaaah-oooo-oo!
I want more
I want my shoes
Tie 'em for me, please
Watch me go. I can feel it
Uh, gimme, gimme
I've sung my song
And I've beat my drum
I've sung my song
And I've beat my drum
Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Hey, where's everybody going?
Come back
Hey, wait a minute. I'm over here
I didn't mean it
Come on back
I didn't mean itEmbed
