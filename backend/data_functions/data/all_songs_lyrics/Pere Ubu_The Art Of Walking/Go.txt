Go LyricsHere's to the small things
Here's to the small things that give pleasure
Here's to the everyday things
Here's to the everyday things that bring a smile
My hands are complicated thoughts
My hands are complicated
But my feet just wanna go
Here's to the finer points
Here's to the finer points that mean everything
Here's to the details
Here's to the details that so often get overlooked:
The way one day fades into another;
The way simple desires get expressed
(What's the bus that goes by here?)
Here's to the best things
Here's to the things that give God pleasure
Here's to the things that make God smile
The small victories are big ones
And as one day fades to another
As the past fills up with failure
It all adds upEmbed
