Misery Goats LyricsDon't fret now
Don't be so tired
No mope, mope, mope-a-dope!
No, it's not as bad as all of that
Don't be no misery goat!
"How are ya?"
"How are ya?"
"How are ya?"
I could cry
I could just cry
Oh, the tears fall down
(I've got one bright hope.)
(I've got one ride home.)
I sang three songs and marched around
Marched around
Marched around
I sang three songs and marched around
Looka here
Here comes the poetry!
"I'm a cave with the wind inside."
"I'm a shell with the sound of the surf inside!"
What?!
What's the point, hunh?
Don't be no misery goat!
(I've got one bright hope.)
(I've got one ride home.)Embed
