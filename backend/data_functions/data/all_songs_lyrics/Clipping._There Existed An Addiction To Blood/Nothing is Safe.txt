Nothing is Safe Lyrics
Everyone safe and sound; this how family do
Only homies around, everyone here is crew
Somethin' foul in the air, somethin' feelin' askew
Wind is in the pipes, is that whistle callin' for you?
Don't holler; it's cool
Windows boarded and sealed, doors are bolted and locked
Product cookin' on pace, weaponry fully stocked
Bodies sleepin' in shifts, other bodies keep watch
Bullets are for anybody caught runnin' up in the spot, the pop, the pop
Drop the lights, so drop low, something shot from the trees
Went straight through the front door, homie drop to his knees
Blood seepin' from his neck, as he struggle to breathe
Wooden floors stained wet, gets soft the more that he bleeds, he leaves, believe

Didn't no one summon what was comin'
But it creepin' on a come up
Now it's right up in your face
Face it, let it resonate up in your bone a minute
When you shiver, make a sliver
Big enough for it to have a space
Ripped life slipping away
Maybe you can make it out with just a little bit of grace
But it truly doesn't give a fuck about the fear you feelin'
It is here to make you understand that nothing is safe
Nothing is, nothing is safe
Nothing is sacred
Nothing is safe, nothing to pray for, nothing is safe, nothing is
Nothing is

Cut the light and stay low; all is quiet and still
Peerin' through the window, starin' over the field
Scent of death in the air, nothing out there looks real
Close the homie's eyes, now is not the time to be feelin', really load up
Furniture to the walls, barricade you inside
Lose the lights in the hallways, everyone gon' be fine
Phone that no one should call starts to ringin' one time
All the homies' eyes slide to it then the walls split from the outside
The air rushes in; it's cold as fuck, bullets slappin' like hail, more homies struck down
The mission has failed; the wood is split, splintered chandelier falls and smashes hard
Glass and steel everywhere in every throat, screams in protest
You all are dyin', and really will anyone care?
Truth, like death, comes for everyone

Barely had to summon what was comin'
It was creepin' on a come up
Now it's right up in your face
Face it, let it resonate up in your bone a minute
When you shiver, make a sliver
Big enough for it to have a space
Ripped life slipping away
Maybe you can make it out with just a little bit of grace
But it truly doesn't give a fuck about the fear you feelin'
It is here to make you understand that nothing is safe
Nothing is, nothing is safe
Nothing is sacred
Nothing is safe, nothing to pray for, nothing is safe
Nothing is
Nothing is

Death is comin' for you, but you already knew that
Thought the clique up brought you some safety up in this pack
But that didn't add up, back up, stand up, strike a pose
With your gat up, that's what they like, you suppose
They gon' rack up, stack up that stuff that you stole
But the fact of status wrapped up in black cold
Caskets cannot be ignored; runnin' so fast should had an award
Homies got gassed for cash from that score
Y'all could have made a dash just after one more
So your foot up on the gas and smash 'round the corner
Only one man was sent to the coroner
Wasn't part of the plan, but damn, the fast foreign
Whip was too quick to flip and fast-forward
The past smashed every wall, pillar and floorboard
Ashes to ashes, dust in the lung
Fire now on everything, gasoline been poured
Last piece of action 'fore you succumb
Just catch a glance of what could have done this
Somethin' 'bout how he walks remind you of someone
You look and see a gun, a man with no face
A golden halo that could be the sun
Long ago, you summoned what was comin'
It was creepin' on a come up
Now it's right up in your face
Face it, let it resonate up in your bone a minute
When you shiver, make a sliver
Big enough for it to have a space
Ripped life slipping away
Maybe you can make it out with just a little bit of grace
But it truly doesn't give a fuck about the fear you feelin'
It is here to make you understand that nothing is safe

Nothing is, nothing is safe
Nothing is sacred
Nothing is safe, nothing to pray for, nothing is safe, nothing is
