Story 7 Lyrics
Kimberly couldn't believe what she was seeing
Video was grainy but she could make out his face
It clearly had to be Steve
Hadn't seen him in maybe, what?
It couldn't be more than a couple days
Who was this bitch on her knees?
She was not even pretty, fuck
He better not still be up in her place
She fishing 'round for her keys
Check the lock, it is broken in
Impatiently, a scowl on her face
Kimberly opens the door
She wasn't ready, drops the keys
Drops to the ground and tries to catch her breath
Steve was still there on the floor
What was left of him, gnarled bone
The body parts are piled in a mess
How easily she ignored
All of the scratches, could be nails or could be teeth
Certainly not a knife
She should have looked at the floor
Follow blood to the window sill
Where it went up and out into the night

Cynthia strolling through the moonlight
Casually wiping the blood from the corner of her mouth
Cynthia knew Steve wouldn't do right
From the moment when he had said that he wouldn't eat her out
Cynthia singing on a blue night
Temporarily satisfied but she knew that wouldn't last
Cynthia steps into the Brew Right
Thirsty for a drink and to find someone to help hours pass
After Randy had sent the photos
He decided that he had just earned a drink
Shit, he's celebrating the end of a horrible case
He never had to see that woman Kimberly ever again
He thinks, shit, he had completed the task that was simple enough
She knew her man was cheating like they always do
She only needed proof
So he got to tailing the brown Chevrolet
And he'll say this for Steve, he knew what he was doing
So good that he almost got away with all of his bullshit
But Randy wouldn't get paid, and let's face it
He needed every dollar that this little job could make
The bookies were calling with more regularity
He would rather keep his kneecaps still unbroken
Thank you, if it's all the same, shit
Nothing had changed, he was the definition of in a rut
Anyway, job well done, he saunters on into the Brew Right pub
The spot pretty jumpin', he spies a seat at the bar
Orders the scotch and then feels a gentle hand on his back
And he turns to meet the eyes of a woman
Who tells him her name is

Cynthia, cross-legged at the bar now holding up a drink
Wink, lips
Cynthia whispers and his heart now takes another beat
Think, skips
Cynthia, tongue along his ear now, maybe he should pay
The tab
Cynthia knows just where to go now, and they leave and hail
A cab
He say, is this the type of thing where he pay?
And if so, he gon' need a rain check (check, check)
She say, "You can have this one for free, bae"
As she licked the lips and started bitin' on his neck
He say what's crazy 'bout this, between the bites and the kisses
Is he ain't been in a taxi since back when he lost his sister
But Cynthia isn't listenin' to him, she on a mission
The moon is full and she hurtin', and he might be the prescription
And now she pullin' up her dress, and he grabbin' on her breasts
And she start to see the throbbin' in his veins
And she get ready for the s—
But just then the cabbie pulled the taxi over quick
Click, pop-pop, silver flashes mixed with red and that was it

Cynthia is choking on her blood now
The cabbie walks off into the night unseen while
Cynthia, still locked in Randy's hug now
'Cept for the oaken window high above the scene and
Cynthia looks straight into her doom now
Little 'Trina watches everything that happens down below
But doesn't scream and
Cynthia is howling at the moon now
Tomorrow, 'Trina's gonna wake up
Wondering if it was really all a dream
Cynthia
