Run for Your Life Lyrics
Way too Hollywood to be in Hollywood (Shh)
You done did it now
Heard the dope was good and, well, a hood's a hood, fuck (Shh)
You gon' get it now
They said she gon' get you, right? They said she got all the juice
They said keep her happy though or she'd be coming after you
But shit, you get invincible when you get high
And them sticky fingers never stopped to wonder why
So now you sprintin' by that fish market tryin' to make it to summer
The blood in the ears is drumming, the heart is a cable jumper
The brain is flippin' the language, the lungs are probably toast
But everybody who ever stopped runnin' is now a ghost
You ain't seen them headlights in a minute so it might be cool
Night is fallin' gently and there ain't no one in sight for you
Stop trippin', stop trippin', stop trippin', but don't stop movin', ho
Not givin' the visions a minute to make a move, let's go

Ho, get it right, get out of sight
She on the street, run fo' your life
Don't you know that she ain't 'fraid to shoot?
You ain't scared, is ya?
You fucked up and she comin' for you
You ain't scared, is ya?
Ho, get it right, get out of sight
She on the street, run fo' your life
Don't you know that she cut you for fun?
You ain't scared, is ya?
If she comin' fo' you, better run
You ain't scared, is ya?
Turnt into a alley quick, just a wall that's made of brick
With a dirty mattress leaning up against, it smell like piss
Big green dumpster to the right, color rusted, look like wine
Lid is heavy, but it's creakin' open, that'll do just fine
Bags of trash with bites took out, coffee grounds are spillin' down
Duck and slam, the lid close, damn, that metal echo hella loud
Quiet, sit, the plastic swish with every tiny move or twitch
Liquid all across the bottom, probably 'bout a quarter inch
Shiver all up in the bones, the body feelin' crazy
Face is streaked with tears and dirt, the vision goin' hazy
Fuck it, it's too dark to see, cannot cry and can't be weak
It's a code of honor, gotta keep it gangster in the streets
OG (OG), OG, OG (OG), OG, oh Jesus
Slap that Koopsta all day, you knew just how this would be
This the devil's playground, ain't for play, but you was born into it
Now far in the distance creepin' up is that underground music

Ho, get it right, get out of sight
She on the street, run fo' your life
Don't you know that she ain't 'fraid to shoot?
You ain't scared, is ya?
You fucked up and she comin' for you
You ain't scared, is ya?
Ho, get it right, get out of sight
She on the street, run fo' your life
Don't you know that she cut you for fun?
You ain't scared, is ya?
If she comin' fo' you, better run
You ain't scared, is ya?
It's La Chat, the killer, the murderer, the bitch they love to hate
Yeah, you tried to run, but I caught you, you know it's no escape
Burn up both your legs, split your head, but yeah, your mouth alright
Throw your garbage ass in the dumpster and now shit on your grave
Blood, I'm so addicted to blood, I'm cuttin' your body up
Never know your name, your remains is scattered through the mud
Yeah, they should have warned you, La Chat, bitch, man, she don't give a fuck
Put you in the ground and relapse, gon' dig yo' ass back up
Ain't no word, I had 'em psychotic, you haters gotta die
Schizophrenic bipolar bitch, I'll feed my pits yo' ass
Drama queen, I'm bringing this drama, don't fuck with me, I'll hunt you
Cut you up like meat, take yo' kids, a very tasty luncheon
Body you bitches for fun, punch a big hole through your lungs
Cut out your muhfuckin' tongue, bury you real quick and we're done
Boostin' up the murder rate, Hannibal Lecter your face
Chainsawed your rib cage, another missing person case, ho

Ho, get it right, get out of sight
She on the street, run fo' your life
Don't you know that she ain't 'fraid to shoot?
You ain't scared, is ya?
You fucked up and she comin' for you
You ain't scared, is ya?
Ho, get it right, get out of sight
She on the street, run fo' your life
Don't you know that she cut you for fun?
You ain't scared, is ya?
If she comin' fo' you, better run
You ain't scared, is ya?2Embed
