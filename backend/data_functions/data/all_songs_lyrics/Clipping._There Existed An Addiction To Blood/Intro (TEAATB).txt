Intro (TEAATB) Lyrics
Mack like you don't remember the cash and the money
The mad dash after the ball had dropped
Dolphin turned tail on you right then and the water was hot
Boiling oil, separating all the good stuff to the top
And then the bottom fell out and the bodies hit the flo'
Same old, bare face and body while you come pay-rollin'
Everybody rockin' that halo back in the day, but they know, say no mo'
The ghost of bitches and chickens come home to roost
And every stitch that was put in this hitch got thread that's connected to the truth
And demons seekin' freedom out here weavin' the quilt
And there may even be some meaning gleamin' in the streets that they built
On top of dead bodies in the olden days when the pen was a quill
And blood was the ink upon which all them scary stories were built
How you liken love and join to a meal and think that there would be the end of the deal?
Fucker, they're real, skinwalker, don't give a fuck how you feel
They eat pieces of meat like you for breakfast, get it?
So deal with it, the steel ain't shit, moon is full, your silver chain is beautiful
And you the fool who never seen the light of day anyway
Any day anybody could pass, monsters out here just as passionate as men out for cash
Bloodsucker ain't never been a big enough figure to give a fuck
The trigger's up, cross your heart, give it up-Embed
