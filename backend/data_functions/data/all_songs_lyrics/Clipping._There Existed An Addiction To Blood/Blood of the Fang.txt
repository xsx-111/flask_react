Blood of the Fang Lyrics
By the Christians, it is written that in the black Myrthian age
There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood, blood

Drink it up
Fifty years 'bout enough
Time to come back (Blood, blood)
They want to call the bluff
Okay, then
Time to come back (What up!) (Blood)
Hail King Huey
Do it for fluid, you knew it was movin' forever
Loop it, the truth is, the movement was really too clever
Who is the newest to do it, pursuing a useless, polluted agenda?
Too long to get they bullshit together
Fifty years 'bout enough (Blood)
Patient, gave 'em a two-year grace
'6-6 came, and they saw the true face
Black on black on black, irate
Had 'em all runnin' scared straight out the gate
Skin do show you who kin; that's it, though
What's inside never been too simple
Syrup, he sip, 'cause he can't taste his own (Blood)
Drink it up, drink it up, you belong in every milliliter of
They tried to take out every military leader, but
You was born to be a martyr
And it doesn't mean a thing because that body really meat
Fill it up, your history is one you might consider killing for
This ain't the shit they taught you when you went to kindergarten
What you need to know is in the (Blood)
Queen Angela done told y'all, "Grasp at the root"
So what y'all talkin' 'bout—"Hands up, don't shoot"?

Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Look back, blood on the ground
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Look straight, they still shootin'
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Jump back, still here
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Now, what that tell you 'bout death?
Death ain't shit, you got to

Drink it up, drink it up
(There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood)
Drink it up, drink it up
Drink it up, drink it up
(There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood)
Drink it up, drink it up

Fist in the sky if you ready
Dice a ofay like confetti, they thought you was playin'
Though really the game was more trainin'
There finna be (Blood)
And much of it blue
Time to fly, 'cause you know time fickle
So cold, finna snow, swing a icicle
Takin' out a police or a politician issuing a statement sayin'
Turn it on a dime or get the nickel
And it ain't just money, B, this ain't honey
Sweet, but it's funny to think of them wantin' to speak
When this pain is deep and ingrained in (Blood)
Drink it up, dress it down
Queen shit, wear the crown, King shit, wear the wounds
New blood in the wombs
Loose noose, clear the tombs, bubblegoose, suede shoes
Lookin' like a who's who of the dead
Come back, bust a head, run track to the red
Black suit, black hair, black wings, black stare
Blackout for the (Blood) (Button up, bruh)
Actin' a fool was just acting
You knew about adapting since dudes started tappin'
And in the dark, flapping the full moon
Asking if you knew the passion that grew when unmasked
Because they were never seein' the basics
Geronimo, Erika, Gregory
With they faces in every book, record, or CD
Even made the MP3s laced with (Blood)
Brother Malcolm done told y'all, "By any means"
So what y'all talkin' 'bout—"All on the same team"?

Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Look back, blood on the ground
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Look straight, they still shootin'
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Jump back, still here
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Now, what that tell you 'bout death?
Death ain't shit, you got to

Drink it up, drink it up
(There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood)
Drink it up, drink it up
Drink it up, drink it up
(There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood)
Drink it up, drink it up

Everybody wanna kill a movement 'fore the moment
But they cannot kill what cannot die
There wasn't ever really an opponent
For what they figured was only three-fifth-human
And they thought they could enslave
By disconnecting from the truth
But look at Brother George
He's back again and never did look finer
Said it's time to gather up another meeting of the Ina
Said that Quentin couldn't kill him and America can't either
And he been sleepin' since '71
Ain't it time to feed, or at least sip a little sum'n?
He up in the Cadillac with little Bobby Hutton
Ridin' shotty with the shotty, swoopin' up the cousins
They soo-woopin' for your blood
That Bobby Seale is on the door
When they regroup up at the club
And Brother Eldridge is keepin' souls on ice
'Til the time was just right, now suffices
Emory got the scene drawn up nice
And Afeni here with Pac, yep, thug life
Kathleen, "Black and Beautiful" as the motto
Assata up in here sippin' a bloody café cubano
With Hilliard on the seat next to her babysittin' the ralo
Waitin' for Heron to say somethin' fly for them all to follow
Into the night, let it swallow, eyes on the sparrow tomorrow
You know the marrow is hollow and light as air
And the call is out to the rest
And this model of effervescence when all of it manifested
They never bothered to question
While calling for the arrest and murder
Guess they never knew it was a test
To best assess the way to move in
And digest the flesh of every wicked human
'Til the best and blackest blood is back to ruling
Prince Stokely done told y'all, "Have no fear"
So how come every time they be like, "Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!"
Y'all look scared?

Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Look back, blood on the ground
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Look straight, they still shootin'
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Jump back, still here
Aw deeyanga, aw deeyanga
Now what that tell you 'bout death?
Death ain't shit, you got to

Drink it up, drink it up
(There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood)
Drink it up, drink it up
Drink it up, drink it up
(There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood)
Drink it up, drink it up
Drink it up, drink it up
(There existed an addiction to blood, blood, blood, among its people)6Embed
