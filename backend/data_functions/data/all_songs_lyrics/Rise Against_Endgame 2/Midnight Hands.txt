Midnight Hands Lyrics
Like a new day rising, like a calm before the storm
Like fog lifting from valleys on a sleeping forest floor
Eyes open slowly as the dust is shaken off
To gaze upon the wreckage that the midnight hands have wrought

And now I, I feel my temperature rising
My body explode
I feel like somebody's watching
Like I'm not alone
I stopped, I vowed right then and said

Whatever path you take
Wherever you might go
Whenever you decide to leave
I will follow, I will follow

We face a crossroad never knowing what's in store
There's an angel on my shoulder
There's a devil at my door
She proclaimed, "Tonight will be the greatest of our lives"
And I said, "Don't be so sure, let's just wait until the morning light"

Whatever path you take
Wherever you might go
Whenever you decide to leave
I will follow, I will follow

There in the clearing we gathered close
Under the moon's pale light, we laid out the tools
"You don't have to do this. But I forgive you if you don't"
She just looked away and said "I know."

Gripped by the midnight hands
We cradle futures they would prevent
Gripped by the midnight hands
The line's crossed over
The dawn grows closer
Let's bite off too much
Let's jump with a blind trust
In water over our heads

Whatever path you take
Wherever you might go
Whenever you decide to leave
I will follow, I will follow
I won't bet on the falls you take
I won't let go if you start to stray
I'll be there until you don't wake up, yeah
I will follow, I will follow I will follow

Whatever path you take I will follow
Wherever you might go I will follow
Whenever you decide to leave I will followEmbed
