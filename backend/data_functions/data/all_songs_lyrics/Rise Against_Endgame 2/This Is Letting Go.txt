This Is Letting Go Lyrics
Once upon a time I could take anything, anything
Always stepped in time, regardless of the beat
I moved my feet, I carried weight
What I could not do I faked
I dug, seeking treasure
Just to wake up in an early grave
So I stopped right there and said...

Go on alone because I won't follow
This isn't giving up, no, this is letting go
Out with the old dreams I've borrowed
The path I carve from here on out will be my own
The path will be my own

This is the part where the needle skips
And the chorus plays like a sink that drips
A syllable repeating like a warning we aren't heeding
Until all of the sudden we notice it
When the wheels brace and the tires grip
A map we've been misreading, a defeat we're not conceding
Until now
There must be some other way out

The wind died, the whole world ceased to move
Now so quiet, her beating heart became a boom
We locked eyes for just a moment or two
She asked why, I said "I don't know why, I just know."

Go on alone, cause I won't follow
This isn't giving up, no this is letting go
I made most of all this sorrow
I tried to brave this discontent, but now I'm through
I'm letting go of you
This is letting go
This is letting go
Once upon a time I could take anything, anything3Embed
