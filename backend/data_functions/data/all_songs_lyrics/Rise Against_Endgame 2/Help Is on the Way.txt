Help Is on the Way Lyrics
I have my mother's dreams, I have my father's eyes
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try
The Crescent City sleeps, while giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash, let loose a mighty cry
Can nobody save us? Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning, the cypress has died
And all alone they're saying

Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way
Five thousand feet below, as black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes, eleven mothers cry
My bones all resonate a burning lullaby
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try
She stands at the shoreline with hands in the air
Her words pierce the dark night, "does anyone care?"
And all alone they're saying
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here

Choking on the black gold, upon which we rely
We keep axes in the attics to see cameras in the sky
"Help is on the way" they said, they said
"Help is on the way" they said, they said
We were told just to sit tight
Cause somebody will soon arrive
"Help is on the way"
But it never came
It never came

Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way5Embed
