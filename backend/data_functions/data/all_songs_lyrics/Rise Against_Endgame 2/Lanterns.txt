Lanterns Lyrics
This night will fall like any other
Daylight subsides and shadows crawl out from under
Black corners hiding, something stirs, all so restless
Cracked windows open wide
Dead-bolt turns, doors creak open
Whispers and moonlight there to guide

Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night?
We'll dance like heathens 'round a flame
While the world sleeps we are awake

The black bird calls, it sings a chorus
While the gathering swells, the flames grow tall right before us
As drums keep pounding and the masses now are fusing
Bodies pressed and tangled
As we revel in confusion
Our inhibitions thrown into the fire

Come raise your lantern to the sky
Can we illuminate this night?
We'll dance like heathens 'round a flame
While the world sleeps we are awake
Here in the dark we are safe from the judgement
Now arm in arm locked tight so no one gets in
The Heaven-sent say, "Child, you are hellbent."
But Hell is not where we're going, Hell's where we've been

Come raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens 'round a flame
And while the world sleeps, we are awake
Raise your lantern to the sky
And let's illuminate this night
We'll dance like heathens around the flames
While the world sleeps, we are awake

(Raise your lantern to the sky) Yeah, we are awake
(Hey, hey)
We are awake
(Now raise your lantern to the sky) Yeah, we are awake
We are awake (Hey, hey)
(We! Are! A)6Embed
