The Celestials LyricsOn the day that you were born
They built an empire off a scream
I can’t explain
Endlessly they’ll set you free
Give you reason to believe
This empty place
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
‘Til the end
‘Til the end
‘Til the end
I’m gonna love you 101 percent
I’m gonna love you ‘til this ends
Take a chance if you should go
Face upon your happy home
The scanners wait
Selfishly they might concede
You were always on your own
You can’t escape
I may seem unafraid
And I may seem unashamed
But I will be special k
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even when their numbers draw you out
Everything I want is free
You’re not me and never ever will you ever be
I’m gonna find you and never run against
I’m gonna find you ‘til the end
‘Til the end
‘Til the end
Never let the summer catch you down
Never let your thoughts run free
Even while their numbers call you out
Everything I want is free
Everything I want is free
Everything I want is free
Everything I want is free
Free you’re free with me
Free you’re free with me
Free you’re free with me
You’re free with me oh oh1Embed
