Oceania LyricsNo one can love you, 'cause no one can free you
Lovers can’t touch you, 'cause lovers might reach you, yeah
I’m so alone, so alone
But better than a wretched world, better than a broken pearl
I’m so alone, so alone
But better than I ever was, better than a just-laid cause
Night may keep you sworn
May bring you storms, from chest to stern
The journey’s blessed; the warning's circumspect
With dreams I’ve had..with dreams I’ve had
And still she’s gone..and still she’s gone
Night will fill your rest, negate your best
With dreams I’ve had..with dreams I’ve had
Oh, would I follow you?
How could I have ever doubted you?
Sweet baby, nurture me
Sweet lady, if you please
Try the way on me..try the way on me
Try the way on me..just try the way, on me
Skirt the cliffs of your illusion
Find the faith on me
My mistake as the last remaining soldier
Was to take the place of you
Love the way..love the way and learn
Try the way; cast off your indecision
Face-to-face, we breathe
Try the way; cast off your indecision
Face-to-face, we breathe3Embed
