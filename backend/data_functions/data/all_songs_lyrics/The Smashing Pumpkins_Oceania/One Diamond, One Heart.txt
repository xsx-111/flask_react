One Diamond, One Heart LyricsI’m not here to hold your hand
I’m just here to understand
If you’re feeling low, I can help
I’m always on your side
Forever near your light
I’m always on your side
However you must fight
Within your darkest night
I’m always on your side
Lovers as lonely as lanterns lost
Show me faith’s real cost
I’m always on your side
Forever near your light
I’m always on your side
Wherever you must fight
Within your darkest night
I’m always on your side
They won’t rush you from me
‘Cause here I’ll always be
I’m always on your side
Forever near your light
I’m not here to hold you down
I’m just here to love you when
Your stars align and you let me
And your heart win
I’m always on your side
Forever near your light
I’m always on your side
Lover, teach me, sweet command
Show me where I land
I’m always on your side
I’m always on your side
Forever near your light
I’m always on your side
However you must fight
Within your darkest night
I’m always on your side
With evidence of trust
And eminence of love
I’m always on your side
Capitulate and fade
Resurrect and break
I’m always on your side
Forever in your light
I’m always on your side
Lover, light the way..3Embed
