My Love Is Winter Lyrics
Lonely draw
Sides grow dimmer
Spellbound all
I waste the hour
My love is winter
My love is lost

Silent fog
Let’s pass and wither
From the cold that saws me flat
My love is winter
My love is lost

There is love enough for the both of us
There is more than prayers made
To be with you
My love is lost
My love is winter
My love is lost
My love is winter
There is love enough for the both of us
There are more than prayers of you
Sacred hold in my mirror
Were you told there is no rest?
My love is winter
My love is lost


There is love enough for the both of us
There is love enough
There is love
There is love enough for the both of us
There is love enough
There is love
There is love, love, love…2Embed
