Inkless LyricsThe stars are out tonight
And what you need of me you’ve got inside you
Just take me home, take me home, don’t fight
But drive me home the wrong way
No loss spared
For losing you ain’t right
You haunt where
Spritis take their time
It’s time I can’t seem to fight
The stars are out for us
And what you feel for me rides beside you
Just take me home, take me home
Don’t fuss
But drive me home the right way
We’ll uncover there’s no other faith but us
A faith in love unseen

Trace the face of love unseen
Don’t shadow up what we mean
Uncover what we’re meant to be
And come unlace your light
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out
The stars are out tonightEmbed
