Pinwheels LyricsMother moon
Mistress of the sun, say
I got you, I got you
Sister soul
Lovers of the tune, sing!
I got you, I got you, I got you
Floating away I think I’ll stay as refused
Floating away I think I’ll stay blue-black
Floating away I think I’ll change next to you
Finding a way to make the loss seem new
Cause you don’t deserve me
But I deserve you
Mother moon
Mistress of the sun, say
I got you, I got you
Sister soul
Lovers of the tune, sing!
I got you
I got you
Mother moon
Mistress of the sun, say
I got you, I got you, oh I’ve got you
I got you, I’ve got you mother moon
Floating away I think I’ll stay as refused
Finding a way to make the loss seem new
Floating away I think I’ll change next to you
Finding a way to make the loss seem new
Cause you don’t deserve me
But I deserve you
Flies for the may queen
But life for the prince
If nobody wins
Then what gets lost?
If I’ve got youEmbed
