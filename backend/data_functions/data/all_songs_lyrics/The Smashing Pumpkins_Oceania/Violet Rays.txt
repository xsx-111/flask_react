Violet Rays Lyrics
Faithless moors
Pulling up your oars
From rivers I have crossed
In magic no heart's lost

And I'll leave with anyone this night
And I'll kiss anyone tonight
Am I the only one you see?
Raised from the path of revelry

Spells fall frail
Webs catching sail
In eternal eternities
Divine purpose catching free

And I'll leave with anyone this night
And I'll kiss anyone tonight
Am I the only one you see?
Seized from the wrath of revelry

Am I the only one you see?
Does love matter when loves the actor
For what you are after is me
Babe, don't leave me, please believe me
'Cause I'm so easy to know
Am I the only one you see?
Raised from the path of revelry
Am I the only one you see?3Embed
