Panopticon Lyrics
Rise! Love is here
Oh don’t make me wonder
Life’s never clear where choice is a gift
To use and abuse
To build on proof
Oh don’t make me suffer
Birds find the wind and wing
Rest in the shells I’ve designed
Run through the fields I’ve denied
And stroll upon the years I’m alive

There’s a sun that shines in
There’s a world that stares out at me
And all I refuse to please

Breathe! Love is air
Oh don’t make me suffer
To dash debonair where chaste is the wish
To bust with pain
A heart goes blank
Oh don’t make me wonder
To ask on behalf of you
Of you, where are you?
Of you, of you, where are you?
There’s a sun that shines in
There’s a world that stares out at me
And all I refuse to please

There’s a sun that shines in
There’s a world that stares out at me
And all I refuse
And all I’d ever use in me
There’s a sun that shines in me
There’s a sun that shines
There’s a sun that shines in meEmbed
