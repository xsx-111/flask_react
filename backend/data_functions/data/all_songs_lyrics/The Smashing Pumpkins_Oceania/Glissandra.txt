Glissandra LyricsFallen lovers and useless friends
Must you glare?
As life uncovers our unions pulled threadbare
Pleasure taps it’s vein
I’ve been hungry and I’ve been full
And I’ve been sated some more
I used to know what for
I used to know
All hours look the same
I used to know
What a wish was for
Magic plumes my soul
Pyramids for sale
Full moons on the rail
Pipers play for dawn
Hypnotized, unwind these lines around my head
What’s left for me to leave for you unsaid?
You can’t fill with dread
I’ve been hungry and I’ve been full
Molten at the spoke
I used to know what for
I used to know what for
La-la-la-la-la…
A pluck on spiders strings
Gutters form the stars
Children cry out proud
As embers blast my heart
Broken where I’d stop
I used to know
What a wish was for
I used to know
What a wish was for
Stolen like a lark
Flicks on tender wrists
Abuse the modern mind
Crush on what you’ll find
La-la-la-la-la…Embed
