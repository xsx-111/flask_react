Do It Like We Used to Do LyricsI hear that music play
Same as yesterday
I hear that music play
Makes me wanna do it again
Do you remember when
The DJ used to send
A melting honey bomb
Send it to my ears express
So drop it steadily
Push me astrally
'Cause when it touches me
You know my body starts to get possessed
So watch me come on through
'Cause then the music lives in you
I feel obliged to do
Do it, just do it like we used to do
Babe I wanna do it
Babe I gotta do it
Know we gotta do it
Do it like we used to do
Babe I wanna do it
Babe I gotta do it
Know we gotta do it
Do it like we used to do
Come on now do it, yeah
I wanna do it, got to do it
I wanna do it, got to do it
I wanna do it
Babe I wanna do it
Babe I gotta do it
Know we gotta do it
Do it like we used to do
Babe I wanna do it
Babe I gotta do it
Know we gotta do it
Do it like we used to do
I hear that music play
Same as yesterday
I hear that music play
It makes me wanna do it again
Do you remember when
The DJ used to send
A melting honey bomb
Send it to my ears express, oh yes
So drop it steadily
And push me astrally
'Cause when it touches me
My body starts to get possessed
Now watch me come on through
'Cause when the music lives in you
You feel obliged to do
Do it like you used to do
Babe I wanna do it
Babe I gotta do it
Know we gotta do it
Do it like we used to do
Babe I wanna do it
Babe I gotta do it
Know we gotta do it
Do it like we used to do
Babe I wanna do it
(Do it baby)
Babe I gotta do it

Know we gotta do it
