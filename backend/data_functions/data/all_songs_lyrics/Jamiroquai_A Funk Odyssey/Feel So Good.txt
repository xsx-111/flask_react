Feel So Good Lyrics
All flights for the Moon, Mars, Jupiter
And the outer galaxies
Of Alpha Centauri
Shuttle departs, 2.56 seconds

Feels good, I'm stranded on a spaceship hideaway
And something makes me think I'm here to stay
I'm so happy where I am
Feels good, I've journeyed to the other atmospheres
And every breath I take just makes it clear
I'm holding Heaven in my hands
It's automatic, baby

And it feels good
Well, it feels so good
Feels good
Well, it feels so good

Feels good, these extra-sensory sensations
Are causing me some complications
Electrostatic information
Ah, feels good, I'm playing with a pleasure trafficker
Arriving soon intergalactica
I'm holding Heaven in my hands
It's automatic, baby

And it feels good
Feels good
Feels good
Feels good
Well, it feels so good
Feels good
Well, it feels so good 

Feels good, I'm stranded on a spaceship hideaway
(All flights for the Moon, Mars, Jupiter
And the outer galaxies of Alpha Centauri
Shuttle departs, 2.56 seconds)


(All flights for the Moon, Mars, Jupiter
And the outer galaxies of Alpha Centauri
Shuttle departs, 2.56 seconds)
