Twenty Zero One LyricsTwenty zero one, where do I belong
I got my mind but I don't know where my head has gone
Twenty zero one, baby where you've been
It's pornographic, internet, traffic on my screen
Twenty zero one, she's just a maniac
It's not for me but my baby really needs a crack
Twenty zero one, don't want the sex to stop
I took a pill now it's killin' me to keep it up
Twenty zero one 
Twenty zero one 
Twenty zero one 
Twenty zero one, I know what's goin' on
You wanna take my soul and change it for another one
Twenty zero one, those liquid crystal eyes, they really suit you honey
Let me get them in your size
Twenty zero one, by twenty thirty two, you can be me
And with a little luck I can be you
Twenty zero one, let me bless you son
Help you believe with my semi-automatic gun
Twenty zero one
Twenty zero one
Twenty zero one
Twenty zero one, by twenty thirty two, you can be me
And with a little luck I can be you
Twenty zero one, by twenty thirty two, you can be me
And with a little luck I can be you
Twenty zero one, by twenty thirty two, you can be me
And with a little luck I can be you
I can be you
I can be you
I can be you
I can be youEmbed
