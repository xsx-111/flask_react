Picture of My Life Lyrics
I never had a dream that I could follow through
Only tears left to stain
Dry my eyes once again
I don't know who I am or what I'm gonna do
Been so long, I've been hopelessly confused

This can never really end
It's infinitely sad
Can someone tell me when
Something good became so bad
So if you have a cure
To me would you please send
A picture of my life
With a letter telling how
It should really be instead

The precipice is there
But will I ever dare?
Throw myself in the sky
So at last, I can die
See, I've become a man who
Holds nothing to do
Who will mind
If I just disappear?

Oh, tell me how it really should be
Yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
