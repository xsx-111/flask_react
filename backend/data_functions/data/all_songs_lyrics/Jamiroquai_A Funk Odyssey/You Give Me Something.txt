You Give Me Something Lyrics
When I met you, you were so unique
You had a little thing I'd love to keep
And every movement carried much mystique
I knew right then I'd carry on
To you I knew my heart belongs

You know, you, you give me something
Something that nobody else can give
And my heart started thumping
You know now you're the one I truly know I dig

Like the sunbeams from a perfect summer day
And heaven only seems a step away
When I'm with you, I just celebrate
I'm hoping my message gets through
There's never been someone like you
I had nobody but on you, I lean
Cause you got those little things that I
I know I've never seen

You know now, you, you give me something
Something that nobody else has got
And this love, that I've been wanting
Oh, babe, it's turning out to be too fast to stop
You know now, ooh, you give me something
Something that nobody else can give
See, my heart has started thumping
You know, babe, you're the one I truly know I dig
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something

Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
You give me something that nobody else can give (Ooh, well you give me, something)
You give me something that nobody else can give (Ooh, well you give me, something)
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something
Ooh, well you give me, something1Embed
