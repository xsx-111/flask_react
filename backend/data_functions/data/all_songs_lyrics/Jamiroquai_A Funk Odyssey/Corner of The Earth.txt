Corner of The Earth Lyrics
Little darlin' don't you see the sun is shining
Just for you, only today
If you hurry you can get a ray on you
Come with me, just to play
Like every humming bird and bumblebee
Every sunflower, cloud and every tree
I feel so much a part of this
Nature's got me high and it's beautiful
I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth

This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers splay
On the face of it I'm blessed when the sunlight comes for free
I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me

So inspired of that there's nothing left to do or say
Think I'll dream, 'til the stars shine
The wind it whispers and the clouds don't seem to care
And I know inside that it's all mine
It's the chorus of the breakin' dawn
The mist that comes before the sun is born
To a hazy afternoon in May
Nature's got me high and it's so beautiful, yeah yeah
I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth
You know that, this corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers splay
On the face of it I'm blessed when the sunlight comes for free
I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me
I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me
La-la-la la, la-la-la la, la-la-la la

This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers splay
On the face of it I'm blessed when the sunlight comes for free
I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me
I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me
Hey, I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me
I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me...Embed
