Little L Lyrics
There you were freaking out
Trying to get your head around
The fact that you and me and love is dead
See how I'm tripping out
'Cause you can't decide what you really want from me

Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
'Cause you make me love you, love you, baby
With a little L

There you were shouting out
Cranking up your altercations, getting upset in your desperation
Screamin' and hollerin'
How could this love become so paper-thin?
You're playing so hard to get
You're making me sweat just to hold your attention
I can't give you nothing more
If you ain't giving nothing to me
Don't you know that

You make me love you, love you baby
With a little L
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Seems like you're stepping on the pieces
Of my broken shell
'Cause you make me love, love you
With a little L, you know
That's the way you make me love you, yeah
Why does it have to be like this?
I can never tell
Cause you make me love you, love you, baby
With a little L
(Why does it have to be like this?)

You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you with a little L
You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you with a little L
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L, that's what you do
You make me love you with a little L4Embed
