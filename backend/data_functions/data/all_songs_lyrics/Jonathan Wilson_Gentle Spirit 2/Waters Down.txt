Waters Down LyricsModern world a nesting mystery
Turn it round turn it round
Wipe the sore from many recent memories
Turn it round turn it round
Waters down
Rivers down
Waters down
Rivers down
Here are people's cries
Peace we want to try
Waters down
Rivers down
Waters down
Rivers down
Waters down down down
Rivers down down down
Waters down down down
Rivers down down down
Natural world she needs our energy
Keep it round keep it round
Smallest world that anyone has ever seen
Love it lives love it lives
Waters down
Rivers down
Waters down
Rivers down
Waters down down down
Rivers down down down
Waters down down down
Rivers down down down
Hear my people's cries
Peace we want to tryEmbed
