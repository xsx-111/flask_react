Woe Is Me LyricsWoe is me
Woe is me
Flown down the river swimming in deep blue see
I've flown down the river swimming in deep blue see
Woe is me
Took a while but I've finally found that
I'm on my own see
Woe is me
Woe is me
Woe is me
And I don't like to find what a man is got to be
Now I don't like to find what a man is got to be
Woe is me
Took a while but I've finally found that
I'm on my own see
Woe is me
Woe is me
Woe is me
Yeah I know it's a sin but a villa dreamed where I am
I know it's a sin but a villa dreamed where I am
Woe is me
Took a while but I've finally found that
I'm on my own see
Woe is me, woe is me, woe is meEmbed
