Natural Rhapsody LyricsWhen we hear your friend of the road
Explaining your natural glow
We have been waiting completely
For every piece of your heart
And later when you're all alone
Let it rain down upon you
What you've always known
There is no defeat
Only kinks in your heart
And when you were a child
Space melted meadow made you smile
Indeed the natural rhapsody
And if you're still waking to life indigo
No water, no fire in your bungalow
Just whisper good friend
To the healers on high (they're working)
Sweet grasses of spring
In the biblical time
Shapes dance and echo for us
Many distant tomorrows await
And when you were a child
Silly bear for me made you smile
Indeed the natural rhapsody
We hear you're friend of the road
With your rebel demeanor and botanist tongue
Come closer we'll leave them
The shapes that we drew in are shifting
And when it's all said and done
We are but dust on the horizon
Indeed the natural rhapsody
The natural rhapsody
The natural rhapsodyEmbed
