Can We Really Party Today? Lyrics
Follow me down to the divine lakes
With the canopy over head
Lavender pick and dry
Keep the pillow for your head at night
Chase the wolf to the ragged river den
Where the stormy weather stays outside
The beaver still chops the pine
Everybody has a lovely time

But hey
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Shouldn't we get started today

But can you swing me back to North Carolina
Let me show you where the red tail flies
The north river slowly winds
Honey suckles on the vine
Follow me down into South Louisiana
Let me show you where the music lies
Swamp music dream dancing wine
Never keep it all inside
Wait, wait
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Shouldn't we get started today
Wait, can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going on
Can we really party today
With all that's going onEmbed
