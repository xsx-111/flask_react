Desert Raven Lyrics
Fuzzy white haze in the asphalt was a lake
And the sand it was a grayish shade of blue
Spirits held desire
While my eyes they did admire
The evening that we only thought we knew

Further out to see
I heard the birds wings over me
The vibrations in the air through my ears
The sun was rising slinking low
The day was saddled up to go
The desert's lonely nightfall disappear

The raven who flies through the desert sky
Is wiser than you or me
The birds have a peace
The stillness a sleeve
And the desert raven he has poetry

Close your eyes and fly to let the diamonds make the night
Crystal blue will turn to ruby red
The plants become a maze under the heavens stary hazel
Pegasus he gallops over head
The buffalo at night they follow close the river's edge while
Saffron slowly grows inside the cage
The starry minds of hyacinth the moon below the sun's eclipse
The sandy canyon floats beyond the wave

The raven who flies through the desert sky
Is wiser than you or me
The birds have a peace
The stillness a sleeve
And the desert raven he has poetryEmbed
