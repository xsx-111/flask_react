You Angel You LyricsYou angel, you
Your essence got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing
You angel, you
You're as fine as anything's fine
I just walk and watch you talk
With you memory of my mind
You know I can't sleep at night for trying
Yes I never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more and more
You angel, you
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
Is the way it ought to be
And oh, I can't sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more
You angel, you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I swear it would make me singEmbed
