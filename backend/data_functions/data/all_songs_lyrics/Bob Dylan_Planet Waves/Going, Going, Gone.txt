Going, Going, Gone Lyrics
I’ve just reached a place
Where the willow don’t bend
There’s not much more to be said
It’s the top of the end
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone

I’m closing’ the book
On the pages and the text
And I don’t really care
Oooh, what happens next
I’m just going
I’m going
I’m gone

I been hanging on threads
I have been playing’ it straight
Now, I’ve just got to cut loose
Before it gets late
So I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone
Grandma said, “Boy, go and follow your heart
And you’ll be fine at the end of the line
All that’s gold doesn't shine
Don’t you and your one true love ever part”

I been walking the road
I been living on the edge
Now, I’ve just got to go
Before I get to the ledge
So I’m going
I’m just going
I’m gone1Embed
