Half Manne Half Cocaine Lyrics

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Niggas will never learn
Yeah
There's some niggas that never learn
Yeah
Niggas that never learn

Bridges burn, tables turn
Fuck niggas, they will never learn (Never learn)
Not about an almighty dollar, it ain't my concern (Ain't my concern)
Who she gave that pussy to outside of me ain't my concern (That ain't my concern)
I just want head in a 458, that's what I deserve

Nigga, I deserve
Big old house and two thick bitches makin' grits
Leather seats in the new candy-painted whip
Bitch, I came out the womb on some gangster shit
Ho, I knew you was off, you could take a lick
Set him up with my bitch, we can fake a lick
I just broke up a brick on the East with the clique
Who you bangin' with? You know that me and Diego be takin' shit
Bridges burn, tables turn, fuck niggas never learn (Never learn)
Chicken dinner, watchin' SportsCenter when I whip a bird (Whip a bird)
Who she gave that pussy to outside of me ain't my concern (That ain't my concern)
I just want head in a 458, that's what I deserve

Nigga, I deserve
Big old house and two thick bitches bangin' out
They go pussy to pussy and mouth to mouth
We don't need 'em, we beat 'em and pipe 'em out
Snitch, you feed 'em and treat 'em and wife 'em out
At the plate, but that pussy, you strikin' out
Met the bitch that's defeating your bank account
I just turned my mom house to a powder house
Got that bitch powdered out

Bridges burn, tables turn, fuck niggas never learn (Never learn)
Chicken dinner, watchin' SportsCenter when I whip a bird (Whip a bird)
Bitch, I know who did the murder, that ain't none of your concern (Your concern)
I just want head in a 458, that's what I deserve (I deserve)


Shut the fuck up
Yeah, half man, half cocaine (Cocaine)
I just mixed the Tylenol with heroin (Heroin)
Junkies shoot some detergent in their fuckin' veins (Fuckin' veins)
Cradle to the grave, nigga, crime pays
Fuck with Mister K, put your face on one of them picture chains
Sugar Ray the fade or go John Wick with the pistol game
Bitch ain't crack the safe, got his moms hit with the pistol whip
Move like the Yakuza set trip, we clipping off fingertips
Bitch, crack numbin' up my fingertips
Pullin' strings with my pinkie rings, AR get you hit
I make fifteen jump like trampolines when that package sent
Now niggas want them methamphetamines, quick to suckin' dick
Suck a dick, for the dope up I was rushin' shit
Fuck the needle, she just puff and sniff, Snuffleupagus
I got strippers on my fuckin' list, fuck a bucket list
Black brains up in buckets, bitch, Michael Douglas, bitch
Half man, half cocaine (Yeah)
Sent sixty pounds of Walter White, to White Plains (That Walter White)
VVS the Prezi, Skydweller plain
Sit your five dollar ass down before I make change (I make change, nigga)
Pay for your funeral, get your shit arranged
Kiss your wife and say, "You were solid," then go piss on your grave
Hold that, lock the doggy up with Similac
Fuck rap, blood movin' ounces on the Cash App, blatt
Half man, half cocaine
I just hit a bank and did the David Blaine
One foot in the booth, one in the fuckin' cage
If I wrote my raps, you'd be a slave to my fuckin' page
Freddie Kane
Half man, half cocaine
Half man, half cocaine
Half man, half cocaine
