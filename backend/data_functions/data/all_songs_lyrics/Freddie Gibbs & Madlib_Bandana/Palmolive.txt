Palmolive Lyrics
It's gon' speak for us
It should speak for itself, you know what I mean?

Kane season
Fucking my pastor daughter in two Jesus pieces (Yeah)
Dropping this blow on the basement floor, my Yeezys squeaking (Yeah)
Repping the fin, I pledge allegiance, undefeated
Fuck the forty acres and the mule, they gave us niggas the evils
Hot pots, spoons, and needles (Yeah)
Sold a piece of crack to polices, Mario Van Peebles (Uh)
Serving every prom queen and pookie with that vanilla smoothie (I was prom queen)
Scary Gary, my nigga, my neighborhood something like Fallujah (Yeah)
Vladimir banana clip, move with Russian collusion shooters (Uh)
Fuck a track, ho, selling that pussy on computers (Yeah)
Pimpin'll never die, Chad Butler in Heaven chuckin' deuces (Hold up)
Trunk of deuce of hard white fish, then I made a wish (Yeah)
A smoker scrubbin' down my kitchen, I'm never gon' wash a dish (Yes)
It's Mr. Clean, Pine-Sol, all Palmolive (Yeah)
These niggas don't know how hard you ridin' for they ass 'til you park it (Skrrt)
In 1998, I sold a Glock 19 chopper
2018, I'm finna reclaim my fucking time and cop the Rollie flooded
Maxine Waters, fuck your poison, keep your vaccines off us
We got a reality star in the goddamn office, quite like the Reagan days (Yeah)
Fernando said they used to move chickens in the Noriega days (Yeah)
I disrespect his name and he signed my face with a razor blade (True story, nigga)
Baby Tony, top of the family like Johnny Sacrimoni (Yeah)
Choppin' up this block white top in some Yohji Yamamotos (Uh)
Whoever kill him first gon' get promoted
Boy, I was getting away with murder before Denzel fucked Viola
Gangsta Kane
Young nigga, dope money, just have at it, nigga
Make money, more money, mathematics, nigga
But the broke hoes, they coming for your money, nigga
Play low, I mean low like no money, nigga
Young nigga, dope money, just have at it, nigga
Make money, more money, mathematics, nigga
But the broke hoes, they coming for your money, nigga
Play low, I mean low like no money, nigga

Look, real bars are the ill bars
These scars are the only real proof they couldn't kill gods
My coke hand is still sketchin' out my memoirs
What I did to door panels on them Windstars
Gem stars, left cuts in the dinner plates
It's new stash spots, the AC don't just ventilate
Take over your blocks, young niggas assimilate
We all break bread like going Dutch on a dinner date
The love of your life rap nigga wear fake watches
The serial number don't match the gift boxes
The bezel on her ballon bleu do the Tinashe
The bitch told me two-tone Rollies was too blas√© (Yugh)
Way more chemical than political
PTSD from what I weighed on the digital
It was snowfall and Reagan gave me the visual
Obama opened his doors knowing I was a criminal
I took a risk, I took a brick
Took a road trip to a Motel 6
Get it wholesale and you know I won't tell shit
Ride coattails, then he really want that lit
Just another in the mix, nigga, I'm rich, nigga
Tell me, is you Alpo or Mitch, nigga?
Bet it all, roulette, all on my wrist, nigga
Like Cleo setting it off, taking your bitch, nigga, ooh
Young nigga, dope money, just have at it, nigga
Make money, more money, mathematics, nigga
But the broke hoes, they coming for your money, nigga
Play low, I mean low like no money, nigga
Young nigga, dope money, just have at it, nigga
Make money, more money, mathematics, nigga
But the low low, like talking to baby mama, nigga
Fake rap, tell that bitch this is that show money, nigga

I know a guy in my neighborhood
He came home from work one day and caught his best friend in the hall with his wife
They had all day to go to bed
Pulled out a .45, shot both of 'em
Next morning, his friend went down to the jail
He said, "Fred, don't take it so hard"
He said, "It could have been worse"
He said, "What you mean, it could have been worse?"
He said, "Man, two people dead. I might get the electric chair. You tell me it could have been worse?"
He said, "Yeah, baby. It could have been worse."
He said, "What you mean?"
He said, "Hell, if you'd have came Thursday instead of Friday, you'd have gotten me too"19Embed
