Giannis Lyrics
Uh, turnt up like Tony juggin' the speaker phones
Fuck Sosa, bitch, I got soldiers and I put my people on
2009, a bitch food stamps what I was eatin' on
Got four-inch quarters, half-nine pieces on my Nokia phone
Squad, diamonds make haters stay on the job
Keepin' a baby .380 with me like Khaled stay with Asahd
Bump that poison poppy seed, the Afghani shit from the mob
You's a cartoon like Flip on the cover of Lucky Charms
Every mornin' I wake up with my daughter, Dora Explorer
Then I get right back to the pot
Kitchen stankin', that's potty trainin'
Murder note go to the muhfuckin' plaintiff at my arraignment
Keep the dead oppressors on green paper
Fuck bein' famous, nigga

Ice will come with the fame
Flowers cover the grave
Power, love, and loyalty
Wash me clean today

Industry got you sleep but bitch I'm woke, I know the Devil
These niggas be fallin' off every day like Ace Hood Rollie bezel
Niggas don't understand
That 360 mean a percentage of every income stream
That record ain't doin' no numbers
You trip on your management and your legal team
Uhh, I done been dropped before
Talked about and wrote off before
Heart on my sleeve and the ATF at my mama door
Mr. Mongol told me, "Freddie, fix up your posture, bro
Walk tall and never show niggas more than they gotta know"
Real Gs move in silence like Giannis
My Greek freak, we did a ménage with a friend in St. Thomas
From 50 karats in my pendant to change up the climate
We paint all the whips to cocaine white, decorate the garages
Kane
Ice will come with the fame (Yeah)
Flowers cover the grave
Power, love, and loyalty
Wash me clean today (Huh)

'Caine all in the blood (Uh-huh)
Shots to the brain, Snow on tha Bluff (Uh-huh)
Calls for a truce, but truce came with snubs (Uh-huh)
Bodies hit the pavement, money came for months (I wasn't done!)
Hey, 'caine paid the bills (Uh-huh)
Penthouse the suite, sugar on the hill (Uh-huh)
Some will get free but most will get killed (Uh-huh)
I'm just doin' me, and me, I'm doin' still (I wasn't done!)
Ha, started with a nickel in my Tommy socks
Smokin' Blacks and gettin' sips of papa's Remy Martin
Boosted Polo out of Macy's in the Jansport (Hey)
Mama would have got me anything I asked for
In the city where they iffy on supportin' niggas (Hey)
Moved to L.A., started selling pounds of cauliflower (Hey)
Same niggas that I grew up sharin' shoes with (Hey)
Turned a limit to a multi-million dollar movement, bitch

Ice will come with the fame (Fame)
Flowers cover the grave (Cover all)
Power, love, and loyalty (Aw, yeah)
Wash me clean (Wash me clean, yeah)
'Caine all in the blood (Uh-huh)
Shots to the brain, Snow on tha Bluff (Uh-huh)
Calls for a truce, but truce came with snubs (Uh-huh)
Bodies hit the pavement, money came for months
'Caine paid the bills (Uh-huh)
Penthouse the suite, sugar on the hill (Uh-huh)
Some will get f– but most will get killed (Uh-huh)
I'm just doin' me, and me, I'm doin' still (I'm doin' still)

Ice will come with the fame
Flowers cover the grave
Power, love, and loyalty
Wash me clean today

For the fame
Covered all, covered all
Where's your loyalty? (Hey)
Wash me clean today
Apne pichhe
Pyaar kaa jahaan basa ke chale
