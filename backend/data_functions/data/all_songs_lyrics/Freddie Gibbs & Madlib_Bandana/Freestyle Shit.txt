Freestyle Shit Lyrics
Warning
The surgeon general has determined (Mmh, yeah)
That the sounds you are about to hear
Will always be devastating (I want it all, nigga, all of it)
To your ear
Sleep well
Kane season
Drink some of this champagne
(I love Madlib, he makes me much joy)
Yeah, yeah
I want it all, nigga, all of it
(My favorite, my nigga Madlib, obrigado)
Yeah, yeah

I want it all, nigga, all leather
25th and Jackson, I'm back in action like Carl Weathers, uh
Tryna beat the Rocky like Carl Weathers
Trap boy Kane, I Clubber Lang Sylvester
Crack cocaine, I was my own investor
Could I do this shit independent? That was my only question, uh
Usher Raymond IV, Confessions
Ferra let me come through and hit when I was alone and stressin’
Yeah, 'cause when this music shit wasn't movin’, man
I said I might as well be movin' thangs, uh
Uh, Joey let him shelf it
But I still put out my fuckin' debut record, for the record
Where I move when I'm with these hoes is off the record, for the record
For the social media shit I was livin' reckless
And these rap niggas share the same hoes
Gotta curve bitches, gotta cut bitches, gotta change hoes
I was reminiscin' in the Range Rove
Me and my little brother shared the same clothes, nigga, yeah
That's when this music shit wasn't movin’, man
I said I might as well be movin’ thangs
'Cause when this music wasn’t movin', man
And I was barely even movin' thangs, uh
Said I was moving with them shooters, man
Before I barely even knew the game
East Side, Gary, nigga, I got it tatted
Virginia Street, fuck the niggas that ratted, my nigga, uh
Don't wan’ hit the trap if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snorting powder
Niggas don't holler 'less I got narcotics
Scratchin' and itchin', he on that dog collar
Trunk full of tapes, I ain't got no dollars
By the time niggas show you love, you don't even want it
By the time niggas show me love, I ain't even need it
By the time niggas showed me love, I was on the TV, yeah
That's when this music started movin', man
But I still proceed to move them thangs, uh
Said I was moving with them shooters, man
Gang bangin' and recruitin', man, uh
Yeah
Movin', man
Fuck it, keep it, I'm done4Embed
