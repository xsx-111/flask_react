Flat Tummy Tea Lyrics
Uh, I beat the pot like Joseph beat Mike and Jermaine
One came out light, one came out dark but they smokin' the same
I break a 50 on blunts and give my smoker the change
That nigga flexin', VVS every stone in the chain
Gold body, my jeweler, he black mummy me
I be all in these bitches' stomach like flat tummy tea
Crackers came to Africa, ravaged, raffled, and rummaged me
America was the name of they fuckin' company
Stackin' niggas like cargo over and under me
Pick cotton bails and the coca leaf off the money tree
Niggas won't let you live in peace but love to see you rest in peace
Broke and poppin' and drinkin' on the rest, they got the best of me
I'm choppin' it up on the table, 'cause there wasn't no label gon' invest in me
These niggas'll ride your wave and wouldn't go sit that time in the fed with me
Eventually, when I got indicted I took a minus
Niggas that I fucked with went on hiatus so I decided
I should make a couple decisions like Sean made
A couple Jhen√© Aiko-lookin' hoes in the Sprinter thing
(They fuckin' with the Kane)
Black nigga, jack tripper, pack flipper
Step out the kitchen and step in the booth and drop heat on these rap niggas
Without a cosign, you probably be fillin' my grocery bag, nigga
Poison flow, I send opponents from riches to rags, nigga
(Gangsta Kane)
Gold body, my jeweler, he black mummy me
I be all in these bitches' stomach like flat tummy tea
Crackers came to Africa, ravaged, raffled, and rummaged me
America was the name of they fuckin' company
Gold body, my jeweler, he black mummy me
I be all in these bitches' stomach like flat tummy tea
Crackers come to Africa, ravaged, raffled, and rummaged me
America was the name of they fuckin' company (Kane)

Uh, chain give me whiplash, my neck glass
Shave a lil tax off the package, pay my connect fast
Bellagio with quatro hoes, stack like Connect 4s
Niggas don't own no land or fine art but got all the retros
Obama can't make the law retroactive, what the fuck happened?
Congress cock-blockin' niggas from comin' home to they family
If you lucky, when he left out of office
You got a pardon, overtime cut
Soft or that hard, you fucked up regardless, made my mind up
Then incarceration my destination, I would wind up
Addicted to medication, just poured another line up
Overdosed with a styrofoam cup, how they gon' find us?
Slave movies every year, yeah, the master gon' remind us
If we don't take it, we don't deserve it back (Yeah)
And six-thousand years done ran up, the kings of the earth is back
(Earth is back)
Supreme mathematics, I'm on the right course (Yeah)
Took the sword and knocked white Jesus off of that white horse
(Yeah)
Yeah, my nigga, I'm on the right course (For sure)
Took the sword and knocked white Jesus off of that white horse
(Uh-huh)
Fuck Spike, he mostly show Malcolm on coke and white whores
(Fuck Spike)
Did the shit so he can get fundin' up from them white boys
White girl magic, cocaine, the white whores (Yeah)
I was in Joliet serving heroin to them white boys (Yeah)
Top five rapper alive and that's on Vice Lord
Took the sword and knocked white Jesus off of that white horse
Damn, somebody callin' me, fuck
Damn, I hate when people do that
Let me put my phone on airplane mode, let me do that over8Embed
