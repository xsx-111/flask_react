Cataracts Lyrics
Yeah, check, check, yeah, uh
Chillin' in my, uh, uh
Chillin’ in my, chillin' in my, uh
Chillin' in my, chillin’ in my, uh
Chillin' in my, chillin' in my, uh

Old school
Chevy thang, Cadillac
Smokin' on that good, good
Good for my cataracts
Fuckin' up this bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat
Nine, extended clip attached
Swingin' it like a battle axe
Livin' la vida broke-a
Fuckin’ these smokers up and baggin’ crack
Antonio Montana dream
Mama wasn't havin’ that
Niggas ain't know no better
We fuck 'em and pass 'em
We was passin’ rats
Bitch, you wet my 'Wood up
Dry my shit off 'fore you pass it back
Bitch, pass it back, pass the Act'
Codeine got me passin' out
Kron, mix it with cranberry
Tryna see what that about
'Member we hit that lick and tied up them Crips in that Atlanta house
Had to smoke that nigga that came along with us 'cause he was gon' rat us out
Seem like my actions was devil sent, I can't sympathize
Fuck Generation X, this generation genocide
Your social stat make you fantasize about a homicide
To me, the God Allah is the black man personified
Anticipatin' and killin' my own in search of wealth
Should he come knockin' at the door of your home, you know, we don't fear death
Knew the Lord was in the room when my daughter took her first breath
Cold turkey on the dope, had to gain the knowledge of self

In my old school
Chevy thang Cadillac
Good, good
Good for my cataracts
Bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat
Nine, extended clip attached
Swingin' it like a battle axe
I'm chillin' in my old school
Chevy thang, Cadillac
Smokin' on that good, good
Good for my cataracts
Fuckin' up this bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat
Nine, extended clip attached
Swingin' it like a battle axe
Livin' la vida broke-a
Fuckin' these smokers up and baggin' crack
Antonio Montana dream
Mama wasn't havin' that
Niggas ain't know no better
We fuck 'em and pass 'em
We was passin' rats
Bitch, you wet my 'Wood up
Dry my shit off 'fore you pass it back

Wish I could put that pussy off in my pockets, I would leave with that
Hit me after your cycle, I need that pussy with no strings attached
Fiendin' to get it, won't hit it, against my religion, a nigga won't bleed for that
You lucky enough to get you a nigga with morals, you need to take heed of that
Turkey bacon, bitch, like my toast buttered on both sides
Chevy dipped in liquid cocaine, my Casper the Ghost ride
I let some people go from my company and they soul died
I know that they jumpin' straight into Hell, I pray that they nosedive
Mama said don't leave out the house if you ain't got Jesus with you
Last Supper, you might get fucked by niggas that's eatin' with you
Side bitch was trippin', I fucked but won't spend the evening with her
My baby mama switched up her diet, I won't go vegan with her
Father, please deliver us niggas, carnivorous niggas
I walk amongst the dumb, deaf, and blind, and them frivolous niggas
And dope, rap, and basketball punchin' a ticket for niggas
You put it in the book then I guess you done hid it from niggas
I'm chillin' in my old school
Chevy thang, Cadillac
Smokin' on that good, good
Good for my cataracts
Fuckin' up this bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat (New shit)

Mashallah, rest in peace to Tha Jacka
Paradise, the next life, I'll see you in the hereafter
I'm in that ebony Instagram, my nigga was mad I ain't smashin'
Nigga, I don't need you for the feature, really don't fuck with no rapper
I don't got no problem with these niggas wearin' they dresses and skirts
When you pop up with an opinion and drag your name through the dirt
On the Day of Judgement, niggas gon' pay for they dirt
Including me
Couldn't push my boat through the lake of fire 'cause my paddles was burnt
Uncle was smokin' that work
Can't come in the crib, I serve you through the gate
Smell the dope off in the air
Jimmy Duggan, shake and bake
Used to walk a dog with H
In and out, Empire State
'68 Chevelle, don't need no Bentley truck or fuckin' Wraith
2014, addicted to lean, I was depressed as fuck
Duckin' shots and wonderin' if my own niggas set me up
And if they knock me down, I wonder would one of my niggas help me up?
Pockets, they finger-lickin', they honey kettle chicken, breaded up
Bitch, get your bread up, bitch
I say my pockets, they finger-lickin', honey kettle chicken, breaded up, bitch

This that new shit
Madlib, that new shit
Takin' over, new Kane, woo
Let that shit ride out
You better pray twice, nigga3Embed
