Situations Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Representer
Street niggas, I'm a representer
East Gary, I'm a representer
Rest in peace, granny, I'ma represent her
Made it through the summer with no air conditioner
Catch us huddled 'round the kitchen in the winter
Just a youngin thuggin', tryna check a million
Youngin thuggin', tryna check a million
Windows tinted with the killer in my system
More than weed and liquor in my system
Got the brand new whip, might see the solar system
On my seventh figure, niggas know the feelin'
Necklace flooded, it's a situation (Yeah)
All my bitches got a situation (Yeah)
County lockup or the police station (Yeah)
We was in some shitty situations (Uh)

'Bout to smoke it up, pour it up
I'm a thug and smokin' lethal warrior
Copped a brick of yay West Side of Florida
Spent a hundred-twenty on a Rover truck
I had bitches when a nigga rode the bus
'Fore the money, bitches never noticed you
Way back when, they wouldn't do a show with us
Now they callin' me so they can open up
I put you niggas on game
Put some respect on my name
Freddie Kane a livin' legend
I hit a stain
Cousin took two to the brain
Bullets missed me, it's a blessing
I can see the day like it was yesterday, I'll never forget it
So rest in peace, good Lord, you was caught in the system
I made my lane up in this game, and upped the winning percentage
So fuck a record deal, a nigga need a bigger percentage
I'm like
Haha
Lambo, cut my check, nigga (Brrt, brrt, brrt, nigga)
Yeah

Representer
Insane, I'm a representer
VL, I'm a representer
I'm a 22-12 representer
What you know 'bout stuffin' kilos in the engine?
You a sidewalk nigga, street ain't in you
'Bout to stretch this coca like the seventh inning
Young and thuggin', tryna check a million
Windows tinted with the killer in my system
More than weed and liquor in my system
Got the brand new whip, might see the solar system
On my seventh figure, niggas know the feelin'
Necklace flooded, it's a situation
All my bitches got a situation
County lockup or the police station
We was in some shitty situations

1989, I seen a nigga bleed
Uncle stabbed him in the neck and hit his knees
Turned the arcade to a stampede
I was playin' Pac-Man, Centipede
Put me on some shit I never should've seen
Robbin', killin', drug dealin' in my genes
I was livin' in Atlanta, juggin' bean
Drea hit a nigga with the Billie Jean
Josh The Goon got a nigga back to flowin'
Bought the plane ticket, first I wasn't open
From that moment I was West Coastin'
Livin' out of Sid apartment, smokin' all the roaches
Straight survivin' off of Wendy's, Pollo Loco
43rd and Main, I'm 'posted serving smokers
Did my re-up la famila with my cholo
Twenty for the chicken, that's some pollo loco (Yeah, yeah)
Obama got elected today, and I got arrested
LA County literally strippin' a nigga naked
And I never tell on none of my enemies or connection
Motherfuck Jeff Sessions, I'm sellin' dope with a weapon
Only union some of me and my niggas got is the Western
I'm they favorite rapper when niggas fucked up and they stressin'
Lot of niggas feel like I got my bucks up and I left 'em
Tell them pussy niggas come get the fuck up on my level, yeah
This how it feel to wake up and you don't owe nobody shit
Not an explanation, not no conversation, Drug Administration, suck a nigga dick
When my daddy ran over Eddie with that motorcycle, he ain't been that nigga since
Seen him transform to crackhead Ed, "If I got twenty, Fred, can I get a hit?"
Nigga, damn
Fuck You Friday was such a great holiday
That I thought I would extend the holiday season
And let's call it I Don't Give A Shit Saturday
I don't give a shit about what you think about me
I don't give a shit about who you think I ought to be
I don't give a shit about, you don't like me cussin'?
I don't give a shit what you like
I'm doing what is best for me
I'm doing those things that makes me happy
Those things that I think are positive with me
And that's what you need to say to anyone today who comes into your life
Tryna bring negative shit into your life
Tell 'em, "I don't give a shit"
In fact, tell them, "If you not feedin' me, financing me, or fuckin' me, I just don't give a shit"
In fact, go out on this holiday
Get you some ribs, put it the grill
And let's call it Fuck-A-Que
Let's have a Fuck-A-Que holiday
And not give a shit about what people have to say about you and your life
This is your morning message from the cussing pastor
Have a great day2Embed
