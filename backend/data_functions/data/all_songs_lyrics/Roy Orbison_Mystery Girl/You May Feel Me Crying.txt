You May Feel Me Crying LyricsWhen we made love, you know we're making love
To everyone we've ever made love to
So when you take him down inside
Just know I'm there with you
And you may feel me crying
And oh, I hope you do
I'm out there somehow all alone
With memories of you
And you may feel me crying
While you're reaching for more
I just hope someday I see you
Standing at my door
It's something I live for
They'll fill you up, I know. with shining dreams
To touch your heart, because you thrill them so
But there's a place they'll never touch
Just you and I can know
And you may feel me crying
And oh, I hope you do
I'm out there somehow all alone
With memories of you
You may feel me crying
While you're reaching for more
I just hope someday I see you
Standing at my door
It's something I live for
There are stronger men than me
And they'll take you on a mountain
And give you all you fear
And you'll do what they desire
You were born to see how long
Yout hand can stand the fire
You may feel me crying
And oh, I hope you do
I'm out there somehow all alone
With memories of you
You may feel me crying
While you're reaching for more
I just hope someday I see you
Standing at my door
It's something I live forEmbed
