A Love So Beautiful LyricsThe summer sun looked down
On our love long ago
But in my heart I feel
The same old afterglow
A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away
We were too young to understand
To ever know
That lovers drift apart
And that's the way love goes
A love so beautiful
A love so sweet
A love so beautiful
A love for you and me
And I when I think of you
I fall in love again
A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip away
A love so beautiful
In every way
A love so beautiful
We let it slip awayEmbed
