Windsurfer LyricsWindsurfer
Windsurfer
All he wanted was to ride out on the wind
Windsurfer
To be one of the guys and to look good in her eyes
He practiced in his dreams
Trying to coast the waves
Most of the time he sailed alone
Endless summer days
Flying in the sun
He'd ride and wait for the wind
To take him home
Windsurfer
Windsurfer
Windsurfer
Windsurfer
He said let's sail away together
She told him no no never no
Wind windsurfer
It was early one morning
On a lovely beach
He left a message and
He wrote it in the sand
Why do we always go for
Something out of reach?
Nobody ever really understands
Windsurfer
All he wanted to do
Was outrun the sun
Windsurfer
To take her in his dreams
When the lonely day was done
