All I Can Do Is Dream You LyricsI've been away from you for so long
Still every time I think of us, I get blue
But all I can do is dream you
I close my eyes
And love so warm and tender
I feel you touching me
I close my eyes
I don't even have to try, it comes so easily
And I don't know why
I ever let us drift apart
But look who's sorry now
'Cause every time I wake up
And you're not around it only brings me down
Baby, all I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
Here I go dreaming you
Everyday I pray
That somewhere down the line
We will meet again
I'll find a way to get you back somehow
But baby, until then
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream you
All I can do is dream youEmbed
