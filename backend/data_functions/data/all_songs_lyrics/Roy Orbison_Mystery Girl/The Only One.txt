The Only One LyricsEveryone you know's been through it
You bite the bullet then you chew it
Tie the knot at the end of your rope
Buy a book to help you cope but
No consolation gonna come
You're the only one
Take a look through history
Recant some bits of poetry
You'll find the words still ring true
Some things don't change
Some things do
And you're the only one with a broken heart
The only one who's afraid of the dark
The only one in a crowded room
The only one who sees a blue moon
What you wouldn't give right now
To be another face in the crowd
And you're the only one who is all alone
The only one who's love is gone
The only one who has given in
And you're the only one with a broken heart
The only one who is falling apart
The only one in a crowded room
The only one who can see the blue moon
The only one who is falling apart
The only one who's afraid of the dark
The only one in a crowded room
The only one who sees the blue moonEmbed
