Coming Down LyricsIf you don't mind
Could we not fight?
I see you're close woman
In the night
I'm sober
Still Alive
Waste your days
On your own
Getting drunk
Getting stoned
I'm sober
Still alone
Must I always take a back seat?
Must I always be your clown?
Did you ever really love me?
Were you always coming down?
See your face
See your eyes
Shouldn't have left
Shouldn't have lied
I'm sober
Spirit's died
Must I always take a back seat?
Must I always be your clown?
Did you ever really love me?
Were you always coming down?
Must I always take a back seat?
Must I always be your clown?
Did you ever really love me?
Were you always coming down?Embed
