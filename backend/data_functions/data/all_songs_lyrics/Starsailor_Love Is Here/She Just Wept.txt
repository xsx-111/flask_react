She Just Wept LyricsShe just wept
Like I could not ignore
How can I act
When my heart's on the floor?
She just wept
'Til her eyes became sore
I knew who she was
But I don't any more
She just cried
To the ruins of time
That kept us apart
We were doing just fine
She just wept
She was put to the test
Those that she'd loved
She had learnt to detest
Daddy I've got nothing left
My life is good, my love's a mess
Daddy I've got nothing left
What can I do that's for the best?
Daddy I've got nothing left
My life is good, my love's a mess
Daddy I've got nothing left
What can I do that's for the best?Embed
