Poor Misguided Fool LyricsAs soon as you sound like him
Give me a call
When you're so sensitive
It's a long way to fall
Whenever you need a home
I will be there
Whenever you're all alone
And nobody cares
You're just a poor misguided fool
Who thinks they know what I should do
A line for me and a line for you
I lose my right to a point of view
Whenever you reach for me
I'll be your guide
Whenever you need someone
To keep it inside
Whenever you need a home
I will be there
Whenever you're all alone
And nobody cares
You're just a poor misguided fool
Who thinks they know what I should do
A line for me and a line for you
I lose my right to a point of view
I'll be your guide in the morning
You cover up bullet holes
As soon as you sound like him
Give me a call
When you're so sensitive
It's a long way to fall
You're just a poor misguided fool
Who thinks they know what I should do
A line for me and a line for you
I lose my right to a point of viewEmbed
