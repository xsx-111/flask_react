Tie Up My Hands LyricsWipe the make-up from your face
Tie your hair and gently fall from grace
Until I come again
Take the disaffected life
Men who ran the company ran your life
You could have been his wife
I wanna love you but my hands are tied
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise
Wipe the sweat from off your brow
All that you believe is here and now
You could have had more doubt
Wipe the shadow from your eyes
Rest your daughter while your mother cries
You could have let him fly
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
I wanna lie here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna stay here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun does rise
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna sleep here but I've been denied
I wanna stay here 'til we've killed this bitter doubt
I wanna hold you but my hands are tied
I wanna sleep here but I've been denied
Let's watch the clock until the morning sun comes out1Embed
