Lullaby LyricsGet back on your feet again
So insincere
Quiet American
I held you so dear
Get back on your feet again
So into you
We met in a cinema
You fell from my view
Lullaby, stop twisting my words tonight
If you get high on life
Don't leave me behind
Get back on your feet again
Nothing to say
Some of your weaker friends get in my way
Get back on your feet again
Always seem down
Some of your weaker friends
Don't want you around
Lullaby
Stop twisting my words tonight
If you get high on life
Don't leave me behind
Lullaby
You live in my ruined mind
Make light of all my fears
And leave me from here
Ohh oh ohh oh ohh oooh oooh...
Get back on your feet again
So insincere
Quiet American
I held you so dear
Get back on your feet again
Nothing to say
We met in a cinema
You got in my way
Lullaby
Stop twisting my words tonight
If you get high on life
Don't leave me behind
Lullaby
You live in my ruined mind
Make light of all my fears
And lead me from hereEmbed
