Love Is Here LyricsIf you could see the lover in me
And we can join our hands together
You could see how good it could be
We'll sing these stupid songs forever
Can you feel it?
Love is here
It has never been so clear
You can't love what you have not
So hold on to what you've got
Is Trudy really smiling for me?
I'd change my name in case she found me
Trembling I can't believe
I've got to leave the girl behind me
Can you feel it
Love is here
It has never been so clear
You can't love what you have not
So hold on to what you've got
If you could see the aching in me
I'd change my name in case you lost me
Trembling down to my knees
I've got to leave the world behind me
Can you feel it
Love is here
It has never been so clear
You can't love what you have not
So hold on to what you've gotEmbed
