Good Souls LyricsFeel
Sick after every meal
I'd say
'Cos I know
The life from your burning wheel
Won't wane
Sleep
I sleep every day
Wipe the cobwebs away
I need to be loved
Christ
I'm out of my mind
I need to be loved
I need to be loved
As I turn to you and I say
Thank goodness for the good souls
That make life better
As I turn to you and I say
If it wasn't for the good souls
Life would not matter
Dive straight in on your girlfriend
Making her feel like there's going to be a war
Dive straight in at the deep end
Making you feel like there's going to be a war
As I turn to you and I say
Thank goodness for the good souls
That make life better
As I turn to you and I say
If it wasn't for the good souls
Life would not matter
One good day of the week
And I'll be up again
One good day of the week
I'll be higher than the government
As I turn to you and I say
Thank goodness for the good souls
That make life better
As I turn to you and I say
If you're messing with a good heart
You've got to take what's dueEmbed
