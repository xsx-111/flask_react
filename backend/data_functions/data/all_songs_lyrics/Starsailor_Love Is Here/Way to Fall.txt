Way to Fall Lyrics
Son, you've got a way to fall
They'll tell you where to go
But they won't know
Son, you'd better take it all
They'll tell you what they know
But they won't show

Oh, I've got something in my throat
I need to be alone
While I suffer

Son, you've got a ways to kill
They're picking on you still
But they don't know
Son, you'd better wait to shine
They'll tell you what is yours
But they'll take mine

Oh, I've got something in my throat
I need to be alone
While I suffer
Oh, there's a hole inside my boat
I need to stay afloat
For the summer long

Oh (Left my sweet soul)
I've got something in my throat (Beneath the bedclothes)
I need to be alone (I'm not coming down)
While I suffer
Oh (Walls have ears)
There's a hole inside my boat (But no one hears)
I need to stay afloat (When nobody's around)
For the summer

Son, you'd better wait to fall
They'll tell you where to go
But they won't know2Embed
