Fever LyricsThere's a fever
On the freeway
In the morning
In the morning
And the lover
Smiling for me
Without warning
Without warning
There's an outlaw
On the highway
And she's falling
And she's falling
Man, I must have been blind
To carry a torch
For most of my life
These days I'm hanging around
You're out of my heart
And out of my town
There's a fever
On the freeway
In the morning
In the morning
And the lover
Smiling for me
While she's falling
While she's falling
Man, I must have been blind
To carry a torch
For most of my life
These days I'm hanging around
You're out of my heart
And out of my town
There's a fever
On the freeway
In the morning
In the morning
And the lover
Smiling for me
Without warning
Without warning
Man, I must have been blind
To carry a torch
For most of my life
These days I'm hanging around
You're out of my heart
And out of my town1Embed
