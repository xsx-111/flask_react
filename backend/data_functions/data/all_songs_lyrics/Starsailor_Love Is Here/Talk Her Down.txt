Talk Her Down LyricsYou came waltzing in
Where the love had been
And the boys all looked around
Let me stay while you talk your baby down
I came waltzing in
Where the light had been
And the girls all looked away
Let them stare while we make our getaway
You came waltzing in
Where the light had been
And the dark was all around
Let me stay while they all fall to the ground
I was hiding from the weather
She was recently estranged
When she put me back together
Didn't even know her name
You came waltzing in
Where the life had been
And the death was all around
Let them stare while they all fall to the ground
You came waltzing in
Where the love had been
And the girls all looked away
Let me stay while they make their getaway
I was hiding from the weather
She was recently estranged
When she put me back together
Didn't even know her name
You came waltzing in
Where your life had been
It was nowhere to be found
Take me back to the place where we were bound
You came waltzing in
Where the love had been
And the boys all looked around
Let me stay while you talk your baby down
I was hiding from the weather
She was recently estranged
When she put me back together
Didn't even know her nameEmbed
