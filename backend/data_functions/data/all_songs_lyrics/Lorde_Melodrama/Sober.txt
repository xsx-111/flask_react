Sober Lyrics
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
(When you get to my high, when you get to)
Night, midnight

Oh God, I'm clean out of air
In my lungs, it's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (Hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah-ha)

We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquour-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (Hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart:
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah-ha)

We're king and queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care, but we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Uh, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Midnight, we're fading
Till daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with
All the heartache and the treason
The fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Us

When you get to my high (Midnight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (Midnight, lose my mind)55Embed
