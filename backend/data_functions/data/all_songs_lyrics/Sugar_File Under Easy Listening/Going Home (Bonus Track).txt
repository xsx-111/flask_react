Going Home (Bonus Track) LyricsGoing home where to go
Where the whole thing started
And you know going back won't be fun forever
As you go
Hasn't been forever
Going home
Leaving home forever
Face the door start to crawl
Like you were a baby
Going home to a home you left
And vowed you'd never be
Going home
This was for someone else
Time to go
You can't stay here any more
Find some things from the past
That you thought were missing
Pack them up as you go back
To the life you're leading now
Going home
I can't stay forever
Got to go
Back to where I came from
I don't know where to go
With so few possessions
They stay home as I go back
To where I came fromEmbed
