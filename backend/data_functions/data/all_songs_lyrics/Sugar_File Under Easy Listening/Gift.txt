Gift LyricsI
Received this gift from you
Pleasantly surprised, I never thought you'd realize
That maybe
I
Have taken this from you
If I was deserving, who am I to disagree
How can I refuse this, even if I don't deserve it
And now
I give this gift to you
Could have got you anything, but this will have to
Do
It's how
I give this gift to you
It doesn't seem like much, but it's the best that I
Could do
I'm giving everything away before I go for good
And once you give the gift away
There's nothing you can do about it
Nothing that you do or say
Can change the way I feel about it
Try to look inside of me
To find the gift that I am giving
Glad you had a chance to see
The gift that I'm deliveringEmbed
