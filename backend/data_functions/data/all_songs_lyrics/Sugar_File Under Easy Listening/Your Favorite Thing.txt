Your Favorite Thing LyricsTell me I'm your favorite thing
You can tell me anything
I wouldn't mind
Dream about you every night
Something tells me that's not right
I wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind
Not at all
Stuck inside my head again
Hoping that this never ends
I wouldn't mind
It's my existence you ignore
And I can't take you anymore
I wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind
The wait is killing me
I keep waiting, wait impatiently
What do I need to do?
I'll do anything you want me to
I'll sit on a bookcase in your room
Alone with all your other favorite things
Now that I'm your favorite thing
Let's see what the future brings
I wouldn't mind
And I can't tell you what's been happening
I don't know, I don't know
I wouldn't mind, I wouldn't mind
Not at allEmbed
