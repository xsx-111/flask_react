Company Book LyricsEveryone loves the company man
With his company book in his hand
The songs inside the company book
Do not deserve a look
They are rules in and of themselves
Everyone knows the company man
He lets etiquette play his every hand
Maybe 20 years ago
He didn't show
His love of rules in and of themselves
In the epilogue the company man
Takes his company life with his company hands
In his revelation he decrees
Extinction of faceless robots like himself
Spawned from the company bookEmbed
