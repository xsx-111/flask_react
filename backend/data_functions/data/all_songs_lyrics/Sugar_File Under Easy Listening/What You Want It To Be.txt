What You Want It To Be LyricsAll the stories you read
Don't know what to believe
And everything that you see
Don't you see what you need
It's what you want to believe
As you lie in the weeds
The lies get amplified and
It's what you're saying to me
It's what you want it to be
Take a look at my face
Don't you know I can see
You don't know what you want
I don't know what you need
It may be simple, but me
I don't have to deceive you
I don't have the time to
But what you're saying to me
Is what you want it to be
You've been talking in rhymes
You don't know what you mean
I can see through it all
Through the web that you weaveEmbed
