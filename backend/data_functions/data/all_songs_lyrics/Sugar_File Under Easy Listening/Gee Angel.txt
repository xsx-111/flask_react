Gee Angel LyricsGot a set of wings that I couldn't use
Bought them in a store on the avenue
Didn't mean to spend all the cash I had
The second that I saw them, I wanted them bad
When I got home and I tried them on
I noticed that the wingspan was way too long
Couldn't take them back, there was no return
I should have gotten more, I was feeling burned
Gee angel, won't you take these back?
Gee angel, gee angel, I need some slack
There's nothing in this world that I'd rather do
Than buy a set of wings and fly away with you
Climbed up the mountain, observed the view
But angel wouldn't say what I had to do
Then angel flew away and left me standing there
I knew I couldn't fly, but I didn't careEmbed
