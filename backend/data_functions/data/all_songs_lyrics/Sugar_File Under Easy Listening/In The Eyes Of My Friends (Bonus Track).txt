In The Eyes Of My Friends (Bonus Track) LyricsI don't want you to look at me
Though the eyes of a stranger
Because you might come to realize that I am stranger
Than a fish that never fries
Than an eye that never cries
Than people who swear up and down that they have never lied
Regardless, insecurities that others may perceive
Are benign in the eyes of my friends
I don't need you to see me flailing at my nervous habits
Each one taunting me for being unable to stab it
Digging holes inside my head about what I should have said
Wishing I could find an answer or a little to shed
Regardless, insecurities that others may perceive
Are benign in the eyes of my friends
I don't want you to always know exactly how I feel
I need your help to weather what the epicenter deals
When doubt is held at bay, but the surface rubs away
The sun is shining everywhere, but I can't find a ray
Regardless, insecurities that others may perceive
Are benign in the eyes of my friendsEmbed
