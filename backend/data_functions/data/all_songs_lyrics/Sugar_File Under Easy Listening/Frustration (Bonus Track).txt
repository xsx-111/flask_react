Frustration (Bonus Track) LyricsI am frustration
Maybe you are too
No one is talking
There's nothing to refuse
But if I said I would not miss you
I was wrong
I have been waiting, waiting for a clue
It has gotten so waiting is all I seem to do
But if I said I would not miss you
I was wrong
You can come to me and I wouldn't mind
You can correct me when I am wrong
It's as inevitable as the fall
From the ages of Etruscan minds
Of the springing from cages
Of criminals and lionsEmbed
