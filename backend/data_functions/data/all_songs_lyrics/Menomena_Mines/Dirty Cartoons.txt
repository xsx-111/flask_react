Dirty Cartoons LyricsGo home, I'd like to
Stumble to bed
And lay beside you
Until we're even
Or romantically bored
Whichever comes first
Go home, I'm trying
But I've been misled
By dirty cartoons
You'll keep me honest
For old times sake
I'm begging of you
Go home, go home
I'd like to
Go home, go home
I'd like to...
My mind's a graveyard
Of unpublished poems
You should be so lucky
Consider the meaning
And shrug it right off
You'll only encourage me
Go home
I'd like to...1Embed
