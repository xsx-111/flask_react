Bomb Me Back LyricsBomb me now a universal song
With hearts we share and hearts we string along
Careful, there's a mountain lion outside
Bomb me back to somewhere I belong
It's
It's the not knowing
Combined with 
Com-combined with pressure
It's the not knowing
It's the not knowing
Combined with worry
And speculation
And, and pessimism
(Bomb me now a universal song)
It's the not knowing
(Hearts we share and hearts we string along)
Careful, there's a mountain lion outside
Bomb me back to somewhere I belong
It's the 
It's pessimism and speculation
It's the not knowing
In, in place of duty and speculation
In place of wisdom
I'm filling notebooks
There is no quality
There is no
There is no quality control
Where is the quality control?
 I'm ready
To move forward
To move forward
To move forward
Without you, without you


Trying too hard
(Bomb me back to somewhere I belong)
Trying too hard
It's the not knowing (not knowing)
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Bending light, breaking news
Only take what you can use
Only take what you can use
Only take what you can use
You can use
 you know
Bomb me now a universal song (It's the not knowing)
Hearts we share and hearts we string along (It's preparation)
Careful, there's a mountain lion outside
Bomb me back to somewhere I belong (It's the not knowing)
Come Holy Jesus (x2)
It's the not knowing (x3)
In place of duty, yes
In place of duty
(In place of wisdom)
Oh Lord, I'm ready (x3)
Oh Lord, I'm ready to move on
Without you
Bomb me now a universal song
Hearts we share and hearts we string along
Careful, there's a mountain lion outside
Bomb me back to somewhere I belongEmbed
