The Insulation LyricsBegin to unwind
That's a process that's riddled with fear of mankind
The prospect of failings on par with divine
There's a tip of an iceberg with wandering eyes
And sights set on mounting
A hole through your heart
Or a shoe through the floor
And my only request on your way out the door
Is that you take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
So I must confess
With the whisper that pulls at the hairs on your neck
I'm a clear cutting forest to fill with regret
For rings left uncounted from trunks that I've split
How could I ever begin to unwind?
It's a process that's riddled with fear of mankind
The prospect of failings on par with divine
There's a tip of an iceberg with wandering eyes
And sights set on mounting
A hole through your heart
Or a shoe through the floor
And my only request on your way out the door
Is that you take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow...
There is a truth coming up the stairs from a tiny room
The vibes aren't all that good so I avoid
Going down there unless it's a complete necessity
Which is usually only twice a year
There's a hole in the kitchen wall covered by a stopped clock
The insulation could be better but I
Like the fact that I'm sheltered from the elements
By a broken countdown towards extinction
There is a hole in the ceiling pointing to the north star
Reassuring me I'll find my way home
As long as there's no clouds or airplanes in the night sky
My alignments cosmically exact
Begin to unwind
That's a process that's riddled with fear of mankind
The prospect of failings on par with divine
There's a tip of an iceberg with wandering eyes
And sights set on mounting
A hole through your heart
Or a shoe through the floor
And my only request on your way out the door
Is that you take a bow
Take a bow
Take a bow
Begin to unwind
That's a process that's riddled with fear of mankind
The prospect of failings on par with divine
There's a tip of an iceberg with wandering eyes
And sights set on mounting
A hole through your heart
Or a shoe through the floor
And my only request on your way out the door
Is that you take a bowEmbed
