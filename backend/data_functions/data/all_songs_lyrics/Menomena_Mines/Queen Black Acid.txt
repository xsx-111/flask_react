Queen Black Acid LyricsI get so caught up in my ways
Sometimes I overlook the simple plays
I feel like certain times in my life
Are met with certain times for pain to thrive
You're five foot five, not a hundred pounds
I'm scared to death of every single ounce
And worst of all is when it's calm
Cause I know the sea won't be calm for long
You bring me down
I walked right in through the rabbit's door
And walked right into the rabbit's hole
I made myself an open book
I made myself a sitting duck
I don't know how I missed the signs
I must have passed by them a hundred times
You barely notice what I say
You're busy looking round the room instead
I get so caught up in my ways
I walked right in through the rabbit's door
And walked right into the rabbit's hole
I made myself an open book
I made myself a sitting duck
I'm walking down this rabbit trail
My feet grow heavy with every step
I stop to eat and take a nap
And now I can't find my way back
You bring me down
So down
So down
(Outro)
A rabbit's door
A rabbit's hole
Open book
A sitting duck
A rabbit's door
A rabbit' hole
Open book1Embed
