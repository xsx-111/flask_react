Sleeping Beauty LyricsEveryone
When everyone's sleeping through the night
When everyone's sleeping through the night
Little and full, my hands and my hands and
When everyone, everyone
When everyone's sleeping through the night
When everyone's sleeping through the night
Little and full, my hands and my hands and
Hotel bathroom
Off the deep end
There's a light on
Sleeping beauty
Share your wisdom
Keep the smoke in with a towel
Stand back
Stand
(Yeah, yeah)
Recollection
Will betray us
Sleeping beauty
Write a memoir
Right through your seat
Make me honest, share the proceeds
Stand back
Stand
(When everyone's sleeping through the night)
Stand back
Stand
(When everyone's sleeping through the night)
Stand back
Stand
(When everyone's sleeping through the night)
(When everyone's sleeping through the night)
(When everyone's sleeping through the night)
Stand back
Stand
(When everyone's sleeping through the night)
(When everyone's sleeping through the night, the night)Embed
