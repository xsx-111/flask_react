BOTE LyricsOh sea legs please don't fail me now
I pray lord please help me right
This ship today
Cause I can't take much more
Of this strain on my battered hull
I thought I was tough
I thought I was strong
Thought I could handle anyone who came along
Thought the worth of a boat
In how well it floats
And this old boat won't float for long with all these holes
So I grab both sides with iron will
It's fit for war but weighs too much and starts to fill
Now I'm clutching the sides as long as I can
It's much too cold to swim
And much too deep to stand
When I started off down this path
I was well aware of the facts
And despite the proof I have vowed to choose
I continue bearing these (?)
I thought I was quick
As smart as a whip
I guess I met my match
Best stiffen up, my lip
My wit's getting weak
The sea's on the rise
And here I sit exposed
Atop the lying side
I thought I was tough
I thought I was strong
But I can't stay aboard this sinking ship for long
I thought I was quick
Smart as a whip
I guess I met my match this time
I'll take my licks
And when push always comes to shove
And I feel like enough's enough
And despite the shit-storm that's pounding my home
I walk outside and set off
Oh sea legs please don't fail me now
Oh sea legs please don't fail me nowEmbed
