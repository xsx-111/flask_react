INTIL LyricsI never thought I'd lie
But you don't wanna know
So now there's a divide
We used to be close
In order to be nice
I only show you half
The rest I gotta hide
'Cause you don't understand
Sometimes I say too much
Times that I'm with you
I'm really not myself
'Cause you don't want the truth
You want someone else
Sometimes I say too much
I admit
Sometimes I say too much
I admit...
I never thought I'd lieEmbed
