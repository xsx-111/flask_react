Five Little Rooms Lyrics
This is a play that takes place in a freezer
Count your blessings, it's far removed
From your group of peers
From your circle
Five little rooms, one for each of my husbands
One for each of my bride-grooms
And their prostitutes
And their children

Take a breath of the scenery
All this someday could be yours
Cross your heart, click your heels
And get the hell away

All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours

Hung on a pole right next to a McDonald's
In a suburban shopping mall
At half-mast again
Between shootings
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours, someday
All this could be yours
