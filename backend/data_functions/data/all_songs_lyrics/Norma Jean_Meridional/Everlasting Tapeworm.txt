Everlasting Tapeworm LyricsThe countless times we fall to ruin
These myriad days are so relentless
It isn't everyone's frailty to stop functioning and stop breathing
Sway with the waves, with the waves change
And we'll find our way back to the shore when it's over
The never content sensation of a tapeworm drug looking for its angry fix
Will mutual fear bring us peace?
Is ruining your day ruining your life?
Sway with the waves, with the waves change
And we'll find our way back to the shore when it's over
Sway with the waves, with the waves change
And we'll find our way back to the shore when it's over
What happened to my noisy planet?
When did the sun go nova?
In dim light I can tell by the hollow look in your eyes
Using technology to live on this slow night
I'm starting to realize I'll die long before
I'll die long before we become extinct
I'll die long before we become extinct
The sun will do all its interesting end of the world things
Crunch the numbers till we become sick
Sway with the waves, with the waves change
And we'll find our way back to the shore when it's over
Sway with the waves, with the waves change
And we'll find our way back to the shore when it's overEmbed
