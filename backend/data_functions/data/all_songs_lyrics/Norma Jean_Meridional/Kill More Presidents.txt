Kill More Presidents LyricsI don't believe you can be troubled
Another day, another customer paying
For it. I'll swallow every knife on this table
Another day, another year with you would shake the ground in the sea
Scarcity of lust, heartlessness prevails
I guess we'll kill more presidents!
We'll need their faces for all the cash we'll get from selling our family
Where are you now?
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same
Remember, it's a buyer's market when you sell your soul, sell your soul
Scarcity of lust, heartlessness prevails
I guess we'll kill more presidents!
We'll need their faces for all the cash we'll get from selling our family
Where are you now?
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same
Our hearts will never... hearts will never... hearts will never... hearts
Will never....
Scarcity of lust, heartlessness prevails
I guess we'll kill more presidents!
We'll need their faces for all the cash we'll get from selling our family
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same
Where are you now?
We've waited so long and our hearts will never be the same...
Our hearts never will be the same...
The same...
The sameEmbed
