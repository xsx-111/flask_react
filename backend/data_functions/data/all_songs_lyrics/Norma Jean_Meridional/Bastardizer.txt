Bastardizer LyricsSomeday you'll pass with relief from the tossing sea of despair
Onto the solid ground of truth
Nothing you can say will prove me a bastard
I'm left with everything, still stray to question
"Why?", "why?", "why?" "why?" "why?"
Our hands were on the same spear that drove into His side
And we're the ones that wound up paralyzed, paralyzed and loved
Endlessly we drift inside your distractions and no one is safe
Nothing is safe from you, from you
Nothing you can say will prove me a bastard
I'm left with everything
Still stray to question "Why?", "why?", "why?"
Our hands were on the same spear that drove into his side
And we're the ones that wound up paralyzed, paralyzed and loved
You're like a never-ending soap opera
And we're ready to find out who kills J.R
We found a better way!
We found a better way!
We found a better way!
We found a better way!
We found a better way!
We found a better way! Yeah
We found a better way!
We found a better way!Embed
