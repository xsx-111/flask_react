High Noise Low Output Lyrics
Yeah!
And I sat through a thousand suns, much sooner than you arrived
And I know what you're thinking:
"Just pull the ripcord and let's descend."

You put your parachutes on parade
And you left the pilots on the ground
But if you're calling me in
Then you better believe I'm gonna call you out
(If you're calling me in, I'm gonna call you out)

Who knows the cost and what may escape you and I
'Cause it's a long way down from here
I have a feeling that we won't be landing soon

Parachutes on parade
And you left the pilots on the ground
But if you're calling me in
Then you better believe I'm gonna call you out

We're standing at these doors
Whether cowards or conquerors
They make no promises
They just provide an opening
And your speech is a thunderous noise
And my ears are catching a dreadful static
You put your parachutes on parade
And you left the pilots on the ground
But if you're calling me in
Then you better believe I'm gonna call you out
Out, out, out, out, out

Yeah!
If you're calling me in, I'm gonna call you outEmbed
