Deathbed Atheist (KC Blitz remix) LyricsWatch it all change and watch it go away
Watch it all never be the same again
Watch it all all be nothing like we thought before
Watch it all. Watch it
Watch it all be lies, damned lies, statistics
Lie to me. Lie to me. Lie to me
Take it all in and take it all from me
Take it all and bury it deep inside of you
Take it all and run away
Take it all forever
Take it all. x5
Bury your hands in the sand
You'll never use them on me again
X2
Lie, take it all
Take it. Take it all. Take it
X2
Bury your hands in the sand
You'll never use them on me again
X2
I'm exhausted from shaking hands with your meat hook fingers
This is my nightmare x12
Lie to me, this is my nightmare
Lie, this is my nightmare, to me
This is my nightmare. x2
Bury your hands in the sand
You'll never use them on me again
X2
And I'm exhausted from shaking hands with your meat hook fingers
Lies, damned lies, statistics
Lie to me. Lie to me. Lie to me
Lie, bury your hands in the sand
Lie, you'll never use them on me again
LieEmbed
