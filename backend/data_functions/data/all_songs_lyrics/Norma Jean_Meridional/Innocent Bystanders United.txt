Innocent Bystanders United Lyrics
These tears are carving trenches in my skin
Put down the microscope, rip off my scales and take a look inside
'Cause I feel like, like Jesus don't, don't come around much more these days

Skeletons are falling out through every fracture
Look away, look away, there's nothing to see here

Lies and mistakes all know me by my name, and
And now they refuse to leave me alone, haunting me with their mutiny

But there's no future in, in being a dinosaur, and
And there's no future in the way I have been living
But there's a hell of a past, so pull up a chair and I'll give you a good story
Because I know you're not attracted to the truth

Skeletons are falling out through every fracture
Look away, look away, there's nothing to see here
Skeletons are falling out through every fracture
Look away, look away, there's nothing to see here

There's a hell of a past, so pull up a chair and I'll give you a good storyEmbed
