Falling From the Sky: Day Seven LyricsYou have never taken any inspiration
In a direction
That won't end up with the death of you
Do you really think all the saints are just lying
Just lying
Just lying in their graves?
Where are we supposed to go?
I want you to remember this
Just because I understand
Doesn't mean I really care
Have you become smarter than your own father?
Are you ready
To lead with no lesson?
Your death will bring you all the answers
That you've been looking for
How does it feel to kill?
Where are we supposed to go?
I want you to remember this
Just because I understand
Doesn't really mean I care
The fruit has been tasted
And their blood is on your hands
You won't know the truth soon enough my friend
Did you think that ended it?
Do you really think it's over?
You will have all of the answers
Soon enough my friend
You're standing near the edge
Falling from the sky
Day one: You never learned to fly
Falling into the ocean
Day seven: You never learned to swim
Sinking to the bottom of the ocean
Day twenty: How could you see the bottom?
Sinking to the bottom of the ocean
Day one hundred
Day one hundred
Day one hundred
Why can't you see the bottom?
Why can't you see the bottom?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see the bottom?
Why can't you see the bottom?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see?Embed
