Leaderless and Self Enlisted LyricsEnslavement wasn't my first choice
My will is greater than that, believe me
I'd scratch away to the center
I'd bite it down to the blood
I want to rip out the foundation
I want the axis to rupture
I never wanted to tell you since we know you've heard it before
Yeah, I never wanted to show you since we know you've seen it before
I break your heart
I know, I know you've felt it before
Yeah, too many things try to pull me down
Life seems to be like a dropping cloud
Believe me, I'd scratch away to the center
I'd bite it down to the blood
I want to rip out the foundation
I want the axis to rupture
I'd scratch away to the center
I'd bite it down to the blood
I never wanted to tell you since we know you've heard it before
Yeah, I never wanted to show you since we know you've seen it before
I break your heart
I know, I know you've felt it before
So many times before, before
I'd scratch away to the center
I'd bite it down to the blood, the blood
I'd scratch away to the center
I'd bite it down to the blood
I'd scratch away to the center
I'd bite it down to the blood
I'd bite it down to the bloodEmbed
