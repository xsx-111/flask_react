The People That Surround You on a Regular Basis LyricsThis is pain draped in excellence, and there's no way to bury it
I awake resolute and numb, climbing 15 stories just to fall asleep at the edge
And I'm praying for a sleepless night
And how does this darkness always find me?
This is the time for you to leave in peace or stay and die
We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope
We hope you never find us, we hope you never find us anywhere
We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope
We hope you never find us, we hope you never find us
I have nothing left but to let you lay there and die for it
So just give up and write it down
If you're paying for it, yeah, you might as well wager it
We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope
We hope you never find us, we hope you never find us anywhere
We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope
We hope you never find us, we hope you never, no
We hope you never find us, cover your shallow grave
We hope you never find us, cover your shallow grave
We hope you never
Anywhere
We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope
We hope you never find us, we hope you never find us anywhere
We're crashing down and burning out with every word you say
We're burning through the atmosphere and we hope, we hope you never find us
We hope you never find us anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
And we hope, we hope you never find us, we hope you never find usEmbed
