Blood Burner LyricsIt's been years of waiting here for you, you, and I'm not waiting anymore here for you, you, here they burn for murder
So now I want to see the world burn in flames, flames
And I'll light the match, till you respect me, till you respect me
Until you respect me
Burn for
It's been years of waiting here for you, you
And I'm not waiting anymore here for you, you
'Cause here they burn for murder
So now I want to see the world burn in flames, flames
And I'll light the match, till you respect me, till you respect me, till you respect me
Till you respect me
'Cause I will not speak until you respect me
'Cause I will not speak until you respect me, till you respect me
Yeah, yeah
Fiction is me and I'm my own apathy
I have done nothing with my pistols
They say it just takes a second to die, but I was set up to be knocked down
Well, it's all over now
Somewhere a violin plays as I watch this ship capsize
But I am a long mean streak of independence
And between you and I
There's no difference, no difference, no difference, there's no differenceEmbed
