Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance Lyrics
There will come a time when everybody who is lonely will be free to sing and dance and love!
There will come a time when every evil that we know will be an evil that we can rise above!
Who cares if hair is long or short or sprayed or partly grayed?
We know that hair ain't where it's at
There will come a time when you won't even be ashamed if you are fat (Wah, wah, wah, wah!)

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, ah-ah-ah
Day-lay-lay (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Day-lay-lay (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Day-lay-lay (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Day-lay-lay (Deedle-deedle-dee)
Wah, wah, wah, wah!

There will come a time when everybody who is lonely will be free to sing and dance and love! (dance and love)
There will come a time when every evil that we know will be an evil that we can rise above! (rise above)
Who cares if you're so poor you can't afford to buy a pair of mod-a-go-go stretch elastic pants?
There will come a time when you can even take your clothes off when you dance!1Embed
