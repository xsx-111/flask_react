Lonely Little Girl Lyrics
You're a lonely little girl
But your mommy and your daddy don't care
You're a lonely little girl

The things they say just hurt your heart
It's too late now for them to start
To understand
The way you feel
The world for them is too unreal

So you're lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely little girl
You're lonely

All your children are poor unfortunate victims of systems beyond their control
Where did Annie go when she went to town?
Who are all those creeps that she brings around?
A plague upon your ignorance and the gray despair of your ugly life
All your children are poor unfortunate victims of lies-Embed
