Absolutely Free LyricsSuzy: I don't do publicity balling for you anymore
FZ: The first word in this song is "discorporate." It means to leave your body
Discorporate and come with me
Shifting, drifting
Cloudless, starless
Velvet valleys and a sapphire sea, wah wah
Unbind your mind, there is no time
To lick your stamps and paste them in
Discorporate and we will begin, wah wah
("Flower Power" sucks)
Diamonds on velvets on goldens on Vixen
On Comet and Cupid on Donner and Blitzen
On up and away and afar and a go-go
Escape from the weight of your corporate logo
Unbind your mind, there is no time
To lick your stamps
And paste them in
Discorproate and we'll begin
Freedom, freedom, kindly loving
You'll be absolutely free
Only if you want to be
Dreaming on cushions of velvet and satin
To music by magic by people that happen
To enter the world of a strange purple Jell-O
The dreams as they live them are all mellow yellow
Unbind your mind, there is no time
To lick your stamps
And paste them in
Discorporate and we'll begin
Freedom, freedom, kindly loving
You'll be absolutely free
Only if you want to be
You'll be absolutely free
Only if you want to beEmbed
