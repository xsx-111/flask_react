Mom & Dad Lyrics
Mama, Mama
Someone said they made some noise
The cops have shot some girls and boys
You'll sit home and drink all night
They looked too weird, it served them right

Mama, Mama
Someone said they made some noise
The cops have shot some girls and boys
You'll sit home and drink all night
They looked too weird, it served them right

Ever take a minute just to show a real emotion
In between the moisture cream and velvet facial lotion?
Ever tell your kids you're glad that they can think?
Ever say you loved 'em? Ever let 'em watch you drink?
Ever wonder why your daughter looks so sad?
It's such a drag to have to love a plastic mom and dad!

Mama, Mama
Your child was killed in the park today
Shot by the cops as she quietly lay
By the side of the creeps she knew...
...They killed her tooEmbed
