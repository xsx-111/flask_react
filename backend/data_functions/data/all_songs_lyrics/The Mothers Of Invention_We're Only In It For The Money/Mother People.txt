Mother People Lyrics
Do it again! Do it again!

We are the other people
We are the other people
We are the other people
You're the other people too!
Found a way to get to you

Do you think that I'm crazy?
Out of my mind?
Do you think that I creep in the night
And sleep in a phone booth?

Lemme take a minute to tell you my plan
Lemme take a minute to tell who I am
If it doesn't show, think you better know
I'm another person

Do you think that my pants are too tight?
Do you think that I'm creepy?
Lemme take a minute to tell you my plan
Lemme take a minute to tell who I am
If it doesn't show, think you better know
I'm another person

We are the other people
We are the other people
We are the other people
You're the other people too!
Found a way to get to you

We are the other people
We are the other people
We are the other people
You're the other people too!
Found a way to get to you

Do you think that I love you?
Stupid & blind
Do you think that I dream through the night
Of holding you near me?

Lemme take a minute to tell you my plan
Lemme take a minute to tell who I am
If it doesn't show, think you better know
I'm another personEmbed
