Hot Poop LyricsGary Kellgren:
He is working the controls because all he does is love to turn knobs
They think it is the way they can create
I wonder what everyone else is whispering about
(Played backwards)
Better look around before you say you don't care
Shut your fucking mouth about the length of my hair
How would you survive if you were alive, shitty little person
(snork noises)Embed
