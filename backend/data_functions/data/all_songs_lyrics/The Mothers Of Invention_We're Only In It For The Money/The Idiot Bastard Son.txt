The Idiot Bastard Son Lyrics
The idiot bastard son
The father's a Nazi in congress today
The mother's a hooker somewhere in L.A

The idiot bastard son
Abandoned to perish in back of a car
Kenny will stash him away in a jar
The idiot boy!

I never wanted to because I was too small to start with, I used to drink really some bad stuff . . . Wine, all kinds of wine! Mixed, seven different varieties . . . Thunderbird wine . . . I don't know but I chugged a fifth of White Port once and passed out one day (heh heh) . . . and I drank a quart of beer just before that . . . and we were out riding around in the desert
(. . . very strange . . . Anyway!)

Try and imagine
The window all covered in green
All the time he would spend
At the church, he'd attend...
Warming his pew

Kenny will feed him & Ronnie will watch
The child will thrive and grow
And enter the world
Of liars & cheaters & people like you
Who smile & think you know what this is about
You think you know everything... maybe so
The song we sing: do you know?
We're listening...
The idiot boy!

Try and imagine
The window all covered in green
All the time he would spend
All the colors he'd blend
Where are they now?

Right now I have two hit records on the charts, but it has not made me any money. It has only brought me fame and glory, and a lot of work. Which I do, really not care to tellEmbed
