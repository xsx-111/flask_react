Concentration Moon Lyrics
Concentration Moon
Over the camp in the valley
Concentration Moon
Wish I was back in the alley
With all of my friends
Still running free
Hair growing out
Every hole in me

American way, how did it start?
Thousands of creeps killed in the park
American way, try and explain
Scab of a nation driven insane
Don't cry
Gotta go bye bye
Suddenly die, die
Cop kill a creep, pow pow pow

Gary Kellgren: Tomorrow I get to do another Frank Zappa creation . . . and the day after that . . . and the day after that . . . also at the same time I get to work with The Velvet Underground which is as shitty a group as Frank Zappa's group
JCB: Hi, boys & girls, I'm Jimmy Carl Black, and I'm the Indian of the group

Concentration Moon
Over the camp in the valley
Concentration Moon
Wish I was back in the alley
With all of my friends
Still running free
Hair growing out
Every hole in me
American way, threatened by us
Drag a few creeps away in a bus
American way, prisoner lock
Smash every creep in the face with a rock
Don't cry
Gotta go bye bye
Suddenly die, die
Cop kill a creep, pow pow powEmbed
