Cold Son Lyrics
At the center where they go on weekdays
It takes hours just to slay that thirst
Heavy heels and a daunting post rate
Bad idea for your blistered toast
To my wheel well you're getting close
So say adios
The conjecture is reject the rose
Don't stay high, high, high on abuse

Sometimes it feels like the world's stuffed with feathers
Table bottom gum just holding it together

A cold son
I am
A cold son
I am

You can chase it but it won't come easy
It's a revelry so silver quick
It gets solid when you're old and hazy
Takes no leverage to make me click
To my wheel well you're getting close
The tension grows
Defy conjecture and accept the rose
Don't stay high, high, high on abuse
Who is that said the world is my oyster?
I feel like a nympho stuck in a cloister

A cold son
I am
A cold son
I am

Face plant, stumble ahead
Victim of your rival pretensions know me
Face plant, we stumble ahead
Rival to the bitter pretensions know me

Cold son
I am
A cold son
I amEmbed
