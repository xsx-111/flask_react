Hopscotch Willie Lyrics
Hopscotch Willie swore he was framed
He was a mark not a killer, so he did claim
It was a classic example of a fall guy
Facts all point to skinny white ass
He had the motive and the means, and a weapon to match
And if he managed to escape the long arms of the law
I will be shocked because I know that he is going down

The dick said to Willie, you're in the clink
So save the the pity party for the county shrink
I'm sure they'll find some profound parallels to mine
You can't blame me for my guilty face
It was a gift from my mother, my father in place
Of all the love they should have given
They just left me with this dirty DNA
That makes you think I'm the one you want


Do a little hopscotch, do a little hopscotch, do a little hopscotch, Willie hopscotch
Do a little hopscotch, Willie hopscotch, do a little Willie hopscotch, Willie hopscotch
Do a little hopscotch, Willie hopscotch, do a Willie Willie hopscotch, Willie hopscotch
Do a little hopscotch Willie hopscotch, do a little Willie hopscotch, Wilie Willie hopscotch Willie!
This all went down not far away just a weak stone's throw from Sheepshead Bay
A corpse was found in pieces underneath the pier
Willie was found not far from the scene
He was panting like a pitbull, minus the mean
He was panting like a pitbull, panting like a pitbull, pantin like a pitbull
Panting like a pitbull minus the mean
Minus the mean, minus the mean, minus the mean, minus the mean, minus the mean, minus the mean, minus the mean1Embed
