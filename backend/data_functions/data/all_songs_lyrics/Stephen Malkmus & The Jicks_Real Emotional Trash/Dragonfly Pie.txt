Dragonfly Pie Lyrics
Of all my stoned digressions
Some have mutated into the truth
Not a spoof
You are the bold expression
Of all your parent's loss
Which you pause, there's no us

Can't be what you ought to be
Gotta be what you wanna be
Take it with pride and like a dragonfly
Dragonfly wants a piece of pie
But he is so strung out
Shake me off the knife because I want to go home
Shake me off the knife because I want to go home
Shake me off the knife because I want to go home
Shake me off the knife because I want to go home


Cursed to be named after jazz songs
High school friends support show and tell
Preach and yell
Ghostly Iraqian starship
Ghostly I turn up and go
No more signs
No more lines
Can't be what you wanna be
Gotta be what you ought to be
Take it with pride and like a dragonfly
Dragonfly wants a piece of pie
He is so strung out
Shake me off the knife because I want to go home
Shake me off the knife because I want to go home
Shake me off the knife because I want to go home
Shake me off the knife because I want to go homeEmbed
