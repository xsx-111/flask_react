Wicked Wanda Lyrics
Wicked, wicked Wanda
What was it that spawned ya
Who's responsible for your trash?
Oh pretty little spider
With Hollywood inside her
And no time to accommodate

The chicken scratch, the bare-ass back, whomever
Avoid your scream, paralyze dream forever

Wicked, wicked Wanda
I'd rather date Rwanda
Than be involved in your moral trap
Oh pretty little spider
With Hollywood inside her
And no time to accommodate

Venom kicks, a one-eyed Jick, a feather
The basement screams, a parent to me forever

Do be free of doubt and longing
Simple clarity belonging
In a role untouched by history
To be part of something vaster than yourself
The frozen plaster
Break out of your core categories
Strike me square into the arms of the air
Strike me square into the arms of the air

Stories not reality, I feel like a junk contraption
Truth is I can't shake this vile fear
When I space out I'm direct
I got no ego to reflect with
Free to be a temperamental tear

Strike me square into the arms of the air
Strike me square into the arms of the airEmbed
