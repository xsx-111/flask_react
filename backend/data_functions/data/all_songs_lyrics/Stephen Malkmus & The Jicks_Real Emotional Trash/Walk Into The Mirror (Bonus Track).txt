Walk Into The Mirror (Bonus Track) LyricsThought became the rhythm
Rhythm became love
Love became the music
Like hail from above
It's a crazy game
A movement, communal
Whistle through the pain
Jilted 60s love, the songs are all the same
So the soldier said
We could disappear
Off a cliff so sheer
Stumble again
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk into the mirror?
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk away?
(Listen to, listen to Stephen)
I'm not after meaning
I'm not digging fame
I don't need disposable lies to feed the flames of philosophy
Easy come, easy come, easy come, go
Easy come, easy come, easy come, go
Such a monumental insult
To the pioneers
Of the sound so dear
So shuffle again
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk into the mirror?
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk away?
(Listen to, listen to Stephen)
Had enough of the beer and gadgets
That any normal man could take
Now I know that the mirror's had it
It's time to separate
You know, it's time to separate
Reef and coral panic, ocean of denial
Waves are rushing over
Ends up in a pile, a catastrophe
Song about the levee
Driving in my Chevy
No, you're not heavy
No, you're not my brother
I'm alone in this vortex
Where do we go from here
If I let you steer over the edge?
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk into the mirror?
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk into the mirror?
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk into the mirror?
Don't you want to walk
Don't you want to walk away?
(Listen to, listen to Stephen)Embed
