Real Emotional Trash Lyrics

Takin' out the wife
We're taking out the wife
It's that kind of night
Will everybody talk, everybody listen, nobody breathe
Take the time, let 'em go down
'Cause daddy's on the run
Daddy's on the run
The trail has two ruts and
One is just a tunnel
The other is a funnel to the tomb
Easy said but less often done
Point me in the direction
Of your real emotional trash

Abstract citizen
The abstract city-sun
Up to now is done
Never gonna to stray
Never gonna to stray
Never gonna to stray
Take the time let him go down
'Cause daddy's on the run
Daddy's on the run
And who will get there first?
Should the bubble burst?
Easy said but less often done
Point me in the direction
Of your real emotional trash



I traipsed over the Mexican border in a cheap caravan man
Like a snake with five eggs stuck in my stomach, I needed some relief
Made it back to 'Frisco in a vanity chest
Two painted ladies on house arrest
So wax up the waxed fruit, it's time for a shine
Its the old fruit that makes wine
Police me, police me, police me, police me

You got no reputation, never took a swing
Silent when they handed spines out
In the sham marina playin' mercy game, no time for you to bow
Down in Sausalito we had clams for desert
You spilled some chardonnay on your gypsy skirt
There's no more time for apricots
He's got to make his own shade
Police me, police me, police me, police meEmbed
