Gardenia Lyrics
I kinda like the way you dot your "J"s
With giant circles of naïveté
The kind of circles include everything
Don't mean to damn you with the faintest phrase
It's just a symptom of the blithe age
Walter Lippmann he would be amazed

So you've got some curb appeal
But can you cook a three course meal?
Or are you just a present
Waiting to be opened up and parceled out again?
Hey!

You are a gardenia
Pressed in the campaign journal
In the rucksack of an Afrikaaner candidate for mild reform

It's like we're at a Ponzi scaminar
There's no escaping without a door prize
They're operating at significant loss
And now the way that you watch your weight
Richard Avedon, Richard Avedon would
Richard Avedon would surely approve
So much for your curb appeal
So much for the three course meals
'Cause I am not a present
Waiting to be opened up and parceled out again
Hey!

Well the torture of the Van Wyck Expressway at 5pm on Friday
Gives you some idea of how rejection makes me feel
Well you are a gardenia
You are a gardeniaEmbed
