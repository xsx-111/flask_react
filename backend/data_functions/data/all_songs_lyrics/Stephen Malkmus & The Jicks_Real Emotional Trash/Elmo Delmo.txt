Elmo Delmo Lyrics
I came to call your dare
And look you up on all you claim to want to share
Claim to want to share
Don't cater to the throng in your head
'Cause this is not a passenger line
Everybody's red
Elusive like consume to acquire
A house sunken church
Expanding candle necklace of hale
A snow stricken ghost will politic the edge of infinity
The habit technique ingrained

We are not here to pray
So fleet of foot and smart in suits of charcoal gray
Suits of charcoal gray
Bring to the fore a thought corridor
A purple puma's guarding the gate
A metal grato
You'll hear no echoes isn't it sweet
The people you meet
Connected with the calendar kids
At one with the grid
It turns me into a double form iris
Dissociation every turnpike

Right after work, nonstop grin
Arctic Circle nonstop winds
Shamrock justice for the ice mall
He is long loss lost Elmo Delmo
Elmo Delmo, Elmo Delmo
Elmo Delmo, Elmo Delmo
Elmo Delmo, Elmo Delmo
Elmo Delmo, Elmo Delmo
Elmo Delmo, Elmo Delmo
Elmo Delmo

You versed my type from Elmo Delmo
Siezed my life from Elmo Delmo
