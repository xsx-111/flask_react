TRIP Lyrics
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

Flap, flap, flap your wings, go high
Go high, go high
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride around the night
This little town, I wanna say goodbye
To everybody here cause they're all the same
I hate this place
And everybody here is all the same
Life's a disgrace

Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Flying on my rocket ship (ay!), I'm on an acid trip (ay!)
I need another pill, snort and let it drip
I'm with my white friends, we getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs, we suffocatin' (ay!)
We get all our drug (ay!) and education
"You came with black folks?" Hoe, your parents racist
You say they hate me? Well, I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends (ay!)
Everybody smilin', I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends, guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes, I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny, wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds with honey, save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void, I don't know what I discover
I know I could hear the thunder, I can feel the hunters
They be preying on my hunger, I won't let 'em make me suffer 'cause

Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?
Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?14Embed
