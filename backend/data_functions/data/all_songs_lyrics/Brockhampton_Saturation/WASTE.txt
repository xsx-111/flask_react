WASTE Lyrics
Was I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk

Losing my way, oh
Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
(No worries) Losing my way, oh
Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy
Seeing your name
Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry
But I'll be fine, yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh41Embed
