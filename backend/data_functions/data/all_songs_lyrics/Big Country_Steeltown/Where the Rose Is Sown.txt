Where the Rose Is Sown LyricsWe're at war All the papers say
We will win I read today
We are strong It wasn't us
We are right Who started this?
Leave your work I just left school
Leave your home I am no fool
Take up arms It left me strong
Sound alarms The school bell rings
Sons of men who stand like gods
We give life to feed the cause
And run to ground our heathen foe
Our name will never die
This time will be forever
Join up here I wave goodbye
We need you Oh, my breast sighs
Have no fear I must try
God will be with braver men
Take the vow I know its right
Praise the flag The good fight
We're at war I'm on my way
We will win Why do I pray?
Sons of men who stand like gods
We give life to feed the cause
And run to ground our heathen foe
Our name will never die
This time will be forever
I wait here in this hole
Playing poker with my soul
I hold the rifle close to me
It lights the way to keep me free
If I die in a combat zone
Box me up and ship me home
If I die and still come home
Lay me where the rose is sown
Sons of men who stand like gods
We give life to feed the cause
And run to ground our heathen foe
Our name will never die
This time will be foreverEmbed
