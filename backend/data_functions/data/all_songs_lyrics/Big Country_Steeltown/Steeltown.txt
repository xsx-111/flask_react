Steeltown LyricsHere I stand with my own kin
At the end of everything
Finaly the dream is gone
I've had enough of hanging on
I came here with all my friends
Leaving behind the weight of years
Leaving alone in a flood of tears
Out on a prospect that never ends
All the landscape was the mill
Grim as the reaper with a heart like hell
With a river of bodies flowing with the bell
Here was the future for hands of skill
We built all this with our own hands
But who could know we built on sand?
Now it's barren all to soon
There is no miracle in ruin
We set the flame and it burned so blue
With open eyes I watched it grow
A sea of palms in an ocean of snow
Hands with the courage to start anew
Here was a home for the lost and scared
Out of the yards and the run dry dock
To the call of the steel that would never stop
Here was a refuge for those who dared
CHORUS
In a steeltown when the heat's on
I went down and the heat turned on me
In a steeltown when the heat's on
I went down and the heat turned on me
And now I stand with my own kin
At the end of everything
Finaly the dream is gone
Nothing left to hang upon
