Come Back To Me LyricsThe day they had a party
Right out in the street
Flags and flowers and singing
For the homecome hero's treat
I sat in the kitchen
Without a fire on the range
I knew this house had lost the cause
To ever make me warm again
Come back to me
Days are all too long
Come back to me
You never should have gone
I was so young and full of pride
And you were wild and strong
I never knew how weak I was
I watched them gather round him
When he stepped down from the car
While tears fell on my cigarette
He handed out cigars
I have your child inside me
But you will never know
I never will forget you
While I watch that child grow
Come back to me
Days are all to long
Come back to me
You never should have gone
I was so young and full of pride
And you were wild and strong
I never knew how weak I was
I was so young and full of pride
(I never, I never, I never...)
I will always be here
Fading by the day
I will wash the bloody hands
And cast the bowl away
As the years hang on me
You will always be young
And one day I will lie down
Where the rose was flung
Come back to me
Days are all to long
Come back to me
You never should have gone
I was so young and full of pride
And you were wild and strong
I never knew how weak I wasEmbed
