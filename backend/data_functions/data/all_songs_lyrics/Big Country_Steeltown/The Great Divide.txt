The Great Divide LyricsHey, hey...
Here comes the great divide, I walk the slide
That only killers will fear
Here comes the skill of choice and all the noise
That I will ring along
Here comes a sign of hope, a length of rope
To measure all our living
I was the mother's son, I took the fun
And knew what I was giving
And suddenly I find the truth
And all it is is sighs and youth
Fire away, fire away
Push the token door
Lie away, steal a day
Make the engine roar
Fire away, fire away
Push the token door
Hey, hey...
I hope I never fall behind the wall
Although the sound would ring
A skill that will take years and still know fear
Although I never did lie
I had the foreman's kiss, I never lisped
Iâ€™m sure it was a downfall
And suddenly I find the truth
And all it is is sighs and youth
Fire away, fire away
Push the token door
Lie away, steal a day
Make the engine roar
Fire away, fire away
Push the token door
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Here comes the great divide
Here comes a sign of hope
Here comes the great divide, I walk the slide
I hope I never fall
I know my machine, I sweat and steam
Until the job card colors
I know all my dreams, I shout and scream
Until the day's first break
And suddenly I find the truth
And suddenly I find the truth
And all it is is sighs and youth
Fire away, fire away
Push the token door
Lie away, steal a day
Make the engine roar
Fire away, fire away
Push the token door
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Here comes the great divide
And I know all my dreams
Here comes the great divide
Here comes the great divideEmbed
