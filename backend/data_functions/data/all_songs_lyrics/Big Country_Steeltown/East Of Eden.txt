East Of Eden LyricsI feel the way the wind blows
It tells me where you've been through
I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night's inside you
Some days I just don't worry
I let it pour through me
Some days I need to bury
The very depths of me
So I wait out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
And though it all seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leaves me
Some days I just don't worry
I let it pour through me
Some days I call upon
The very depths of me
So I wait out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Some days will stay a thousand years
Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go?
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom
And I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers
And I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry
I let it pour through me
Some days I walk into
The very depths of me
So I wait out here to the east of Eden
I let my conscience be
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be there for me?
When I felt that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with meEmbed
