Belief In The Small Man LyricsJust as one life turns from birth
Just as the ring finds its worth
Just as the leaf turns to gold
So you and I will be sold
Sold for the work done
While we could feel young
Sold for the new son
Gold for the pure one
Where does our home lie
When is our own
Lonely the cold cry
Only unknown
Dark comes the night on the aged
Hard comes the day still unpaid yet
All in a bed still unmade it
Chokes like the tomb and it says its
Sold for the work done
While we could feel young
Sold for the new son
Gold for the pure one
Where does our home lie
When is our own
Lonely the cold cry
Only unknown, unknown, unknown
One, two, three!
Sold for the work done
While we could feel young
Sold for the new son
Gold for the pure one
Where does our home lie
When is our own
Lonely the cold cry
Only unknown
Sold for the work done
While we could feel young
Sold for the new son
Gold for the pure one
Where does our home lie
When is our own
Lonely the cold cry
Only unknown, unknown, unknown
Sold for the work done
While we could feel young
Sold for the new son
Gold for the pure one
Where does our home lie
When is our own
Lonely the cold cry
Only unknown
Where does our home lie
When is our own
Lonely the cold cry
Only unknown, unknown, unknownEmbed
