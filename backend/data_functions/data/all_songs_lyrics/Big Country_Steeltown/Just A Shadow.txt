Just A Shadow LyricsIt went so well for you
With a place right where you wanted
And the ones to fill it to
But some blows break the spell
That it hits you every day
Until you need to hit as well
It's just a shadow of the man you should be
Like a garden in the forest
That the world will never see
You have no thought of answers
Only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
It all seemed fine for you
Till the struggle of ambition
Turned in violence upon you
Sometimes a landslide comes
If you're hiding in that avalanche
You need a place to run
It's just a shadow of the woman you should be
Like a garden in the forest
That the world will never see
And you have no thought of answers
Only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
I know there is no need for what's been done
I know there is enough for everyone
Frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there's never been a hand
Did we ever have it good
While we lived in Eldorado
Did we find the gold we should
If it really was the truth
Why are faces filled with anger
That should only shine with youth
It's just a shadow of the people we should be
Like a garden in the forest
That the world will never see
You have no thought of answers
Only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
I know there is no need for what's been done
I know there is enough for everyone
Frustration brings a heavy hand to bear
And there never is a hand outside that cares
Still the promise comes of living fit for all
If we only get our back against the wall
I look at backs that pushed the wall for years
Scarred by many knives and too much fearEmbed
