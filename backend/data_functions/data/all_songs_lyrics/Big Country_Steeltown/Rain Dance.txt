Rain Dance LyricsIf I hold my hand to you
Though you never asked me to
You will know it's time for the rains to come
And you must help me through
If you feel the fear on me
That I know the eye can't see
It comes with the sadness that the autumn brings
So we know what has to be
In the rain dance
I cool it all down
It is the year to come
Oh, when this one's run
We are not dust, we are not stone
Just as the wild seed is sown
No one knows how we bring it home
We only take as we have grown
When you put your arms on me
Are they meant to set me free
Or hold me like his master's voice
And put the spell on me
I only have these hands
I only have the land
I fear you like the frost that the spring can bring
Or the fire of a cattle brand
In the rain dance
I cool it all down
It is the year to come
Oh, when this one's run
In the rain dance
I cool it all down
It is the year to come
Oh, when this one's run
We are not dust, we are not stone
Just as the wild seed is sown
No one knows how we bring it home
We only take as we have grown
If I hold my hands to you
Though you never asked me to
You will know it's time for the rains to come
And you must help me through
When we take all this to town
And I buy the wedding gown
We will find the newborn year
As the winter crashes down
In the rain dance
I cool it all down
It is the year to come
Oh, when this one's run
In the rain dance
I cool it all down
It is the year to come
Oh, when this one's runEmbed
