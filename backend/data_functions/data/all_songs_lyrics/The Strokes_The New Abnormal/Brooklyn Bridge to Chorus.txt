Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus Lyrics
One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you
(Hostile, give me a break
Don't say it's in the bottle of air)

And first, he would tell me I'm his friend
Actually, no thanks, I'm okay
And then he would send weird looks my way

I want new friends, but they don't want me
They're making plans while I watch TV
Thought it was you, but maybe it's me
I want new friends, but they don't want me

And the '80s song, yeah, how did it go?
When they said, "This is the beginning of the best years"
Even though, false, break

One shot is never enough
I just wait for this to go into circles
And the distance from my room, is anything so necessary?
I was thinking about that thing that you said last night, so boring
And the '80s bands? Oh, where did they go?
Can we switch into the chorus right now?

I want new friends, but they don't want me
They have some fun, but then they just leave
Is it just them? Or maybe all me?
Why my new friends don't seem to want me

Hurts my case, but that's okay
It hurts my case, but that's okay
We're dancing on a moonbeam
On and on and on and on and on

The deeper I get, the less that I know
That's the way that it go
The less that I know, the deeper I go
Juliet, I adore
The deeper I get, the less that I know
Diminishing returns, oh

Oh, that's how it goes
All I wanna say
On another song
On another day
On another song
On another day
On another song
On another break21Embed
