Good Intentions Lyrics
Babe you can believe me when I say I tried my best
But there's no other way
You deserve the world, I couldn't give you less

But I'm not perfect, the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye

I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions

And it's a shame
Oh, all the heartache that I went and put you through
I take the blame
Cause the truth, there's really nothing you could do

But I'm not perfect, the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye
I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I  had good intentions

But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye
But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye3Embed
