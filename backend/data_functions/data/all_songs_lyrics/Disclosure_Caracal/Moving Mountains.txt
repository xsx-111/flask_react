Moving Mountains Lyrics

I can't stop
Whether you know or not
I ain't strong
And it's something in you that I'm dependent on
Worth a shot
Even though I've lost the plot
I know it's wrong
But it's something in you that I'm dependent on

Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself far too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

You give nothing to me
Still why do you feel like someone I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

Such a shame
Time for me to make a change
With what you've shown
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Lost my name
Trying to put out this flame
I don't know
Maybe you're just another stepping stone

Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself far too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

You give nothing to me
Still why do you feel like someone I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

Feels like I'm
Feels like I'm
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Movin' mountains
Movin' mountains5Embed
