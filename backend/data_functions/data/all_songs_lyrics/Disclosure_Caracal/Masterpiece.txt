Masterpiece Lyrics
Lately, you hold your tongue and don't make a scene
But I see through the fa√ßade
See the queen behind the guard
Gently, you mask the fact that you disagree
Dealt a hand without your card
Had the joker from the start

You're yearning, wearing thin
Searching for something

I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got, baby, what you've got, baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby, what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh, you're the masterpiece

In time, you'll see the colours through your own eyes
You could take the perfect shot
Show the people what you've got
A far cry from insecurity and demise
When your tears come to a stop
You can look down from the top
You're yearning, wearing thin
Searching for something

I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got, baby, what you've got, baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby, what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh you're the masterpiece

What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby1Embed
