Molecules Lyrics
The lights are too bright
Let's turn them down and get to work
You're in the limelight
But I'll flip the switch if you prefer

You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drawn in by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules
I know you want me
But I can act like I don't know
It's nearly morning
So grab your coat, it's time to go

You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drawn in by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules1Embed
