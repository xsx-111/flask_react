Superego Lyrics
It's not your bubble I'm bursting
But soon a penny's gonna drop
Every time we're conversing
I see your head about to pop

I'm looking at you, don't like what I see
You need to touch ground 'til you're level with me
So you better hold it, hold it down, down
This is bigger than you, it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it, hold it down, down, down

This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
So where's your superego?

You're my girl, so it's worth it
I'm gonna hit you with the truth
In this world no one's perfect
We're all consumed by what we do
I'm looking at you, don't like what I see
You need to touch ground and get level with me
So you better hold it, hold it down, down
This is bigger than you, it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it, hold it down, down, down, down

This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
So where's your superego?

You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego
You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego
This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
So where's your superego?2Embed
