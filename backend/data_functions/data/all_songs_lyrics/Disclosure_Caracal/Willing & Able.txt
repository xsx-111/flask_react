Willing & Able Lyrics


Don't say you want me, don't say you need me
If you ain't ready, turn around
Willing and able, cards on the table
And I believe in what we've found

If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no
If there's enough, in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no

If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If you don't feel it, the same as me
Speak now or hold your peace
If you don't see it, the way I see
Then it was never meant to be

If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no
If there's enough, in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no

If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love

If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in12Embed
