Nocturnal Lyrics
Street lights, turn on one by one
My hope is, descending like the sun
Try to tell myself there's freedom in the loneliness (Oh baby)
Always restless, story of my life
Disconnected, body clock's not right
Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight

Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually

My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal

My demons are blocking out the light
And my mind is about to lose the fight
Why can't I find peace, when a caracal could sleep tonight? (Yeah)
Your absence isn't something that I choose (choose, choose choose)
But the truth is you were never mine to lose (lose, lose, lose)
Spending half my life just tryna get away from you (Oh baby, oh)
Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually

My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal (Oh yeah)

My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal24Embed
