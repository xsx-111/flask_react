Echoes Lyrics
You made a promise I won't forget
You were dishonest ever since we met
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
You'd make an honest choice

Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head

Such repetition, cause for concern
I shouldn't listen, but I never learn
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
That you'd make an honest choice

Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head
I've had, I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had, I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
I've had, I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had, I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
Me up, me up, me up, me up
Me up, me up, me up, me up

Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head3Embed
