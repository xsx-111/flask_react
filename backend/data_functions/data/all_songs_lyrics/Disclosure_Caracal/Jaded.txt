Jaded Lyrics
Your words give you away
Be careful how you say my name
Step back, refrain
Be honest and you'll save some face
Cause you're fading
Don't mistake me for a fool
The game you play has changed

Take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind?
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost?
Is this how you survive?

Why, oh why do you have to lie?
What are you afraid of?
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
Soak it up, soak it up and save it
Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
The gospel that you preach
It's poisonous beyond belief
But still, you'll reach
Be careful or the truth might speak
It's amazing when it's there in black and white for all to see
We sow and you reap

Take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind?
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost?
Is this how you survive?

Why, oh why do you have to lie?
What are you afraid of?
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
Soak it up, soak it up and save it
Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
Soak it up, soak it up and save it
Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll raise them
You cannot replace them9Embed
