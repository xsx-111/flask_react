Afterthought Lyrics
Anytime I'm alone, I'm reliving the moment
Does it enter your mind?
Have I already blown it?

Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on

It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Our time together become too short
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?

When you're so hard to read
I wonder what you're hiding
Lying under the leaves
I'm not someone you confide in
Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on

It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Our time together become too short
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Afterthought, afterthought

Get this, get this sound
