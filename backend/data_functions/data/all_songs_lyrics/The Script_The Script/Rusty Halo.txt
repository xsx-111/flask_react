Rusty Halo LyricsIt's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
But you know you had it coming
Know you had it coming
Everyone's running from something
But we don't know when it's coming
So we keep running and running, gotta
Everyone's running from something
But we don't know when it's coming
So we keep running and running and running

Now I'm looking at the Bible trying to find a loophole
Yeah, I'm living for revival, dying for a new soul
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo

(It's been a long time coming)
It's been a long time
(It's been a long time coming)
Yeah, it's been a long time
(It's been a long time coming)
Been so long, but I gotta shine, shine, shine
My rusty halo, whoa
Gotta shine my rusty halo, whoa
Gotta shine my rusty halo

Now I'm running for the light in the tunnel
But it's just the train, but it's just the train
Yeah, I'm looking for the right type of pleasure
But all I find is pain
Now there's no light to guide me on my way home
Now there's no time to shine my rusty halo

(It's been a long time coming)
It's been a long time
(It's been a long time coming)
Yeah, it's been a long time
(It's been a long time coming)
Been so long, but I gotta shine, shine, shine

My rusty halo, whoa
Gotta shine my rusty halo, whoa
Gotta shine my rusty halo
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time

I know I had it coming yeah, yeah
(It's been a long time coming)
I know I had it coming yeah, yeah
(It's been a long time coming)
I know I had it coming yeah, yeah
(It's been a long time coming)
I know that I gotta shine, shine, shine

My rusty halo, whoa
Gotta shine my rusty halo, whoa
Gotta shine my rusty halo
My halo, my halo
Gotta shine my rusty halo
My halo, my halo, I gotta shine
Everyone's running from something
But we don't know when it's coming
So we keep running and running, gotta
Everyone's running from something
But we don't know when it's coming
So we keep running and running and running
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long timeEmbed
