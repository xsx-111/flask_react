If You See Kay Lyrics
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay (If you see Kay)
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay (If you see Kay)

She said I won the battle but I lost the war
And now my head is sore
And if I try to sail back in
She's gonna push me from the shore
Now I won't even get the time of day
No way, no way, no
Not for what I said
But for what I didn't say, what I didn't say, so

If you see Kay, will you tell her that I love her?
And if you see Kay, let her know I want her back
If she'll listen, say I'm missing everything about her
And make sure you say I'm sweet F.A. without her
If you see Kay

If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay (If you see Kay)
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay (If you see Kay)
She got me saying "sorry" through the door
She don't care anymore
She says, "It's too late now
Should've thought of this before," yeah
But I ain't gonna take this as defeat
No way, no way, no
'Cause I'm gonna shout it out to everyone I, everyone I meet

If you see Kay, will you tell her that I love her? Oh, yeah
And if you see Kay, let her know I want her back
If she'll listen, say I'm missing everything about her
And make sure you say I'm sweet F.A. without her
If you see Kay

Now I'm sitting here in disbelief
How it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave
But she was torn between what she wants and what she needs
They say you love someone enough, you gotta set them free
She said that she was born to leave this town behind
Knew the truth but still, she looked me in the eyes and lied
Saying "It's time to cut the ties, time to say goodbye"
So she left, but she never-never left my, never-never left my mind
If you see Kay, will you tell her that I love her? Oh, yeah
And if you see Kay, let her know I want her back
If she'll listen, say I'm missing everything about her
And make sure you say I'm sweet F.A. without her
And make sure you say I lost my way without her
If you see Kay

If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay (If you see Kay)
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay (If you see Kay)
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay
If you see my friend, doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay5Embed
