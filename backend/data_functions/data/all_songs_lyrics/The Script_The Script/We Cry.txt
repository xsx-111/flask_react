We Cry LyricsTogether we cry
Together we cry

Jenny was a poor girl
Living in a rich world
Named her baby "Hope" when she was just fourteen
She was hoping for a better world
For this little girl
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
When she gets that call
Hope's too far gone
Her baby's on the way
With nothing left inside
Together we cry

What about the John play
Could've gone the whole way
Lighting up the stage tryna get a deal
Now he's lighting up the wrong way
Something for the pain
Man, you wanna see this kid
We was so fucking unreal
When he gets that call
He's too far gone
Can't get it together to sing one song
They won't hear tonight
The words of a lullaby
Together we cry
Together we cry
Together we cry
(Oh we cry, we cry, oh we cry, we cry)
Together we cry

Oh, Mary's ambition
She wanna be a politician
She's been dreaming about it since she was a girl
She thought she'd be the one who could change the world
Always tryna pave the way for women in a man's world
But life happened
House, kids, two cars
Husband hits the jar
Checks that don't go very far now
Now she ain't making changes
She keeps her mind on her wages
The only rattling cages are her own
Together we cry
Together we cry

There's so much sad gonna flood the ocean
We're all in tears for a world that's broken
Together we cry
Oh we cry, we cry
Oh we cry

There comes a time where every bird has to fly
At some point, every rose has to die
It's hard to let your children go
Leave home
Where'd they go?
Who knows
Getting drunk, getting stoned all alone
Teach a man to fish
Feed a man for life
Show your kids the truth
Hope they never lie
Instead of reading in a letter
Now they've gone for something better
Bet you're sorry now
I won't be coming home tonight

I'm sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
To teach us how to fly
Together we cry, we cry, we cry
Together we cry
Together we cry
There's so much sad gonna flood the ocean
We're all in tears for a world that's broken
Together we cry
Together we
