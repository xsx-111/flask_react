Fall for Anything LyricsDoes that bring you down, down, down?
Does that bring you down, down, down?
Does that bring you down, down, down?
Does that bring you down, down, down?

Don't give yourself away, don't live your life that way
Of course, he's gonna say anything you want
Then leave quicker than he came, now you got yourself to blame
Don't put yourself back in the fire again

It's the same damn things you're so quick to believe
You do it over and over again
And it's the same mistakes that I'm watching you make
You do it over and over again

So before they bring you down
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
No, you'll fall for anything, no, you'll fall for
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
No, you'll fall for anything, no, you'll fall for
Love that bring you down, down, down
Love that bring you down, down, down
Love that bring you down, down, down
Love that bring you down, down, down
Oh, please don't be so naive, don't wait 'till your heart bleeds
Love wasn't built for speed, listen to me girl
He keeps fucking with your head, tryna get you into bed
And in the morning you'll just hate yourself

It's the same damn things you're so quick to believe
You do it over and over again
And it's the same mistakes that I'm watching you make
You do it over and over again

Before they bring you down
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
No, you'll fall for anything, no, you'll fall for
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
No, you'll fall for anything, no, you'll fall for
Love that bring you down, down, down
Love that bring you down, down, down
Love that bring you down, down, down
Love that bring you down, down, down

And you give until there's nothing to give
Until there's nothing to give, until there's nothing to give
And you give until there's nothing to give
Until there's nothing to give, until there's nothing to give
And you give until there's nothing to give
Until there's nothing to give, until there's nothing to give
Before they bring you down
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
No, you'll fall for anything, no, you'll fall for
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for everything
No, you'll fall for anything, no, you'll fall for
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
No, you'll fall for anything, no, you'll fall for
You've gotta stand for something or you'll fall for anything
No, you'll fall for anything
Before they bring you down, down, down
Cause girl they'll bring you down, down, down
Cause they'll bring you down, down, down
Cause they'll bring you down, down, down, yeah1Embed
