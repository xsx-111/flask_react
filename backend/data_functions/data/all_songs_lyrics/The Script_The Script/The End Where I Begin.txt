The End Where I Begin Lyrics
Sometimes tears say all there is to say
Sometime your first scars won't ever fade away

Tried to break my heart, well it's broke
Tried to hang me high, well I'm choked
Wanted rain on me, well I'm soaked, soaked to the skin
It's the end where I begin, it's the end where I begin

Sometimes we don't learn from our mistakes
And sometimes we've no choice but to walk away, away

Tried to break my heart, well it's broke
Tried to hang me high, well I'm choked
Wanted rain on me, well I'm soaked, soaked to the skin
It's the end where I begin, it's the end where I begin
Now I'm alive and the ghosts are gone
I've shed all the pain, I've been holding on
The cure for a heart is to move along
So move along, so move along
Now I'm alive and the ghosts are gone
I've shed all the pain, I've been holding on
The cure for a heart is to move along
So move along, so move along
Now I'm alive and the ghosts are gone
I've shed all the pain, I've been holding on
What don't kill a heart only makes it strong

Sometimes tears say all there is to say
Sometime your first scars won't ever fade away

Tried to break my heart, well it's broke
Tried to hang me high, well I'm choked
Wanted rain on me, well I'm soaked, soaked to the skin
It's the end, end where I, end where I, end where I begin
It's the end where I, end where I, end where I begin

Sometimes we don't learn from our mistakes
And sometimes we've no choice but to walk away, away1Embed
