Sgt. Sunshine LyricsSunrise
The milk man rides his clanging cow
The sun explodes above the brow
The village venom's daily vow
That can't tell when from anyhow
That seized a grip upon it's plow
And knows how much to raise a brow
When steps are taken to allow
A thoughtful thought to take a bow
But all the time it's now somehow
All the time it's now
And Sgt. Sunshine's made the choice
Sgt. Sunshine smokes the choice
Sgt. Sunshine struck for light
Outside the city hall
With the sky so blue, to fall into
And disappear, today
And away, away across the self-same day
Young Johnny's Mum is heard to say
'A stitch in ten saves nine astray'
And— 'hey look, even the Sun kneels down to pray'
Sgt Sunshine knows his faults
He rides the endless next-last waltz
Says he loves his liver salts
And the Moon speaks English, true or false?
And all the time it's now somehow
All the time it's now
Your gravestones mark the past, my friends
Your bank balance marks the future
You live for them,— you don't live now
I hope you like your torture...
And Sgt. Sunshine's made the point
Sgt. Sunshine's made the joint
Sgt. Sunshine struck for light
Outside the city hall
Sgt. Sunshine
Sgt. Sunshine
