Renegade LyricsI'm letting go
To see if you'll hold on to me
I'm in doubt
Of what is thought and what is real
In our room
Between the shapes I thought I knew
A guillotine
A pillow with feathers like snow
I've come
To a listening post beyond your lines
I'm all ears
To gather clues and look for signs
But I can't hear
The song you sing while you try to soothe
Why are you whispering
While the bombs are falling?
Go easy on me
I can't help what I'm doing
Go easy on me
Oh, I can't help what I'm doing
Hello again
I buried you, where have you been?
My renegade
You came back from the labyrinth
Unlike me
You've looked for things that could be found
And the thread
That guides through black times
Go easy on me
I can't help what I'm doing
Go easy on me
Oh, I can't help what I'm doing
When thoughts
Had outnumbered spoken words
In the early hours
We failed to establish
Who was hurt
