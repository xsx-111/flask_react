Peacetime Resistance LyricsFeeling the comfort of eyes is your sole intention
We all want to be understood unconditionally
But you have to realize that a viewer needs distance
And the moment your wall melts down - the inside is outside
Maybe way back in the past when people were different
Shortening bonds made them last
Now we emphasize our difference
We have been enrolled one by one for the Peacetime Resistance
And we're fighting our battles alone
We've got four eyes - so why yearn for one perspective?
We've got colours with shades erased when blended
We've got four eyes - so why yearn for one perspective?
We've got colours, but they disappear when blendedEmbed
