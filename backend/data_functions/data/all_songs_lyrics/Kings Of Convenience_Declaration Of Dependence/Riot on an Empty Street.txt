Riot on an Empty Street LyricsWhy, why so quiet
Oh my mysterious country singer she asked
My life, it's a riot
I am climbing barricades in empty streets at night
When I'm down fighting shadows
Twenty-five postcards in a box in my room
Telephone conversations
Gas slowly leaking out of a heart shaped balloon
It's a dangerous game
That I'm not sure if I could keep playing for long
It's a dangerous game
It's a very fine line and if one step is wrong
I'll have no cards to play and that's why
I've got nothing to say tonightEmbed
