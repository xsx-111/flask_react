Mrs. Cold LyricsHey baby, Mrs. Cold, acting so tough
Didn't know you had it in you to be hurt at all
You waited too long, you should've hooked me
Before I put my raincoat on
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
You were frantic because you knew
You'd find yourself vulnerable around me
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey, baby, what's going on?
You lost control and you lost your tongue
You lost me, deaf in my ear
Nothing you can say is gonna change the way I feel
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
You were frantic because you knew
You'd find yourself vulnerable around me
Okay, I get it, okay, I see
I step too close to your boundaries
You wanted nobody around to see
You feel vulnerable around me
Hey baby, what is love?
It was just a game
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough ofEmbed
