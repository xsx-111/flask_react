Me in You LyricsCrossroads and given the option
To pass and look back at goals I've missed
Rainbows of burning bridges
If you squint a little more, it looks the same
But ooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of me inside you
Gathering what you've lost
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of you in everyone
Can never keep a secret
Problem lines on your face
You smooth them out so no one can tell
You're the straight back upon a stage
Could (dance dance) hide the tremble in your hand
But ooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of me inside you
Gathering what you've lost
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of you in everyone
And I'm watching you now
I see you building the castle with one hand
While tearing down another with the other
And I'm watching you now
I see you building the castle with one hand
While tearing down another with the other
And I'm watching you now
I see you building the castle with one hand
While tearing down another with the other1Embed
