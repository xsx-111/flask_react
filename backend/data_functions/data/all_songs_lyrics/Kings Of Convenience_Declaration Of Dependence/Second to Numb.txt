Second to Numb LyricsHe won't touch you anymore
Staying at his side
Half indifferent, half afraid
It will only make you cry
What is given can't be returned
The cards are in our hands
All that is living can be hurt
And that's the end of innocence
Second round found you beating death
The miracle of life
Once each of you caught your breath
A question simmers inside
How far away from being in
Can there be stated of love?
How to put it is you're bound within
What matter is it made of?
What will we become?
What will we become?
What will we become?
