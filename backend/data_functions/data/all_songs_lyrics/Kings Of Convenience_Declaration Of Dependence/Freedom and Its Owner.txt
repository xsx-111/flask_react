Freedom and Its Owner LyricsThe beauty memories of all the places
We've captured with our camera
We've seen the pyramids
We've seen the Louvre
We've seen Orion upside down
Total eclipses and moonlight shadows
We've seen dolphins jumping waves
We've skied the mountains and we swam in the rivers
And let the sunlight dry our skins
But freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
Freedom is the mastery of the known
Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
No view is wider than the eye
Show a view to someone
Who chose to live his whole life in cave
He'll raise his arms to protect his eyes from learning
And the blindness to which he belongs
This time it's me, it's me
Cascades of chances I'll just let them be
The unfamiliar is right below our eyes
Don't look for what we know
The unfamiliar is right below our eyes
Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
Freedom is the mastery of the known
Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner
No view is wider than the eye2Embed
