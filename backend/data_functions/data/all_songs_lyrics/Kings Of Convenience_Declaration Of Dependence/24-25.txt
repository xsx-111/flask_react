24-25 LyricsShe'll be gone soon
You can have me for yourself
She'll be gone soon
You can have me for yourself
But do give
Just give me today
Or you will just scare me away
What we built is bigger
Than the sum of two
What we built is bigger
Than the sum of two
But somewhere
I lost count of my own
And somehow
I must find it alone
24 and blooming like the fields of May
25 and yearning for a ticket out
Dreams burn
But in ashes are gold
Dreams burn
But in ashes are gold1Embed
