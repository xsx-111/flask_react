Rule My World LyricsYou set yourself above
That all forgiving god
You claim that you believe in
Your kind is gonna fall
Your ship is sinking fast
And all your able men are leaving
Only someone
Who's morally
Superior can possibly
And honestly deserve
To rule my world
I talk before I think
You shoot before you know
Who's in your line of fire
So somehow we're the same
We're causing people pain
But I stand and take the blame
You scramble to deny
Only someone
Who's morally
Superior can possibly
And honestly deserve
Only someone
Who's morally
Superior can possibly
And honestly deserve
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
To rule my world
Explain me one more time
When they kill it's a crime
When you kill it is justice2Embed
