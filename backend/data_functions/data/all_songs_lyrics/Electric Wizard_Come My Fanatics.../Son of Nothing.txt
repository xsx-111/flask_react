Son of Nothing Lyrics
Dying sun fades in our sky
The time has come for us to say goodbye
Construct the pods, we must evacuate
To the stars again, is this to be our fate?

Oh baby, just maybe, we'll take you
To the sun of nothingness

We left the war pigs far behind
Plot apocalyptic course to find
Will we ever reach our journey's end
To find a world and start again
