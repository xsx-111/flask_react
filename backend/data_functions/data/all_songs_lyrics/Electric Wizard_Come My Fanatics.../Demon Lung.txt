Demon Lung LyricsI've got a 12 ton demon on my back
Whispering shit in my brain
Martin witch on a bitch whip death trip
Begging me to do it again Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
She'd been to places her mothers never seen
When she was fifteen
Now she's squirming across the floor
Begging me to do it again Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah, load me a demon lung
Yeah, load me a demon lung
Yeah, load me a demon lung
Yeah, load me a demon lung and I'll be alright nowEmbed
