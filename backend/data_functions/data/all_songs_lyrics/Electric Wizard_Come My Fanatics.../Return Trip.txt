Return Trip Lyrics
"Get off my case, motherfucker!"

The sun burns in the stranger's eyes
Just one tear before he dies
Black mass can't ease the pain
There's nothing here, there's nothing sane

I hope this fucking world fucking burns away
And I'd kill you all if I had my way
But I'll live forever, questions curse me why
Oh Lord above, why won't you let me dieEmbed
