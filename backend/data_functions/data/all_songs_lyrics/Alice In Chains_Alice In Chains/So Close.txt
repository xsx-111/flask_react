So Close Lyrics
"I'm serious, there's big money going on"
"Big big money!"

Why are we here again?
It's the same old sit down, roll around, chewed up pen
Nothing thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothing thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothing thrilling me too much, yeah
Nothing thrilling me

Yeah, so close now, ooh, ooh
Yeah, so close now, ooh, ooh

Man, I nearly snapped my twig
Then again I nearly snapped a few of you
So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think highly now
So I hear you think

Yeah, so close now, ooh, ooh
Yeah, so close now, ooh, ooh
Why?
Why?
Why?3Embed
