Sludge Factory Lyrics
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh yeah
Ooh, oh Yeah

You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake and "I'm high"
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
Twenty hours won't print my picture milk carton size
Carton size, carton size, carton size

Call me up, congratulations ain't the real why
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day nine
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time
"By the way", "by the way", "by the way", "by the way"

Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me

Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die
You have always told me you'd not live past twenty-five
I say stay long enough to repay all who caused strife
Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me
Once again, you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid, you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me

I bear true and an existing witness
To this barrel of monkeys
A self-proclaimed immoral success
Perfected by each whereof
Individually deadly, and equally so
And spread about the surrendered troops
For even thousands of miles
Will not tear apart their communication
Or the lack thereof
Vultures, liars, thieves, each proclaim their innocence
In no suggestion or rhyme
Your weapon is contained
In the wrecking of the keeping the desired effect
The breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
