Brush Away Lyrics
I could use some time to curl away
My aggression is where you stake your claim
Why I question this curve on which you grade
My conception, a joke or latest craze?

I try to get away, and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground

My intention, I arrive at eight
Lie and dream some, surprise, you guys, I'm late
All right, correction, forgetting something, wait

I try to get away, and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground
I try to get away, and yet I stick around
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground4Embed
