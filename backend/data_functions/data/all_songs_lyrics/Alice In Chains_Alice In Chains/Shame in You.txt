Shame in You Lyrics
When I waken, and I'm aching, time for sleeping, yeah
When I'm saying time to go and, I've been hurting, yeah
When I'm laying, I'm still trying, concentrating on dying, yeah

You're right as rain, but you're wrong to blame
Agreed my crime's the same
My sins I'll claim, give you back shed pain
Go find a place for own shame
So you can deal with this thing unreal
No one made you feel any hurt, yeah

Body's moving, only proving, no one needed to move
Still believing, yet mistaken, all God's children, yeah
And I must say, I was stupid, selfishly she consumed, yeah

And you must change patterns all we trained
Or never regain peace you seek
Now you hear me, for the things I see
Yeah, I believe in inner peace, yeah

Throw out, blow up, hold in
Show fine, no signs, grow blind2Embed
