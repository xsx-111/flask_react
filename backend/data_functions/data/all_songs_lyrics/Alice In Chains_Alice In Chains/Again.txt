Again Lyrics
Hey, let 'em do it again, yeah
Hey, you said you were my friend
Hey, turn me upside down, oh
Hey, feeling so down
Hey, hey

You made a fool of me again
And again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again

Hey, I know I made the same mistake, yeah
I, I won't do it again, no
Why, why do you slap me in the face? Ow
I, I didn't say it was okay, no
No, no

You violate a part of me again
And again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

Ah, ooh
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Hey, you had time to think it out, yeah
Hey, your weak will won't help her heal her heart
Hey, I'll bet it really eats you up, huh?

Extending part of me again
And again, and again, and again, and again

Ooh
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah8Embed
