Boogie No More LyricsOh, People, baby, what's the matter with you?
Your feet, they ain't leaving' the ground
Don't you just want to get up, babe
Hearing this rocking sound?
Don't you just want to jump on up
And kick your chairs out of the way?
OOh we're going to rock you, baby
Rock you till the break of day
Chorus:
We ain't never had no problem before
Nobody seems to want to boogie no more
Oh, it's easy, can't you see?
Gonna give it to you one time
Oh, People, baby, what's the matter with you?
Your feet, they're leaving' the ground
I know that you get on up, baby
Hearing this rockin' sound
Don't you just want to jump on up
And kick your chairs out of the way
MMM' gonna rock you , baby
Rock you till the break of dayEmbed
