Let The Good Times Roll LyricsWell some people bitch, Lord, some people holler
About the long days on the road
Each man can do just what he wants
But we've all got ot pull our load
As for myself, I'm gonna take the highway
It ain't as bad as they say
Give me wine, women, whiskey, and rock 'n roll
And let me sleep my days away
Chorus:
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
I've been all throughout the South land
Keep moving on down the line
I ought to settle down some place
But I just can't find the time
As for myself, gonna take this highway
It ain't as bad as they say
Give me wine, whiskey, women, and rock 'n roll
And let me sleep my days away
Chorus:
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
Chorus:
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
Chorus:
C'mon baby, let the good times roll
C'mon baby, let the good times rollEmbed
