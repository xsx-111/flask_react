Whiskey Man LyricsHey whiskey man, you're running as hard as you can
You drink your whiskey too much more than you can stand
You have your highs, you have your lows
Nobody knows which way you go

Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long
Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long
It takes whiskey to make you tall
You ain't so very damn tall at all
You start to get straight, then you get weak
Can't you see you're on a losing streak
You have your highs, you have your lows
Nobody knows which way you'll go

Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long
Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long
Hey don't you know
I used to be there myself
I tried to kick the habit, baby, with nobody else's help
I have my highs, I have my lows
But nobody knows which way I'll go

Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long
Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long
Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long
Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long1Embed
