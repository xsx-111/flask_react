Long Time LyricsAll alone with a full moon to light my night
Been six long months since I held you tight
It's been a long time
Baby, you are my only love
Sent to me, from Heaven above
Oh, honey, times are bad
Got so bad, one lonely night
I needed you to hold me tight
Honey, don't be so sad
I've got you on my mind
You know I've done you wrong
Oh, baby, listen to my song
We made a deal
I remember the pact
Now you're gone and I need you back
Honey, don't be so mad
There's no other
There never could be
You're my woman, my family
Honey, baby, take me back
I've got you on my mind
You know I've done you wrong
Oh, baby, listen to my song
Chorus:
A feeling inside
I couldn't hide
Now I wish I lied
Oh, baby, won't you come back home?
Lonely days and damn the nights
Has it been too long to make things right?
Been a long time
Lord a long time
I've got you on my mind
You know I've done you wrong
Oh, this pain in my soul
Chorus:
The feeling inside
I couldn't hide
Now I wish I lied
Oh, baby, won't you come back home?
Yeah, a long timeEmbed
