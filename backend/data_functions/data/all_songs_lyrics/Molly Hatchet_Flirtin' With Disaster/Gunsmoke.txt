Gunsmoke LyricsWell I rode into town with my ear to the ground
Looking for the right hand to play
I felt just right in the heat of the night
I'd ridden many miles that day
I heard of a place where men got together
Playin' and layin' it down
I'm going in to win, but Lord, what a sin
I didn't know they'd gun me down
Chorus:
Gunsmoke on the horizon, hiding the setting sun
Gunsmoke on the horizon, I grabbed my horse and run
Well the dealer was blind and I was trying to find
A way to keep the winnings I'd found
The smoke was thick, the tension was thicker
I still thought they'd gun me down
Chorus:
Gunsmoke on the horizon, hiding the setting sun
Gunsmoke on the horizon, I grabbed my horse and run
I didn't come into this ol' two horse town to get all shot I've
Got a little livin' on my mind
Aces and eights, ha-ha-ha-ha
Now the dealer dealt me eight and I had my straight
I knew the other men would call
The booze was a flowin', my cards were showing But
My back was up against the wall
Chorus:
Gunsmoke on the horizon, hiding the setting sun
Gunsmoke on the horizon, I grabbed my horse and run
C'mon ThunderEmbed
