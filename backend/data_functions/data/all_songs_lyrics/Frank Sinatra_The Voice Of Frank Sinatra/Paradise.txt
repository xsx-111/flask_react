Paradise LyricsAnd then she holds my hand, mm
And then I understand, mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?
And then she dims the light, mm
And then she holds me tight, mm
One kiss, one fond caress
Will lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise
One kiss, one fond caress
Will lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradiseEmbed
