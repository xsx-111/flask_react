Invisible Face Lyrics
I distort the notion of the place
The universe's other face
The speed of light has slowed apace
The universe's other face

What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face
Invisible face
Invisible face

I climb up the stalk and plant the bean
The universe is a machine
That has awoken from a dream
The universe is a machine

What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face
Invisible face
Invisible face

I climb up the stalk and plant the bean
The universe is a machine
That has awoken from a dream
The universe is a machine

What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
