Robot Stop Lyrics
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door

One, two, three!

Loosen up
Time to drop
Fuck shit up
Don't forget about it
My coffin's all I see
Lately
Robot stop

Oh!

Loosen up
Time to drop
Fuck shit up
Don't forget about it
My coffin's all I see
Lately
Robot stop
My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

One, two, three!

Limber up
Time is up
Fuck shit up
Don't forget about it
My coffin's all I see
Lately
Robot stop
My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

Upload me to the robot brain
I'm the drudge that goes again and again
Oh!
Bring the spooks to the beer-soaked glade
The robot's here if the robot's paid
Oh!


My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence
I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more
Oh!

One, two, three!

Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity- ah!18Embed
