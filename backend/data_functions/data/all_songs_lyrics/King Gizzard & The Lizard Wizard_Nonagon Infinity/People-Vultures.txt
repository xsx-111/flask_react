People-Vultures Lyrics
People-vultures, God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

People-vultures waiting to begin
Deadly ulcers feeding on my skin

People-vultures waiting at my stage
Wild dogs escaping from their cage

People-vultures, God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

People-vultures, God approaches
Final hearing, disappearing
Tainted voodoo, headless guru
Final head-spin
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
What else have I got left to spew down?
People-vultures crowding at my door
Parasites are eating more and more8Embed
