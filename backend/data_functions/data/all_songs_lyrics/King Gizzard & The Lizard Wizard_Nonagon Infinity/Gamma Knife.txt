Gamma Knife Lyrics
Milk and honey for my body
Come up through the door, see it's your unborn self
Seen it before
Fake soul-butter made of rubber
Stick it in the skin, see it's a wealth of life

Gamma knife, gamma knife
Gamma knife, gamma knife (Woo!)
Gamma knife, nice knife
Gamma knife (Ooh!)

Crack the whip, I'll jump the hoop (Gamma)
Cut the skin and bend the truth (Gamma)
All I wanted was my youth (Gamma)
All in favour of this truth
Gamma knife (Woo!)

Milk and honey for my body
Come up through the door, see it's your unborn self
Seen it before
Fake soul-butter made of rubber
Stick it in the skin, see it's a wealth of life
Gamma knife, gamma knife
Gamma knife, gamma knife (Woo!)
Gamma knife, nice knife
Nice gamma knife (Ooh!)

Crack the whip, I'll jump the hoop (Gamma)
Cut the skin and bend the truth (Gamma)
All I wanted was my youth (Gamma)
All in favour of this truth
Gamma knife (Woo!)

Gamma, gamma
Gamma, gamma
Gamma, gamma
Gamma, gamma


Gamma knife, nice knife
