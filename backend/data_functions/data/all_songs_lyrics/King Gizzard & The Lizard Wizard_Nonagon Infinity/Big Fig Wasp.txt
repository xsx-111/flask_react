Big Fig Wasp Lyrics
Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp
And when the harvest's clean, there's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine, it's a fig wasp
Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp
And when the harvest's clean, there's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine, it's a fig wasp

Did your God know
Insects grow in my pome?

BIG FIG WASP!
BIG FIG WASP!

Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp
And when the harvest's clean, there's a fig wasp
It's a winged machine, it's a fig wasp

Did your God know
Insects grow in my pome?
BIG FIG WASP!

Any wasp I see, it's a fig wasp
Pearly guillotine, it's a fig wasp

BIG FIG WASP!
BIG FIG WASP!

Ficain eating corpses
There's a hornet in my throat!

BIG FIG WASP!
BIG FIG WASP!

My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same I know
My only difference
Is robot influence
I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more
One, two, three!

Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door3Embed
