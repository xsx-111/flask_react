Too Pooped to Pop Lyrics
Casey is an old man who wants to be a teen
He goes to all the dances and they call him cha-cha King
He cha-cha's when the band is playing rock and roll
He tries to keep in time but the beat leaves him cold

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips getting weaker when he tries to do this stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's going to stray

Chicks told Casey, you better move man
This is only a one night stand
Casey wasn't in time but he was dancing awhile
Till a cramp caught his leg and he had to change his style

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips getting weaker when he tries to do this stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's going to stray
Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips getting weaker when he tries to do this stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's going to stray
Casey finally learned to do the hoochie koo
This might have been fine back in '22
Now, I'm going to give you fellows just a little tip
If you want to keep your girl you'll better get hip

Or, you'll be too pooped to pop, too old a soul
You hips are getting weaker when you'll try to do the stroll
And every time your feet getting to go in one way
Here comes a new dance you'll be left to strayEmbed
