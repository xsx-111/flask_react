Childhood Sweetheart Lyrics
Last night, I had a beautiful dream
Last night, in the wee wee hours, oh yes
Had a beautiful dream
Isn't about my childhood sweetheart
How true and real it seemed

I had dream we was walking?
Hand in hand, home from school
Yeah, I dreamed we was walking together
Hand in hand, home from school
Yeah, if it hadn't be for you darling
I'd broke my mother's rule

Yeah, you was only sixteen
So young and yet so fine
Yeah, you was only sixteen
So young, yet so fine
You said when you would finish school
You'd let me take and make you mine
Oh yeah

Yeah, you had those same pretty eyes
Same sweet little smile
You had those same pretty eyes
Same sweet little smile
I had dreamed about the sweet things
We used to do, when you was a child

You were my childhood sweetheart
Love you now, and loved you then
You were my childhood sweetheart
I love you now and I loved you then
And when I'll leave you down the twilight
I'll go to sleep and dream againEmbed
