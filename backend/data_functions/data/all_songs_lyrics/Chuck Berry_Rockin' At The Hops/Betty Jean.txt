Betty Jean Lyrics
I love the way you talk
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Speaking little, saying a lot
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
I love the way you walk
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Look like you're dancing when you're not
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
I love the way you love
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
You give it everything you've got
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)

Oh oh oh, baby
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)
I'm in love with you
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Oh oh oh, baby
(Keep it singing Chuckie Boy)
I'm in love with you
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Woah, baby
(Keep it singing Chuckie Boy)
Could you love me too?
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Every time I knock, knock, knock
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
I hear you say, "Come in"
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
My heart goes a boom-boom
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Just to hold you again
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
I hear bells ding-a-ling
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Because you the living end
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)

Oh oh oh, baby
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)
I'm in love with you
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Oh oh oh, baby
(Keep it singing Chuckie Boy)
I'm in love with you
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Woah, baby
(Keep it singing Chuckie Boy)
Could you love me too?
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)

I bet you wouldn't think a dance
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)
Could start a real romance
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)
I bet you wouldn't think a kiss
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)
Could turn me on like this
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)
Well let me tell you like it was
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)
Yes it did, yes it does
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)

Oh oh oh, baby
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)
I'm in love with you
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Oh oh oh, baby
(Keep it singing Chuckie Boy)
I'm in love with you
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Woah, baby
(Keep it singing Chuckie Boy)
Could you love me too?
(Oh yeah, Betty Jean)
Oh ha, oh ha, baby, I'm in love
Oh ha, oh ha, baby, I'm in love
Oh ha, oh ha, babyEmbed
