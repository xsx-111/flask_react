Broken Arrow Lyrics
Old Chief warrior on a mountain side
(I am not never doing that again)
Met up with Geronimo’s enemy tribe
(I am not never doing that again)
There was a broken arrow here, a bloody arrow there
A head broken, back busted, bones broken, bloody bones
Old Chief met up with Geronimo’s tribe
(I am not never doing that again)

I sent my lady downtown to shop
(I am not never doing that again)
She evidently didn’t know when to stop
(I am not never doing that again)
With a mink stolen here and a chinchilla there
A here fur, there fur, fur where I don’t know
Sent my lady downtown to shop
(I am not never doing that again)

I bet all I had on a hearsay sure shot
(I am not never doing that again)
The horse started walking because the sun got hot
(I am not never doing that again)
I had a bill lying here and a bill lying there
A home bill, gas bill, all but a dollar bill
I bet all I had on a hearsay sure shot
(I am not never doing that again)Embed
