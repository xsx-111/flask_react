I Got to Find My Baby Lyrics
I'm going to search this town
From door to door
Love I crave
I can't find no more

I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that girl said goodbye

Hmm, you know I hate to see the sun
Hurry to the west
'Cause I know my whole life
Will be in a solid mess

I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that girl said goodbye

Yes, ever since she said
That we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too
I gotta find my baby
I declare I wouldn't lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that girl said goodbye

Yes, I don't care if it's the last thing
I ever do in my life
I'm gonna find that little girl
And make her my wife

I gotta find my baby
I wouldn't lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that girl said goodbyeEmbed
