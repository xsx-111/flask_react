As Flittermice As Satans Spys LyricsFlittermice of Eld Unveiled at the plenilune
Fordone by Mournful rest now seeking to be fed again
Rising terrestrial power umbraged by celestial light
That Shineth Forth from the palace of god - the palace of no return
Flittermice of Eld they peer into the morrows
They peer the yesteryears as those are coming back
Beholding the son recrucified, beholding gods race browbeaten
Beholding the devastation of all morals built by them
Flittermice of Eld they fly to blaspheme yehova
And to build their Temple (of the) Damned on once holy pleasure ground
A Fare to Raise the Flag (of Satan), to desseminate the races
To build the Hall of Battle and to live in Eternal Strife
Flittermice came forth from the land beyond the forest
Multifarious winged black creatures slew the angels (up so) high
Devastation, blasphemy, desecration, unholy He
Who burned the face of God with the eye of our master
