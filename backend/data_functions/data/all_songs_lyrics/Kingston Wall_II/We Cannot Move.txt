We Cannot Move Lyrics
It's getting dark and all the creatures start to live
We cannot do no more than go and hide in the bin, hey
We cannot move
No, we cannot move
They rule the kitchen and there's nothing that can be done
They mess the bedroom while we're waiting for the sun, hey
We cannot move
No, we cannot move
The fridge is coming down, I hear that sound again
There's food all over the floor, it's all a part of their game
We cannot move
No, we cannot move
And if we do they'll know we're hiding in the bin
It's a matter of life and death, a game we cannot win
We cannot move
No, we cannot move
Hey!


The fridge is coming down, I hear that sound again
There's food all over the floor, it's all a part of their game
We cannot move
No, we cannot move...
We cannot move
No, we cannot move...
We cannot move
No, we cannot move....1Embed
