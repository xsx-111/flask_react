Shine On Me Lyrics
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me

Can't you see it's all your future
Feelings have to be pushed away
Can't you see it's just a feeling
Shine, shine on me



See me walking, see me crawling
See my future, see a dead man
See me walking, see me crawling
Shine, shine on me, yeah


Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on me
Shine, shine on meEmbed
