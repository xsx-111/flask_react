I Feel Love Lyrics
Ooh it's so good, it's so good, it's so good, it's so good
It's so good...
Ooh I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love...
Ooh I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love

I feel love...
I feel love...

Ooh falling free, falling free, falling free, falling free
Falling free...
Ooh you and me, you and me, you and me, you and me
You and me...
Ooh I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love...

I feel love...
I feel love...

Ooh I've got you, I've got you, I've got you, I've got you
I've got you...
Ooh what to do, what to do, what to do, what to do
What to do...
Ooh I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love
I feel love...

I feel love...
I feel love...
I feel love...Embed
