Two of a Kind Lyrics
Hey, don't leave me here
I can't stand it if you go
And I won't be surprised
When I open my eyes, and I see what it's like
To realize that we're two of a kind...

No, when will I see you
And when will you call, and what will I do (what will I do?)
No, I won't be surprised
When I open my eyes, and I see what it's like
To realize that we're two of a kind...


The feelings I get when I look to the west are taking me away
But I know it's something to see, it's something to feel
And I won't be surprised
When I open my eyes and I see what it's like
To realize that we're two of a kind...
Yeah, two of a kind...
That we're two of a kind...
Two of a kind, two of a kind...Embed
