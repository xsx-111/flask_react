Could It Be So? Lyrics
Something strange is down there but we don't know where
It's been lying in peace waiting for its release
But that moment will come long after we are gone
Like it did long ago before we were born

Could it be so that
We have been here before
Could it be so that
This all happened before...

Ol' man Jacques found that road in the bottom of the sea
Indians wrote 'bout the bombs that you just have to see
And then huge rocks in Giza, it seemed like they flew
And the pictures in deserts I wonder who drew...


Ancient wise-men knew things that we can hardly dream about
Builded statues and temples that can't be pulled down
Now we seek for that wisdom from too far away
Wonder 'round with our eyes blind and think we are there
Could it be so that
We have been here before
Could it be so that
This all happened before...
Could it be so that
We have been here before
Could it be so that
This all happened before...
Could it be so that
We have been here before
Could it be so that
This all happened before...Embed
