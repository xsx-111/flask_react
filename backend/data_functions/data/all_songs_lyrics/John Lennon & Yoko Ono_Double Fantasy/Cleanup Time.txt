Cleanup Time Lyrics
Bubble, bubble...

Moonlight on the water
Sunlight on my face
You and me together
We are in our place
The gods are in the heavens
The angels treat us well
The oracle has spoken
We cast the perfect spell

The queen is in the counting house
Counting out the money
The king is in the kitchen
Making bread and honey
No friends and yet no enemies
Absolutely free
No rats aboard the magic ship
Of perfect harmony

Now it begins - let it begin
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Well, well, well?

However far we travel
Wherever we may roam
The centre of the circle
Will always be our home
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
Cleanup time
