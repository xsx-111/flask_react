(Just Like) Starting Over Lyrics
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over (over)
Starting over (over)

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy?
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by, my love
It'll be just like starting over (over)
Starting over (over)

Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, darling
It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over (over)
Starting over (over)
Look out!

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere...
(Over and over and over)
Starting over
(Over and over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over and over)
