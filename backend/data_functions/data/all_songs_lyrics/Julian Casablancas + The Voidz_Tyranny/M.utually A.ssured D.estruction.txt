M.utually A.ssured D.estruction Lyrics
Chasing all your dreams like any fool
Observing the absurd from a piano stool
It’s the first time you’ll get the truth - that’s for sure
Now the bad feelings they come in waves

Feedin' all your nightmares to procure
Trusting in their words today no more
And it’s the first time you got it right - that's for sure
Black hole sucking us into oblivion7Embed
