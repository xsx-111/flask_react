Where No Eagles Fly Lyrics
Please, come on babe, they'll end up all confused
What's the point of telling people if they won't use it?
Fly on the wall, bird of prey in the mall
It's the eye in the sky where no eagles fly

Meat, predators eat meat
Predators eat meat
Ceremony or a speech
In a church or on a beach
Predators eat

The wolf will cry sheep as they take him away
We plot in our sleep but follow orders all day
The rhythm is for you but the song is for me
The meaning might be secret but the melody is free

Meat, predators eat meat
Predators eat meat
Let all my big dreams sink in
No one to enjoy it with
Oblivious, stay oblivious
Why can you not be more like me?
Hiding in a nearby tree
Business, business, I forget
Pray for predators, I guess
Uh-oh, uh-oh, here we go
All our future's through that door
Future futures come to this, everybody cheats I guess
Let's go down to Mexico, "there's a couple guys I know"

All our future's come to this, I don't want my friends to know
All our future's come to this, I don't want our friends12Embed
