Crunch Punch Lyrics
Survivors I have interviewed and also from all of the historical reading
These are patterns. This has happened many times in history

Devil's evangelicals they puppet my eye
He is the creepiest guy in the sky
Re-runs on the radio, the DJ is wrong
He's just a preacher who pushed play on this song

I can't live on a farm forever
Please just tell them I'm gone
But not until tomorrow, when I've made it out somehow
Can I pray for you, 'ma-?

Policemen get in their face
Officer down on the scene
(Two fifty-six? Calling all cars we have an officer down, I repeatâ€¦)
Best repeat what is not true
Watch my neighbor
We won't tell them what to do
Can you rescue me everybody wants what they can't see
Yes I want it for me, but I want it for you, too
(OH YEAH! DJ DERRICK!)

Come meet the ventriloquist who puppets my eye
He is the creepiest guy in the sky
Everybody loves him  and he kisses your hand
He likes to pretend that he sings in a band
Okay: please don't take the pain
It's running all down on your face
Don't miss the show okay?
"Ah I can't have time."

I can't live on the farm forever
We live too far away
From everything
I pray for some things to change
Your mother is a murderer
Trust me I know
"...Shit, I got excited, oh"

Can't beat them it's so hard
I wanna beat them in my prime11Embed
