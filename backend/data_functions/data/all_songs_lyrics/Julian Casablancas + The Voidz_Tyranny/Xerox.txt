Xerox Lyrics
I won't fight, it's not the time or place
Stone-age mind in a space-world age
In the dark, violent space
Kids learning how to mosh again
Will the sky open up and destroy everyone I loved?
One way out
You don't take it to heart
Until it tries tearing you apart

Hard to avoid the past
I guess the only way is acknowledging it
Everyone lies to me and tries to sell me stuff, but I guess that's just love
I love the beginning; the way women give in - the velvet rope unhinged
I'll give you everything that you ever wanted, but you won't want it then
I'm the worst, I'm the worst
I'm the worst, I'm the worst
I'm the worst, I'm the worst
I'm the worst, I'm the worst

Very late at night when cities turn into forests again
When the devil offers you
A devil sip of his devil brew
"In my day, trained in a distant life, I won't think of it, I won't cry"
Summer days, I'd be at the playground
Please, please, please
I can't wait to make it through
Our awkwardness

Hard to avoid the past
I guess the only way is acknowledging it
Everyone lies to me and tries to sell me stuff, but I guess that's just love
I love the beginning, your clothes slide off your skin, giving is receiving
Patterns of emptiness
Tomorrow is laughing
Money brings tyranny
I'm the worst, I'm the worst
I'm the worst, I'm the worst
I'm the worst, I'm the worst8Embed
