Father Electricity LyricsLike harmonies, locks in keys
Lightning in every drop
We're tricked again, lost at sea
When we find land can I climb your tree?
I know it's hard to see, oh
I wanna believe what you're saying
But I'm seeing the game that you're playin'
Oh, I kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-know
What I'm gonna d-d-d-d-d-do
Kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-know what I'm gonna d-d-d-d-d-do
Oh no, I meant...
I'm at the wrong place at the wrong time
They're attracting all the wrong people to the wrong line
I do not want to see the whole mess
I wish I could live in retrospect
Five steps
Remember them well
As you're coming down, down the well
You drop 500 tons of hell
You are everything I see
Every time I blink, despair
Who's asleep at the wheel?
They fight for every meal
Who likes that bad idea?
You
Undo
What I feel, qualia
What I am, qualia
Wait, wait
No, I don't want it
No, I don't want it
Oh man
What are we doing now?
All I knowâ€¦ are instincts
You are everything I see
Every time I blink, despair
Lock the doors and hide the keys
And wake the doctor, call a priest
Born out of electricity, I wait for you in the second life
Who's asleep at the wheel?
Who likes that bad idea?
Who wants a Happy Meal?
Oooh
You are everything I see
Every time I blink, despair
I will take what I can grab, but I, I don't want your money bags
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
What else can I say
What else can I say
What else can I say tonight?7Embed
