Nintendo Blood Lyrics
Her eyes were black and white and blue
I listen to your favorite songs backwards
Do you have a plan for who to surrender to?
Oh, I've been training for you (It won't stop now)

Imprisoned us in a song
Asleep in the dead of wrong
No return beyond this point
In theory

Will you drift into that dark war path
When the blood runs down the face sideways?
As the party stays in the city forever, it seems
Like ugly hippy neon art
We let the schoolboys in your eyes run out
When you asked me to blow smoke in your mouth
Like anybody, the gloves I find I try
Can you think back to that time?
I was so angry I got up and out of bed
I spent 25 minutes reading what you said
A face I know so well, I've memorized your teeth
I've worked so hard, I haven't looked at you in weeks
I hope I give it
I'm not gonna give it back
I hope I give it
I'm not gonna take it
I'm not gonna take it, no
I'm not gonna give it

Will you solve your problems in the daylight?
They like to change the rules as they go
By chapter two he got killed by the author
Momma won't let me out
Take me in your android arms, mom - Jeanette
Made up of every lonely person you've met
Of every pretty stranger you'll never regret
I can't help it, it's not my fault, gotta be possessive
Each man for his own, arm in arm in arms

Imprisoned us in a song
Asleep in the dead of wrong
Motha-f. Don't page me tonight
Don't stop - react, attack
When man has conquered the earth he will have destroyed himself
His appetite will devour the earth and leave behind only a desert
The end of living and the beginning of surviving
Our land, our brother, we treat like an enemy
But "when man has conquered the earth he will have destroyed himself
The end of living and the beginning of survivingâ€¦"
Our land is a brother we treat like an enemy - oh oh
'Cause nothing exists except molecules and empty space - oh oh
The moon is cracked, I think it looked at me and grinned
The room is packed, I look around and now it spins
Cyborg, I need to sit down, I need to shut up
Universe, everything's wrong, I think I fucked up
Only trust myself
Level with myself
Level with myself
I am not myself9Embed
