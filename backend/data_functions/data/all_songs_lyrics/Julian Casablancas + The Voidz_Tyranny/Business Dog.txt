Business Dog Lyrics
Take me to your business place
I'm gonna be there twenty minutes late
I'm gonna fuck your face for breakfast
I love being weird, it's so weird
Quiz in the morning, the police outside
She's been missing since late last night
'I wrote my name on the world,'
Regreting as he makes his license plates

Leave it all to me, yeah
Just leave it to me, yeah
Leave it all to me, yeah
Make and model number, please

Waiting for my license plates
Meet you at your breakfast place
I'm gonna be at your place for business
Let me work it, work it - work it - work it
Wage war on the listener
I can't fight cause I can't fight
He does it on a plane
I bet my lies
You can trust him
Leave it all to me, yeahhh
Just leave it to me, yeahhh
Leave it all to me, yeahhh
Make and model number, please
That's how you do it in the business kid

Leave it all to me, yeahhh
Just leave it to me, yeahhh
Leave it all to me, yeahhh
Model number, please
Wait â€” Ohhh
Good job business dog3Embed
