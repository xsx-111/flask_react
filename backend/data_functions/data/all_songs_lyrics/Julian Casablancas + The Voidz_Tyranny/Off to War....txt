Off to War... LyricsOur eyes see colors our mind made up
I wait for the light to shine
I wait for the light to shine
They're tugging on your pride to help them win
Yeah baby
I wait for the light to shine
I wait for the light to shine
When I look at you, it was shining all along
I wait for the light to shine
But someone else got to you
I wait for the light to shine
I wait for the light to shine3Embed
