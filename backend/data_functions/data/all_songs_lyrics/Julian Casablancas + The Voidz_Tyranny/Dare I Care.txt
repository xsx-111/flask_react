Dare I Care LyricsHit the knee - ow - heck, they're ready
S.O.N.'s SAT, how magenta are you?
Daddy, I owe Doc Luke a Mercedes
Barely up and I'm looking for jobs
Yup, they been at your house already
Who, me? Sad? I'm last to hear
Yeah, they been at your house already
Who me? Fuck, I'm last to hear
What a real woman won't mind
But don't be weird with me
I won't be weird with you
But I wanna be weird my way
It won't be my way
American always our way
What can I say?
In the band I put the key, cause I did my time
What can I say?
Your memory's no good, leave your clothes on
Our bodies crave a lot of things that end in loss
Don't try and turn this into something else
Too late to change your mind this time and hit eject
Now that I'm here
I been wasting half my life
Right here is where my friends they used to live
Hit the knee - ow - heck, they're ready
S.O.N.'s SAT, how magenta are you?
Daddy, I owe Doc Luke a Mercedes
Barely up and I'm looking for jobs
Who, me? Sad? I'm last to hear
Yeah, they been at your house already. Who gives a fuck?
I want my money back
That wasn't fun
The bricks and the gravel and the mud and the blood
Another wild teenager in search of success, welcome to the jewel of the modified west
Now that I'm here, o-o-oh
I've been wasting half my life
Right here is where my friends they used to live...

I don't care anymore
I'd don't dare anymore
Now that I'm here, where my friends they used to live
I don't care anymore, I'd dare anymore
Thatâ€™s how they know, that's how they know
"Calm down"
That's what they say, that's how they know12Embed
