Malleus Maleficarum Lyrics
Open my eyes as I submerge
And I won't deny what I've been since birth
I'll die drowned by your standards
Breathe in the life of the summer's death
As the orange and red breathe their first breath
So welcome as they're burning through

We all begin to burn
Autumn's flame dances in my eyes
Set alight for all we've learned
My ashes falling

My skin is singed but it heals my heart
And with glowing pride I'll wear my scars
Honored by your hatred
Leaves fall, we arise again
And the end impending, it will begin
So welcome as it's burning through

We all begin to burn
Autumn's flame dances in my eyes
Set alight for all we've learned
My ashes falling, can you feel me?
Ashes fall when I'm rising up again
Ashes fall when I'm rising up again
Ashes fall when I'm rising up again
Ashes fall when I'm rising up again
Ashes fall when I'm rising up again
Ashes fall when I'm rising up again
Ashes fall when I'm rising up again
Ashes fall, ashes fall
Fall, fall
Ashes fall
As we all
Arise

We all begin to burn
Autumn's flame dances in my eyes
Set alight for all we've learned
My ashes falling, can you feel me?Embed
