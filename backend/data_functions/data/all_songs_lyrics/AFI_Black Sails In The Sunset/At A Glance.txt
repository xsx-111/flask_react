At A Glance Lyrics
No haven now as I watch it pour from everywhere
Just like the storm that has come out of thin air
Gentle caresses, just as paper thin
Frail and only lack the strength to hold

What if could go to sleep for days?
Would you count the hours?
Or would your restlessness consume
Fading memories of me?

Fall into open arms that offer their protection
Quick to deny that they're open to deceit
Long to believe that support will never cease
Bitter and lonely, those they've left before

What if could go to sleep for days?
Would you count the hours?
Or would your restlessness consume
Fading memories of me?

The vibrant heart so quickly growing old
The warmest eyes so quickly growing cold
Just a glance for they don't care to see
What becomes of me
The vibrant heart so quickly growing old
The warmest eyes so quickly growing cold
Just a glance for they don't care to see
What becomes of me
What becomes of me
What becomes of me
What if could go to sleep for days?
Would you count the hours?
Or would your restlessness consume
What if could go to sleep for days?
Would you count the hours?
Or would your restlessness consume
Fading memories of me?Embed
