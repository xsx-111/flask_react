Narrative of Soul Against Soul Lyrics
To the wounded, I have seen
The self image they've forced you to reduce to shattered glass
With the only remaining value lying in its jagged edges
The few who warrant waking for
Await their recognition
No fear of death, but with fear of life
Your weakness kills everyone, so live

For no lack of searching I can't seem to find, can't seem to find one
Angels for everyone
What of all their promises, can't seem to find much more than lies
Angels in anyone

A permanent solution to a temporary problem
Before I'd lay me down to rest
I'd throw away everything to live

For no lack of searching I can't seem to find, can't seem to find one
Angels for everyone
What of all their promises, can't seem to find much more than lies
Angels in anyone
For no lack of searching I can't seem to find, can't seem to find one
Angels for everyone
What of all their promises, can't seem to find much more than lies
Angels in anyone
For no lack of searching I can't seem to find, can't seem to find one
Angels for everyone
What of all their promises, can't seem to find much more than lies
Angels in anyone
For no lack of searching I can't seem to find, can't seem to find one
Angels for everyone
What of all their promises, can't seem to find much more than lies
Angels in anyone1Embed
