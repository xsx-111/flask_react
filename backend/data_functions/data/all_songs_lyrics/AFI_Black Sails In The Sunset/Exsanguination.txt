Exsanguination Lyrics
Welcome the whole new pain
And take comfort in what you've become
I waved as I passed myself along the way

I have arrived, so unashamed
But my reflection no longer looks the same
It seems much dimmer now
It seems so dim

Just stumble and fall
Into a world that's overcrowded
And you will find me, won't recognize me
I won't recognize myself

I've arrived, so unashamed
But all my senses no longer seem the same
I can sense everything
My sight's so clear

Just stumble and fall
Into a world that's overcrowded
And you will find me, won't recognize me
I won't recognize myself
In an instant my life just slipped away
I fought for life the whole time you were holding me down
You watched me dying, holding me down
You brought my rebirth, holding me down
You watched me dying, holding me down
You brought my rebirth

Just stumble and fall
Into a world that's overcrowded
And you will find me, won't recognize me
I won't recognize myselfEmbed
