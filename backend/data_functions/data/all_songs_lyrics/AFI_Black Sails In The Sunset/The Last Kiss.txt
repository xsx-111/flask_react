The Last Kiss Lyrics
Hung in your room, swaying, hoping only that you'll see
All by myself, I'm alone in such poor company
The deeper I think, the deeper I seem to sink
I can't

Stop the insects that are feeding
Pull the needles from beneath my skin

I broke myself, shattered, tied a bow around every piece
You'll love the eyes, have they always shown so vacantly?
The more I show the less you'll want to know
I can't

Stop the insects that are feeding
Pull the needles from beneath my skin

Now I'm on display, I am becoming
Hurt myself today, it's all for you
Do you like, do you like what I'm becoming?
Cut myself today, it's all for you
I part the night, flashing, approaching as I watch you flee
Pushed through your panes, seems I've landed quite uncomfortably
But as I pass through souls of broken glass
I can't

Stop the insects that are feeding
Pull the needles from beneath my skin

Now I'm on display, I am becoming
Hurt myself today, it's all for you
Do you like, do you like what I'm becoming?
Cut myself today, it's all for you

Please don't ask me just what I think
Trust me, you don't want to know
Please don't ask me to open up
Trust me, trust me, because I can't

Stop the insects that are feeding
Pull the needles from beneath my skin
Now I'm on display, I am becoming
Hurt myself today, it's all for you
Do you like, do you like what I'm becoming?
Cut myself today, it's all for youEmbed
