Porphyria Cutanea Tarda Lyrics
I know it's here we retreat for where else could we go?
To great disbelief there is somewhere we belong
In negative space supposed flaws go unseen
But our strength is shown

In darkness together, we're bringing the light
In darkness together, we are forming
The fire tomorrow is born of the night
In darkness together we ignite

From all we've been shunned but we found a new home
To great discontent it is greatness that we own
In luminous eyes, reflections of fear absolute
All hate what we've become

In darkness together, we're bringing the light
In darkness together, we are forming
The fire tomorrow is born of the night
In darkness together we ignite

Through our will we brought fear
Left to burn beneath the sun
We are one
When daylight forms blinding walls, where do we go?
The darkness calls
Days arid are scorching all, where do we go?
The darkness calls
When daylight forms blinding, binding walls, where do we go?
The darkness calls
Days arid are scorching all, where do we go?
The darkness callsEmbed
