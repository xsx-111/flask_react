Clove Smoke Catharsis Lyrics
Lean against the night and laugh
As I try to scale the wall
Ignored futility fills the air
You're only there to watch me fall
Watch me fall, watch me

If only pure sweetness was offered
Why is this bitter taste left in my mouth?
If I could catch my breath, just to exhale
I'd know that I held it in too long

From above comes a faint smile
A new vantage, such a view
Familiarity, now disowned
Just sit and stare, as I walk away
Walk away, watch me

If only pure sweetness was offered
Why is this bitter taste left in my mouth?
If I could catch my breath, just to exhale
I'd know that I held it in too long
If only pure sweetness was offered
Why is this bitter taste left in my mouth?
If I could catch my breath, just to exhale
I'd know that I held it in too long
If only pure sweetness was offered
Why is this bitter taste left in my mouth?
If I could catch my breath, just to exhale
I'd know that I held it in too longEmbed
