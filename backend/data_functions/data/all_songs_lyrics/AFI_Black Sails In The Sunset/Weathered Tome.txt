Weathered Tome Lyrics
They're coming around again
I've returned and they've been waiting
Their aged offerings received and returned
Passed through wet eyes
I tremble as I feel them rolling in
For my sins, the old ghosts know
So chilling as I feel them mourn within
My soul, as the mourning grows

Unfold before me, turn back the page again
Twenty-four hours spent wishing that the day was never ending
Shadows of glory shading my heart again
Recall the summer when I left my heart to cool beneath the shadows

I'm coming around again
I've returned and no one's waiting
I strain my eyes to see
But it's so hard to read the old tags on fallen walls
I tremble as I feel them rolling in
For my sins, the old ghosts know
So chilling as I feel them mourn within
My soul, as the mourning grows
Unfold before me, turn back the page again
Twenty-four hours spent wishing that the day was never ending
Shadows of glory shading my heart again
Recall the summer when I left my heart to cool beneath the shadowsEmbed
