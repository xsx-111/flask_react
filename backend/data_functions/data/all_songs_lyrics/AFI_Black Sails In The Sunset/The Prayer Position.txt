The Prayer Position Lyrics
Now, peel the skin back from the flesh
Steal the flesh back from the starving static minds
From nature we must stray, to clarity we'll climb
Deadly impulse seems so natural
Just look beyond it and we'll find, we will find
A brand new evolution, here begins a brand new line

And in the distance there's a gathering
That no longer seems so far away

Pushed to our knees so let us pray
And all together we'll bring the real rain
Watch all that's wasted wash away
So let it come, our will be done

Stature retrieved, regain our form
Break free from instinct that's left us all confined
From nature we must stray, to clarity we'll climb
Tradition ingrained, now impermissible
Now comes a call for all to find, we will find
A brand new evolution, here begins a brand new line
And in the distance there's a gathering
That no longer seems so far away

Pushed to our knees so let us pray
And all together we'll bring the real rain
Watch all that's wasted wash away
So let it come, our will be done

I can't help but fear
Look to my species and tremble
To think that God is just

And in the distance there's a gathering
That no longer seems so far away

Pushed to our knees so let us pray
And all together we'll bring the real rain
Watch all that's wasted wash away
So let it come, our will be doneEmbed
