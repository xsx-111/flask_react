And the Same LyricsYes I know this is politically correct
But it comes to you spiritually direct
An attempt to thoughtfully affect your way of thinking
That is if you believe in race
And that you were born in the right time or place
That is a thought about face your way of thinking
Your way of...
Your way of...
Your way of...
Your way of...
And the same could be said
For all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found out a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now
And now it's nothing but reaction
If you have to carry a gun
To keep your fragile seat at number one
This is a bullet
You can't outrun... Your way of thinking
So wait and see it's coming round
Conscripted through the lost and found
And still we find so tightly wound
Your way of thinking
Your way of...
Your way of...
Your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now
And now there's nothing but reaction
Action, reaction
Action
Action, reaction
Action
Action, action, action, action, action, reactionEmbed
