Bad Mouth LyricsYou can't be what you were
So you better start being
Just what you are
You can't be what you were
The time is now, it's running out
It's running out, it's running, running, running out
You can't be what you were
So you better start living the life
That you're talking about
You can't be what you were
The no movement, the no movement
The no movement in a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
The no movement in a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
The no movement, in a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
You're always talking, talking, talking, talking, talking shit now
But you will talk yourself down
You're going way down!2Embed
