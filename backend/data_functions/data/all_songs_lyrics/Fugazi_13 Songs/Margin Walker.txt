Margin Walker Lyrics
You make yourself so beautiful
You make yourself so, so beautiful
And I feel like I'm gonna
I'm gonna set myself on fire
I'm gonna set myself up at a window
This margin walker wants a clear view
This margin walker wants a clear shot
And now I'm shooting it right on you

Untraceable, untranslatable (Now)
Can't explain all I ever wanted to do (And it comes)
Trajectory passing right through me
Threads my needle, sends it right through you

You make yourself so visible
You make yourself so, so visible
And I feel, I feel like I'm
In the tread of some bastard jealousy
Up here, above the avenue
Up here, where the things you do
They lend me a problem with the language
Split my seams and then they drop in a fuse
Untraceable (Now), untranslatable (Now)
I can't explain all I ever wanted to do (And it comes)
Trajectory passing right through me
Threads my needle, sends it right to you

You, I want a clear shot to you (You)
To you (You), I want a clear shot to you (You)
You want the motherlode? I'll swing a payload
You pull my trigger, send it right to you
You want the motherlode? I swing a payload
You pull my trigger, send it right to you

(Oh, yeah)
Untraceable, untranslatable (Now)
I can't explain all I ever wanted to do (And it comes)
Trajectory passing right through me
Pull my trigger, send it right to youEmbed
