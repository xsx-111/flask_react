Promises LyricsWords
Words and expressions
All these confessions
Of where we stand
How I see you
And you see me
Dedications of symmetry
Together
We will be forever
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see it through
Stupid fucking words
Tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
There were no truer words than when spoken
Let that stand as it should
There was nothing left when broken
We grab anything when we fall
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see us through
Stupid fucking words
Tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
You will do what you do
And I will do what I do
And we will do what we do
Rearrange, see it through
You will do what you do
And I will do what I do
And we will do what we do
Rearrange, see it through
Rearrange
Go where you think you wanna go
Do everything you were sent here for
Fire at will if you hear that call
Touch your hand to the wall at night
Go where you think you wanna go
Do everything you were sent here for
Fire at will if you hear that call
Touch your hand to the wall at night
Promises, promises, promises
Words
Promises, promises, promises
Words
Promises, promises, promises
Words
Promises, promises, promises
