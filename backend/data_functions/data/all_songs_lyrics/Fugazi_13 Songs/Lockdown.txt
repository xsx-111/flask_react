Lockdown LyricsBlood on the pedals, blood on the grips
Steel leveled, chest-level, smear my lips
Let them slip into a smile because now after
A while it's all we're seen to do
'Cause business is as business does
Trash is trash until it's sealed from above
And left onto the corner of your mind to disappear
Yeah! Lockdown the remains
Lockdown the remains
Seal it with a kiss
A machine works best when the machine's not shy
Trash is trash but trash from cash must divide
Body bent, body-doubled, dismissed by time
A 5 to 9 will serve the 9 to 5, now c'mon!
Lockdown the remains
Lockdown the remains
Seal it with a kiss
Seal it with a kiss!
Like with a smile!
Seal it with a kiss!
Like with a smile!
Seal it with a kiss!
Like with a smile!
Seal it with a kiss!
Lock you up!
Shut you down!
Shut you down!
Lock you up!
Lock you up!
Shut you down!
Shut you down!
You're shut up!Embed
