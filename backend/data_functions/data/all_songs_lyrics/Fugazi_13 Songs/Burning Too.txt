Burning Too LyricsAnytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
Anytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
We are consumed by society
We are obsessed with variety
We are all filled that anxiety
World would not survive
We gotta put it out, put it out, we gotta put it out
The sky is burning
We gotta put it out, we gotta put it out, put it out
The water's burning
We gotta put it out, put it out, put it out
The earth is burning
Outrage
But then they say...
Anytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
Anytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
The world is not our facility
We have a responsibility
To use our abilities
To keep this place alive
We gotta put it out, put it out, put it out
The sky is burning
We gotta put it out, we gotta put it out, put it out
The water's burning
We gotta put it out, put it out, we gotta put it out
The earth is burning
Right here
Right now
Do it
Do it
Now
Do it
Now
Do it
Now
Do itEmbed
