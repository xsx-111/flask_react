Provisional LyricsSomewhere in these private minds
The last one comes just in time to
Clear out the chambers, sew up the lips
That's the price to pay for hoping
Every slip's not a slide
In other words, not to get it wrong
Pointless to walk when it's past time to run
Secure under the weight of watchful eyes
Lulled to sleep under clear, expansive skies
Somewhere in these prying hearts
Competing histories tear us apart
We hope we won't get what we deserve
Hide behind the targets in front of
All the people we serve
Somewhere in these private minds
The last one comes just in time to
Clear out the chambers, sew up the lips
That's the price to pay for hoping
Every slip's not a slideEmbed
