Bulldog Front Lyrics
Ahistorical
You think this shit just dropped right out of the sky
My analysis:
It's time to harvest the crust from your eyes
To surge and refine
To rage and define ourselves
Against your line
So sorry friend, you must resign

You want to figure it out
We'll throw down
We'll throw down
We'll throw down
You want to figure it out
Well throw down your bulldog front

Bold, bold mouth talking, not so bold
Now that you've eaten your own
Lips flecked, mouth specked
You strip the skin right off of the bone
But I would never say
You act without precision or care, but
It's all attention to armor
To the armor you wear so well
You want to figure it out
We'll throw down
We'll throw down
You want to figure it out
We'll throw down your bulldog front

You want to figure it out
You want to figure it out

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

You want to figure it out
We'll throw down and
We'll throw down
You want to figure it out
We'll throw down your bulldog front
You want to figure it out
You want to figure it outEmbed
