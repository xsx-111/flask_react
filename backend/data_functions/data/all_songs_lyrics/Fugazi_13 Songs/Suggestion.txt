Suggestion LyricsWhy can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Is my body my only trait in the eyes of men?
In the eyes of men
I've got some skin
When you want to look in
I've got some
There lays no reward (in what you, in what you)
In what you discover
You spent yourself, boy
Watching me suffer
Suffer your words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands
Suffer your interpretation (of what it is)
Of what it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is) to be a man
I've got some skin
When you wanna look in
Well, I've got some
She does nothing to deserve it
He touches her 'cause he wants to observe it
We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us
He just wants, he wants to prove it
She does nothing to remove it
We don't want anyone to mind us
So we play the roles that they assigned us
She does nothing to conceal it
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
We blame her for being there
We are all here
But we are all...
