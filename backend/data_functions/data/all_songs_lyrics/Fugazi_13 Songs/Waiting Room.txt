Waiting Room Lyrics
I am a patient boy
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait
My time is like water down a drain
Everybody's moving, everybody's moving
Everybody's moving, moving, moving, moving
Please don't leave me to remain
In the waiting room

I don't want the news (I cannot use it)
I don't want the news (I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up

(Ahh, come on and get up)
(Come on and get up)

But I don't sit idly by (ahh)
I'm planning a big surprise
I'm gonna fight for what I wanna be
And I won't make the same mistakes (Because I know)
Because I know how much time that wastes
(And function), function is the key
To the the waiting room
I don't want the news (I cannot use it)
I don't want the news (I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up

(Ahh, come on and get up)

Up for the waiting room

Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (ahh)
Sitting in the waiting room (Tell me why?)
Because they can't get up15Embed
