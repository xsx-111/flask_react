Glue Man LyricsI
I spent it all
I
I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag
I
I spent it all
The sun comes up, the tide rolls out
The trucks roll by the park, still a park
Where children play, pick up stones
Anything to make them feel less alone - he's alone
His mind is his own town
Where his thoughts run aground
They fall all over and down
I
I spent it all
I
I spent it all
On the bag (can't you see)
On the drag
I
I spent it all
The sun comes down, the tide rolls back
We crawl our way back to the house we call home
He holds his home in the palm of his hand (and says)
And he says, and he says
You are my everyone
You are my anyone
You are my anytime
You are my everytime
You are my anywhere
You are my everywhere
You are my anytime
You are my anytime
You are my anytime
You are my everywhere
You are mine
And he says, and I say
And he says, and I say, I say
You are my everyone
You are my anyone
You are my anytime
You are my everytime
You are my anywhere
You are my everywhere
You are my anytime
You are my anytime
Everywhere
Anywhere
Everywhere
