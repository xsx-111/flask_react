We Want Freedom Lyrics
I was born black, I live black
And I'mma die probably *because* I'm black
Because some cracker that knows I'm black
Better than you, nigga, is probably gonna' put
A bullet in the back of my head!
Yeah our lives fucked up, no doubt
All this shit we go through every day
Sometimes a nigga don't know what the fuck to do
But see I got my niggas
And we gon organize a people army
And we gon get control over our own lives
And I mean that shit right there from the bottom of my shit
I Ching

Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war?
Could you take the life of somebody you know
Or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died when they registered
Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me wanna break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free? We need more than MCs
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today is kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us
But I'mma stand up on my own, like a man do
Dominate the land and make wealth, like Fu-Manchu
Yes, the peoples army stick together like glue
We represent the I-Ching, and to this we stand true
Military formation, anyone participation is welcome
Each one teach one, son help son
Just one gun is all it take to get it started
Livin in the wilderness of the West, we cold-hearted

If you don't think it could happen, think again, my son
Be prepared, for the worst has yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies of ancient wisdom
Cataclysm; niggas be like, "Fuck the system"
If you don't think it could happen, think again, my son
Be prepared, for the worst has yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies of ancient wisdom
Cataclysm; niggas be like, "Fuck the system"
I don't wanna be no movie star (Uh-uh)
I don't wanna drive no fancy car (Uh-uh)
I just wanna be free to live my life
To live my own life

Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is, crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
Cuz a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lot of niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, trying to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear and the coming years ahead of me
I'm ready for whatever they bring, though
I'd go against a tank with a shank for my dreams
And that's my fucking word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hanging on the curb

If you don't think it could happen, think again, my son
Be prepared, for the worst has yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies of ancient wisdom
Cataclysm; niggas be like, "Fuck the system"
If you don't think it could happen, think again, my son
Be prepared, for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies of ancient wisdom
Cataclysm; niggas be like, "Fuck the system"
I don't wanna be no movie star
And I don't wanna drive no fancy car
I just wanna be free to live my life
To live my own life

If you don't think it could happen, think again, my son
Be prepared, for the worst has yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclysm; niggas be like, "Fuck the system"
If you don't think it could happen, think again, my son
Be prepared, for the worst has yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies of ancient wisdom
Cataclysm; niggas be like, "Fuck the system"1Embed
