Wolves Lyrics
I'm not a hunter but I am told
That, in places like in the Arctic
Where indigenous people sometimes might hunt a wolf
They'll take a double edged blade;
And they'll put blood on the blade
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice
So that only the blade is protruding
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat
And it'll come and lick the blade, trying to eat
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade
Of course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds
And he thinks he's really having a good meal
And he drinks, and he licks, and he licks
And of course, he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself
That’s what the Imperialists did to us with crack cocaine
You got these young brothers out there thinking that they’re getting something
That they’re gonna make a living with
They is getting something so they can buy a car;
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something so they can get a piece of gold;
White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They’re getting something to get a house;
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there’s something that’s bringing resources to them
But they're killing themselves just like the wolf was licking the blade
And they're slowly dying without knowing it
That’s what’s happening to the community, you with me on that?
That’s exactly and precisely what happens to the community
And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn
Handle and the blade in the ice for the wolf
What happens is the wolf gets blamed for trying to live
That’s what happens in our community
You don't blame the person, the victim
You blame the oppressor!
Imperialism, white power is the enemy
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa
Snatched up the first African;
Brought us here against our will
Is the enemy today
That’s the thing that we have to understand3Embed
