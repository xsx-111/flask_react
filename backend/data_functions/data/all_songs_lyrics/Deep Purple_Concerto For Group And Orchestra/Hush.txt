Hush Lyrics
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na

I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Sometimes she's gonna
Make me feel so bad

Na na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her
Just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving
And I'm not to blame now
(Love, love)
They got it early in the morning
(Love, love)
They got it late in the evening
(Love, love)
Well, I want that, need it
(Love, love)
Oh, I gotta gotta have it

She's got loving like quicksand
Only took one touch of her hand
To blow my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat and I can't sleep

Na na na na, na na na, na na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na

Listen, hush, hush
I thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her
Just the same now
Hush, hush
Thought I heard her
Calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her loving
And I'm not to blame now
(Love, love)
They got it early in the morning
(Love, love)
They got it late in the evening
(Love, love)
Well, I want that, need it
(Love, love)
Yeah I gotta gotta have it


Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na
Na na na, na na na7Embed
