Several Miles LyricsSeveral miles have come between
All for the best it seems
And just in case you're listening
To this song, I will make it clear
That I still love you
Whatever happened, it don't need to be second guessed
We move from one home to a new address
Oh, it's just miles, miles behind us
Miles to go, miles behind us
Several miles have come to pass
The smoke is cleared at last
Into our lives we disappear
It's just a song that you sometimes hear
As you're passing through
Whatever happened, it don't need to be second guessed
We move from one home to a new address
Oh, it's just miles, miles behind us
Miles to go, miles behind us
I'm listening too
Oh, it's just miles, miles behind us
Miles to go, miles behind us
Oh, it's just miles
Several miles have come between
All for the best it seems
Just in case you're listening
I'm listening tooEmbed
