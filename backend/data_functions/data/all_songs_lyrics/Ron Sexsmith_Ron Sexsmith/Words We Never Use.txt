Words We Never Use LyricsI can't understand this sadness here
Sorrow's rolling in from where's unclear
But I know there's a reason for all these blues
So I'm off to find the words we never use
Yes, I know you've been hurt by words I've said
But more by the time I turned my head
For the willow of your smile is showing through
You're aching for the words we never use
How long must we bury all we feel?
Yes, and turn in the face of what is real
Well, now love's made an offer we can't refuse
So let's try for the words we never use, the words we never useEmbed
