Galbraith Street LyricsI woke up on Galbraith Street
Where the houses stood like twins
Oh, and even though the door's been closed
I can find a way to get back in
For in daydreams my mind returns
Like a ghost upon the hill
As I knock upon old doors again
And find my friends all live there still
So many good times to speak of in a life
But none compared to the good times I had there
The world looks so much brighter when
You believe in every word
Now, I'm holding on to all those years
Like a tear before it falls unheard
So many goodbyes to speak of in a life
But none compared to the goodbyes I said there
The sun went down on Galbraith street
Saw it from my childhood bed
As the red and gold brick houses stood
Underneath a crimson sky that bledEmbed
