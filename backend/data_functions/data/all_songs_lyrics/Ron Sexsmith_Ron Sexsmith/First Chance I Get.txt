First Chance I Get LyricsFirst chance I get, I'm gonna write you a letter
Tell you everything I'm feeling
First chance I get, I'm going to make it better
Then we can both start healing
But right now, there's blood everywhere
Tears and despair
And the mirror is cracking
First chance I get, I'm gonna send my blues packing
First chance I get, I'm gonna take you somewhere
Somewhere safe and secluded
First chance I get, I'm gonna take you up where
Pure love ain't diluted
But right now the roads are bad
World's going mad
But I swear, we're gonna get there someday
(Someday)
First chance I get, I'm gonna plan out the big getaway
But right now I'm occupied, my hands are tied
But I swear I'm gonna get 'round to it
(To it)
First chance I get, I'm gonna say, “I love you” and prove it
First chance I get, I'm gonna say, “I love you” and prove it
Oh, first chance I get, I'm gonna say, “I love you” and prove itEmbed
