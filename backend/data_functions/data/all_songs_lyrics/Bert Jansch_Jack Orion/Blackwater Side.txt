Blackwater Side LyricsOne morning fair
I took the air
Down by black waterside
Was in gazing all around me
The Irish lad I spied
All through the fair part of that night
We lay in sport and play
Til this young man arose and gathered his clothes
Saying, "Fare thee well today"
That's not the promise that you gave to me
When you lay upon my breast
For you had made me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west
Then go hometo your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill
And think on your misfortune
That you've wrought with your wanton will
One morning fair
I took the air
Down by black waterside
Was in gazing all around me
The Irish lad I spied1Embed
