The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face LyricsThe first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and empty skies my love
Dark and empty skies
The first time ever I kissed your lips
I felt the earth move in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love
That was there at my command
The first time ever I lay with you
I felt your heart beat close to mine
And I knew our joy would fill the earth
And would last till the end of time, my love
And would last till the end of time
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and empty skies my love
Dark and empty skiesEmbed
