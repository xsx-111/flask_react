Nottamun Town LyricsIn a-Nottamun town, not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
To show me my way to fair Nottamun town
I bought me a horse, t'was called the gray mare
Gray mane and gray tail, a green stripe down her back
Gray mane and gray tail, a green stripe down her back
There ain't a hair on her that ain't coal black
She stood so still, she threw me to the dirt
She bruised my hide and she teared my shirt
From saddle to stirrup I mounted again-a
And on my ten toes I rode over the plain
When I got there, no one could I see
They all stood around a-looking at me;
I called for a quart to drive gladness away
To stifle the dust â€” for it had rained the whole day
The king and the queen and a company more
Came a-riding behind and a-walking before
Came a stark-naked drummer, a-beating a drum
With his heels in his bosom come marching along
Sat down on a hard, hot cold frozen stone
Ten thousand stood round me and yet I wass alone
Took my hat in my hand for to keep my head warm
Ten thousand got drowned that never was born
Yeah, in Nottamun town, not a soul would look up
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
To show me my way to fair Nottamun townEmbed
