Pretty Polly LyricsPolly, pretty Polly, come go along with me
Polly, pretty Polly, come go along with me
Before we get married, some pleasures to see
She jumped up behind him and away they did ride
She jumped up behind him and away they did ride
Over the hills and the valleys so wide
They rode on a little further and a-what did they spy
They rode on a little further and a-what did they spy
But a new dug grave with a spade lying by
Oh Willy, oh Willy, I'm a-scared of your ways
Willy, oh Willy, I'm a-scared of your ways
Scared you may lead my poor body astray
There's no time to talk now, there's no time to stand
There's no time to talk and there's no time to stand
And in his right hand a dagger 
He stabbed her through the heart and her heart's blood did flow
Stabbed her through the heart and her heart's blood did flow
And into her grave pretty Polly did go
He threw a little dirt over her, started for home
Threw a little dirt over her, started for home
He left nothing behind but the wild birds to morn
A debt to the devil and Willy must pay
A debt to the devil and Willy must pay
For killing pretty Polly and running awayEmbed
