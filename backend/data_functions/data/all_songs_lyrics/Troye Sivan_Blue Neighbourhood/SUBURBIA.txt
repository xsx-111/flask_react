SUBURBIA Lyrics
The sun sets longer
Where I am from
Where dreams go to die
While having fun
The boys fix their cars and
Girls eat it up
Loving's so good when
Love is young

Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia
Swallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing time
Missing occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine

Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces

Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
