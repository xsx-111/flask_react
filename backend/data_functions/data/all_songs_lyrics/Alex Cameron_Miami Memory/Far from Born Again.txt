Far from Born Again Lyrics
Men don't protect her
They just neglect her
They got her singing the blues
There's either no God or there is and he don't care about you
She'll keep on hustling
Make money till the cash starts rustling
She's got the keys to the till
Her scent is dancing like a pie upon a windowsill

Are you seeing
What I'm seeing?
In control in command
She's just a woman in charge of her plan

Some love 'em and then leave 'em
Some want you to stay
It doesn't make a difference if she does it for pay
Far from born again
She's doing porn again
They're angry little dogs
But she don't care what they say
Same men that tell her stop
Are the same suckers that pay
Far from born again
She's doing porn again
There's no romancing
When a woman makes her money from dancing
She's not gonna fall for your charm
You have to call her stupid just to comprehend what she does
Now she's doing sex work
Pays bills while you all still text jerks
She buys her own damn meals
You sit at home and masturbate while she plays grown ups for real

Are you seeing
What I'm seeing?
In control in command
She's a woman earning more than a man

Some love 'em and then leave 'em
Some want you to stay
It ain't your goddamn business if she does it for pay
Far from born again
She's doing porn again
This girl's a new creation even after two kids
She'll change your whole damn life if you just watch one of her vids
Far from born again
She's doing porn again2Embed
