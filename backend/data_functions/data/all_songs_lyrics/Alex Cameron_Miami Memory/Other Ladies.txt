Other Ladies Lyrics
Here I am in old Agora
At this lonesome Holiday Inn
But I ain't got no money and I ain't got the time
To be free, yeah

I don't even need those other ladies
I don't need to make up my mind
If it's plain to see what you have done to me
Then baby I don't understand what we're waiting for
I don't understand what we're waiting for

I've been working like you've told me
Pitching shows to NBC
But that old Tim Allen ain't the way he used to be
It's not for me, TV!

I don't even need those other ladies
I don't need to make up my mind
If it's plain to see what you have done to me
Then baby I don't understand what we're waiting for
I don't understand what we're waiting for
Now I'm heading down the highway
I'm gonna let you scroll right through my phone
'Cause there ain't nothing to see
But pictures of Miami
And from now on, it's you and me

I don't even need those other ladies
I don't need to make up my mind
If it's plain to see what you have done to me
What you have to done
Then baby I don't understand what we're waiting for
I don't understand what we're waiting forEmbed
