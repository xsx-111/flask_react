Miami Memory Lyrics
Holding your hand at the strip club
Holding your hand at the beach
Holding your hand just to make sure
You're never too far out of reach
Making love in your momma's bed
Making love on the floor
Making love in the hotel room
We forgot to shut the door

I can't believe they think about it
Leaving here for somewhere new
No one did that city right
But me and you

Cellulite massage and cocktails
Bursting fireworks over the sea
Maybe I know at the end of the day
The water's rising and it's hard to breathe
Eating your ass like an oyster
The way you came like a tsunami
Our love is strong like a city
In Miami Memory
Watching you dance with a bald cap on
Watching you dance all night long
Watching you pleasure a woman
While I sit and carry on
Knowing the world is a sinking ship
Knowing we've been here before
Knowing when cars fill with water
A vacuum seals the door

I can't believe they dream about it
Moving on to somewhere new
I swear no one does this city right
But me and you

Cellulite massage and cocktails
Bursting fireworks over the sea
Maybe I know at the end of the day
The water's rising and it's hard to breathe
Eating your ass like an oyster
The way you came like a tsunami
Our love is strong like a city
