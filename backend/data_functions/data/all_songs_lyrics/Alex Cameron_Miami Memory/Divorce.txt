Divorce Lyrics
Well, in the age of conversation
I guess I got the gift of gab
But when you shine your spotlight on me
My little microphone turns to sand
And I've killed little baby rabbits
I've killed microscopic crabs
But I never killed a feeling
Like the one you and me had

Now, did you see where my love went?
Because it ain't here in my hand
You need to check there, darling, between your legs
I couldn't bear another needy man

I got friends in Kansas City with a motherfucking futon couch
If that's how you want to play it
I'm drinking in the dark because my battery's all ran out
All you got to do is say it
Divorce

I could leave your ovulation
To meet Elon and his clan
With his batteries full of sunlight
And his cars that run on sand
And I'll go weak with constipation
From all the pills and the spam
Though we drink our Mother Energy
There ain't no women for the needy man
Or did you see where my love went?
Because it ain't here in my hand
You need to check there, darling, between your legs
I couldn't bear another needy man

I got friends in Kansas City with a motherfucking futon couch
If that's how you want to play it
I'm drinking in the dark because my battery's all ran out
All you got to do is say it
Divorce, divorce, divorce
All you got to do is say it
Divorce, divorce, divorce
All you got to do is say it2Embed
