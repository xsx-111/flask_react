Too Far Lyrics
I wake up in the middle of the night
And I swear I heard him call your name
It's nothing new, and I’ve got my exes too
But it irks me baby all the same

I can feel it, I know you feel it too
Yeah, he's calling you
Yeah, he's calling you baby
I don’t know just what the hell I'm supposed to do

One boy in your head
One boy in your heart
Feeling like it's gone too far
Feeling like it's gone too far

We're at brunch and this scampi's all nice, I'm feeling like a million bucks
In he comes, this bobbin' turd, this piece of shit, he just won’t flush

I can feel it, I know you feel it too
Yeah, he’s coming
Yeah, he's coming, baby
I don’t know just what the fuck I'm supposed to do
One boy in your head
One boy in your heart
Feeling like it's gone too far
Feeling like it's gone too far
One boy in your bed
One boy in your yard
Feeling like it’s gone too far
Feeling like it's gone too far

Sometimes I find myself contemplating
What my life could be like after you've left me
And it's a dark place
But in that place, for a brief moment
I understand how the men from your past feel
They feel pathetic for having lost someone so unique
What I can't understand is how they treat you
How they let their own feelings of shame and disappointment in themselves obscure the truth
The truth that you're a good mother
The truth that your children love and admire you
And that they have nothing to be afraid of when they're in your presence
The truth that you're an artist, you're an actor
And a real motherfucking powerhouse
So if you're worried that this could all come undone
Because of something you did or said
That might come back to haunt you
I don't care about your past
I don't care about how many times you've lied to save face
Or to protect yourself
I only care that you're mine for as long as you're around
And for as long as that's in the cards
Then sweet one
You could never go too farEmbed
