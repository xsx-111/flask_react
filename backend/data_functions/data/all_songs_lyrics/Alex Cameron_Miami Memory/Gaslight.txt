Gaslight Lyrics
Well, you are the only one
Yeah, you are the only one
Now tell me I'm the only one
Go on girl and say it, I’m the only one

And that's why when I'm feeling something ain’t right
I hold you tight and use my gaslight

Baby talk to me, you've been acting strange
I can see in your eye that there's something wrong
And these texts are all crazy, I'm not surprised
'Cause I've seen it before
Don't go lying now, baby your dates are all hazy
Hear me out, I'm a nice guy
In the night, use my gaslight

I know you like your mama does
You need help like a baby does
And these so-called friends are lying when they tell you
Your life’s changed for the better
And I know if I had friends, they’d probably tell me
Say boy you should go get her
And that's why when you’re feeling that fight or flight
It's so warm and bright, use my gaslight

Baby talk to me, you've been acting strange
I can see in your eye that there's something wrong
And these texts are all crazy, I’m not surprised
'Cause I've seen it before
Don't go lying now, baby your dates are all hazy
Hear me out, I'm a nice guy
In the night, use my gaslight

Use my gaslight, baby
Use my, use my
Use my gaslight, baby
Use my, use my
Use my gaslight, baby
So warm, so bright
Use my gaslight, baby
Use my, use my
And that's why when I'm feeling something ain't right
I hold you tight and use my gaslightEmbed
