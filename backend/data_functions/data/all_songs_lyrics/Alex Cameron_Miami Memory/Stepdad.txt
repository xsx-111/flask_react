Stepdad Lyrics
And now that you know why I'm leavin'
And your mum's yelling out that she hopes I don't come back
Of course she would say that

Don't forget what I told you about your demons
They're just thoughts in your head while you sleep, no more than that
Now fetch my duffle bag

If my ride ain't here, then it's coming
I can feel it not so far away
And I know you're angry, youngen
Dry your eyes up
Or you won't see
Big dog walking away

Now if you think I'm chasing the seasons
Like a van is some place to be
I'm your stepdad
And I know they say I'm scheming of leaving
Dreaming my life away
But if you see my name in the headlines
And they're all pissing on me
I'm your stepdad
And I know they say I'm frail and broken
But you can't treat your mom that way
I'll tell you how I got to Memphis
Saw your mum on a TV show and that was that
Both my bags were packed

I could put you to sleep just by reading
Turn the living room into an avalanche
I loved to make you laugh

If the paps ain't here, then they're comin'
I can hear their flashes blast away
And I know you're tired, youngen
Time to wise up
Or you won't see
What your dad does for pay

Now if you think I'm chasing the seasons
Like a van is some place to be
I'm your stepdad
And I know they say I'm scheming of leaving
Dreaming my life away
But if you see my name in the headlines
And they're all pissing on me
I'm your stepdad
And I know they say I'm frail and broken
But you can't treat your mum that way1Embed
