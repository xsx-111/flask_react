PC with Me Lyrics
Oooh
Calm me down, babe
I know I've been away
I'm coming back for the holidays
Boots all shined, I'm Santa Claus with AIDS
Selling pornographic polaroids and counterfeit shades

When she said
"You don't have to be
My darling, so PC with me"
Yeah, she said
"You don't have to be
So PC with me
Because the meaner they are
The harder I fall in love
The meaner they are
The harder I fall in love"

I'm barely treading water, Roy Boy's clinging on
Paddling drunk through airports
On a raft of plastic bongs
Been on dating apps in Budapest
We got Figh as Huck in Prague
Sodomy in Berlin without no guten Tag
When she said
"You don't have to be
My darling, so PC with me"
Yeah, she said
"You don't have to be
So PC with me
Because the meaner they are
The harder I fall in love
The meaner they are
The harder I fall in love"
(Ooh, that's right)

She said
"The meaner they are
The harder I fall in love"
(In love, ooh, ahh)
She said
"The meaner they are
The harder I fall in love"Embed
