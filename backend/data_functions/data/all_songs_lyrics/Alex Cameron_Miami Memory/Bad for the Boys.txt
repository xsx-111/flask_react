Bad for the Boys Lyrics
Never thought I'd feel bad for the boys
Never thought I'd feel bad for the boys
Good old Dane, what a shame
He got done for a sexual harassment claim
What about Phil, he lost his chill
Had to go and eat that damn red pill

And here come the grammar police
Here comes the PC brigade
And here comes the mattress on the floor
From the bed you tried to get her to make

And now you're living little lives without women
And blaming them for all the change
You thought the boys were gonna stay the same
But no one cares about your good old days

Never thought I'd feel bad for the boys
Never thought I'd feel bad for the boys
Poor Jack, that was slack
He took the bait and hit his girl back
And here comes Mike with the motorbike
Guess he'll never get to see that little tyke
And handsome Cory with his high school glory
Yeah, no one wants to hear those fucking stories
And here come the grammar police
Here comes the PC brigade
And here comes the mattress on the floor
From the bed you tried to get her to make

And now you're living little lives without women
And blaming them for all the change
You thought the boys were gonna stay the same
But no one cares about your good old days
Now you live a little life without women
And blaming them for all the change
You thought the boys were supposed to stay the same
But no one cares about your good old days

Never thought I'd feel bad for the boys
Never thought I'd feel bad for the boys
Feel so bad, feel so bad, feel so bad
Feel so bad for the boys
Not so sure I feel bad, feel so bad
Feel so bad for the boys
Guess I don't feel so bad, feel so bad, feel so bad
Feel so bad, feel so bad for the boys1Embed
