Radio Gnome Invisible LyricsRadio Gnome (from outer space, Radio Gnome)
Brrrain to brrrain! (Rradio Gnome)
Radio Gnome, Radio Gnome, Radio Gnome, Radio Gnome
Radio Gnome
Gnome
Radio-oh Gnome
Radio-oh Gnome
Radio Gnome, Radio Gnome Invisible, hah
Then when you're receiving
Perceiving your telepathic powers
Who knows why the wind blows through this window
Why you believe in me
We believe in you
Oh I am in a Persain market
With the Pot-head Pixies
Cool
What's that in the sky now?
Teapots that can fly now (Good lord)
Voices in your head
Tell me what they said
Banana, nirvana, mañana (you know)
Banana, nirvana, mañana (and I know)
Banana, nirvana, mañana (we know)
Banana, nirvana, mañana (who knows)
Banana, nirvana, mañana (you know)
Banana, nirvana, mañana (and I know)
Banana, nirvana, mañana (we know)
Banana, nirvana, mañana (who knows)
Everything you think shows
Hanging round your head
Underneath your long hair
Tell me what you feel there
Brrrain to brrrain!
Pot-head pixies
Pot-head pixies, pot-head pixies, pot-head pixies, pot-head pixies, pot-head pixies, pot-
You hear me
But I don't see you
You feel me
One day I'll be you
Gnome
Radio-oh Gnome
Radio-oh Gnome
Radio Gnome, Radio Gnome Invisible, hah
Then when you're receiving
Believing your telepathic powers
Who knows why the wind blows through this window
Why you believe in me
We believe in you
What's that in the sky now?
Teapots that can fly now
Voices in your head
Tell me what they saidEmbed
