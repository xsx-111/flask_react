The Pot-Head Pixies LyricsI am, you are, we are, crazy!
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Hey Pete, you gotta meet the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
So meet, you'll never beat the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Oh me, they're something to see, the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Oh my, they come from the sky, the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Beware! Be aware! Beware! Be aware!
Somebody somewhere has got to be high
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
They got a Flying Teapot, don't need a taxi
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
They're from the planet of love, the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Ding dang dong, singing the song, it's pretty catchy
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
They just can't give you enough, the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Be there! Be aware! Be there! See you there!
Open on Saturday seven to nine
I'm an invisible Pothead Pixie
The green planet Gong is my home
Now, I live everywhere but in case I'm not there
You can reach me by Radio Gnome
Somebody somewhere has got to be high
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Hey Joe, you gotta know the PotHead Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Hey-ho, they come and they go, the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Hey Pete, get up on your feet and catch a taxi
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Alright, we're gonna meet the Pot Head Pixies
I am, you are, we are, crazy!
Now so! Now you know! Here and now! They come and go!
