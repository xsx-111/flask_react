Big-Jesus-Trash-Can Lyrics
Big Jesus soulmates Trash Can
And its a fucking rotten business this
Both feet in the bad-boot
Stiff in the crypt, babay, like a rock
Rock-rock-rock

Big-Jesus soul-mates Trash-Can
Pumped me fulla Trash at least it smelt like Trash
Wears a suit of Gold (got greasy hair)
But God gave me sex appeal
Well-well-well-rock
He drives a trash can
He's comin to my town rock rock rock
Ro-o-o-o-o-ck!

Big Jesus Oil King down in Texas
Drives great holy tanks of gold
Screams from heaven's graveyard
American heads will roll in Texas (roll like Daddies meat)
Roll under those singing stars of Texas
Roll under those glorious singing stars of Texas
Well-well-well-well
Well-well-well-well
Well-well-well-well
Well-well-well-well
He drives a trash can
He's coming to town
He's coming to town
He's coming to my town
And he drives a trash can
He's coming to my town
And he drives a trash can
He's coming to my town
And he drives a trash can
He's coming to my town
And he drives a trash can
He's coming to my town
And he drives a trash canEmbed
