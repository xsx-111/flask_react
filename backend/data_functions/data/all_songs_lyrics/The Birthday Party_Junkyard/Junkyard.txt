Junkyard Lyrics
I am the King
I am the King
I am the King
I am the King
I am the King
I am the King
I am the King
I am the King

One dead marine through the hatch
Scratch and scrape this heavenly body
Every inch of winning skin
There's garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Come on and kiss me
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Stack the garbage junk
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey's child is taken over this place
Two dead marines standing in a row
Drink to me, my heavenly body
Every inch a winning thing
There's garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Come on and kiss me
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Stack all this junk
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Honey's child is taken over this place

Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack this heavenly body
Yack, yack, yack, yack, yack, yack, yack, yack, yack, yack goes junk-face
Scratch, scrape, scratch, scrape, scratch, scrape, scratch, scrape, this winning thing
There's garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Junk in honey's bunk again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey
Garbage in honey
Garbage in honey
Garbage in honey
Garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey's sack again
Garbage in honey
Garbage in honey
Garbage in honey
Garbage in honey
Junkyard king
Junkyard king
Junkyard king
Junkyard king
King, king, king, kingEmbed
