Blast Off LyricsThis time it's the truth
This time nothings gonna fall on through
These books
Are broken up
Blast off!
Wham! bam!
Right off the shelf
Right off the shelf
Right off the shelf
Blast off!
Blast off
This is it- the last one
This one's the final-in-a-fair-field-of-wheat
This building
Will maybe fall down
Blast off!
Down! down!
Down! down!
The ground
Down! down!
The ground
Blast off!
BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAST OFF!Embed
