6" Gold Blade LyricsI stuck a six-inch gold blade in the head of a girl
She: lying through her teeth, him: lying on his back
Hands off this one, hands off! she cried
Grinning at me from hip to hip
Hands off, pretty baby, tough bone then so soft to slip
Oooh yeah
I stuck a six-inch gold blade in the head of a girl
Sharks-fin slices sugar-bed slices that pretty red-head
I love you! now me! I love you!
Laughter, laughter
Oh baby, those skinny girls, they're so quick to murder
Oooh yeah
Shake it baby, c'mon, shake, shake it baby
