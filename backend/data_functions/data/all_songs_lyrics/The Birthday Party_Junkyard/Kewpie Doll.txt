Kewpie Doll LyricsWell I love that kewpie doll
Well I love that kewpie doll
Well I love that kewpie doll
Yeah I bought her in a show
I dressed her up in a cheap red cotton dress
But everything was either fished-out or spat-out
Fished-out or spat-out
Well I love that kewpie doll
But I could not make it stick
Well I love that kewpie doll
But I could not make it stick
Only she could save my soul
She put her hands inside of me
Well I love that kewpie doll
Dressed her in a cheap-red-cotton-dress
Fished it out now spat it out now
Spat it out in front of me
Well I love that kewpie doll
But I could not make it stick
Doll doll doll doll doll doll doll doll
I held her in my cheap arms
She believed in me, she believed in me
Her soul and my arms
Well I love that kewpie doll
I told her phoney stories
Well I love that kewpie doll
She believed in me
Doll doll doll doll doll doll doll doll
Kewpie on a stick
I can see her coming even now
Kewpie on a stick
I can see her walking to me even now
Well I love that kewpie doll
I can see her walking to me even now
Well I love that kewpie doll
I can see her walking to me even now
Well I love that kewpie doll
But I could not make it stick. endEmbed
