The Dim Locator Lyrics
Inanimational items elude I, and
In-an-emotional-motion I swallow my
Motive of quicker location is slammed
My dim chance of skipping this thick world is thin

They call me Dim
I am the Dim Locator
Dim Locator
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO, L'WOW, WOW, WOW
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO, L'WOW, WOW, WOW
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO, L'WOW, WOW, WOW
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO

Intriquintomitry treads on my trail
Entriggering traps for a gross gang of ghost types
Who later are packed in a cast IRON trunk
These things have been known, to get out of their wraps

Don't call me Dim
I am the Dim Locator
Dim Locator
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO, L'WOW, WOW, WOW
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO, L'WOW, WOW, WOW
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO, L'WOW, WOW, WOW
LOCO, LOMO, LOCO, LOMO, L'WOW, WOW, WOW, WOWWWWWW!
Fog fished and filtered is filling my case book, of
Friends who fall foul of my files trip and BreakNeck
Are stacked in the woodshed for further good use
There's some certain people who shouldn't start fires

So call me Dim!
I am the Dim Locator!
Dim Locator!
DON'T CALL ME DIM!
I am the Dim Locator
DON'T CALL ME DIM!
I am the Dim Locator
DON'T CALL ME DIM!Embed
