Dead Joe Lyrics
Dead Joe Joe... Joe Joe
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho Dead Joe
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho Dead Joe

Welcome to the car smash
Welcome to the car smash
Welcome to the car smash
A-a-a-a-a-smash
Dead Joe

Junk-Sculpture turning back to JUNK
Junk-Sculpture turning back to JUNK
Junk-Sculpture turning back to JUNK
Ju-ju-ju-ju-junk
Dead Joe
Oh Joe no-o-o-o-o-o! It's Christmas time Joe
It's Christmas time now for you
And all the little bells are hanging two-by-two
The holly and the nativity
Oh now speak to me Joe, speak to me Joe, speak to me Joe
Oh-oh-oh---oh--oh--oh--oh--oh--oh--oh
De-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e--e-e-e-ead Joe
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho Dead Joe
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho Dead Joe

Welcome to the car smash
Welcome to the car smash
Welcome to the car crash
You can't tell the girls from the boys anymore
You can't tell the girls from the boys anymore
You can't tell the girls from the boys anymore
You can't tell the girls from the boys anymore
Ho-Oh-Oh-OH-Oh-Oh---Oh--Oh--Oh---Oh---Oh---Oh
De-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e---e-e-e-e-ead JoeEmbed
