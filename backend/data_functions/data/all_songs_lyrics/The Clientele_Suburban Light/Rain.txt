Rain Lyrics
Rain, soft in the dark
We take a left through the deepening park
Grass, soaking and warm
Past the iron gates, August has come

And I want you so bad in my heart
And I touch your shadowed fingers in the dark
And the stars have fallen on this night like rain
Through the silence of the dark October lanes

Iron, cold in the breeze
The gate beneath the haunted trees
Swings, as evening reveals
Your face, so lovely and unreal

And I want you so bad in my heart
And I touch your shadowed fingers in the dark
And the stars have fallen on this night like rain
Through the silence of the dark October lanes

So here everything stays
The dew on the gates has melted away
And in your sunlit eyes
I see my love and all the night
And I want you so bad in my heart
And I touch your shadowed fingers in the dark
And the stars have fallen on this night like rain
Through the silence of the dark October lanesEmbed
