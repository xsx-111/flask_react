We Could Walk Together Lyrics
We could walk together
In the jade and the coolness of the evening light
And watch the crowds serenely flow
Through carnivals and shop windows where elm trees sigh

The summer's heat is fading
And the clown on the golden lawn holds out his hand
And out there in the fading night
The members of a strange parade play sarabandes

Like a silver ring thrown into the flood of my heart
With the moon high above the motorway
I have searched for all your fragrance in the silent dark
Is that okay?

So why don't we stick together?
With our eyes so full of evening and amphetamine
And watch the fools go rolling on
Through still fields as the darkness falls on England greenEmbed
