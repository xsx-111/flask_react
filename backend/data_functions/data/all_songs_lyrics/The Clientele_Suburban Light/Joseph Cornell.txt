Joseph Cornell Lyrics
Why do hummingbirds just hum their
Loneliness to me?
151 or 145
Or twice times 123

If we're on Delancey Street at night
In the after-train-ride quiet
Barking dogs by Highgate Pond
Something's here but something's gone

What a night for talking, darling
What a night for dreams
151 or 145
Or twice times 123

This is all I really know tonight
Something's wrong but something's right
Barking dogs by Highgate Pond
Something's here but something's gone

If we're on Delancey Street at night
In the after-train-ride quiet
Barking dogs by Highgate Pond
Something's here but something's goneEmbed
