Lacewings Lyrics
Only a word is in my mind
We'll get high, we'll go watch the lacewings fly
We'll get high, we'll go watch the lacewings fly

Ever since I saw you
Ever since I saw you, I
There are violets on the shore
There are violets on the shore tonight

Only my words are real tonight
We'll get high, we'll go watch the lacewings fly
We'll get high, we'll go watch the lacewings fly

All the autumn patients, stretching out their arms
Toward the fire
Close my eyes this sleepless night
Close my eyes and I am burning higherEmbed
