Five Day Morning Lyrics
Mrs. Jones and I were dreaming of the moon
On Wednesday afternoons without a cloud
And the mirage of a suburb in the rain
On a train and drifting down

Oh, Miss Lloyd, your smiling eyes are in my mind
Holidays and nights away and quieter times
What's in the game that we both play
Walking our dogs in the rain, anyway?

And we think about the things that we have done
What our love's become, as we drift down
And our glowing eyes are filled with silent rooms
Alleyways and evenings that we found

Oh, Miss Lloyd, your smiling eyes are in my mind
Holidays and nights away and quieter times
What's in the game that we both play
Walking our dogs in the rain, anyway?

And it's a five day morning
As I am in the rain
And I don't know if I'll see you again
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Mrs. Jones and I were dreaming of the moon
On Wednesday afternoons without a cloud
And the mirage of a suburb in the rain
On a train and drifting downEmbed
