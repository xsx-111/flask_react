(I Want You) More Than Ever Lyrics
Oh, I'll never sleep like this
With all the yard just stirring in my mind
As the evening rises up and falls now
I've got something on my mind

And I see you're working on a Tuesday
Back with no relief
And I see I'm walking everywhere
Among the drifting leaves

And I want you more than ever, and I want you still forever
But I'm waiting for the very last departing train
And the night has come so softly to this afternoon of memory
Listen to my words just fade away

And I want you more than ever, and I want you still forever
But I'm waiting for the very last departing train
And the night has come so softly to this afternoon of memory
Listen to my words just fade away

Here with Douglas Crescent on my mindEmbed
