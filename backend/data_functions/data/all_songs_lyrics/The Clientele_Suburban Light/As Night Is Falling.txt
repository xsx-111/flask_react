As Night Is Falling LyricsDrag yourself along to the sweetest Sunday song, then you smile
It's the kind of place, where dizzy and awake, you face the night
And I stoop to touch the skin that only seems to be here in my mind
And I see a stranger now, playing games that break her heart

Oh, Miss Jones
Oh, Miss Jones, can't you see?
Oh, Miss Jones
Oh, Miss Jones, it's me

I am in a dream and I don't know why
The sweetest pain that I, the sweetest pain that I
Sunday in the garden and my mind, oh my mind
And my fever close my eyes till my dream enclose my mind

Oh, Miss Jones
Oh, Miss Jones, can't you see?
Oh, Miss Jones
Oh, Miss Jones, it's me

Drag yourself along to the sweetest Sunday song
Then you smile
It's the kind of place where, dizzy and awake
You face the nightEmbed
