Saturday Lyrics
The taxi lights were in your eyes, so warm against St. Mary's spires
The carnival was over in the rain
And arm in arm through Vincent Street, the evening hanging like a dream
I touched your face and saw the night again

And in your arms, I watched the stars ascend
And sweep a loneliness away for a while
Your fingers white and locked in mine, I kiss your face and kiss your eyes
Until they turn to me and softly smile

And empty hearted, I walked on, the river flowing to the song
Of evening in the darkness and the rain
The Christmas lights were far downstream, the wind so lonely and unreal
I saw your face and I thought you were a dream

But when I saw your eyes, what could I do?
What could I say, my love?
Your kisses, they will hide away the stars

It's Saturday, the evening's come, the football crowds have all gone home
But still behind this window, I look on
December's leaves so slowly fall to cars that break the evening's pall
And I will wait for you to come tonightEmbed
