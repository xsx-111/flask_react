An Hour Before the Light Lyrics
And when I see your sunlit eyes
It turns my laughter into stone
I wait a single hour before the light
Unreal and alone

Summer's waxing in the air, the meadows stretch and onwards to St. James' Square
Oh, my mind's astray
I dream of you each fevered night, the stars are cold and singing in an August sky
That breaks into the day

Are you really in the lonely evening light
That falls in shadows to the ground?
And when I wake enchanted and alone
I don't know where to turn my eyes

Summer's waxing in the air, the meadows stretch and onwards to St. James' Square
Oh, my mind's astray
An afternoon on Saturday before the stars can shine upon the streets of grey
And you and I go home

And when I see your sunlit eyes
It turns my laughter into stone
I wait a single hour before the light
Unreal and aloneEmbed
