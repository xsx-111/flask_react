VCR Lyrics
You, you used to have all the answers
And you, you still have them too
And we, we live half in the day time
And we, we live half at night

Watch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing
But you, you just know, you just do

Wanna find myself by the sea, in another's company by the sea
I wanna go out to the pier, I'm gonna dive and have no fear
'Cause you, you just know, you just do

Watch things on VCRs, with me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars, you say you think we are the best thing
But you, you just know, you just do11Embed
