Hot Like Fire LyricsYou're hotter than summer day, in California
Ya got me meltin like a sundae, and I want ya
I know you've been waitin' you've been waitin' a long time for me
But if you wait a little while longer this is how it'll be
Oh it's gonna be, hot like fire
I'm gonna take you higher
You can't resist
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kiss
You shouldn't have said "take our time"
I'll let you know when I'm ready if that's alright
I won't keep you, I won't keep you, I won't keep you holdin' on
But if you wait on me, I promise you it won't be long
Oh it's gonna be, hot like fire
I'm gonna take you higher
You can't resist
Kiss, kiss, and kiss and kiss and kissEmbed
