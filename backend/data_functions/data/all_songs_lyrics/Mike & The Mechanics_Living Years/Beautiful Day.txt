Beautiful Day LyricsFour o'clock in the morning
Waiting for the light
It's another day dawning
Another day
A better life
Walk out in the morning sun
I'm always going to be
With you
Lay down when your day is done
I'm always going to be
With you
I don't blame you for crying
No-one else could see
But today we'll be flying
Forever you
Forever me
Walk out in the morning sun
I'm always going to be with you
Lay down when your day is done
I'm always going to be
With you
No doubts now we're free to run
I'm always going to be
With you
It's a beautiful
Beautiful day....Embed
