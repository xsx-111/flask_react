Black & Blue LyricsHey, hey one fine day, you're going away ooh
What do you say, little girl
Yeah it's you I'm talkin' to tell me what right have you
To leave me black and blue
You say nothing lasts forever
No never, ever, ever but the goods you got
Oh God, you know it's hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Ooh, it's hot
That's right it's black and white
You're saying day is night
But you leave me black and blue
You say nothing's everlasting
And that love is just the last thing
That you feel you want, you know you got
You know it's hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
We'll I've tried to make it on my own
But I just can't leave your love alone
Maybe just maybe, I'll get it sometime
From a boat or a plane or a magical sign
Send me the pieces, that make up my heart
I'll put them together, a part by, a part by
Hey, you I'm talking to
Tell me what right have you
To leave me black and blue
Yeah, what right have you, what right
To leave me black and blue, you wanna fight
You're saying day is night, you leave me black
Bring back the pieces that make up my heart
And I'll put them together, a part by, a part by a
Hey, you I'm black and blueEmbed
