Nobody Knows LyricsThere is nothing wrong with me
There's nothing wrong with you
Maybe we're just blind to see
Each other's point of view
Nobody knows what we had
You could do much better
You could do much worse than me
I could have walked right out on you
There was nothing stopping me
Nobody knows what we had
We were running of passion
We were running out of time
There's a face to fit the future
There's a face to fit the crime
Now the truth is on the table
And the ghost is plain to see
There's nothing wrong with you or me
I won't live in your world
You can't live in mine
We don't hate each other darlin'
We just gave up trying
Nobody knows what we had
Maybe I'm not crying
Maybe I don't mind
But it hurts just knowing
Your children won't be mine
Nobody knows what we hadEmbed
