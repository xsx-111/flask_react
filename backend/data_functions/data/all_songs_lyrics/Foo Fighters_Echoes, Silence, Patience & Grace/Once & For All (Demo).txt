Once & For All (Demo) Lyrics
Oh misery, come marshal me in
No better place for me to begin
I'm coming in from out of this rain
The time has come to wash you away

The lovers are ridin' again
The lovers are ridin' again
Oh gather 'round, sing your sins
Amen

My time has come once and for all
My time has come, this means war

Oh, bring to me your broken and blue
No matter if it matters to you
A longin' like never before
I've had enough, now I need more


Hey, forgive me, debility
I'll sing you all my sins


My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
My time has come, this means war
The lovers are ridin' again
The lovers are ridin' again
The lovers are ridin' again
The lovers are ridin' againEmbed
