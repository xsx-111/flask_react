Erase / Replace Lyrics
Attention, pay attention
No mention, a sickest array
A mission, an admission
Ignition, detonate

Oh no don't talk about it
No please don't talk about it
Oh no don't talk about it
Not one more word about it
Oh no don't think about it
No please don't think about it
Oh please don't think about it
It goes away

Who made these promises?
You made these promises
Erase, replace
Erase, replace
We'll make more promises
We'll wait for promises
Erase, replace
Erase, replace
A vision, division
Revision, recognate
An action, a reaction
Distraction, question the fate

Oh no don't talk about it
No please don't talk about it
Oh no don't talk about it
It goes away

Who made these promises?
You made these promises
Erase, replace
Erase, replace
We'll make more promises
We'll wait for promises
Erase, replace
Erase, replace

Oh, oh we're better off now
It's the only thing left said
Meant for you
Oh, oh I'm better off now
It's the only thing left said
Meant for you
Who made these promises?
You made these promises
Erase, replace
Erase, replace
We'll make more promises
We'll wait for promises
Erase, replace
Erase, replace

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Erase, replace
Erase, replace4Embed
