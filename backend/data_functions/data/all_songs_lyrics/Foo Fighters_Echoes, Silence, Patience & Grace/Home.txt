Home Lyrics
Wish I were with you
But I couldn't stay
Every direction
Leads me away
Pray for tomorrow
But for today

All I want is to be home

Stand in the mirror
You look the same
Just lookin' for shelter
From cold and the pain
Someone to cover
Safe from the rain


Echoes and silence
Patience and grace
All of these moments
I'll never replace
No fear of my heart
Absence of faith

People I've loved
I have no regrets
Some I remember
Some I forget
Some of them living
Some of them dead
