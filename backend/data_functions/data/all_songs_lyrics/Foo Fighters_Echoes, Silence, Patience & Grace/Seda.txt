Seda Lyrics
Seda, can you hear me?
Do you know my face?
Perfect like a circle
Gone without a trace
So long I have known you
Marks upon your skin
I can picture everything
Can you picture this?

Seda doesn't care, she just sits and stares
All her secrets there for the world to see

Who will stand before you
If you don't say my name?
Safe to say we will never know
We are both the same
I don't mind, I can always find you
Waiting there for me

Seda doesn't care, she just sits and stares
All her secrets there for the world to see
Seda doesn't care, she just sits and stares
Seda doesn't care, she's just dying there
Seda doesn't care. she's just lying there
All her secrets there for you and me1Embed
