Happen LyricsEnd silence, like, common sense
Before I'm too empty, where you went
Without the nerve to speak to me, makes you happen
I guess we are 
Ricochet star by my mind, doesn't matter now
Look down, it scares me, chase him and show me how
Matter, matter, matter
Yeah, yes you matter and always will
Still happen 
Wish we were at a movie
Or in  maybe
This made me feel real small
Take a happy pill, and then, put it in
Make it shake that comes on fly
With a kick end my...
Oh my
I guess we are  hell
Ricochet star by my mind,  well
Look down, look down
It scares me so chase him and show me how
Matter, matter, matter, matter
Yeah, yes you matter
Matter, matter
And yes we are 
Ricochet star by my mind
And those who may well, look down
Love it down
Love it, look down
Look down, look downEmbed
