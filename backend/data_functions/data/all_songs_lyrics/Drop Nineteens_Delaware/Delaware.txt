Delaware LyricsWelcome and spin your Hollywood
In the backyard with a friend on the telephone
The town right then is cooler than down
You're the one that turns it around
It's high and lost, forget about them
And this sound
Yeah, I guess this sound
Wear a bell that Saturday makes
If you've got what it takes, then fate'll come around
Pick that wish and crying thing
And get yourself to a super town
Who cares who's gone?
It's like palm tree sickness hit home
James Taylor's on, through this pipeline
Feels real good
Flashing like rhythm, more than you could
Imagine if it happens to you
And ask me if it lasts
And yesterday's home cut in half
Good night you sleep, it'll be a heavy drive back eastEmbed
