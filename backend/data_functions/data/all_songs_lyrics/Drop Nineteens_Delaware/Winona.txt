Winona Lyrics
There's a gap in the twentieth century
And it fills the world with dreams
When you've got the looks then the rest just works
If that's what it's like...
Then hold on tight to the candy
Believe another record shop story that was born to die
It'll come on real
And we're losing time

Baby dice swingin' from a baby's hand
Too young to understand
All there is to know
To lose your soul

Alien crack down from planet car
Unhappy with their bag of stars
They search for the one
And then wrap her around the sun
They know who we are
Could be as fast as a day that outside your door
And it all has changed evermore
Confused
It's why I've got to know the truth
Was it you who sang in Xanadu?
Baby dice swingin' from a baby's hand
Too young to understand
All there is to know
If you're gonna lose your soul
Guess I've got my fate in the sky
And I wonder why
You'll be the one who used to go
"I'm the only star he wants to know"Embed
