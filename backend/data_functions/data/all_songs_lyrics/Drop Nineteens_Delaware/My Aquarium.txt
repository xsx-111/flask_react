My Aquarium Lyrics
One, two, three

Here I sway on my swing
Make my life a simple thing
I guess the space dust helps
If you know what I mean
Water scape religion can change a frown
Into a happy thing

When you start
I think it's better the second time around
And at the end
You can't do it again

And when I heard where you've been
Maybe it was scary to know that
You killed the only prophet that was left
And maybe I was soaking wet
Without nothing, love
But we've had just about enough
Yes we've had more than enough
When you start
I think it's better the second time around
And at the end
You can't do it again
When you start
I think it's better the second time around
And at the end
You can't do it again

And at the end
I sway on my swing
And at the end
Make my life a simple thing
And at the end
Everyone welcomes the space age nothing

At the end
At the end
At the end, at the end
At the end
At the end, at the end
At the end
At the end, at the end, at the endEmbed
