Are You Ready for the Country Lyrics
Slipping and sliding
And playing domino
Lefting and then Righting
It's not a crime you know
You got to tell your story boy
Before it's time to go

Are you ready for the country because it's time to go? 

I was talking to the preacher
Said God was on my side
Then I ran into the hangman
He said it's time to die
You gotta tell your story boy
You know the reason why
