Out on the Weekend Lyrics
Think I'll pack it in
And buy a pick-up
Take it down to "L.A."
Find a place to call my own
And try to fix up
Start a brand new day

The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say


She got pictures on the wall
They make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road
Trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head
The woman I'm thinking of
She loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

See the lonely boy
Out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy
He tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
Oh
