Words (Between the Lines of Age) Lyrics

Someone and someone were down by the pond
Looking for something to plant in the lawn
Out in the fields, they were turning the soil
I'm sitting here hoping this water will boil
When I look through the windows and out on the road
They're bringing me presents and saying hello

Singing words, words between the lines of age
Words, words between the lines of age


If I was a junkman selling you cars
Washing your windows and shining your stars
Thinking your mind was my own in a dream
What would you wonder? And how would it seem?
Living in castles a bit at a time
The King started laughing and talking in rhyme

Singing words, words between the lines of age
Words, words between the lines of age
