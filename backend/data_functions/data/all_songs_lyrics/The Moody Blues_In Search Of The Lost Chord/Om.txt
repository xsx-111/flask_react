Om LyricsThe rain is on the roof
Hurry high, butterfly
As clouds roll past my head
I know why the skies all cry
Om. Om. Heaven. Om
The Earth turns slowly round
Far away, the distant sound
Is with us everyday
Can you hear what it says?
Om. Om. Heaven. Om
The rain is on the roof
Hurry high, butterfly
As clouds roll past my head
I know why the skies all cry
Om. Om. Heaven. OmEmbed
