The Actor LyricsThe curtain rises on the scene
With someone shouting to be free
The play unfolds before my eyes
There stands the actor who is me
The sleeping hours takes us far
From traffic, telephones and fear
Put out your problems with the cat
Escape until a bell you hear
Our reasons are the same
But there's no-one we can blame
For there's nowhere we need go
And the only truth we know comes so easily
The sound I have heard in your hello
Oh, oh, darling, you're almost part of me
Oh, oh, darling, you're all I'll ever see
Ah, ah, ah
It's such a rainy afternoon
No point in going anywhere
The sounds just drift across my room
I wish this feeling I could share
It's such a rainy afternoon
She sits and gazes from her window
Her mind tries to recall his face
The feeling deep inside her grows
Our reasons are the same
But there's no-one we can blame
For there's nowhere we need go
And the only truth we know comes so easily
The sound I have heard in your hello
Oh, oh, darling, you're almost part of me
Oh, oh, darling, you're all I'll ever see
The sound I have heard in your hello
Oh, oh, darling, you're all I'll ever see
Oh, oh, darling, you're almost part of me
Ah, ah, ahEmbed
