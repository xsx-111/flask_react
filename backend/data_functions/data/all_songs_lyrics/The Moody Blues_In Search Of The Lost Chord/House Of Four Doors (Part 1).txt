House Of Four Doors (Part 1) LyricsMystery spead its cloak
Across the sky
We'd lost our way
Shadows fell from trees
They knew why
Then through the leaves a light broke through
A path lost for years lead us through
House of four doors
I could live there forever
House of four doors
Would it be there forever?
Loneliness, the face of pilgrims eyes was known
As the door opened wide
Beauty they had found before my eyes to see
To the next door we came
Love of music showed in everything we heard
Through the third door where are we?
Enter in all ye who seek to find within
As the plaque said on the last doorEmbed
