House Of Four Doors (Part 2) LyricsWalking thru that door
Outside we came
Nowhere at all
Perhaps the answers here
Not there anymore
Then in our hearts the light broke thru
A path lost for years is there in view
House of four doors
You'll be lost now forever
House of four doors
Rest of life's life forever
House of four doors
You'll be lost now forever
House of four doors
Rest of life's life foreverEmbed
