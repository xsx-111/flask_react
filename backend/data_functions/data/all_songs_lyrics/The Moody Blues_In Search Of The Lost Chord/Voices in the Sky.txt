Voices in the Sky LyricsBluebird, flying high
Tell me what you sing
If you could talk to me
What news would you bring
Of voices in the sky
Nightingale, hovering high
Harmonize the wind
Darkness, your symphony
I can hear you sing
Of voices in the sky
Just what is happening to me
I lie awake with the sound of the sea
Calling to me
Old man, passing by
Tell me what you sing
Though your voice be faint
I am listening
Voices in the sky
Children with a skipping rope
Tell me what you sing
Play time is nearly gone
The bell's about to ring
Voices in the sky
Just what is happening to me
I lie awake with the sound of the sea
Calling to me
Bluebird, flying high
Tell me what you sing
If you could talk to me
What news would you bring
Of voices in the sky
Voices in the sky
Voices in the sky
Voices in the sky1Embed
