8.6.82 Lyrics
It's august 6th, 1982, and uhh we were jamming over at the house
My pants caught on fire, we were smoking a lot of whiskey and uhh chicken
And uhh got some food and, i got some food and came home and got a call, uhh
No wait, i got some calls then, uhh, came home, then i got some food
Came home, got some food and then  got some calls, uhh
Couldn't find the fridge for a while and wait, first we couldn't
We got the food and then no wait, first we had the fridge1Embed
