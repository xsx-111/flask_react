Satan Gave Me A Taco Lyrics
Satan gave me a taco and it made me really sick
The chicken was all raw and the grease was mighty thick
The rice was all rancid and the beans were so hard
I was getting kinda dizzy eating all the lard
There was aphids on the lettuce and i ate every one
An' after i was done the salsa melted off my tongue
Pieces of tortilla got stuck in my throat
An' the stains on my clothes burned a hole through my coat
My stomach was a-trembling and i broke out in a rash
I was so dry and thirsty and i didn't have no cash
So i went and found a hose, tore off all my clothes
Turned on the water and it shot right up my nose
Some old lady came along and she thought i was a freak
So she beat me with a handbag till i could hardly speak
I was lying there naked, my body badly bruised
In a pool of my own blood, unconscious and confused
Well, the cops came and got me and threw me in their van
And i woke up on the ceiling and i couldn't find my hand
They took me to the judge, his eyes a-glowing red
The courtroom was filled with witches and the dead
Well, the sheriff was a hell-hound with fangs and claws
The prisoners were tied up and chained to the walls
The air was getting thick; the smoke was getting thicker
The judge read the verdict: said, "cut off his head!"
Well, they placed me on the altar, and they raised up the axe
My head was about to explode when i noticed the marshall stacks
I noticed all the smoke machines, cameras and the lights
Some guy with a microphone, running around dancing in tights
And i noticed the crew and the band playing down below
And i realized i was in a rock video
So i went and joined the band and i went out on tour
And i smoked a lot of heroin and i passed out in manure
I made out with the groupies, started fires backstage
I made a lot of money and i gave it all away
Well, the band got killed, so i started a solo career
And i won all the awards and i drank all the beer
I opened up a taco stand just to smell the smell
Cooking with the devil, frying down in hell2Embed
