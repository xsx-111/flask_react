Puttin It Down Lyrics
Big pain burning now
Giving me a cow
What you seem to be saying
Is you're patiently waiting
Like an ashtray for the butt

Well I'm putting it down
When you're not picking it up
When I'm putting it down
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny

Fat chance glued to the wall
Like a centerfold
Of an old cannonball
Will you put me inside
Your TV tonight
Cause you're treating me like a rerun

Well I'm putting it down
But you're not picking it up
Well I'm putting it down
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
No no no no no
So what
I lost my job at the hut
My ass got cut
But I'll be better at kissing
When my teeth are all missing
And the silverware's burnt
And I'm eating with my fingers

And I'm putting it down
And you're not picking it up
Well I'm putting it down
But you treat me like a clown
And I don't want to be funny
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah1Embed
