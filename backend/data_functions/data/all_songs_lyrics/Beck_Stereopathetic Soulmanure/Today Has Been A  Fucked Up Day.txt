Today Has Been A  Fucked Up Day Lyrics
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Looks like tomorrow will be the same old day
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Today has been a fucked up day
Looks like tomorrow will be the same old day
There's people running up and down the line
With grocery bags on their heads
And dollar bills pasted onto their faces
Squeegees in their hand2Embed
