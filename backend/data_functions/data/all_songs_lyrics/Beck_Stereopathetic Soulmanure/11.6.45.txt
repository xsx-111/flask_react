11.6.45 Lyrics
It's uhh november 6th, 1945 and we ... Went up to ...
And uhh, back to the house and watched mtv ... And playing pac-man ...
It's all really gross and all the kids were diseased ...
Giant airplanes, uh, crashing underneath ... electro-magnetic fuse ...
Guys with flamethrowers ... Melting ... Taco trucks were crashed...
There was sausage meat all over the ... Sasquatch was eating a burrito1Embed
