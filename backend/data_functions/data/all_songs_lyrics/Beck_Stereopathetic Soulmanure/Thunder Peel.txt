Thunder Peel Lyrics
It's a cold ass fashion when she stole my passion
It's an everlasting, it's a ghetto blasting
On the wonderwheel, I let my thunder peel
I made an effort to get just what I deserve

I got all maxed out, I got faxed some doubt
I was jumping around, she got another comin' down
In the thick of the thin, I couldn't bother to pick
Her eyes we're naturally blue, remember she's in your soul

Now I'm rolling in sweat
With a cold slick of red
And a nickel in my jeans
On the map if you glide
She's got such heavy thighs
I got taken by surprise
When she shake and move

It's a cold ass fashion when she stole my passion
It's an everlasting, it's a ghetto blasting
On the wonderwheel, I let my thunder peel
I made an effort to get just what I deserve1Embed
