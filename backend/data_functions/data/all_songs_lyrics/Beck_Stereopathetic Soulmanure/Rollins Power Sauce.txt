Rollins Power Sauce Lyrics
Whoa my throat muscles are completely shredded
You tell no-one
Nobody
Beating on you
No defenses
False faces
Bloody wallet
Ripping out your head
Put on my clothes
No, I wouldn't want you
Where the blood is washed off
Where the blood is washed off
Where the blood is washed off
I got no focus
Got no focus1Embed
