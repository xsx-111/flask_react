Total Soul Future (Eat It) Lyrics
She got some soul
Yeah she got some soul
She got some soul
Yeah she got some soul
She got finger snap
She put the lit cigarette
On my birthday cake
Oh, yeah
She rock and roll
She got the soul
She rock and roll
She got the soul
She rock and roll
She got some soul
She rock and roll
She got the soul
Oh yeah bring it on down1Embed
