The Spirit Moves Me Lyrics
Walking back to the burning schoolhouse
And the kids drinking in the park
Late at night and the spirit moves me
And i don't mind being afraid
Old man with no clothes
Leaning on my fence
Tell me where the money goes
And the food don't taste the same
I'm getting fast at being the last
To know i don't need to waste no time
You can call me once a week
Tell me where i been
Phony lady laying flat on the road
And the helicopter going by
And i'm down to the sound
Of the sky turned brown
And i'm loving everything you say
I don't think it's funny
When you shave both of my arms
Lately i been spitting out things
That i didn't mean to say
But that's alright, now
You don't listen to me anyway1Embed
