Modesto Lyrics
You came, you went
My mind it got a dent
I couldn't make my rent
Cos all my cash was lent
This town is filled
With thousand-dollar-bills
Laminated songs
Contaminated lawns
Well we eat about fifteen times a day
Staring through a bag of frito lay
And i play with the fire in the stove
When my eyes peel out and my fingertips get cold
Well it's real and it's fake
And it's flaming like a steak
And she's putting out my face with the rake
Oh honey you knew
That you were my one and only blur
Unglued, depressed
The meatloaf in my chest
Personality test
I failed with the best
And i stomped and i stormed
And i passed out in your dorm
Then you hustled me outside
I couldn't catch a ride
But the subway trains speak to me now
I'm browsing through the supermarket town
And the girls don't talk when i'm around
And i'm feeling bad even though nothing's wrong
Choking on a breathmint
That's cool
Yeah, that's cool1Embed
