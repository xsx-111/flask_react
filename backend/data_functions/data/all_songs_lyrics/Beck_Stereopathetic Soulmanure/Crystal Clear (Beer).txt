Crystal Clear (Beer) Lyrics
Plastic donut, can of spam
There's no kindness in this land

Better not let my good gal catch you here
She's getting all juiced up with a bottle of plain wrap beer

Coffee clothing pasted on
Clean my gravestone when i'm gone

And you better not let my good gal catch you here
She's got a whole pile of things you don't want to hear

Hitch my horse up to the town
I got my toenails painted brown

And you better not let my good gal catch you here
She'll cut you down and put the blame on me

Just a muscle in a bag
Throw my baby, don't let her sag
But you better not let my good gal catch you here
She's getting all juiced up with a bottle of plain wrap beer1Embed
