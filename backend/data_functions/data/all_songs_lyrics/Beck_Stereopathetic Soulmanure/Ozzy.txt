Ozzy Lyrics
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy can I get a little echo on this?
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy
What does it mean?
The fire is green
The demons just scraped through the window
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Drinkin' in bed, they'll get you instead
Gives him a point went forever
Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy! You're the man
How can I grasp your power?
I'm sitting here looking at this key-chain
And you, uh
There's mascara bleeding out of your eyes
The microphone is in flames
There's a giant chicken claw above your head
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
Ozzy, Ozzy
