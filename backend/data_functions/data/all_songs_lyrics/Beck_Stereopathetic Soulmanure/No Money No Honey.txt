No Money No Honey Lyrics
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
Ain't no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
One more time
Keep going
One more time
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
No money, no honey
I want to pass on to you
That I think is
Has meant a lot to me
He said  "Ed, you have no control over the past
It's a canceled check
You have no control over the future
Because you don't know what's going to happen
Your maximum point of power in your life is now!"1Embed
