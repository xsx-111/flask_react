Aphid Manure Heist Lyrics
Amanda, light of the man's life
Make sure the faith in the light and make heard
The greatest woman
The greatest woman
To be the man's greatest wife
I thought it all over, lord knows i've tried
It's a awful great struggle in any man's life
To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the great hair on her shoulders
And the great big big beautiful beautiful eyes
