Cut 1/2 Blues Lyrics
I thought I heard a chainsaw revving late last night
I woke this morning and I knew I was right

I got the cut-in-half blues
The cut-in-half blues
Well the last thing I saw was the big long saw
I got the cut-in-half blues

I knew we were in trouble, I knew she lost her head
When she started bringing all those power tools to bed

I got the cut-in-half blues
The cut-in-half blues
Well the last thing I saw was the big long saw
I got the cut-in-half blues

I'm laying in my grave, all I do is grunt
'Cause the undertaker got all mixed up and put my ass in the front

I got the cut-in-half blues
The cut-in-half blues
Well the last thing I saw was the big long saw
I got the cut-in-half blues1Embed
