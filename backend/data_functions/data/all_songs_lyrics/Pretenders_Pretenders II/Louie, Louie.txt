Louie, Louie Lyrics
Shh, here they come

Now Louie, Louie had his day
Nothin' gonna change it now
The rats and snakes will never fade away
Not while I'm alive
Hey, hey, hey, hey

There come the Cossacks
The Road Spiders
The Supergliders
Burnin' trash, flickin' class
All the white trash, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Now Louie, Louie had his time
Seems like only yesterday
Sadie and Hattie got married and moved away
'Cause they had nothin' left to say, yeah

You with the glasses
I'll see you later
We'll find love, I know
Rockin', reelin', double dealin'
One more time, this time with feelin', yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Go, boys
Yeah

(Ooh, pattycake
I love your daughter
I wanna take now
Ooh, pattycake
I love your daughter
I wanna take)
You move so fine
Yeah, what a scene I said
Mmm, kinda aquiline
Yeah, baby, saw through this now
(Ooh, pattycake
I love your daughter
I wanna take now
Ooh, pattycake
I love your daughter
I wanna take)
You smell so good
Yeah, and your shirt's always pressed
You'll be the best inside, my baby
Yeah, I'm all under arrest now
Louie, Louie made his mark
On this tender heart of mine
The Jamaican moon don't let it get dark
Though we rock out in the night time, yeah

Let's get on outta here now
Let's go1Embed
