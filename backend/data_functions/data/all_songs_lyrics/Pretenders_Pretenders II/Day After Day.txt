Day After Day LyricsWay up in the sky
Over the city, over Tokyo
Silver light, summer moon
You'll be over somebody's winter this afternoon
While the dolphins swim in the sea
You're going grey, my baby
Still the war is waging endlessly
Day after day, day after day
Way up in the sky
Over the city and Lake Erie
You remember the flats, you were there
Out every night, Mr. Moonlight
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Just like yesterday
Way up in the sky
Over the city where you sleep tonight
The light outside your window blinks
Hotel, hotel, hotel
Open the blind and dream in a moonbeam
When the war's finally over, we'll meet again
And pick up where we left offEmbed
