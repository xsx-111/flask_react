Jealous Dogs Lyrics
Those jealous dogs
Always on the alert
Territorial rights
They'll take your back and leave your shirt
Like that jealous bitch
Always wanting more
The courts have made her rich
And the click of high heels down the corridor
Jealous (Jealous, jealous), dogs

Those jealous dogs
Detectives, every one
Don't be a sucker all your life
She's gonna have you hung
Evidence, evidence, evidence
Suspicion invites treachery
Oh, you really got taken
Bringing home the bacon
Jealous (Jealous, jealous), dogs

Bow-wow-wow, here come the dogs
Grr, here come the dogs
Don't lay down, here come the dogs
Stand straight, don't slouch
Get down off the couch
You're not allowed on the couch
Get down off the couch

Those jealous dogs
They get worse and worse
Every time you turn around
They're sniffin' at your purse
Who do they think we are?
What do they think we do?
It's hard to get in the mood
When you're treated like some kind of dog food
Jealous (Jealous, jealous), dogs

Bow-wow-wow, here come the dogs
Oh, ruff ruff, here come the dogs
Get down, here come the dogs
Mind your leg, roll over and beg

Happy birthday, darling
Empty heart
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
