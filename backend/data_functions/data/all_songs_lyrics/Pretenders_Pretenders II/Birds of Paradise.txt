Birds of Paradise Lyrics
I wrote a letter to you, my friend
So many letters that I never send
I think about you at the day's end
The time that we had
I laughed in my bed
The stupid things you said
We were two birds of paradise

When I was a little girl
With clay horses and lambs on the shelf
I caught frogs in ditches, listened for elves
My friends and I had a world unto ourselves
No grownups could find us when we
Made our plans so secretly
To run away ever to be
With the birds of paradise

Once upon a time, my mind still there wanders
Back in your room, the things I remember
One time, when we took off our clothes
But you were cryin', cryin'
You said nothing lasts forever
We were happy together
I thought about you in Stockholm and Rome
Me in my hotel room, you in your home
This is the life they say that dreams are made of
But don't forget and please do forgive me
I still have that something you did give me
I meant to write, but dreams will outlive me
And dream
And please don't forget, do forgive me
I still have that something you did give me
I meant to write, but dreams will outlive me
And dream
Of
And dream
Of paradiseEmbed
