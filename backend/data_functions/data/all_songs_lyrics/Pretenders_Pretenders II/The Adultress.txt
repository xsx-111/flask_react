The Adultress Lyrics
I'm the adulteress, but I didn't want to be
But I'm convenient and I make good tea
I stand accused of the worst crime in history
That's my mystery, I'm the adulteress

I go to the park with a bag of crumbs for the birds
That's where we meet without words
He takes my hand and stares into the wood
There's nothing to understand, it's understood
I'm the adulteress

Look at the fool
Made up to go out
She's desperate and lonely
But she's puttin' it about
(Look at the spinster) Look at the spinster
Comin' down off the shelf
(She's in love) She's in love
And she hates herself

Don't try to stop me, don't get in my way
It's too late, I've made my play
Does misery love company?
I'll be in the bar, you'll find meEmbed
