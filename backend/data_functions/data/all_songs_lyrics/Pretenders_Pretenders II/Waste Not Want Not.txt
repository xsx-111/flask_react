Waste Not Want Not Lyrics
Take, take, take, takin' what you don't need
You're get, get, gettin' what you don't need
Stand back, take a look and take heed
All the children in God's kingdom bleed
See the networks of concrete and steel
They've no mystery, but what they reveal
Tells a story of a future that's void
Of the beauty and the majesty that life on Earth is meant to be

Talk, talk, talk, talk about the government
Not a word about political favour
Everything touched is my political choice
The life you take is your political voice
The sacred cow's come crashing to her knees
The golden harvest reaped without intelligence
There's no chance between the heavens and the seas
In a bloodbath, don't laugh, grab your piece of golden calf

Waste not, want not, pick it up
Waste not, want not, pick it up
Waste not, want not, pick it up
Waste not, want not
Do unto others as you wish be done to you
There's a million lies 'round everything true
You slaughter when you feast, you disrespect the beast
Make our beds and lie there, take your share

Waste not, want not, pick it up
Waste not, want not, pick it up
Waste not, want not, pick it up
Pick it up and eat it

Waste not, want notEmbed
