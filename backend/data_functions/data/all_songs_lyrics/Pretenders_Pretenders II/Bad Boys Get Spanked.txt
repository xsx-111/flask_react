Bad Boys Get Spanked Lyrics
You're not supposed to do that
You know you're not allowed to
But you seem to get some kind of kick
Out of doing what you're not allowed to
You deliberately defy the rules
'Cause the law's upheld by fools

Shit on that
Bad boys get spanked

You can look, but don't touch
But no, you can't resist
Don't you ever think about the consequence?
Guys like you never do
That's the kind of stuff that whores are made out of
That's the kind of stuff that floors are made out of

You know
Bad boys get spanked
Bad boys get spanked

You don't listen, do you, asshole?
Don't be a punk all your life
Someone's gonna sort you out
They'll try to make a man out of you
Now say, "Yes, sir," say, "No, sir"
Say, "Yes, ma'am," say, "No, ma'am"
Shit on that
Bad boys get spanked
Bad boys get spanked

Get spanked
Get spanked
Ooh
Come here, get spanked
Bad boys get spanked
Come here
Get spankedEmbed
