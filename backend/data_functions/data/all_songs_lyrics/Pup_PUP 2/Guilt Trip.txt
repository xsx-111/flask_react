Guilt Trip Lyrics
How many times have you lied to my face?
I can't confront you, and it's better that way
And how many bulbs must I break?
'Til all my filaments rust and decay
And I can't explain anything anymore anyway

Now that you're gone, I'm back on my own
Giving it all up to leave you alone
And if I had my choice, I would come back soon
I never wanted to

And how many times have I lied to you?
If I was drunk when I said it, it might have been true

I know now that you're gone, I'll be back on my own
Giving it all up to leave you alone
And if I had my choice, I would die by your love
I know it wasn't enough
One, two, three, four, five, six!

Why would you speak if you don't know?
Got a little bit of my self-righteous attitude
Whoa oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh


Now that you're gone, I'll be back on my own
Felt her up, fucked her up, left her alone
If I had it all in the palm of my hand
(Ah ah-ah ah-ah-ah)
Don't even ask, 'cause you won't understand3Embed
