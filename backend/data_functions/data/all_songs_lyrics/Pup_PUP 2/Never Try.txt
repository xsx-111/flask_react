Never Try Lyrics
Every mornin', I keep sleepin'
'Cause in the nighttime, I'm dreamin' of
My childhood schoolyard, I was breathin'
Air on the street where I grew up
You tell me I should know better
You're probably right, it's just a phase
I'll come back ten years from now
And nothin' will have changed

'Cause I know I never try
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I wanna know if I leave here alive
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Am I too old
To be campin' out on my back porch?
In the suburbs where I was born
You never made me happy

And I know I never try
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I wanna know if I leave here alive
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And even when I try, I can't recall
Faces of, anyone at all
And I dreamt of you in Montreal
In places I've never been at all
This isn't what I was hopin' for
I barely ever dream about you anymore
When everything you want has come and gone

Then you'll know I never try
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I wanna know if I leave here alive
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohEmbed
