Blush Response Lyrics
Do you like our owl?

Is it artificial?

Of course it is

Must be expensive

Very. I'm Rachael

Deckard

It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public

Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem

May I ask you a personal question?
Sure

Have you ever retired a human by mistake?

No

But in your position that is a risk

Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response, fluctuation of the pupil, involuntary dilation of the iris

We call it Voight-Kampff for short

Mr. Deckard, Dr. Elden Tyrell

Demonstrate it, I want to see it work

Where's the subject?
I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative before I provide you with a positive

What's that gonna prove?

Indulge me

On you?
