One More Kiss, Dear Lyrics
One more kiss, dear
One more sigh
Only this, dear, is goodbye
For our love is such pain and such pleasure
That I'll treasure till I die

So, for now, dear
Au revoir, ma belle
But, I vow, dear, not farewell
For in time, we may have all love's glory
Our love story to tell

Just as every autumn leaves fall from the trees
Tumble to the ground and die
So in the springtime, like sweet memories
They will return, as will I

Like the sun dear, up on high
We'll return dear to the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow, goodbye
One more kiss, dear
One more sigh
Only this, dear, is goodbye
For our love is such passion, such pleasure
I will treasure until I die

Like the sun, dear, up on high
We'll return, dear, to the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow, goodbye1Embed
