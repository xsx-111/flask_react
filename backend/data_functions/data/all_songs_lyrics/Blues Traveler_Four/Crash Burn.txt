Crash Burn LyricsI'm gonna ride you
Gonna ride you out like a witch on a broom
I'm gonna ride you
Gonna ride you out like a witch on a broom
It's the old give and take
And I've been took again
So give me room
I'm gonna watch you
Gonna watch you fall like a tower of cards
Gonna watch you
Gonna watch you fall like a tower of cards
Gonna land, gonna land, gonna land, gonna land
No matter how hard
Crash burn
When will I learn?
Crash burn
When will I learn?
Crash burn
When will I learn?
Crash burn
When will I learn?Embed
