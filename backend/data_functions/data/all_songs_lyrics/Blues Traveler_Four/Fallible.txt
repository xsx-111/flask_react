Fallible LyricsWith an air of indignation
Smiles a painted porcelain face
And we're supposed to trust this
Decorum has its place
But you and I beyond that
With a question I might ask
How suddenly the smile doth crack
When we slip beneath the mask
And they're fallible
Yeah, they're fallible
And we hold up a mirror
And we hate what we see
And we keep on trekking westward
Infallibly
God, I wanna touch you
In the place you wanna hide
Dare you to come after me
Commit my narcisside
Punishing the guilty
Was never the intent
I just busted out of prison, baby
That's really where I went
And I'm fallible
Yeah, I'm fallible
And we hold up a mirror
And we hate what we see
And we keep on trekking westward
Infallibly
In the name of all the power
That's centered in your hand
If you crave some revolution
Take possession of your stand
It's the only one you'll get to make
In a moment come and gone
So do your best to stay awake
And own the path you're on
Cause you're fallible
Yeah you're fallible
And we hold up a mirror
And we hate what we see
And we keep on trekking westward
Infallibly
