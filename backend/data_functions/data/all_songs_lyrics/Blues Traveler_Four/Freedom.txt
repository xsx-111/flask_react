Freedom LyricsI walk right by him and he's freezing his ass off
He could be dead, I'm supposed to walk away
I won't remember a thing come the summertime
Handful of quarters make me feel okay
Ah, ah, who's gonna have to pay?
Ah, ah, who do I love today?
I love what's mine ‘cause what's mine is all mine
Gives me a reason to go get more
Don't really care where I go to get it
I ain't too clear about "What's yours is yours"
You take it for granted
I guess that's what it's for
But before you demand it
Take a look out your back door
If you don't like a single thing that I'm saying
If you're offended when I demonstrate
Don't mean a damn to me and I shall continue
Hope you won't mind if I control my fate
Ah, ah, who do I have to fight?
Ah, ah, to defend my created right
I'll defend what's mine ‘cause what's mine is all mine
It's what I'd fight for, it's for what I'd bleed
I roll the dice on the grand experiment
While I am strong I will get what I need
You take it for granted
I guess that's what it's for
But before you demand it
Take a look out your back door
If you're concerned with the moral imperative
If you are tripping on the right thing to do
Come to my office with the exclusive screenplay
I think there's money in a book about you
Ah, ah, what have you got to lose?
Ah, ah, which are you gonna choose?
I choose what's mine so what's mine will be all mine
Gonna make a million on the folly of men
Don't even care about no consequences
Turn my damnation into chapter ten
You take it for granted
I guess that's what it's for
But before you demand it
Take a look out your back door
Oh
Oh yeahEmbed
