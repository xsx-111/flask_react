Stand LyricsStand
Stand and walk
Tragedy
Is cheap and so is talk
Decision
Yours to make, what will you do?
In the end
It comes back to you
‘Cause it's a long way to fall
Thunder
Don't scare me at all
Lightning
Well just a little
Pressure
It ain't worth a dime
And your wounds
They'll all heal in time
‘Cause it's a long way to fall
The answers are getting harder
The answers are getting harder
The answers are getting harder
(If an answer comes to those who pray)
The answers are getting harder
(If an answer comes to those who pray)
The answers are getting harder
(If an answer comes to those who pray)
The answers are getting harder and harder
And there ain't no way to bargain or to barter
But if you've got the angst we got the ardor
You might faint from the fight but you're gonna find it
For every challenge could have paradise behind it
And if you accept what you have lost and you stand tall
You might just get it back and you can get it all
So now you know why it's a long way to fall
Yeah, ‘cause it's a long way to fall
It's a long way to fall
(But badiddela da de doo badidela da nn deddle da nn do etc.)
Stand
Stand and wallk
