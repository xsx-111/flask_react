Brother John LyricsAre you sleeping, Brother John?
If you feel like weeping, Brother John
Please won't you hear me, Brother John?
Just wait and see, Brother John
Can't you see by the will of your hand?
You can give it a try and just name your price
And everybody in this rock & roll band
Don't wanna preach, don't wanna give advice
But the music's playing and all we're saying
Is come along and jam
And it's hard to be believed what can be achieved
With an outstretched hand
Are you sleeping, Brother John?
If you feel like weeping, Brother John
Please won't you hear me, Brother John?
Just wait and see, Brother John
Are you sleeping, Brother John?
If you feel like weeping, Brother John
Please won't you hear me, Brother John?
Just wait and see, Brother John
The things that hurt just won't go away
But neither will we
Doesn't really matter either way 'cause you're all you need
To set yourself free
It may sound hard but it's just a start
To ride that wind
And you ain't Peter Pan, you're just a man
You'll get there again
Are you sleeping, Brother John?
If you feel like weeping, Brother John
Please won't you hear me, Brother John?
Just wait and see, Brother John
I said, are you sleeping, Brother John?
If you feel like weeping, Brother John
Please won't you hear me, Brother John?
Just wait and see, Brother John
Just wait and see
Just wait and see
Just wait and see
Just wait and see
Won't you rise and shine?
Won't you rise and shine?
Won't you rise and shine?
Won't you rise and shine?
Won't you rise and shine?
Won't you rise and shine?
Won't you rise and shine?
Won't you wait and see?Embed
