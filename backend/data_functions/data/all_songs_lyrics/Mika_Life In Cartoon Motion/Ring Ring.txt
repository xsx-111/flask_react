Ring Ring Lyrics
I was sitting on the fence
And I thought that I would kiss you
I never thought I would've missed you
But you never let me fall, push my back against the wall
Every time you call, you get so emotional
I'm freaking out!

Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever
But you never say nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy
When you play me like a kid with a crown

You got a dangerous obsession
Now I'm in need of some protection
That was never my intention
Used to love me, now you hate me; say I drove you crazy
Well, if I did, you made me; won't somebody save me
From you now?

Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever
But you never say nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy
When you play me like a kid with a crown

It's words
I wanted
Until you
Blasted
Why won't you
Leave me alone?
Hang up the phone
Just let me go

Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever
But you never say nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy
When you play me like a kid with a crown

Ring, ring
Is that you on the phone?
You think you're clever
But you're never saying nothing at all
Hey, hey
The way you spin me around
You make me dizzy
When you play me like a kid with a crown

Ring, ring
Ring, ring
Ring, ring...Embed
