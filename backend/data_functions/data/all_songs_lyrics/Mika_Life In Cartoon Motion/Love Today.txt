Love Today LyricsI’ve been crying for so long
Fighting tears just to carry on
But now, but now it’s gone away
Hey girl why can’t you carry on
Is it cuz your just like your mother
A little tight, like to tease for fun
Well you ain’t gonna tease no other
Gonna make you a lover!
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me
Girl in the blue with the big bust on
Wait till your mamma and your papa’s gone
Papa’s gone!
Mamma, mamma, papa
Shock, shock me
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me
Carolina sits on ‘95
Give her a dollar and she’ll make you smile
Hook her, book her, nook her
Walk away!
Girl dresses like a kid for fun
Licks her lips like they’re something other
Tries to tell you life has just begun
Now you know she’s getting something other
Than the love from her mother!
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me
Girl in the blue with the big bust on
Wait till your mamma and your papa’s gone
Papa’s gone!
Mamma, mamma, papa
Shock, shock me
Everybody’s gonna love today!
Anyway you want to
Anyway you’ve got to
Love, love me8Embed
