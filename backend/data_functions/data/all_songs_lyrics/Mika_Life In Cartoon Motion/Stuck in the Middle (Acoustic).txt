Stuck in the Middle (Acoustic) Lyrics
Hmm, da-da!

I sit and think about the day that you're gonna die
Your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
Care to see my reason?
Care to put your life in mine?
Looking at life from the perspective of a boy
Who's learned to love you, but has also learned to grow
Could we make it better, stormy weather?
So I don't know

Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?
Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me, just to love me
Stuck in the middle

I look at you, you look at me, we bite each other
And, with your bitter words, you kick me in the gutter
But my troops are bigger than yours
You'll never stop my fight
Ours is a family that's based upon tradition
But, with my careless words, I tread upon your vision
Are five kids better than one?
Who doesn't like to be gone?

Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?
Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me, just to love me
Stuck in the middle

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah...
This is just who I am
This ain't a greater plan
To break your heart
Of me
I know that what I've started
Means that when we have parted
I can live
In honesty

Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home?
Who will believe me, won't deceive me
Won't try to change me?
Oh, oh, oh
Is there anybody home?
Who wants to have me, just to love me
Stuck in the middle

Stuck in the middle
Stuck in the middle
