Over My Shoulder LyricsOver my shoulder, running away
Feels like I'm falling, losing my day
Cold and dry
Cold and dry
Fog out my daylight, torture my night
Feels like I'm falling far out of sight
Cold, drunk
Tired, lost
Over my shoulder, running away
Feels like Im falling, losing my way
Cold, dry
Cold and dry
Fog out my daylight, torture my night
Feels like I'm falling far out of sight
Cold, drunk
