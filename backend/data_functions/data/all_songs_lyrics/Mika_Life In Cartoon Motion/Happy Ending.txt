Happy Ending LyricsThis is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like its forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Wake up in the morning
Stumble out my eyes
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen
I guess I'd wish you well
A little bit of heaven
But a little bit of hell
This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, no love, no glory
Happy endings, gone forever more
I feel as If I'm wasted
And I'm wasting every day
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like its forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together
Two o'clock in the morning
Something’s on my mind
Can't get no rest
Keep walking around
If I pretend that nothing ever went wrong
I could get to my sleep
I could think that we just carried on
This is the hardest story
That I have ever told
No hope, no love, no glory
Happy endings, gone forever more
I feel as If I'm wasted
I'm wasting every day
This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending…9Embed
