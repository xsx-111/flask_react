Relax, Take It Easy LyricsTook a ride
To the end of the line
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train
With nobody I know
But the pain
And the longing’s the same when you’re dying
Now I’m lost
And I’m screaming for help on my own
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if I’m terrified
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if we’re playing with fire
Oh, there is an answer to the darkest times
It’s clear, we don’t understand it
But the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you
I believe that we’re in this together
Don’t scream
There are so many roads left to run
Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if I’m terrified
It’s as if I’m scared
It’s as if we’re playing with fire8Embed
