Billy Brown (acoustic) LyricsOh, Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Two kids, a dog, and then the cautionary wife
But while it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another man
He met his lover almost every single day
Making excuses for his dodgy holiday
On some religion that he said he newly found
They didn't know that his faith was earthly bound
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Don't let the stars get you down
Don't let the waves let you drown
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh, Billy Brown
Oh, Billy Brown needed a place, somewhere to go
He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind
Oh, Billy Brown needed to find some peace of mind
And on his journey and his travels on the way
He met a girlie who was brave enough to say
When they made love he shared the burden of his mind
Oh, Billy Brown you are a victim of the times
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Don't let the stars get you down
Don't let the waves let you drown
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh, Billy Brown
Brown, oh, Billy Brown
Gonna pick you up like a paper cup
Gonna shake the water out of every nook
Oh, Billy Brown
Oh, Billy Brown had lived an ordinary life
Two kids, a dog, and then the cautionary wife
While it was all going accordingly to plan
Then Billy Brown fell in love with another manEmbed
