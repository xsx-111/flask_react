Big Girl (You Are Beautiful) Lyrics
Big girl, you are beautiful...

Walks into the room, feels like a big balloon
I said, "Hey girls, you are beautiful"
"Diet coke and a pizza please." Diet coke! I'm on my knees
Screaming, "Big girl, you are beautiful!"

You take your skinny girls, I feel like I'm gonna die
'Cause a real woman needs a real man, here's why:
You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you 'baby'
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Walks into the room, feels like a big balloon
I said, "Hey girls, you are beautiful"
"Diet coke and a pizza please." Diet coke! I'm on my knees
Screaming, "Big girl, you are beautiful!"

You take your girl and multiply her by four
Now a whole lotta woman needs a whole lot more

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you 'baby'
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you 'baby'
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places
Big girls, you are beautiful!
Big girls, you are beautiful!
Big girls, you are beautiful!
Big girls, you are beautiful!
Oh, you are beautiful!

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you 'baby'
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places

Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!
Ah-ah! Big girls, you are beautiful!

Get yourself to the Butterfly Lounge, find yourself a big lady
Big boy, come on round, and they’ll be calling you 'baby'
No need to fantasize since I was in my braces
Of a watering hole where the girls are round and curves in all the right places
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful!
Big girl, you are beautiful...5Embed
