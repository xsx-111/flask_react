My Interpretation Lyrics
You talk about life, you talk about death
And everything in between
Like it's nothing
And the words are easy
You talk about me and talk about you
And everything I do
Like it's something
That needs repeating

I don't need an alibi
Or for you to realize
The things we left unsaid
Are only taking space up in our heads
Make it my fault, win the game
Point the finger, place the blame
It does me up and down
It doesn't matter now

'Cause I don't care if I
Ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to
Care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

The first two weeks turn into ten
I hold my breath and wonder when
It'll happen
Does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do
Could be different
Would it make it better?

If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down
I can see that now

'Cause I don't care if I
Ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to
Care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

It's really not
Such a sacrifice...

If I
Ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to
Care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't, don't make sense

And it don't have to make no
Sense to you at all
'Cause this is my interpretation
Yeah, yeah, yeah2Embed
