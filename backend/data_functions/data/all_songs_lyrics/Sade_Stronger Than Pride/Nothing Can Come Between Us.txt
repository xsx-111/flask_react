Nothing Can Come Between Us Lyrics
Always hope that you remember
We'll never really learn the meaning of it all
What we have is strong and tender
So hold on
In the middle of the madness
When the time is running out and you're left alone
All I want is you to know that
It's strong still, can't pull us apart

Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
(Nothing can pull us apart)
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

I always hope that you remember
What we have is strong and tender
In the middle of the madness
Hold on
So it truly is a good thing
And I always wanted you to know
There is always this
And this is everlasting
Hold on
It's about faith
It's about trust (Yeah, yeah)
It's about faith
It's about trust

Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
(Can't come) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Can't tear) Nothing can come between us
(Can't pull) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Us apart) Nothing can come between us
(Can't come) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Can't tear) Nothing can come between us
(Can't pull) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Us apart) Nothing can come between us
(Can't come) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Can't tear) Nothing can come between us
(Can't pull) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Us apart) Nothing can come between us1Embed
