Haunt Me LyricsINTRO: (Instrumental: Matthewman)
:
Haunt me in my dreams
If you please
Your breath is with me now
And always
It's like a breeze

So, should you ever doubt me
If it's help that you need
Never dare to doubt me

:
And if you want to sleep
I'll be quiet
Like an angel (like an angel)
As quiet as your soul could be
If you only knew
You had a friend like me...

So, should you ever doubt me
If it's help that you need
Never dare to doubt me
