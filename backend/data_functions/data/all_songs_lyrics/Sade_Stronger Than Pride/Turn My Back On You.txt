Turn My Back On You Lyrics
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

No (Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know I'll never let you down
(Ah, ha) No way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

Try to tell you that it's all right
Oooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I am saying?
You are my religion

To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
No (Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know I'll never let you down
(Ah, ha) No way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

Try to tell you that it's all right
Oooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying?
You are my religion

To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?1Embed
