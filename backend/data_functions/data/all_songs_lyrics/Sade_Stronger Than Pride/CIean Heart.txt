CIean Heart Lyrics
Clean heart
Clean and sharp
Clean dream
Bad start

He loved his brother and his sister
Luke and Tony called him mister
They made him feel much more
Like a man
He loved his daddy though he never told him
And how he loved his mama
He loved, he loved, loved, loved her like an Italian

Little Janet said you look so fine
So fine
But something in his smile
Made them feel like strangers
And then he straightened his belt
With a lover's touch
And he said I'm gonna bring home
The things that are out of your clutch

Seemed like the hottest night in summer
A heat that makes you feel like dying
Somewhere in the next block
There was a baby crying
Finger on the trigger for the years to come
Finger on the trigger for the years to come
And as the moon slid up over the restless streets
Sirens mocking, people stop to see
Ooh, their greedy eyes don't realize
He's someone's son
Finger on the trigger for the years to come
Finger on the trigger for the years to comeEmbed
