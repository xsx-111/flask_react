Paradise Lyrics
I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise
I'd give you the world if it was mine
Feels fine
Feels like
You're mine
I'm yours
So fine
Like paradise

I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine
Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise

Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
(Ooh, what a life)
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
(Like paradise)
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with youEmbed
