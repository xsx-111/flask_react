The Globalist Lyrics
You were never truly loved
You have only been betrayed
You were never truly nurtured
By churches of the state
You were left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands
But you can rise up like a god
Arm yourself
You can be strong
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire
Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy
Now you finally have the code
I have given you the code
Oh oh oh
(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, Fire!)

There’s no country left
To love and cherish
It’s gone, it’s gone for good
It’s you and me babe
Survivors
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were
There’s no countries left
To fight and conquer
I think I destroyed them all
It’s human nature
The greatest hunter
Will survive alone
With no one left to love
Ah ah ah ah...
There’s no culture left
To love and cherish
It’s gone, you know it’s gone for good
A trillion memories
Lost in space and time forevermore
I just wanted
I just needed to be loved22Embed
