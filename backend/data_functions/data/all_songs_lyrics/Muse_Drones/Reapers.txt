Reapers Lyrics
Home, it's becoming a killing field
There's a crosshair locked on my heart
With no recourse and there's no one behind the wheel
Hellfire, you're wiping me out, killed by

Drones (killed by)
Drones (killed by)

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
Cause you've got the CIA, babe
(you can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
But all you've done is brutalise
(you can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Drones!

War, war just moved up a gear
I don't think I can handle the truth
I’m just a pawn
And we’re all expendable
Incidentally
Electronically erased
By your
Drones (killed by)
Drones (killed by)

You kill by remote control
And the world is on your side
You’ve got reapers and hawks babe
(you can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Now I am radicalized
(you can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Drones!

(killed by)


You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
You've got the CIA, babe
But all you've done is brutalise
You kill by remote control
(you can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
And the world is on your side
You’ve got reapers and hawks babe
(you can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Now I am radicalized
(you can run but you're never gonna hide, you can run but you're never gonna gonna gonna)
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!32Embed
