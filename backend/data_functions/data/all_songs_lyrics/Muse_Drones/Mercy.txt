Mercy Lyrics
Help me, I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game, I tried to infiltrate but now I'm losing
Men in cloaks always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows before they eat my soul
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under, hypnotized by another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows the world just disavows
Mercy
Mercy
Show me mercy, from the powers that be
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?
Show me mercy
Show me mercy, please
Help me, I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks trying to devour my soul
Show me mercy from the powers that be
Show me mercy from the gutless and mean
Show me mercy from the killing machines
Show me mercy, can someone rescue me?44Embed
