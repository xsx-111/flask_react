Higher Ground LyricsI feel the wind blow on the corner
And I'm looking down along this dead end street
All the people are getting older
But they don't give a damn their lives are incomplete
It don't look no better than it did before
And I know what's happening behind each door
If I don't get out today, I'm gonna waste my life away
And that's a part that I can't play
I don't wanna spend my whole life in this town, I can feel it driving me away
Baby you and me were meant for higher ground, we've got to steal away
As a young boy I didn't fit in
And I knew it then I wouldn't be the same
But that was only in the beginning
And as the time rolled on deeper grew the pain
So give me one good reason why I should stay
I think I've got enough money for the late night train
There's a world you've never seen, but I've been there in my dreams
It's calling out to me
I don't wanna spend my whole life in this town, I can feel it driving me away
Baby you and me were meant for higher ground, we've got to steal away
(Solo)
If I don't get out today, I'm gonna waste my life away
I'm gonna waste my life away, and that's a part that I can't play
I don't wanna spend my whole life in this town, I can feel it driving me away
Baby you and me were meant for higher ground, we've got to steal away
I don't wanna spend my whole life in this town, I can feel it driving me away
Baby you and me were meant for higher ground, we've got to steal away
You and me baby, we've got to steal away, turn it on, turn it onEmbed
