Fired Up LyricsWell her dress was tall and dirty
A backstreet beauty queen
She was standing at 11th and 46th
Like a second hand sex machine
She got me fired up
Then she tried to make a deal with me
I was really fired up
Then she told me how good it would be
Oh!
In a basement bar in broadway
You can watch the well played scene
All the lonely hearts, sitting at the bar
In a five dollar fantasy
Let me get it fired up
See her messing on the stage at seventeen
Ooh you know what I mean
Then we get it fired up
It's the kind of night out that you don't see where you've been
Mm you wanna get fired up
Gotta gotta get fired up
You know you can't get enough!
You wanna do it like you're in a dirty movie
You play the game but you never ask her name
Waaaaaaaawh!
Walking the streets in the dead of night
You can try, you can buy right on the reel
They got love for sale
Been going on since time began
A pretty lady waiting for a lonely man
And she can go on and get him fired up
Well her dress was tall and dirty
A backstreet beauty queen
She was standing at 11th and 46th
Like a second hand sex machine
She got me fired up
Then she tried to make a deal with me
Ooh you know she tried to take me
I was really fired up
Oh then she told me how good it would be
Woah-oh!
 Mm you wanna get fired up
Gotta gotta gotta get fired up
Mmm-mm-mm-mmm
You know you can't get enoughEmbed
