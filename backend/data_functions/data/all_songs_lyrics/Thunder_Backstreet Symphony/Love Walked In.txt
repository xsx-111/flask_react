Love Walked In LyricsSo tired of waiting I walked an empty land
I was looking for something to help me understand
But bad luck kept turning
My dreams into sand
I didn't want pity
I had my share of friends
I wanted somebody
More special than the rest
I was aching inside
Like I was approaching the end
Just about that moment
The timing was so right
You appeared like a vision
Sent down to my life
I thought I was dreaming
When I saw you that night
That's when love walked in through my door
That familiar feeling I had once before
Love walked in through my door
And it felt so strange
It's hard to remember being on my own
That kind of loving makes a hard man lose control
But I sleep so much better
Now I'm not alone
So promise me baby
You're always gonna stay
I don't think I could take it
Seeing you walk away
You don't need to doubt it
I remember that day
That's when love walked in through my door
I found just what I wanted
But I got so much more
Love walked in through my door
And it felt so strange
Like a long lost friend that hadn't changed
Giving me hope again
Love walked in
Love walked in
Love
Just about that moment
The timing was so right
You appeared like a vision
Sent down to my life
I thought I was dreaming
When I saw you that night
That's when love walked in through my door
That familiar feeling I had once before
Love walked in through my door
Love walked in through my door
That familiar feeling I had it once before
Love walked in through my door
And it felt so strange
Like a long lost friend that hadn't changed
Giving me hope again
Love walked in
Love walked in
Love
Love walked in
Love walked inEmbed
