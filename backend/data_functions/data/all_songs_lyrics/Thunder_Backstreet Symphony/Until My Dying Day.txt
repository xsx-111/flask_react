Until My Dying Day LyricsI can see the fading sun
Sinking at the edge of town
And it's one more day that's gone
I'm thinking 'bout the past
And the time that slipped away
But I can't change what I've done
Chasing after foolish dreams
I should've let go but I just can't seem to stop
I don't deserve your loving baby
I don't know why you stay
There's a child within the man
And it's keeping me keeping on
Yet you always understand
The future can't be planned
But I'm gonna keep fighting on
While I've still got two strong hands
Maybe I'll change someday
Maybe I'll chase those dreams away
I need you by my side now baby
'cos you're the price that I won't pay
Girl you're the only one to light a fire inside me
You're the only woman that can make me feel this way
I want to stay with you forever
I'll never let you go
Until my dying day
(Solo)
Chasing after foolish dreams
I should've let go but I just can't seem to stop
I don't deserve your loving baby
And I don't know why you stay
Hey baby you're the only one to light a fire inside me
You're the only woman that can make me feel this way
I want to stay with you forever
I'll never let you go
Until my dying day
Until my dying day
I don't deserve your loving baby
I don't know why you stay
I need you by my side now baby
'cos you're the price that I won't pay
I don't deserve your loving baby
I don't know why you stay
I need you by my side now baby
I don't know, I don't knowEmbed
