Distant Thunder LyricsEvery morning I wake up, and I switch the TV on
I like to watch the world go by from the safety of my home
News is looking bad today, like it always seems to be
I can't believe I'm so unmoved by the violence that I see
It's a fact of life, but I can't cry anymore
'cos it happens all the time
I hear the sound of distant thunder, it's coming closer every day
Soon there'll be lightning crashing to the ground
Feels like the end's not far away
As we race towards the future, we're not learning from the past
In the minefields of excess, you can hear the devil laugh
He can see what's going on, 'cos he knows the signs so well
It won't be long before we meet, on the road that leads to hell
In the wink of an eye, a hundred years will pass
So there's no time left to lie
I hear the sound of distant thunder, it's coming closer every day
Soon there'll be lightning crashing to the ground
Feels like the end's not far away
(Solo)
In the wink of an eye, a hundred years will pass
So there's no time left to lie
I hear the sound of distant thunder, it's coming closer every day
Soon there'll be lightning crashing to the ground
Feels like the end's not far away
It feels like the end's not far away
I can hear the sound of distant thunder, it's coming closer every day
I can feel it, can you feel it
I can hear the sound, the sound of distant thunder
I can feel it, can you feel it
I can feel it, I can feel that thunder crashing downEmbed
