Dirty Love LyricsI see you walking by, you've got that faraway look in your eye
It was only yesterday, like a cheap suit you were all over me
I should know better by now my friend, just what I mean to you
You've been running in and out of my life so long
I don't want nothing to do with you
I don't need your dirty love, I don't want you touching me
I don't want your dirty love, it's enough, trying to live with the memory
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
Chew me up, spit me out, you turned my whole world inside out
There's a name for girls like you
You belong in the gutter, I know that you do
Baby I've had enough lies to last the rest of my days on earth
So now you're gonna get what you deserve
I don't need your dirty love, I don't want you touching me
I don't want your dirty love, it's enough
I know there ain't no way I'll stay, we were gonna break it up some day
And that day is now, baby I'm getting out
So don't you cry now, sigh now
'Cos you've been living a lie now when I'm not around
(Solo)
You've been running in and out of my life so long
There ain't no way I'll stay, no way
I don't need your dirty love, I don't want you touching me
I don't want your dirty love, it's enough, trying to live with the memory
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na, I don't need your dirty love
So get out, I've packed your bags, I left 'em at the door
So get 'em out, start walkin'...Embed
