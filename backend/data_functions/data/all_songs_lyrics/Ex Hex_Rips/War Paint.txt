War Paint Lyrics
I can see that you’re different than me
There are a lot of reasons to disagree

I can tell things are changing every day
But there’s still one thing that never goes away:
You think you’re too cool
Yeah, you think you’re too cool

So put your war paint on and dance alone in the crowd
And soon, you will discover the music was just too loud

Your friends are cruel, street smart and rough
You’d tell them everything, but you’re just too tough
And no one’s good enough, uh-uh
No one’s good enough

Don’t lose your head about it, perception is a fool
Or else your mind might turn inside out on you
Good times are almost here, I can hear the sound
I got no time for cool kids 'cause we gotta roll on and on
Too-too-too-too too cool
Too-too-too-too too cool
(I know you think you're)
Too-too-too-too too cool
(I know you think you're)
Too-too-too-too too coolEmbed
