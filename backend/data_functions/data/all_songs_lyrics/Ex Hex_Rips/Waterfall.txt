Waterfall Lyrics
Surely there was no one to guide us
You know what I mean?
So we’re gonna ride the river before we quit this scene

You’re my little waterfall, oh, oh (whoa – ohh)
I love to watch you roll and roll, oh, oh (whoa – ohh)

You took me to a party and you hid behind a door
Then you stole my wallet and passed out on the kitchen floor

It’s a chemical reaction, oh, oh (whoa – ohh)
I want to show you fake affection, oh, oh (whoa – ohh)

Surely there was no one to guide us
You know what I mean?
So we’re gonna ride the river before we quit this scene

You’re my little waterfall, oh, oh (whoa – ohh)
I love to watch you roll and roll, oh, oh (whoa – ohh)
It’s a chemical reaction and nothing more
I want to show you my affection but you’re on the floor1Embed
