Radio On Lyrics
Just about the time, time I get off
You’re gonna roll right past with the radio on
I don’t mind
One more time, yeah, do it again
But you keep on saying that you’re my friend
I don’t mind

Radio on
Radio on
Turn around and you’re gone

You take my love and you waste my time
Well, how can I help it if it sure feels fine?
I don’t mind
Here you come again looking like you do
I know you like it when I’m falling all over you
I don’t mind

Radio on
Radio on
Turn around and you're gone
Radio on
Oh, oh, oh I know that I gotta let you go, oh, oh
Oh, oh I can see that you’re just not the one for me

Radio on
With the radio on
Turn around and you’re gone
Radio on
Radio on
Turn around and you're gone
With the radio onEmbed
