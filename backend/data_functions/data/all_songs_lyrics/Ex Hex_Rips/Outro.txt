Outro Lyrics
Take care, don’t beware
Follow the sound
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I’ve been around
I follow the silver stream of what I can’t forget
I wait for worlds that haven’t happened yet

Take care, don’t beware
Follow the sound
I’ve been up, I’ve been down, I’ve been around
We lay beside our minds and watched the time grow
There was nothing left to find, and nothing left to knowEmbed
