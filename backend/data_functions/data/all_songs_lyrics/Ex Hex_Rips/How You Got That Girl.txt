How You Got That Girl Lyrics
Maybe I’ve changed but I don’t worry
You’re not gonna bring me down
I used to cry, cry, cry
Now I don’t remember why
I just never want to hear that sound
You tell me this
You tell me that
It’s what you give
You’re gonna get it back

I’ve been the object (whoa, oh, oh)
Of your affection (whoa, oh, oh)
And I’ve been the target (whoa, oh, oh)
Of your cruel intention (oh, oh, oh)

And I know just how you got that girl

I see you on the street with someone new, you talk sweet
You just walk, walk on by
Staying out just about every night
Oh yeah, you just try, try, try
You tell her this
You tell her that
Whatever you give
You’re gonna get it back

I’ve been the object (whoa, oh, oh)
Of your affection (whoa, oh, oh)
And I’ve been the target (whoa, oh, oh)
Of your cruel intention (oh, oh, oh)

And I know just how you got that...
How you got that girl
How you got that girl
How you got that girl

I’ve been the object (whoa, oh, oh)
Of your affection (whoa, oh, oh)
And I’ve been the target (whoa, oh, oh)
Of your cruel intention (oh, oh, oh)

And I know
How you got that girl
How you got that girl (oh, oh)
How you got that girl
How you got that girl (oh, oh)
How you got that girl
How you got that girl (oh yeah)
How you got that girl
How you got that girlEmbed
