New Kid Lyrics
Here comes Johnny, he’s your answer man
Says he can read you like the back of his hand
Says he can make you understand
Watch out, he’ll be your best friend
Saw him in the woods skipping school
Talking trash and being rude
Smoking up, getting bent
Watch out, here he comes again

You’re the new kid in town
Everybody tryin' to knock you down
They thought it hurt when they did it to me
I just laughed and I turned the other cheek
Just trying to get your kicks
And no one understands
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

That mean girl, she’s got nothing to do
She tried to mess around with you
Tell her that it won’t be long
Play around and you’ll be conned
Some say it’s out of hate, some say it’s out of love
Some say it’s out of nothing, and some say that it’s just because –

You’re the new kid in town
Everybody tryin' to knock you down
They were headed in the wrong direction
When they were messing with your affection
Just trying to get your kicks
And no one understands
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior
You’re the new kid in town
Everybody tryin’ to knock you down
They thought it hurt when they did it to me
I just laughed and I turned the other cheek
Just trying to get your kicks
And no one understands
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

You’re the new kid, and you’re a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re the new kid, and you’re a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
You’re a warrior, a warrior, a warriorEmbed
