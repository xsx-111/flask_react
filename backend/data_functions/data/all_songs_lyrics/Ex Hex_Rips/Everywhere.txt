Everywhere Lyrics
I’ll find you everywhere
If you don’t exist, I don’t care
I’ll find you everywhere
Waterfalls are in the air
If you don’t see them, I don’t care
There are waterfalls in the air

I saw you looking into the mortal mirror
I could see right through you
Even though you were right here

You’re a crystal chandelier
Your prisms ring so clear
Crystal chandelier
I’ll find you everywhere
If you don’t exist, I don’t care
I’ll find you everywhere

And when I saw you
You were hanging out with your friends
I knew that it was over
But I didn’t know it had come to an endEmbed
