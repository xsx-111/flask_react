You Fell Apart Lyrics
Last night, you fell apart
I always knew you were strange from the start
Now you’re out creeping around
Just looking for some action, trying to get down
You’re at the after-party every night
And you're wasted in the fog, trying to see the light

I can’t stop thinking, so what do I do?
And I can’t stop feeling, so what do I do?

Last night tore you apart
I always knew you were strange from the start
Now you’re out creeping around
Looking for girly action, trying to get down

And I can’t stop thinking, so what do I do?
And I can’t stop feeling, so what do I do?

I tried so hard not to forget
I got no regrets, I got no regrets
Can’t stop thinking, so what do I do?
And I can’t stop feeling, so what do I do?

I tried so hard not to forget
I got no regrets, I got no regrets

And I can’t stop thinking, so what do I do?
And I can’t stop feeling, so what do I do?

I tried so hard not to forget
That you’re just a creep that I regret
And I tried so hard not to forget
I got no regrets, I got no regretsEmbed
