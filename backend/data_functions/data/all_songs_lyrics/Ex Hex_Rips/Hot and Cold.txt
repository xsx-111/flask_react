Hot and Cold Lyrics
So hot, so cold
So young, so old
You look at me with snake-like eyes
I cannot see through your disguise

We’re parallel
I can tell
You’re acting like the foolish kind
Trying to talk to me through your mind

I want you more, the more I know
The lines that cross and the dots that go

So hot, so cold
So young, so old
You’re acting like the foolish kind
Keep trying to talk to me through your mind

So hot, so cold
So hot, so cold
So hot, so cold
So hot, so cold
So hot, so coldEmbed
