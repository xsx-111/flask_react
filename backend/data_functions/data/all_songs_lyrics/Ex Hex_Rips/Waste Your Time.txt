Waste Your Time Lyrics
I don’t wanna waste your time
You keep talking to me, I might change my mind
There's colors that you can’t see
I wanna say to you so naturally

I don’t wanna hang out with anyone else
So why you wanna hide behind yourself?

If you’re really Mother Nature’s son
Shining perpetual sound on everyone
Well, I don’t wanna let you down
I just wanna dance, wanna dance, wanna dance now

You got all dressed up but there was nowhere to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When the cops shut down our rainbow
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I just wanna be your mirror
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The colors that you can hear
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)1Embed
