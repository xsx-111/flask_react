Beast Lyrics
Was it my imagination?
Did you come out of the past?
You had horses behind you
But I didn’t want to ask
You’re so independent
You never needed nothing
Never needed no one
Never wanted to have fun

That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along

You were standing on the corner
You were waiting for the beast
You had stories of prophets
But I didn’t want to tease
Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desire
I should have known right from the start
When you count on nothing, nothing falls apart
And then we stayed out all night
And in the morning you had second sight
That’s when I found out I was wrong
When you count on nothing, nothing comes along

Come down from your tower
You got tall tree power
Your eyes are on fire
You got no desireEmbed
