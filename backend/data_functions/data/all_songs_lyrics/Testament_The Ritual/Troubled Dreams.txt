Troubled Dreams LyricsTroubled dreams of a wandering nomad
Damned to be all by myself
I travelled far, following bright stars
Through the endless desert sands

Starring off into the sky
Down on myself
Loneliness brings my demise
Oh, what a nightmare
Here we go!
Leave me be; why must I please them
When I can't even please myself?
Deep in thoughts but I still feel so
Lost in endless despair

Starring off into the sky
Down on myself
Loneliness brings my demise
Oh, what a nightmare
Here we go!
As you soon realize
The nights so black I feel blind
Should I keep wandering on
On and on and on
There's just one thing you should know
No, I can't take it no more
Two wrongs don't make it right;
Right or wrong, I can't take it
And in the end you will find
Find me a peace of mind
Forever lost severing my thoughts
From the dream I must seek
Time to end this aggravation
The nomad spirit lives in me

Starring off into the sky
Down on myself
Loneliness brings my demise
Oh, what a nightmare
Here we go!
As you soon realize
The nights so black I feel blind
Should I keep wandering on
On and on and on
There's just one thing you should know
No, I can't take it no more
Two wrongs don't make it right;
Right or wrong, I can't take it
And in the end you will find
Find me a peace of mindEmbed
