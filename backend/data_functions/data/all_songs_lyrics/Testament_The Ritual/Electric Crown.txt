Electric Crown Lyrics
Here we go, the people show
Victims of tomorrow
The way it goes, it never shows
Emptiness or sorrow
There is nothing left inside
Nothing left to cry for
So I justify my crimes
Things that I must die for

So alone, away it goes
The life that you have wasted
You never know where it might go
The sweet success you've tasted
Tested by a bitter frown
Knowing I must die for
Can't confide to all the lies
No one to inquire
As I wander, change of seasons
As I realise that I'll soon be there
I'll let you know, the reapers show
Makes you beg or borrow
He comes to see the tragedy
His fate he will not follow
Wearing your electric crown
The preacher starts to pray
Shiver as the lights go down
Heed these words I say
As I wander, change of seasons
I can't ponder, got my reasons
As I realise I don't care
All I know is that I'll soon be there

Now it's done, the time has come
The people stand in silence
Another dawn has come and gone
His fate has been decided
There is no one left inside
A brain without mind
Traces of a bitter man
Are all that you will find
As I wander, change of seasons
I can't ponder, got my reasons
As I realise I don't care
All I know is, that I'll soon be there
And I'll soon be there
And I'll soon be there
And I'll soon be thereEmbed
