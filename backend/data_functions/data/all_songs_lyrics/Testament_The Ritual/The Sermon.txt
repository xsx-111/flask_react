The Sermon LyricsSuit up for destruction
Death looks behind many faces
Hatred plants it's deepest seed
In the most obvious places
Symbols of allegiance
Chaos spells devotion
Evil is their sanction
The master plan is set in motion
Oh yeah !!
What the hell are you proud of ?
Heads held low
Self respect must be earned
Evil poisons taste just like wine
Swallow the lies until you are blind
You're going blind
Now let it flow...
Waiting to deliver
Imposing martial laws of pain
Kkk or cia
They are one and all the same
Chorus
Evil poisons taste just like wine
Swallow the lies until you are blind
You're going blind
Can't get to me
Or abuse me
Your racist tears will amuse me
And then you'll bleed...
Now let it flow...
Charismatic leaders
Preach their sermons of ignorance
Please take heed soon my friends
Promises won't cleanse the sins
