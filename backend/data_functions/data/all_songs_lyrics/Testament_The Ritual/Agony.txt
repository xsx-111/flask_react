Agony LyricsTrapped in a nightmare
Prisoners of warfare
Days gone become years
Of suffering...
Fight on but what's to gain ?
Misfortune leads to pain...
Fearless they won't die
Caged in they ask why
Cry out but don't cry
In agony...
Live on but what's to gain ?
Die slowly everyday
Misfortune leads to pain
Will they ever be saved
From agony
Agony
Agony ?
In silent suffering
It's never ending
They pray to end their
Misery...
Fight on but what's to gain ?
Die slowly everyday
Misfortune leads to pain
Will they ever be saved
From agony
Agony
Agony
Agony ?
Missing in action
Never forgotten
America the mighty
Set them free...
Fight on but what's to gain ?
Die slowly everyday
Misfortune leads to pain
Will they ever be saved
From agony
Agony
Agony
Agony ?Embed
