Deadline LyricsTake a look away
Think about the things you say
The day awaits your soul in chains
Ya got to make it today
Or there will be hell to pay
And there is no other way
Look at how you're living now
Life can always bring you down
The cradle to the grave
All I give is all I save...
Every day's the same
Can you still feel the pain
You lose your mind then go insane
I can't talk to you
You can't tell me what to do
What I need is up to you
Look at how you're living now
Life can always bring me down
The cradle to the grave
All I give is all I save...
And I wonder how they live
Always taking what they give
Never far, always near, lose your mind
Gripping you with...fear...
What's done is done...
Hey, slave, take it to the grave
Walk in someone else's shoes
That's the path you paved
Live, die, take off that disguise
Find your own reflection now
In the pool it lies
Now you know the score
You can't take this hell anymore
You feel like you never did before
Go and find the way
You're closer to it everyday
Yes, this is the price you pay
And I wonder how they live
Always taking what they give
Never far, always near, lose your mind
Gripping you with fear...
When the fist comes down...Embed
