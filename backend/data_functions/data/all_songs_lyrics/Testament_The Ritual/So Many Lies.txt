So Many Lies LyricsI didn't mean to offend you
But you were way out of line
And I can't help this way I feel
Who said I feel fine?
I'll only give you one warning
Then you must realize
The day of judgement is closing in
Your selfish ways bring your demise

He who lies
Evil pays
Who are you?
Who made you anyway?
Wrong or right
Who's to say
I wanna know
Who made you God today
Slave to the ways of the system
Soon to be crucified
I've seen into your darkest fears
The ones you cannot hide
I know where you go when
Your fears start showing
You run
You cannot hide
Will they respect you when
You ask of the world
'Forgive me for so many lies'?
He who lies
Evil pays
Who are you?
Who made you anyway?
Wrong or right
Who's to say
I wanna know
Who made you God today

Is there a need to pretend to be a man, so divine
And even if I offended you
My truth you can't deny
I know where you go when
Your fears start showing
You run
You cannot hide
Will they respect you when
You ask of the world
'Forgive me for so many lies'?

He who lies
Evil pays
Who are you?
Who made you anyway?
Wrong or right
Who's to say
I wanna know
Who made you God todayEmbed
