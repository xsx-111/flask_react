The Ritual LyricsSay hello again, my friends
I've got to go
The ritual calls to me
Screams twist in harmony
Blinding lights reveal
Thoughts that should not be
The ritual calls to me
Silent insanity
You really thought you'd never
Be the one who bleeds
It's all so clear to me now
Why can't they see ?
Revelations breaking through
The truth distorts
Untimely accident
Your precious mind is lost
Try to regain again my friend
Your sanity
The ritual calls to me
Melodic agony
You really never thought you would never
Be the one who bleeds
It's all so clear to me now
Why they can't see ?
Fry away your mind
Walk behind the blind
Kill yourself killing time
Oooh, what'cha gonna do
When your life is sold
To a world so cold ?
Hey, what'cha gonna say
When you're on your way
On your darkest day ?
Hey
Darkest day
Say goodbye again, my friends
I'm coming home
The ritual calls to me
Distant reality
Unseen images expose
What I can't see
The ritual calls to me
Won't ever set me free
You really thought you'd never
Be the one who bleeds
It's all so clear to me now
Why can't you see ?
Fry away your mind
Walk behind the blind
Kill yourself killing timeEmbed
