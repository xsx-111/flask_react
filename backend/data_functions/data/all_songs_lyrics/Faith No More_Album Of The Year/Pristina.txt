Pristina Lyrics
I'm watching you
I'm watching

You shall weep no more
Its your last breath of air
These walls won't keep them out
They'll keep you in
But who's going to protect you?
Who's going to protect you?

Who?
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who?

In every dark land
In every flower bed
In every marriage bed
I'll be with you

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'm watching you
I'm watching you
I'm watching you
I'm watching youEmbed
