Light Up & Let Go LyricsThe way you're holding me
I'm gonna blow up in your face
You know the way
You're gonna light up and let go
You better let go
Let go
You better let go
You wanted flames
But now your tears won't put out the blaze
Before you run away
Know that I cannot let go
You better let go
Let go
You better let go
You're as good as what you leave behind
Remember smoke your high
Remember to laugh out loud
You left me cold and blind
The way you're holding me
I'm gonna blow up in your face
You know the way
You gotta light up and let go
You better let go
And go
You better let go
Let goEmbed
