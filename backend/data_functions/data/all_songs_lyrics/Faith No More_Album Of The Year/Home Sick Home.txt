Home Sick Home Lyrics
Come home
Its been so long
We're missing you at home
So hang up that phone

Cause I'm coming back home
Back home

Come home
Its been so long
I can hide no more
So hang up that phone

Cause I'm coming back home
Back home

Drive me home
Drive me home
Drive me home
Drive me, keep driving me, keep on driving me
Keep driving me, keep on driving me
Keep driving me ,driving me, driving me home
Come home
Its been so long
We're missing you at home
So hang up that phone

Cause I'm coming back home (I'm coming home)
Back home (I'm coming home)
I'm coming back home (I'm coming home)
I'm back homeEmbed
