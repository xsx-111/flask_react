Got That Feeling Lyrics
Got that feeling
Luck is a little of it
I got that feeling
I can't stop winning
I'm winning

A to z
Look what you're missing
As we speak
Your numbers rising
Take a peak
There's just enough to go around
Get a piece
Your own little piece of hell

Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Got that feeling
Loving every minute of it
Got that feeling
I can't stop winning
Stop winning

Have a drink
A pot of coffee
Cannot think
Too many friends here
Just an inch between striking out and striking rich
If that's the risk
Why not take it, take it, take it

Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get your gold
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Got that feeling
Loving every minute of it
Got that feeling
I can't stop winning
And start living
Start winning
Start living

You can't borrow, tomorrowEmbed
