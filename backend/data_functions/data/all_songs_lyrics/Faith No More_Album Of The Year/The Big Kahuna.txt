The Big Kahuna LyricsWhat's it to you?
Let's make it new
Let's make it die, make it die
There's nothing wrong
It's lived too long
And the pleasure is yours and mine
You conceived me now you wanna kill me
It won't be easy, hey I wanna be me
You took me with you, now I'm gonna kill you
I want my mom
What's it to you?
What's it to you?
Cutting through you
It's still alive, still alive
This thing between us
Is eating us
And it's chewing from the inside
You conceived me now you wanna kill me
It won't be easy, hey I wanna be me
You took me with you, now I'm gonna kill you
I want my mom
You conceived me now you wanna kill me
It won't be easy, hey I wanna be me
You took me with you, now I'm gonna kill you
I want my mom
You conceived me now you wanna kill me
It won't be easy, hey I wanna be me
You took me with you, now I'm gonna kill you
I want my momEmbed
