Naked in Front of the Computer Lyrics
My box is full
And my mouth is full
And my life is full
Until the memory's full

In how many ways and words
Can you say nothing
Millions of ways and words
To say nothing
In how many ways and words
Can you say nothing
Millions of ways and words

What'd I say? I'm empty

I bought the thing
I taught the thing
And I fought the thing

They said it's normal
But they're keeping me dumb and hot
You're missing something
Keeping me dumb and hot
You must be missing something
Keeping me dumb and hot
You must be missing something
Keeping me dumb and hot
What'd I say? I'm empty
What'd I say? I'm empty

And I'm sending it back to you
And I'm sending it back to you
Sending it back to you
I'm sending it back to you
Sending it back to youEmbed
