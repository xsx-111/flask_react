Paths of Glory Lyrics
You squirt out red and turn so yellow
And then you made me kill my own
I'm not afraid (coming, coming, coming)
(Coming, coming, coming)
(Coming, coming, coming)
(Coming, coming, coming)
But I'm afraid (coming, coming, coming)
(Coming, coming, coming)
(Coming, coming, coming)

Blood in your eyes again
Bravery, the face of man
Blood on your mind again
Chivalry, the face of man
Blood in your lies again
Enemy, the face of man
Blood in your eyes again
Again
Again
Again
Again

Is this the only path of glory?
If so, then I won't go along
Follow the trail (running, running, running)
(Running, running, running)
(Running, running, running)
(Running, running, running)
Follow the trail (running, running, running)
(Running, running, running)
(Running, running, running)
Blood in your eyes again
Bravery, the face of man
Blood on your mind again
Chivalry, the face of man
Blood in your lies again
Enemy, the face of man
Blood in your eyes again

Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again
I'm not afraid
But I'm afraid
I'm not afraid
But I'm afraid1Embed
