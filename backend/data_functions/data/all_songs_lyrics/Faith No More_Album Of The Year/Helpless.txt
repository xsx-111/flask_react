Helpless Lyrics
Day is warm, I hear
The wind and the trees
I know I'm there, but I'll never be
The wind is soft tonight
The tide is low
And I know the way
I never felt better, now

Sometimes life, it moves too slow
Slows to a crawl
And then the poetry is lost
And without speed
Hope becomes certainty
And for once, I'm certain
I never felt better, now

A garden is its own perfect world
Where everything has a place
Mmm, every leaf, every stone
Every speck of dirt
But wheres my place?
I never felt better, now
I even tried
To get arrested today
But everyone looked the other way
I count the hours
And I count the days
But for once, I'm certain
I never felt better, now

Don't want your help
Don't need your help
Don't want your help
Don't need your help
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
(You found a way to make me say, help me please, someone)
Helpless
(You found a way to make me say, help me please someone)

The water's clean
I see that it's full of dimes
For every wish, I wonder why
Why all I want
Is something beautiful
A place to rest
I never felt better now
Help
Help
Help
Help
Help
Help
I never felt better now

Don't want your help
Don't need your help
Don't want your help
Don't need your help

You found a way to make me say, help me please, someone
You found a way to make me say, help me please, someone
(Helpless)
You found a way to make me say, help me please, someone
(Helpless)
You found a way to make me say, help me please, someone
(Helpless)
You found a way, you found a way
You found a way, you found a way
(Helpless)
Found a way to make me say, help me please, someone
