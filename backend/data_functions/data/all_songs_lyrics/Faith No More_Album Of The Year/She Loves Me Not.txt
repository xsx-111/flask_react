She Loves Me Not Lyrics
I'm here, alone
On the the telephone line
I'm right where you want me to be
And I'll wait alone and never ask why
I'll be where you want me to be

And I know (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
And I know

I've been here before, and I know your kind
You're right where I want you to be
Now I'll say what I think
I'll never be what you want me to be

Just to be who I am
What you want me to be
You'll be on your knees

Tell me, tell me (tell me it's not true)
Tell me, tell me (tell me it's not true)
Tell me, tell me (tell me it's not true)
Tell me it's not true
And now I'm here
Alone on the telephone line
I'm right where you want me to be

And I know (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
And I know (and I know)
And I know

I'll wait, alone
And never ask why
I'll be where you want me to be
I'll say what I think
I'll never be what you want me to be

Just to be who I am
What you want me to be
You'll be on your knees

Tell me, tell me (tell me it's not true)
Tell me, tell me (tell me it's not true)
Tell me, tell me (tell me it's not true)
Tell me it's not true
Why don't you tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me (tell me)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me it's not trueEmbed
