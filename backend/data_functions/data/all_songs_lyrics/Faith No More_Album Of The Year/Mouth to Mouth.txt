Mouth to Mouth Lyrics
Ahey
Ahey

You tied the knot
A legend is what you bought
I give you cold water
And you swear it was wine
You bought time
If you can fool yourself
Then why not them?
Just keep passing it
Mouth to mouth to mouth

Ahey
Ahey

You tied the knot
A legend is what you bought
I give you cold water
And you swear it was wine
You bought time
If you can fool yourself
Then why not them?
Just keep passing it
Mouth to mouth to mouth
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
Bring it out, bring it out

Ahey
Ahey

You tied the knot
Peeled your skin off
Leave a bundle of nerves
I give you a wet noodle
You swear that it was my tongue
A sharp one
Instead of that same old
Mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth

I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
Bring it out, bring it out

Ahey
Ahey
Mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth
Ahey
Mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth

I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to life
I can dress up the dead man
But I can't bring him back to lifeEmbed
