Collision Lyrics
Collision
My mission

When the dawn breaks
With a handshake
Relaxed and feelin' great

Screeching, head on
Head on, head on
I'm needing a head on
A head on, a head on
Screeching, head on
Head on, head on
I'm needing a head on
A head on, a head on

All the day's plans
All the shaking hands
Beepers and suntans

Screeching, head on
Head on, head on
I'm needing a head on
A head on, a head on
Screeching, head on
Head on, head on
I'm needing a head on
A head on, a head on
Collision
My mission

Head on
Head on
Head on
Head on

When the dawn breaks
With a handshake (head on, head on, head on, head on)
(Collision) Relaxed and feelin' great

Collision
My mission
Collision (head on, head on, head on)
My mission (head on, head on, head on, head on)

Head on
Head on
Head on
Head onEmbed
