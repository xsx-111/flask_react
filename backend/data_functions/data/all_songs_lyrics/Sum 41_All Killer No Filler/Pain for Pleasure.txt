Pain for Pleasure Lyrics
The seas have parted, the ending's started
The sky has turned to black
A killing spree through eternity
The devil stabs you in the back
It's midnight now, you must escape somehow
Torture is his leisure
Don't try to hide, he'll make you subside
As he exchanges pain for pleasure

Pain for pleasure
He's the hunter, you're the game!
Pain for pleasure
Satan is his name!

Look out!Embed
