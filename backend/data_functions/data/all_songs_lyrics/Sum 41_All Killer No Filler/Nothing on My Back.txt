Nothing on My Back Lyrics
Was happiness a fad?
Or was it in the lost and found again
Behind the issues?
It might not be so bad
We're all addicted to our tragedy
I guess it's what it had to be

With nothing on my back
It's still enough to bring me down
Mind's about to crack
'Cause what I thought could not be found
Matter of in fact
It's harder still when you're around
Nothing on my back
I can't help but drown... Switch!

I might as well belong to both of you
And the mess you always seem to drag me through
That night, forever always haunting me
But I guess it is what it's supposed to be
But spare your thoughts of sympathy

With nothing on my back
It's still enough to bring me down
My mind's about to crack
'Cause what I thought could not be found
Matter of in fact
It's harder still when you're around
Nothing on my back
I can't help but drown...

With nothing on my back
It's still enough to bring me down
My mind's about to crack
'Cause what I thought could not be found
With nothing on my back
It's still enough to bring me down
My mind's about to crack
'Cause what I thought could not be found
With nothing on my back
It's still enough to bring me down
My mind's about to crack
'Cause what I thought could not be found
With nothing on my back
It's still enough to bring me down
My mind's about to crack
'Cause what I thought could not be found

With nothing on my back
It's still enough to bring me down
My mind's about to crack
'Cause what I thought could not be found
Matter of in fact
It's harder still when you're around
Nothing on my back
I can't help but drown2Embed
