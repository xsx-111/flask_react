Summer Lyrics
It's far beyond your reach, it holds a place in time
Somewhere ahead is the back of the line
I can't relate to your mistakes
Awkwardly speaking with nothing to say
Caught up in your life, excuses are so lame
You may be different, but I'm still the same
The reasons that you thought, the intention that you caught
You say things are simple, we both know they're not

You can't let it go
Whoa-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
You can't, but I know
Whoa-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Whoa-oh, you don't even know

It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, what you do

A million questions asked, the remnants of the past
You've always been denied, but always by your side
I've always tried to, to understand you
The world's not learning from you
Whoa-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh
Whoa-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh

It's not in what you do, more in what you say
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
(Whoa-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
It's not in what you do, more in what you say
(Whoa-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
It's not in what you do, what you do...2Embed
