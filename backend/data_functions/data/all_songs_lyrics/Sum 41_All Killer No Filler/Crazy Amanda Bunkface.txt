Crazy Amanda Bunkface Lyrics
Don't know what you've really got
It's hard to stay and not pretend
Can't make sense in what you thought
Seems I can't comprehend

I'm happy to be only all that you see
And I'm not one to learn to be the same

I don't wanna hear you bitch no more
I was better off a year before
No matter how I try, I can't ignore
Every time I think, my brain gets sore
When I'm with you

What's so hard about goodbyes?
I'm sorry, I'm just not as keen
On planning out our perfect lives
When I'm only nineteen

I'm happy to be only all that you see
And I'm not one to learn to be the same
I don't wanna try and just be friends
Nothing's gonna change my mind again
If ever there were thoughts I had, they're dead
I can't even think inside my head
When I'm with you

I'm on my way
Can't you see that's the truth?
So long, can't stay
Won't you see that's the truth?
I'm on my way
Can't you see that's the truth?
So long, can't stay
Won't you see that's the, see that's the...

See that's the last that I can take?
Because it's getting really hard to fake
It's not like it's my problem that you're late
Why can't you just spare the lies I hate
When I'm with you?Embed
