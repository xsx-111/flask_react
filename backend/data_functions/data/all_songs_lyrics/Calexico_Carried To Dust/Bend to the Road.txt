Bend to the Road LyricsWatching your eyes go back and forth
Out on the highway
Watching your heart bend to the road
Kiss your forehead as I turn to go
Following those signs
Driving out
Only engine smoke frozen in a cloud
Wishing the space would remain
You're holding back your tears
From letting go of your heart
Leaving the middle of the road
Letting go just a little bit
Till it all spills out the side of the road
Hole in the sea
Hole in the heart
There's a hole in your hand
Where the money just falls
And the pain falls right through
The hole in your head
That wears right through
The hole in all your plans
There's a hole that shines right throughEmbed
