The News About William Lyrics4 in the morning the sidewalk's asleep
Dogs on the porch
Spiders on the leaf
Shipwrecked by night sailing through days
Nobody noticed the slipping away
Connecting the dots with thorns in his side
Boarded up the Windows with pain and with pride
The music box broken that once was his soul
Its sad little song spinning out of control
Then came the storm that washed the roads out
Closed both his eyes and pointed straight south
Second line drums marched into the sea
While the clouds overhead cried "mutiny"
They parted for Cathy and her bitter news
As her words fail and the sky grew dim
Recalled how close to that exit I've been
Ours not to reply, ours not to reason why
The news about William
The lifeline retreats
Desire for release
The thorns in his sideEmbed
