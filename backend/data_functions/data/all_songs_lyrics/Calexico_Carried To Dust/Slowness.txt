Slowness LyricsMiles of highway poppies, a stretch of maybe flowers
Past Signal Hill a ways
We were parked and searching
For a hubcap rolling into the fields of thorn
Although we couldn't see a thing that night
Stars still shone
In their slowness
And their slowness
Took us by surprise
If I never told you how you helped to rescue
The car and all inside
Remember roads were steep and
You and I went sliding down the grade from Gate's Pass
You asleep and me behind the wheel hovering
In that slowness
And that slowness
Has never gone awayEmbed
