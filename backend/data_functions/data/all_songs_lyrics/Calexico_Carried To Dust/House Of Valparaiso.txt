House Of Valparaiso LyricsDialing in a forgotten voice
Coming in like waves rolling off the coast
Sweeping through illegal ports
Rising from the depths falling off the tongue
Ships drifting out of tune
Coming in like waves rolling off the coast
Many, many more, sculpting the shoreline
Etching the harbor and the people
Who’ve stayed afloat
Coming in like waves rolling off the coast
Dialing in a forgotten voice
Rising from the depths falling off the tongue
Sweeping through illegal ports
Coming in like waves rolling off the coast
Ships drifting out of tune
Can’t stop the waves coming like a ghost
Is that your shape
In the foam of the sea
After all these years
Coming home to me
La Chascona
Hearts to ocean
Vows unbroken
Lying in the bath fully clothed
Ready for the ocean’s wake
The tears won’t wash away
What her eyes can’t erase
Not safe to say in her native tongue
A radio voice drowning out
The general’s song lingering on
A raft made of books from a driftwood house
Returns to the wavesEmbed
