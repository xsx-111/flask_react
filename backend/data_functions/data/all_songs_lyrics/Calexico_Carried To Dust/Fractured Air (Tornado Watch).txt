Fractured Air (Tornado Watch) LyricsFrom the delta to the plains
Storms touching down again
Devil's hiding in the house
Angel's in the rain
Corrugated lovers swimming on the wire
Switching on and off the breakers
On a night like this
No one should be alone
In the fractured air
Misfired from a distress flare
All the while searchlights reconcile
Cut their losses and run
Clinging to the rooftop
Losing track of days
Devil's up in the attic
Angel's lost her way
Must've misdialed the number
Or the telephone's died
Lost you in the darkness
And never heard back
Dropped out from the night
Like a stone
Falling from the fractured air
Misfired like a distress flare
All the while searchlights reconcile
Cut their losses and runEmbed
