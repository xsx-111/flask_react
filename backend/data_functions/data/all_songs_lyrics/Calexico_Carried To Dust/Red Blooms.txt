Red Blooms LyricsWhen the fists of winter fly
Driving bones into the snow
Blackened frostbitten nights
Vodka running dry
The statues cloaked in white
Migrants from museums
Losing all the feeling now that
Sunrise is outlawed
Strangers plant themselves
Down in the cold hard ground
Later when the harvest thaws
Snow drops will be in bloom
Crossed out on city maps
Prospekt Mira reveals
Shadows drinking antifreeze
Neath the underpass
Ordered once a gulagâ€™s march
Now cities send the call
Falling from the rooftops fast
And frozen against the wall
Where strangers plant themselves
Dead souls of the underground
When February thaws
Snow drops will be in bloom again
Bloom again, bloom again
Bloom again, bloom again
Red blooms, red bloomsEmbed
