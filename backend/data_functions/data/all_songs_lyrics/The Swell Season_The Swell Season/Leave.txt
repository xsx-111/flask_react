Leave Lyrics
"I can't wait forever"
Is all that you said
Before you stood up
And you won't disappoint me
I can do that myself
But I'm glad that you've come
Now if you don't mind

Leave, leave
And free yourself at the same time
Leave, leave
I don't understand, you've already gone

And I hope you feel better
Now that it's out
What took you so long?
And the truth has a habit
Of falling out of your mouth
But now that it's come
If you don't mind

Leave, leave
And please yourself at the same time
Leave, leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you came to now
Leave, leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave, leave
Da, da
Oh, leave, leave
Let go of my hand
You said what you have to now
Leave, leave
Da, da, da
La da da, da da
La da da-da
La da da, da da
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
La da da
La da da, ah
