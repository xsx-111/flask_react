Lies LyricsI think it's time we give it up
And figure out what's stopping us
From breathing easy
And talking straight
The way is clear
If you're ready now
The volunteer is slowing down
And taking time to
Save himself
The little cracks they escalated
And before we knew it was too late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you'd slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
The little cracks they escalated
And before we knew it was too late
For making circles and telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you'd slow down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn
So plant the thought and watch it grow
Wind it up and let it goEmbed
