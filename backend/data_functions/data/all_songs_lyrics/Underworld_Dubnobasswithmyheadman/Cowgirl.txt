Cowgirl Lyrics

I'm invisible, I'm invisible

An eraser of love, an eraser of love

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' to

I'm invisible, I'm invisible

An eraser of love, an eraser of love

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' to

An eraser of love, an eraser of love
I scream, I scream
I scream so much
You know what I mean
This electric stream
And my tears in league
With the wires and energy
And my machine
This is my beautiful dream

I'm hurting no one
I wanna give you everything
I wanna give you energy
I wanna give a good thing
I wanna give you everything

Everything, everything
In one final scream of love
Who couldn't climb this high
She looks beautiful
Like a child
I feel tears, and I wanna scream
You know what I mean
This is hurting  no one
An eraser of love
Hurt, the necessary feeling

Why don't you call me?
I feel like flyin' to

An eraser of love, an eraser of loveEmbed
