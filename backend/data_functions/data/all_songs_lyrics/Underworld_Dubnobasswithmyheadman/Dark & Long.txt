Dark & Long LyricsThunder, thunder, lightning ahead, long
Kiss you, kiss you dark and long
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead
Thunder, thunder, lightning
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead
Now I kiss you dark and long
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead, long
Kiss you, kiss you dark and long, long
Me I'm just a waitress she said
I went and bought a new head she said
I look at you I believe in you she said
Screaming into the eye of the lens
I want to smash it up, I want to break it down
I want a wall of tears to wash away
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead
Thunder, thunder, lightning
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead
Now I kiss you dark and long
Filled with tainted girls and motel frills
What a laugh, you was done up there mate
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead
I could kiss you dark and long
Thunder, thunder, lightning ahead
Now I kiss you dark and long
Shout your love, the stars are black
The church is sweet, my skin is hot
Thunder, thunder lightning ahead
Now I kiss you dark and long, shout your love1Embed
