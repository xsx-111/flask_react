Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
I'm the spoonman, talks to God
Transfusion, penetration
I'm the spoonman, talks to God
Transfusion, penetration
I'm the spoonman, talks to God
Transfusion, penetration
I'm the spoonman, talks to God
Transfusion penetration
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
I'm the spoonman, she's a wound
Nice bikini, steppin' razor
I'm the spoonman, she's a wound
Nice bikini, steppin' razor
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
Watched you cry
Watched you fly
Watched you die
Don't put your hand where you wouldn't put your face
She said a dollar rubber rat Utah plates
Brilliant green substance unknown
With a face like a peeled onion
Sheep in drag horseback automatic
To make your home clean make it sani-flush
She said now I'm a new skin-free
Crispy with this urge to phone
Into the no-smoking zone of stainless steel Tokyo
Me and big white dog got to hijack pecan tarts for Babylon Bambi
Out of mercer street where the crack heads catwalk charity
Where teenage sex rides a stoned
Rhythm trading its chili skins to the screamers come
To hunt their meat to the gold diggers in kiss boots
And the recycled blondes in their
Stack heeled snatches the monster trucks the rolling rocks
The poodle boys with their little bone diggers
And dark stuff comes
Oozing out the apple core tonight like
A beggars dog tasting the wind (change)
Into the blood
Into the blood
Into the bloodEmbed
