Mmm Skyscraper I Love You LyricsMmm skyscraper I love you
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Thirty thousand feet above the earth
It's a beautiful thing
And you're a beautiful thing
Thirty thousand feet above the earth
It's a beautiful thing
Everybody's a beautiful thing
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Mmm skyscraper I love you
And I see Elvis! Elvis!
I see porn dogs sniffing the wind, sniffing the wind for something new
Porn dogs sniffing the wind for something violent they can do
Porn dogs sniffing the wind, sniffing the wind for something new
Porn dogs sniffing the wind for something violent for me and you
Will you be my big plaything
My total big disorientator
Will you be my big plaything
My ninja power
My number cruncher
Yes yes yes no yes yes
Yes yes yes yes no no
And I see Elvis! And I hear God on the phone
Mmm skyscraper I love you
I see porn dogs sniffing the wind, sniffing the wind for something new
Porn dogs sniffing the wind for something violent that they could do
Porn dogs sniffing the wind, sniffing the wind for something new
Porn dogs sniffing the wind for something violent for me and you
The city is a whore tonight
And I see God talking! Elvis! God talking!
Pornfest pork fat jesus christ night light
Elvis fresh meat and a little whipped cream
Pornfast cornfat jesus christ night ride
Elvis fresh meat and a little whipped cream
Thirty thousand feet above the earth
Thirty thousand feet above the earth
Beautiful thing, you're a beautiful thing
Thirty thousand feet above the beautiful earth
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Mmm skyscraper I love you
Like I feel you
Like I feel you
Like I feel you
Like I feel you...Embed
