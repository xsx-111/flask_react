Rez LyricsI'm invisible...
And a razor of love...
Why don't you call me I feel like flying in too...
And a razor of love...
Why don't you call me I feel like flying in too...
And a razor of love...
And a razor of love...
I scream! I scream! I scream! I scream!
I scream! I scream! I scream! I scream!
I scream I scream I scream so much
You know what I mean this electric stream
And my tears in league with the wires and energy
It's my machine, this is my beautiful dream
I'm hurting no one! hurting no one! hurting no one!
I'm hurting no one!
I want to give you everything
I want to give you energy
Want to give a good thing
To give you everything
Everything everything everything everything
Everything everything everything everything
Everything everything!
One final scream of love who couldn't climb this high
She looks beautiful like a child
A feel of tears and I want to scream
You know what I mean
This is hurting no one!
And a razor of love!
Let go! let go!
Ooh ooh
Let go! let go!
Yeah!
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Let go!
Let go!
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Let go! let go!
Oh no no no no no no!Embed
