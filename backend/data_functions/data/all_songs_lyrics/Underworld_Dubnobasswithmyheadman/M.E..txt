M.E. Lyrics(あなたの夢に私を保てる)
Can you hold me in your dreams?
(私を感じることができるの
私があなたを感じるように)
Can you feel me like I feel you?
Goodbye, Mother Earth
I don't want to kill time, I want it to live
I'm not wasting this life, I'm letting it in
You just rip off the planet and take what you want
I'm coming to get you if you don't give up
Beautiful destination, what's it worth
Beautiful destination, goodbye Mother Earth
I am all that surrounds you
The earth and the sky
You, you're the mouth and the money
That's bleeding me dry
Why?
I am not a spirit of the world
I heal the spirit of the world
I heal the spirit of the world
Goodbye Mother Earth
I heal the spirit of the world
(こっちだ)
It's a beautiful destination
(こっちだ)
For what it's worth
(こっちだ)
A beautiful destination
(こっちだ)
Goodbye Mother Earth
It's a beautiful destination
For what it's worth
It's a beautiful destination
Goodbye Mother EarthEmbed
