Dirty LyricsSweet in winter, sweet in rain
"Shake well before use," she said
You never touch me anymore this way
Connector in, receiver out
You let me in through the back door
Ride the sainted rhythms
On the midnight train to Romford
Ride the sainted rhythms
Sweet in winter, sweet in rain
"Shake well before use," she said
You never touch me anymore this way
Oh no, connector, connector, connector, connector
You're a connector, connector, connector, connector
I'm so dirty and the light blinds my eyes
You're oh so dirty and the light, it blinds my eyes
Here comes Christ on crutches
"Call me wet trampoline," she said today
But I was too busy with my hand
"Shake well before use," she said
But you never touch me anymore
I was busy listening for phone sex
Coming through the back door in skin tight trunks
And we all went mental and danced
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
To the off peak electricity
And the light blinds my eyes and I feel dirty
And the light blinds my eyes and I feel so shaken in my faith
Here comes Christ on crutches
And here comes another God, here comes another God
Like a buffalo thunder, with a smell of sugar
And a velvet tongue and designer voodoo
But I got phone sex to see me through the emptiness in my 501s
Freeze dried with a new religion
And my teeth step back in my head
I get my kicks on channel six
The light, it burns my eyes and I feel so dirty
Here comes Christ on crutches
I will not be confused
Will not be confused
You left me confused
I will not be confused with another man
This pressure of opinions
"Lighten up, listen to your eyes," you said
But all I could see was Doris Day in a big screen satellite
Disappearing down the tube hole on Farringdon Street
With whiplash Willy, the motor psycho
And the light, it burns my eyes
And the light, it burns my eyes
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel six
I get my kicks on channel sixEmbed
