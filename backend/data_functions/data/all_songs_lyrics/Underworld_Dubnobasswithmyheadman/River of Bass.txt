River of Bass LyricsTo touch to taste
She flows like a river of bass vibration
To touch to taste
She flows like a river of bass vibration
Sweet water
Sweet water
To touch to taste
You flow like a river of bass vibration
Sunshine surrounds me
Showering above their greed
Sunshine surrounds me
Showering above the greed
To touch to taste
You flow like a river of bass vibration
To touch to taste
You flow like a river of bass vibration
Take me down down down down down down
To your river of sweet release
Take me down down down down down down
To your river of sweet relief
Everyone is sleeping
This needle is release
Sitting on a mountain
Companies could see
Listening to a whisper
To touch to taste
You flow like a river of bass vibration
To touch to taste
You flow like a river of bass vibration
What is in the thornbush
A thornbush in my head
I'm a snowstorm I'm a shaker
Sometimes I regret the things I say
To touch to taste
She flows like a river of bass vibration
To touch to taste
She flows like a river of bass vibration
Take me down down down down down down
To your river of sweet release
Take me down down down down down down
To your river of sweet relief
From Chelsea to Essex
Every room
In every sweet cocoon
Chelsea to Essex
In every room
In every sweet cocoon
Sometimes I feel her coming from the other side of the world
Sometimes I feel her coming from the other side of the world
To touch to taste
She flows like a river of bass vibrationEmbed
