The Amorous Humphrey Plugg Lyrics
Hello, Mr. Big Shot
Say, you're lookin' smart
I've had a tiring day, I took the kids along to the park
You've become a stranger
Every night, with the boys, got a new suit
That old smile's come back
And I kiss the children good night
And I slip away on the newly waxed floor

I've become a giant
I fill every street
I dwarf the rooftops, I hunchback the moon
Stars dance at my feet
Leave it all behind me
Screaming kids on my knee
And the telly swallowing me
And the neighbor shouting next door
And the subway trembling the roller-skate floor

I seek the buildings blazing with moonlight
In Channing Way
Their very eyes seem to suck you in with their laughter
They seem to say
"You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile
In Channing Way"
Oh, to die of kisses
Ecstasies and charms
Pavements of poets will write that I died in nine angel's arms
And they all were smiling
Still seductive as sin in their eyes
The man I had been
No more hard-luck stories to wear
Nothing left to give, why the hell should I care?

Ann owns my smile and Mary's my shadow
In Channing Way
And with her cellophane sighs, Celina, the candles
Begs me to stay
"You're all right now
So stop a while behind our smile
In Channing Way"Embed
