Best of Both Worlds Lyrics
Best of both worlds
That's what you want
All your own way
That's not my way

I won't share you, I couldn't bear to
It's time for you to choose which one you'd rather lose
Could you love him and forget me?
Are you sorry that you met me?
What we've been through means nothing to you
I can't satisfy you
You want best of both worlds

Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of both worlds

I have loved you since I found you
You belong here, just look around you
Keep your true love or take your new love
You must choose between us
You want best of both worlds
Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of both worlds

You've got to choose between us
You just can't have the two of us

Make your fickle mind up
I won't stay while you enjoy
Best of both worlds

Best of both worlds
Best of both worldsEmbed
