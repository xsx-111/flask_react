Wait Until Dark Lyrics
Who cares how cold and grey the day may be?
Wait until dark and we'll be warm
Our place of love is where we face our dreams, together
Where our fantasies take form

When I can't feel your nearness in the night
My disappointments disappear

The cheerless day may bring us little dreams
That seem to miss their mark
But, oh, my darling, wait until dark


The cheerless day may bring us little dreams
That seem to miss their mark
But, oh, my darling, wait until darkEmbed
