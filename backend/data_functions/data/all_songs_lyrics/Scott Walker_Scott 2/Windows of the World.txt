Windows of the World LyricsThe windows of the world are covered with rain
Where is the sunshine we once knew
Everybody knows when little children play
They need a sunny day to grow straight and tall
Let the sun shine through
The windows of the world are covered with rain
When will those black skies turn to blue
Everybody knows when boys grow into men
They start to wonder when their country will call
Let the sun shine through
The windows of the world are covered with rain
What is this whole world coming to
Everybody knows when men can not be friends
Their quarter loves an ends
Some have to die, some have to die
Let the sun shine through
The windows of the world are covered with rain
There must be something we can do
Everybody knows whenever rain appears
It's really angel tears
How long must they cryEmbed
