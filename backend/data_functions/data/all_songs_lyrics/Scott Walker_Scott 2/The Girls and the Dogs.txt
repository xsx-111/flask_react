The Girls and the Dogs LyricsThe girls
Are as fast as a game
Are as bright as a flame
And you're always to blame
The girls
Are as pink as the light
And as dark as the night
And they're always right
The girls
Are as cold as the sphinx
Always dreaming of minks
They drive you to drink
The girls
Are as soft as a sigh
That whispers good-bye
And leaves you to cry
But the dogs
Well, they're only dogs
Just wagging their tails
As they watch it end
Oh, the dogs
Well, they're only dogs
And maybe that's why
They're man's best friend
The girls
Can make you feel cold
Can make you feel old
An antique to be sold
The girls
They play with your heart
They tear you apart
You're never too smart
The girls
They throw you from towers
They'll whip you with flowers
It depends on the hours
The girls
Will treat you like trash
Or let you be brash
It depends on your cash
But the dogs
Don't depend on a thing
They just lick your face
When they see it end
Oh, the dogs
Don't depend on a thing
And maybe that's why
They're man's best friend
The girls
You know that they are vain
They will poison your brain
They will drive you insane
The girls
Will laugh at your jokes
How they love the coat
Aw, but it is all a hoax
The girls
Are still making dates
They still making you wait
And they say you are late
The girls
Are yours for a throw
At least you think so
Ah but you will never know
The dogs
Well you know the dogs
They lift up a leg
As they see it end
The dogs
Well you know the dogs
And maybe that's why
They're man's best friend
The girls
They're not what they seem
They all have a scheme
They call it a dream
The girls
Are as hot as they please
And you're down on your knees
With the greatest of ease
The girls
Say you're on the right track
Then they take it all back
Tie it up in a sack
The girls
They will give it of course
But they give with such force
That it gives you remorse
But the dogs
They give nothing at all
For they can do
Is just watch it end
Oh, the dogs
They give nothing at all
And maybe that's why
They're man's best friend
And yet it's because of the girls
When they've knocked us about
And our tears want to shout
That we kick the dogs outEmbed
