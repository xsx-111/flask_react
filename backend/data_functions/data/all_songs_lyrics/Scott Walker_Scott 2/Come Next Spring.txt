Come Next Spring Lyrics
Come next spring
When all the world is new
And fresh
And green
And fair

Then I'll come home
And I'll carry in my heart
Just one prayer

That I'll find you
Still waiting for my arms
We'll meet
We'll kiss
We'll cling
And then once more
Love will blossom as before
Come—come on, next spring

And then once more
Love will blossom as before
Come next—next spring
Come next springEmbed
