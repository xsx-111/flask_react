Puff, The Magic Dragon Lyrics
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Little Jackie Paper
Loved that rascal Puff
And brought him strings and sealing wax
And other fancy stuff
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

Together they would travel
On a boat with billowed sail
Jackie kept a look-out
Perched on Puff's gigantic tail
Noble kings and princes
Would bow whene'er they came
Pirate ships would lower their flags
When Puff roared out his name

Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee

A dragon lives forever
But not so, little boys
Painted wings and giants' rings
Make way for other toys

One grey night it happened
Jackie Paper came no more
And Puff, that mighty dragon
He ceased his fearless roar
His head was bent in sorrow
Green scales fell like rain
Puff no longer went to play
Along the cherry lane

Without his lifelong friend
Puff could not be brave
So Puff, that mighty dragon
Sadly slipped into his cave
Oh, Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
Puff, the magic dragon
Lived by the sea
And frolicked in the autumn mist
In a land called Honalee
