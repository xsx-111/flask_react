Big Boat LyricsI went up the levee to pack some sacks
And I thought I'd bring me some money back
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
My woman on the levee wearing a frown
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
There's a big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river blowing loud and fast
If she don't get to deep water she'll never land
And my woman on the levee shaking her hand
She thinks she's gonna quit me for another man
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
There's a big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river blowing loud and fast
And my woman on the levee feeling mighty sad
She thinks I got the money that I once had had
But when I get her home it's gonna be too bad
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Big boat up the river and she can't come down
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
Somebody tell that woman
There's a big boat up the river and she can't come downEmbed
