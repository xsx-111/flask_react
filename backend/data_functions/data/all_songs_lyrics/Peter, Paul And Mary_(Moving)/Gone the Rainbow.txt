Gone the Rainbow Lyrics
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal
Come bibble in the boo shy Lorey
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal
Come bibble in the boo shy Lorey

Here I sit on Buttermilk Hill
Who could blame me, cry my fill
Every tear would turn a mill
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule-a-roo
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal
Come bibble in the boo shy Lorey

I sold my flax, I sold my wheel
To buy my love a sword of steel
So it in battle he might wield
Johnny's gone for a soldier
Oh my baby, oh my love (Shule, shule, shule-a-roo)
Gone the rainbow, gone the dove
Your father was my only love (Shule, shule, shule-a-roo)
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule-a-roo
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal
Come bibble in the boo shy Lorey
Shule, shule, shule-a-roo
Shule-a-rak-shak, shule-a-ba-ba-coo
When I saw my Sally Babby Beal
Come bibble in the boo shy LoreyEmbed
