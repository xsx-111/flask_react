Morning Train LyricsI'm goin' home on the morning train
I'm goin' home on the morning train
I'm goin' home on the morning train
If you don't see me you can hear me singing
All my sins been taken away, taken away
Sister Mary wore three links of chain
Sister Mary wore three links of chain
Sister Mary wore three links of chain
On each link was my Jesus name
All my sins been taken away, taken away
I'm on my way to the freedom land
I'm on my way to the freedom land
I'm on my way to the freedom land
Lord God Almighty hold my hand
All my sins been taken away, taken away
Well I don't know but I been told
Streets in heaven paved in gold
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Hold on, hold on, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
The devil he has a slippery shoe
And if you don't watch out he'll slip it on you
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Hold on, hold on, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
I'm goin' home on the morning train
I'm goin' home on the morning train
I'm goin' home on the morning train
If you don't see me you can hear me singing
All my sins been taken away, taken awayEmbed
