Old Coat LyricsI look to the east, I look to the west
A youth asking fate to be rewardin'
But fortune is a blind god, flying through the clouds
And forgettin' me on this side of Jordan
Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves
Life is a hard road to travel, I believe
Silver spoons to some mouths, golden spoons to others
Dare a man to change the given order?
Though they smile and tell us all of us are brothers
Never was it true this side of Jordan
Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves
Life is a hard road to travel, I believe
Like some ragged owlet with it's wings expanded
Nailed to some garden gate or boardin'
Thus will I by some men all my life be branded
Never hurted none this side of Jordan
Take off your old coat and roll up your sleeves
Life is a hard road to travel, I believeEmbed
