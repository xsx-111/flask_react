Man Come Into Egypt LyricsThere is a man come into Egypt, and Moses is his name
When he saw the grief upon us
In his heart there burned a flame
In his heart there burned a flame Oh Lord
In his heart there burned a flame
When he saw the grief upon us
In his heart there burned a flame
There is a man come into Egypt, his eyes are full of light
Like the sun come up in Egypt, come to drive away the night
Come to drive away the night Oh Lord
Come to drive away the night
Like the sun come up in Egypt, come to drive away the night
There is a man come into Egypt, he's come for you and me
On his lips a word is singing, and the word is Liberty
And the word is Liberty, Oh, Lord;
And the word is Liberty
On his lips a word is singing, and the word is Liberty
There is a man come into Egypt to stir the souls of men
We will follow him to freedom, never wear those chains again
Never wear those chains again oh Lord
Never wear those chains again
We will follow him to freedom, never wear those chains again!Embed
