Tiny Sparrow Lyrics
Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like the stars on a summer's mornin'
First they'll appear and then they're gone

If I had known before I courted
What all his lyin' could have done
I'd have locked my heart in a box of golden
And never would have courted none

I wish I were a tiny sparrow
And I had wings and I could fly
I'd fly away to my own true lover
And all he'd ask I would deny

Alas I'm not a tiny sparrow
I have not wings nor can I fly
And on this earth in grief and sorrow
I am bound until I die

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like the stars on a summer's mornin'
First they'll appear and then they're goneEmbed
