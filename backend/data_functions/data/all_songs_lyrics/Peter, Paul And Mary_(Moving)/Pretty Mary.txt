Pretty Mary Lyrics
My horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay
So fare thee well darlin' I'm goin' away
Your parents don't like me, they say I'm too poor
They say I'm not worthy to enter your door

Pretty Mary, Pretty Mary, would you think me unkind
If I were to see you and tell you my mind?
As sure as the dew drops fall on the green corn
Last night I was with her, tonight I am gone (Tonight I am gone)

My horses ain't hungry, they won't eat your hay
So fare thee well darlin' I'm goin awayEmbed
