Names LyricsAs the warmth of the sun leaves my back
And these bruise colored skies turn to black
None of these faces look the same
And not a one knows my name
Oh, I am a long way from home
This road is now my only friend
It welcomes me through straights and through bends
But no matter how long I stay
It will never know my name
Oh, I am a long way from home
Yeah, I am a long way from homeEmbed
