Near the End Lyrics
And when you feel you're near the end
Will you just turn it over and start again
Is there a stirring in your heart
As the time comes when we will have to part?


And when you feel you're near the end
And there's a stranger where once was a friend
And you are left without a word
Only the whispers that you've overheard

Standing in silence, holding my breath
Disconnected and dry
And though I'm certain that there's nothing left
To hold on to, to give or to try
Some things never change, no don't ever change
And I'm feeling the cold
Thinking that we're getting older and wiser
When we're just getting old

And when you feel you're near the end
And what once burned so bright is growing dim?
And when you see what's been achieved
Is there a feeling that you've been deceived?
