Cruise Lyrics
Cruise, you are making me sing
Now you have taken me under your wing
Cruise, we both know you're the best
How can they say you're like all the rest
Cruise, we're both traveling so far
Burning out fast like a shooting star
Cruise, I feel sure that your song will be sung
And will ring in the ears of everyone

Saving our children, saving our land
Protecting us from things we can't understand
Power and glory, justice and right
I'm sure that you'll help us to see the light
And the love that you radiate will keep us warm
And help us to weather the storm

Cruise, you have taken me in
And just when I've got you under my skin
You start ignoring the fears I have felt
'Cause you know you can always make my poor heart melt
Please don't take what I'm saying amiss
Or misunderstand at a time such as this
Because if such close friends should ever fall out
What would there be left worth fighting about
Power and glory, justice and right
I'm sure that you'll help them to see the light
Hooh, dudndu du du, dundudududu
Will you save our children, will you save our land
And protect us from all the things that we can't understand?
Hooh, dudndu du du, dundudududu
Power and glory and justice for all
Who will we turn to when your hard rain falls?
