Love on the Air LyricsLove on the air
I keep transmitting but reception is hazy
I don't get an answer
Keep sending it faster
Always knew it was crazy
To put my love on the air

No one will hurt me again
No one will cause me to lie
No one will control me by pain
No one will cause me to cry
I was looking for love
In wandering eyes
Like a ship trying to fix on a beacon
I learned how to sigh
On the ribbon and wires
It's a habit that's so hard to weaken

No one will ever manipulate
Make me promise to do or die
No one can make me hesitate
What can I lose if they try
I was looking for love
Like the very first time
Didn't realize love never left me
Contradicted, conspired
I connived and designed
Nothing on earth could arrest me

(Reception is hazy)
When you put your love on the air
(Always knew it was crazy)
To put my love on the air
(But I only communicate)
When I put my love on the air
(You don't have to consummate)
Love on the air

No one will hurt me again
No one will cause me to lie
No one controlled me by pain
No one will cause me to cry
I was looking for love
In wandering eyes
Like a ship trying to fix on a beacon
I learned how to sigh
On the ribbon and wires
It's a habit that's so hard to weaken
I put my love on the air
