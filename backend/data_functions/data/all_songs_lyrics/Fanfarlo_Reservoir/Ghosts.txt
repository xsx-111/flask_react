Ghosts LyricsThey stayed put in their houses
Or moved to higher grounds
There are ghosts by the reservoir
No one wants them round any more
Theyve put a spell
For the dam to break
Theyll tell you all about the day when it came
What it took away
In 1922
It caused a drought
It caused a flood
It came to change us all for good
Do I look like someone?
Ive heard the voices through the floor
In a strange cold language
Theyre planning out a war
So tap into the mainline
And tell me all the secrets
Of a world you once lived in
That your heart could not swallow
The sky is so shallow
Its late, youve been working hard
Drive down to the reservoir
It caused a drought
It caused a flood
It came to change us all for good
Despite the years theyre still around
Have we fallen out for good?1Embed
