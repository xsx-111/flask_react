Finish Line LyricsWait here for the flag to fall
And follow me to the edge of town
Your familys seen you on your bike
All they say is its such a waste of time
Stay clear of the runner up
Hes got some tricks hes not afraid to try
I stopped racing years ago
I stopped listening  I stopped speaking
The world has kept you on your toes
Speak to me with your hands
Ive got my friends safe in a cocoon
But Ive read enough to know it will end
Kerosene is my last line of defense
Against all the rules Ive bent
Im in the dark there, Im in the basement
Thats where I keep them, thats where theyre buzzing
Last year was a good year, I beat myself to a bloody mess
But blue is the colour of the days Im hoping for
What have you done to the mind you had
Out there somewhere is the finish line
I came to on a bed
I must have been taken by surprise
I must have lost my head!
Speak to me, if you canEmbed
