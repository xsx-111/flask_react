Tuesday (You Come When We Call) LyricsTrust me on this one
Tuesday's when we will come
With our guns, with our knives
You swallow all that we put on your plate
You come when we call
And you dance when we say so
Air is good and thin
Sun hangs low from your ceiling
Man made of tin march across your bedroom wall
You come when we call
And you dance when we say soEmbed
