If It Is Growing LyricsIf it is growing
If it is clawing
And wants to get out
Then let it come out
Your memorys failing
Your eyes are like rocks
And I can see you on the floor of your box
Youve got answers
In everyone is electric circuits
And thats all there is
So now youre leaving?
Im not that impressed
Oh they will comment on the way that I dress
If I could be so cruel to confess:
That if you built this to look just like you
Then heres the irony
No one will know
If its tomorrow or today that you goEmbed
