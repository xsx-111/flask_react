Drowning Men LyricsEven though the lights have changed, I'm caught up in an endless loop
Driving for ten hours and then ending up in the same place
Can you hear a rumble underground, can you hear the beat?
Someone pacing round and round in circles on the floor above
But we can still afford to not make sense at all
But we can still afford to not make sense at all
I see you wearing surgery rubber gloves, standing in the street
Early in the morning, still awake but barely on your feet
Oh we can still afford to not make sense at all
Oh we can still afford to not make sense at all
We spend our time with drowning men
We're going to let ourselves get dragged down
And now we're waiting
And now we're stranded
And now we're choking (and now)
And now we're all (we're waiting)
Waiting
And now we're stranded
And now we're aching (and now)
And now we're all (we're waiting)
Waiting
And now we're stranded
And now we're aching (and now)
And now we're all (we're waiting)
Waiting
And now we're stranded
And now we're choking (and now)
And now we're all (we're waiting)
Even though the lights have changed I'm caught up in an endless loop
We spend our time with drowning men
We're going to let ourselves get dragged downEmbed
