Comets LyricsLook up, open the clouds
Here comes the bombshell
On the way home
And now we want the coal?
Confusing times
Cry murder, cry what you like
Just let the comets lead the way
Well tear it down
Well hold the truth by the neck
Kick in the doors and burn the books
Try to forget
And wear it like flag
Try to be patient
On the way home
Cause inside, behind every curtain
They count the minutes, they count the days
Well tear it down
Well hold the truth by the neck
Kick in the doors and burn the books
Try to forget
If you look at the horizon there is always something ducking out of sight
When youre looking at the treetops and theyre scratching out their patterns in the sky
Look up, open the clouds
Here comes the bombshell
On the way homeEmbed
