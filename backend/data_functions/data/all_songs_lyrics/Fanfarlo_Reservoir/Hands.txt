Hands LyricsYes, we fight sometimes
That's a good start
There's a goal sometimes
That's a good start
'Cause it's where I'll find what's been failing
I've been out of town
I've been trailing
Something in the walls
If it's underground, then it's where I'll go
If it's coming down, then it's how I'll know
It's in my head but never in my hands
So put it away like a folded flag
And bow to your name in a shoe box
I'll be back in ten years, it will idle
I've been out of town
I've been missing
Doing what I'm bound to do
If it's coming down, then it's how I'll know
If it's underground, then it's where I'll go
If it's underground, then it's where I'll go
If it's coming down, then it's how I'll know
If it's in my head but never in my hands
It's never in my handsEmbed
