We Live By The Lake LyricsWe live by the lake
Where the road ends
Where the foreign souls
Find a place to bask
Where they don't speak;
Where they know the time
Oh, we've found a home
For ourselves
All that I can say
Is that I feel like running
Time to stay awake;
Time to fall apart
There are roads here
That lead you in circles
But you don't know
But you don't know...
That's the point of them
Because we'll cross the water
In a little while
All that I can say
Is that I feel like running
Time to stay awake;
Time to fall apartEmbed
