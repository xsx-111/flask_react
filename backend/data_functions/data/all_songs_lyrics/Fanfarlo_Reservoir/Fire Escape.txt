Fire Escape LyricsOn the fire escape
We stopped and we looked down
Through the broken glass
On the sirens
On the spires
When you're still midway
It's not too late to just turn back
It's not too late to just turn back
The winter is cruel round here
Future is not down there
Why can't they just think like us?
Why can't they just think like us?
Why can't they just think like us?
If you got flags to wear
You should be careful what you sell
On the fire escape
I think I slipped
I think I fell
But you're still midway
It's not too late to just turn back
It's not too late to just turn back
The winter is cruel round here
Future is not down there
Why can't they just think like us?
Why can't they just think like us?
Why can't they just think like us?
We were raised by strangers
The life that you had in mind
Was just a moth and a light
Was just a moth and a light
Was just a moth and a lightEmbed
