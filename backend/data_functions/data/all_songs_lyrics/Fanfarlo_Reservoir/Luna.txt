Luna LyricsOh they hide it in their beds, they grow it in their sheds
They serve it up in cups from overseas
In the gardens in the trees
And if were kicking up a fuss, its only cause we must
Let the world begin to understand
Begin to understand
And so were running down our street, arms stretched out to the sky
Antennas for the poison and the lies
The delinquency of time
Separated by a wall they had us build and raise
Im waiting for the call I cant wait
Luna, theyre coming down now
And it was always on the cards
Luna, the doors are open
And you will have to start taking sides
Luna, the doors are open
You could not burn faster if you triedEmbed
