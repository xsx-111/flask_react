The Walls Are Coming Down LyricsThey swallowed it whole, they went for the gold, for the gold
We fall for the same lies we all have the same shoes to fit
The preachers and books of your empire will fight here alone
Some day the will be forgotten and die one by one
The walls the walls are coming down
The here and now is coming round
It will some day let you down
The ships the ships are coming in
The great ideas are wearing thin
There is nothing left to do
For atoms have gone as far as atoms will go
Your books write themselves
They line up in row after row
The walls the walls are coming down
The here and now is coming round
It will some day let you down
The ships the ships are coming in
The great ideas are wearing thin
There is nothing left to doEmbed
