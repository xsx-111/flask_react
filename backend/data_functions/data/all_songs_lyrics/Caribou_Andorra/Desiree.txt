Desiree LyricsYou told me things would have changed and now we're back here again
You left me nowhere to start and watch me falling apart
There's nothing left I can say to stop it ending this way
I think you wanted me here to watch it all disappear
Desiree, my mind's made up, desiree, this can't go on
Desiree, my mind's made up, desiree, you know we're not young
Desiree, my mind's made up, desiree, this can't go on
Desiree, my mind's made up, desiree, you know we're not youngEmbed
