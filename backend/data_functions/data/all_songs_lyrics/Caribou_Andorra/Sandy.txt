Sandy LyricsNow I'm divided
Like a flock of birds when excited
And picture circles in the sky
You can't believe me
Like all of the others who leave me
And feel their shapes across the aisle
Twirl things around us
And the shadows they left as they found us
Or running fingers through your hair
It's life that ended and the tracks that they left as they ascended
They'll picture circles in the air
Sometimes in her eyes I see forever
I can't believe what we've found
I know in time we'll be together
And now our love will make this sound
Now I'm divided
Like a flock of birds when excited
And picture circles in the sky
You can't believe me
Like all of the others who leave me
And feel their shapes across the aisle
Sometimes in her eyes I see forever
I can't believe what we've found
I know in time we'll be together
And now our love will make this sound
Sometimes in her eyes I see forever
I can't believe what we've found
I know in time we'll be together
And now our love will make this soundEmbed
