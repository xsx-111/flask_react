Sundialing LyricsOf pictures and of promises, an arrow drawn in time
That's pointing to me standing here with your words on my mind
And every night I dream of you while lying in my bed
And ever since I was a boy, keeps running through my head
(Promises, promises, promises, promises)
And when we meet, my mind is making promises of you
And when you go, I know you know it breaks my heart in twoEmbed
