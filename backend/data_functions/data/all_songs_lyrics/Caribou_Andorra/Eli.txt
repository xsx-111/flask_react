Eli LyricsWhen she opens her eyes she says she feels better
Now she's falling apart and it's all in her mind
And things fall as soon she opens your letter
When she tries who knows what she will find
When she opens her eyes she says she feels better
She'll push you until she can see you unwind
She will tear you apart just as soon as you let her
When she tries who knows what she will find
She will never know
When she takes the time it makes her feel like letting goEmbed
