Melody Day Lyrics
Melody day, what have I done? (aaah)
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
And when you smile it melts away again

Melody day, where have you gone?
All the hope I had has gone away
And what we had has come undone
And when you smile it melts away again

Be there
Be there
Be there
Be there

Melody day, what have I done?
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
And when you smile it melts away again

Tell them, oh
Tell them I always knew why
So long, oh
So long to say goodbye
Be there
Be there
Be there
Be thereEmbed
