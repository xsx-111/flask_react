Niobe LyricsI fall so far, I fall so far
And every moment, everything we used to share (I fall so far)
Will she be waiting when I call, will she be there? (I fall so far)
And every moment, every thought that passes by
Only reminds me of the heart it must have tried
Niobe... Niobe, Niobe
I fall so far, I fall so far
I fall so far, I fall so far
Niobe... Niobe, NiobeEmbed
