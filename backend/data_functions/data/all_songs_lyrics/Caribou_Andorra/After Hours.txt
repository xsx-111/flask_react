After Hours LyricsAnd you and I will follow down the street
And when the rivers end into the sea
While I remember what you mean to me
And you and I, a spiral spinning round
And standing in a circle on the ground
I'll follow you until you wear me out
And in your summer sky and in the air
Have you forgotten how you got us here
While I remember how much I care
And in a dream I'm trying to forget
I feel the blood that rushes to my head
I need your love and all the things you've said
And in the leaves, and in my mind you're always there
And in the leaves, and in my mind you're always there1Embed
