Snake LyricsWalking by the snake
I feel the pull of the animals
Walking by the snake
I feel them pull
I feel the rush
Rush, rush, rush
I feel it
The rush, rush
Time will give
And time will take
Watch out what you wish for
Looking to the brightest light
Tell me why this is
Give me your pieces
One by one
Coins that counted
Downward
Every time I see that silence
Turn to run away
How could you find
What you need to be, uh huh
How could you find
How could you find
What you need to be, uh huh
Going ah na, na, na, na, na
Standing at the railroad station
Looking for the future
Take me to the places
I can't see but I can feel
It sure is a bitch and she will
She will drag you under
Looking for the animal
You hunt down every day
Hey don't give it away now
Hey just give it away
Hey don't give it away now
She's got something bad to say now
Snake
