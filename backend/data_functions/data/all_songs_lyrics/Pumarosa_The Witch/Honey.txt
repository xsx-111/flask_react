Honey Lyrics
God gave us honey
Oh, he gave us honey
God gave us honey
Oh you stupid son of a bitch
Yeah you stupid son of a bitch
Oh you stupid son of a bitch

Events come and go
As waves of a fever
And you tell me stories
Of good and evil
Events come and go
As waves of a fever
And you tell me stories
I want to believe in

Into the wasteland we blindly stray
Wake up your sleeping family
Into the wasteland we blindly stray
Stuck inside this dance forever
Walk in circles all together
Stuck inside this dance forever
Events come and go
As waves of a fever
And you tell me stories
I want to believe in
Events come and go
As waves of a fever
And you tell me stories
Of good and evil

Oh, we go
Through every open door
Always wanting more
Always wanting more, yeah
Oh, we go
Through every open door
Always wanting more
Always wanting more, and more
And more, and more, and more, and more
And more, and more, and more, and more
And more, and more, and more, and more
And more, and more, and more, and moreEmbed
