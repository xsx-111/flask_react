Dragonfly Lyrics
I wear armour to face the day
My second skin now it won't go away
It weighs me down though
Maybe this could be the right time
To shake it loose like a dragonfly
Slide out of mine
If you do too

The more you give
The more you have to lose

Slide out of your skin
And let me in
I'm a dragonfly for you

At the pictures the other day
Watch the credits roll
Tears in your eyes
Oh baby, it's just colour and light
If you could read some of my mind
Would you stay until the last line
Then we could scream our souls into the dark night
Would you open up entire
Like a dragonfly

Slide out of your skin
And let me in
I'm a dragonfly for you
Slide out of your skin
And let me in, let me in
We could be dragonflies, me and youEmbed
