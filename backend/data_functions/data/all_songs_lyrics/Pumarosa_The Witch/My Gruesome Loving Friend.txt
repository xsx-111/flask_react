My Gruesome Loving Friend Lyrics
They keep falling in love with you
Angels and Philistines
Falling in love is true
Prophets and punks, get in line
Shin, shin, shin
Got new blood
You make it look so easy
But hold on, hold on
How I came to know
The way it revolts
My gruesome loving friends
Must take nerves of steel to bend as you bent

Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away

If you find your heart
You know I could hold you, yeah
And even in the dark
We'll find the fault lines
'Cause you inspire all this
In everyone you see
And that includes my love
And that includes me
I'll be the jester
And you'll be the queen
Talking in colours and the lights
Are turning red to green
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it awayEmbed
