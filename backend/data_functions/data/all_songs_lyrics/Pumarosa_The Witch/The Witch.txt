The Witch LyricsSave me from myself, save my mind from my body
Teach me how to love, can you teach me how to be?
Save me from the violence that lives inside of us
Tell me I'm an animal, without you I'd be lost
Without you I'd be lost
You teach me dependency, I'm coming back for more
Sucking on the cigarette even though I'm bored
Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands
'Cause you're a liar, I think I understand
That it's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made you
Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands
'Cause you're a liar, I think I understand
Closing up the curtains now and blocking out the night
Cover me in ashes, yeah, you make me up in white
Paint a pretty face upon the one that's stained with tears
Only she can save you now, you whisper in my ear
But that's no good for me
I don't break easily, yeah
Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands
'Cause you're a liar, I think I understand
Gonna build a fire and warm my monkey hands
'Cause you're a liar, yeah, you are, I think I understand
That it's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made you
It's not human nature, it's what they made youEmbed
