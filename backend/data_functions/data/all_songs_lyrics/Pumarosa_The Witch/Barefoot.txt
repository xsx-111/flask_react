Barefoot LyricsI sit to settle an eye over my eyes
Imagine my surprise
Heaven and Earth have both fade away
After the arguing, there was very little to say
Oh, as the dust came down
Well, I drowned, I drowned
Lying with a slab on a cold city street
Soaking up the rain with the soles of my feet
Now the city feels like a cold, cruel place
When you're down on your luck and it spits in your face
I'm walking barefoot now
On the edge of a knife
I chewed lightly on no man's land
With my high heels on, I keep sinking in the sand
Now I'm buying coffee and I'm drinking some raw
It must go on so tight
I'm running, running, running, running, running, running, running
I'm walking barefoot now
On the edge of a knife
I'm walking barefoot now
On the edge of a knifeEmbed
