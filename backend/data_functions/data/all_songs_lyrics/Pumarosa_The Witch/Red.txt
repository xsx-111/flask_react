Red LyricsThunder in the court yard
I see you and I'm high
Lightening flashes in the night sky
You bring your body and I'll bring wine
I want your body now
What a place of life
London has become
I push at everyone
Now I run from anybody, factory, it pulls me, yeah
Now
Let it be here
Let it be here
Let it be now
Now, now
Now, now, now, nowEmbed
