Amerimacka Lyrics
Miss Liberty turn inna Jezebel
All of the dreams you go sell turn inna hell
Her bed of roses are filled with thorns
Her righteous robes are tattered and torn
If she had only stood for love
That would have been enough
She wouldn't have to hide in her shame
If she had only stood for love
That would have been enough
But now we all burn in her flame

Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful lie
Amerimacka
It's like licking honey off of a knife
Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful sight
Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful lie

The land of the free built on slavery
Her consciousness is in captivity
The promised land is in the lion's den
Your culture of greed has got to end
Now we're laying in the mud
Looking up above
'Til water just a drop from the sky
They try to keep us in the mud
Separating us from love
But me nah go let dem conquer de I
Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful lie
Amerimacka
It's like licking honey off of a knife
Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful sight
Amerimacka
Oh what a beautiful lie

Say Amerimacka, gonna miss Amerimacka-macka
Amerimacka, we've seen the sound of choppa-choppa
Amerimacka, this one is like a tanka-tanka
Say Amerimacka, me know dem are... sing-ah
Say Amerimacka, me know dem are the attacker
Me see the world of them and man that world is shattered-shattered
Say Amerimacka, me see the dreams are shattered
Me look up on the sky and man me see a little altar-altar2Embed
