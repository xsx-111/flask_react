Revolution Solution LyricsOh, I?ve hoped for comfort
But I?ve never felt too safe
And in this hard life
I?ve had to navigate
Through un-exhausted
Has been my virtue
Ooh, I?ve hoped for comfort
But I?ve never felt too safe
And in this hard life
I?ve had to navigate
Through un-exhausted
Has been my virtue
They set themselves against I
They set my pride on fire
Phoenix always rises high
Rebel crusader
Driven to decisions
They trapped me into
The revolution solution
Oh, I?ve come to join you
Oh, I?ve hoped for comfort
But I?ve never felt too safe
And in this hard life
I?ve had to navigate
Through un-exhausted
Has been my virtue
Ooh, I?ve hoped for comfort
But I?ve never felt too safe
And in this hard life
I?ve had to navigate
Through un-exhausted
Has been my virtue
The paradox of poverty
Has left us dismayed
Sliding democracy
Washing away
The toil of the many goes
To the fortunate few
The revolution solution
Oh, I?ve come to join you
The toil of the many goes
To the fortunate few
The revolution solution
Oh, I?ve come to join youEmbed
