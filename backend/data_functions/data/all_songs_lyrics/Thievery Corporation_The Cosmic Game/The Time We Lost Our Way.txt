The Time We Lost Our Way LyricsMy mind is full bursting over
With all these things I can't remember
Every little single memory reminds me of you
My eyes were weary with all these tears
You left your shadow in my dreams
And all my doubts seemed to disappear when you came along
Flowers melting up into the sky
Hear my heart where our love collides
We hear the songs we found in the times we lost our way
Gentle memories replace our tears
All the love we had is still right here
We hear the songs we found in the time we lost our way
From without words can not describe
What caused the stars to fall deep inside
Every little single memory reminds me of you
Our days are gone lost forever
Reflecting light glistening under water
Naturally this could be everything that seems so unreal
Flowers melting up into the sky
Hear my heart where our love collides
We hear the songs we found in the time we lost our way
Gentle memories replace our tears
All the love we had is still right here
We hear the songs we found in the time we lost our way
Flowers melting up into the sky
Hear my heart where our love collides
We hear the songs we found in the time we lost our way
Gentle memories replace our tears
All the love we had is still right here
We hear the songs we found in the time we lost our wayEmbed
