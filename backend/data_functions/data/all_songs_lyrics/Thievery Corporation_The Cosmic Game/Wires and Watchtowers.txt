Wires and Watchtowers LyricsHow can the wicked smile while the world is burning
How can they turn their eyes and walk away
How can the blue bloods hide, while brothers killing brothers
Why do they divide I and I for diamonds and gold
The dreams of children they float to the sky
And wires and watchtowers can't bring their demise
Tell me why oh why are we so blind
The treasures of love lay buried inside
Tell me why oh why do we deny
The chains of Babylon are all in our mind
The murderers clouds can't keep the sun from shining
The wind of Jah will scatter them away
The murderers clouds can't keep the sun from shining
Jah will scatter he who has no shame
The dreams of children they float to the sky
And wires and watchtowers can't bring their demise
Tell me why oh why are we so blind
The treasures of love lay buried inside
Tell me why oh why do we deny
The chains of Babylon are all in our mind
Tell me why oh why are we so blind
The treasures of love lay buried inside
Tell me why oh why do we deny
The chains of Babylon are all in our mindEmbed
