Marching the Hate Machines (Into the Sun) LyricsWell let's start by
Making it clear
Who is the enemy, here
And we'll show them
That it's not them
Who is superior
So let's start by
Making it clear
Who is the enemy, here
And we'll show them
That it's not them
Who is superior
It's gonna be bad
It's gonna be wrong
It's gonna feel good
Marching the hate machines into the sun
Marching the hate machines into the sun
We'll let's start by
Making it clear
Who is the enemy, here
And we'll show them
That it's not them
Who is superior
Marching the hate machines into the sun
Marching the hate machines into the sun
Marching the hate machines into the sun
Marching the hate machines into the sunEmbed
