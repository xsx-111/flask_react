Precious Stones Lyrics
I hope the sun shows the way
Don't crush my spirit today
Reveal your precious stones
So I can help myself

Don't waste your time
Don't let it slip away from you
Don't waste your time
If it's the last thing that you do

I dig through bone and skull
Imagine black emerald
I'm covered head to toe
With diamonds in the rough

Don't waste your time
Don't let it slip away from you
Don't waste your time
If it's the last thing that you do

These snakes have nothing to say
I want their heads right away
I sharpen every blade
And I give them all to you
Yeah, I give them all to you
You're in my head
You're in my head againEmbed
