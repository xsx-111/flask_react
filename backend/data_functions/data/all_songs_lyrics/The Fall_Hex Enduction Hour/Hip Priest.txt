Hip Priest Lyrics
He's not appreciated
He's not appreciated
He's not appreciated

Drink the long draught, Dan
For the Hip Priest
I said drink the long draught, Dan
For the Hip Priest!
He's not appreciated
He's not appreciated
White collar hits motorway services
It's the Hip Priest
From the eyes he can see, they know
It's the Hip Priest
He's not appreciated
It's purple psychology
Not just an old lady's
That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest
That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest

And he's gonna make an appearance
He's gonna make an appearance
Was shown in a freakshow early on
And drunk from small brown bottles since I was so long
Cause I'm a Hip Priest
Cause I'm a Hip Priest
People only need me when they're down and gone to seed
Cause I'm a Hip Priest
Cause I'm a Hip Priest
It's appreciation half won
And they hate their allegiance to hip preacher one
Hip Priest
I got my last clean dirty shirt outta the wardrobe
I got my last clean dirty shirt outta the wardrobe
And all the good people know
That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest
All the young groups know
All the young groups know
They can't ever take advantage because I'm a Hip Priest
I was as clean as a packet of chocolate chips
That's hip hip hip hip hit hit hit Hip Priest
And if the good people knew they would say

He's not appreciated
He's not appreciated
So drink the long draught, Dan
For the Hip PriestEmbed
