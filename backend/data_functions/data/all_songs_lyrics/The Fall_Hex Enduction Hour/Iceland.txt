Iceland Lyrics
A plate steel object was fired
And I did not feel for my compatriots
Hated even the core of myself
Not a matter of ill-health
It was fear of weakness deep in core of myself
The fact attainment was out of
[Mounting orations
What generations
Dumb populations
What emulations]

To be humbled in Iceland
Sing of legend, sing of destruction
Witness the last of the god-men
Hear about Megas Jonsson
Cast the runes against your own soul
There is not much more time to go
Work fifteen hours for the good of the soul

And be humbled in Iceland
Sit in the gold room
Fall down flat in the Cafe aisle
Without a glance from the clientele
Your coffee black as well
Hair blond as hell
Cast the runes against your own soul
Roll up for the underpants show
And be humbled in Iceland
And the spawn of the volcano
Is thick and impatient
Like the people around it
See a green goblin redhead, redhead
Make a grab for the book of prayers
Do anything for a bit of attention

Get humbled in Iceland
What the goddamn fuck is it?
That played the pipes of aluminum
A Memorex for the Krakens
That induces this rough text
And casts the runes against the self-soul
And humbles in Iceland2Embed
