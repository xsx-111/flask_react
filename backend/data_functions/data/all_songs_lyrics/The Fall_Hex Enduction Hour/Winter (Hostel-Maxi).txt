Winter (Hostel-Maxi) Lyrics
Entrances uncovered
Street signs you never saw
All entrances delivered
Courtesy winter

You got Manny in the library
Working off his hangover 3:30
You get the spleen at 3:15
But it's 3:13
The mad kid walked left-side south-side towards me
He was about 7
His mother was a cleaning lady
She had a large black dog
And the mad kid said:
"Gimme the lead
Gimme the lead
Gimme the lead"
I'd just walked past the alcoholics' dry-out house
The lawn was littered with cans of Barbican
There was a feminist's Austin Maxi parked outside
With anti-nicotine anti-nuclear stickers on the side
...on the inside and they didn't even smoke...
Anyway two weeks before the mad kid had said to me
"I'll take both of you on
I'll take both of you on"
Then he seemed the young one
He had a parka on and a black cardboard Archbishop's hat
With a green-fuzz skull and crossbones
He'd just got back from the backward kids' party
Anyway then he seemed the young one
But now he looked like the victim of a pogrom
Entrances uncovered
Street signs you never saw
All entrances delivered
