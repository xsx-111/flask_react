And This Day Lyrics
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
And this day
No matter what and never or who fills baskets or who's just there
You show me the bloody poor bores
You show me the bloody poor bores
And this day
And this day
The surroundings are screaming on the roads
The surroundings are screaming on the roads
So you even mistrust your own feelings
And this day
And this day
And this day
No matter what and never or who throws baskets or who's just there
The whole Earth shudders
And this day
And this day
Everywhere just no fucking respite for us here, John Kidder
And this day
Who are the translators?
And this day
You even mistrust your own feelings
And the greyer B1 glandule area
The few days I have off are just a bank of fog
And this day
And this day
Seen from a glass bottom phutt cig
And this day
The old feelings came back
Everywhere just no fucking respite for us here, Jim Kidder
And this day
Your friends-
And this day
The whole Earth shudders
The surroundings are screaming on the roads
You even mistrust your own feelings
And this day
The old feelings came back
Big basket full s'-park s'-mart
And this day
The old feelings came back
Everywhere just no fucking respite for us here, John Kidder

And this day
And this day
No matter what and never or who fills baskets or who's just there
Who are the translators?
Who are the translators?
The body's like a U.S. football players
Blades make presence felt
Worked 3 weeks nearly full solid
And this day
And this day
My shoulder feels like it's got a socket and-
It will soon heal up
And this day
The old feelings came back
Everywhere no fucking respite for us here, John Kidder
 your friends are-
And this day
The whole Earth shudders
The surroundings are screaming on the roads
The surroundings are screaming on the roads
You even mistrust your own feelings
And the greyer B1 glandule area
Who are the translators?
Who are the translators?

And this day
The old feelings came back
Big fat- s'-plug s'-mart organic brain slug
And this day
And this day
And this day
And this day
And this day
And this day
And this day
And this day
And this day
And this day
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere just no fucking respite for us here John KidderEmbed
