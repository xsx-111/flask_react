Mere Pseud Mag. Ed. Lyrics
His heart organ was where it should be
His brain was in his arse
His hand was well out of his pocket
His psyche's in the hearth
Had a beard which was weird
Some time ago heard Ramones in '81
Has a Spanish guitar
Real ale, curry as well - sophisticate!
Spanish guitar doesn't get far
In computer teaching job
His dreamgirl sings adverts for the Weetabix
A fancied wit that's imitation of Rumpole of Bailey
Who's causes and rags were phoenix-like
They were do-do like
They were comfort blanket type
Pho-do in fact (4x)
He had a weak pisser
And one night at darts match
Decadent sandwich quaff
He showed he was a big fan of double-entendre
Saw Not the Nine O'Clock News History of the World Part One
Twice each at least (3x)
