The Classical Lyrics
There is no culture is my brag
Your taste for bullshit reveals a lust for a home of office
This is the home of the vain!
This is the home of the vain!
Where are the obligatory niggers?
Hey there fuckface!
Hey there fuckface!
There are twelve people in the world
The rest are paste
This is the home of the vain!
This is the home of the vain!

I just left the Hotel Amnesia
I had to go there
Where it is I can't remember
But now I can remember, now I can remember
Hafta! Hafta!
Message for yer! Message for yer!
Too much reliance on girl here
On girls here, behind every shell-actor
Snobbier Snobbier
Too much romantic here
I destroy romantics, actors
Kill it!
Kill it!
Kill it a!
Kill it!
Kill it a!
You won't find anything more ridiculous than this new profile razor unit
Made with the highest British attention to the wrong detail
Become obsolete units surrounded by hail
The Classical!
The Classical!
The Classical!
Hotel Aggro!
Message for yer! Message for yer!
The Classical!
Parallax!
One of the millenium of conspiracy
Forever
I know it means a lot of stomach gas
I know it means alot of stomach gas
I've never felt better in my life
I've never felt better in my life

Parallax!
The Classical!
Stomach gas

I've never felt better in my life
I've never felt better in my life

Parallax!
Millenium of conspiracy
Play out Classical

I've never felt better in my life
Better in my lifeEmbed
