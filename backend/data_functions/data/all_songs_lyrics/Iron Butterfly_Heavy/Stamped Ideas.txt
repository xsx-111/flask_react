Stamped Ideas LyricsStay away from people made from plastic in a mold
And keep your stamped ideas inside your head untold
Because I, I, I, baby am protecting you
Yes, against the kind of things that other people do
I, baby, am protecting you 'cause I'm in love with you
So come on baby!
Stay away from people made from plastic in a mold
And keep your stamped ideas inside your head untold
Because I, I, I, baby am protecting you
Yes, against the kind of things that other people do
I, baby, am protecting you 'cause I'm in love with you
So come on baby!Embed
