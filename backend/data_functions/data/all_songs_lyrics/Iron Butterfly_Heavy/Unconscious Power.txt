Unconscious Power LyricsWe all want to prepare you
The unbelievable is going to happen
It will linger in your mind forever
Let this carry you wherever - wherever
Triggering the unconscious power
Removing all your inhibitions
Releasing complete freedom of thought
Sensations of ev'ry sense will prevail
With this you will see ev'ry thing
Triggering the unconscious power
Triggering the unconscious power
I say to you
Nothin' for now
For now!
We know all
We know all
We know all
We know all!Embed
