Look for the Sun LyricsDeLoach-Ingle-Weis
Sunshine keeps the light time from bringing down the sad sad times
Mmm, that sunshine brings brightness to you
Oh, when you are blue, there's that sunshine made especially for you
When you're down, look up from the ground
Look, look up from the ground
Look, look for that sound
Sunshine keeps the light time from bringing back the sad sad times
Mmm, that sunshine brings brightness to youEmbed
