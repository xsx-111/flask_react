Gentle as It May Seem LyricsGentle as it may seem
You lose her in a dream
You Gotta learn how to scheme
Or man you've lost the scene
Come here woman
There's a girl for every guy
You can get one if you try
It's not your fault my friend
If you lose her in the end
Come here woman
Gentle as it may seem
You lose her in a dream
You Gotta learn how to scheme
Or man you've lost the scene
Come here woman
There's a girl for every guy
You can get one if you try
It's not your fault my friend
If you lose her in the endEmbed
