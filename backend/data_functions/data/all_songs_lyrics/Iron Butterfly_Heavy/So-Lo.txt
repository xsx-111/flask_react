So-Lo Lyrics
Have you heard about the word that's goin' round?
(Goin' round, goin' round)
Have you heard about the girl who put me down?
(Put me down, put me down)
Well, she became aware the fact that I was runnin' 'round
(Runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round)
And consequently, my behavior put me down
(Put me down, put me down)

Have you heard about the word that's goin' round?
(Goin' round, goin' round)
Have you heard about the girl who put me down?
(Put me down, put me down)
Well, she became aware the fact that I was runnin' 'round
(Runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round)
And consequently, my behavior put me down
(Put me down, put me down)Embed
