Your Daddy Hates Me LyricsI know your daddy hates me
And I got a room in hell reserved
I know he wants to kill me
And it's the least that I deserve
But I always loved his daughter
That's something that I know you know
Just sometimes don't do what I oughta
Sometimes I yes when I should no
I know your daddy hates me
And I drink more than a whale
But my failures ain't for lack of trying
It's just a little too late now to prevail
But you always knew I was a screw up
Long before I screwed us up
You said it endeared you to me
But in the end you just gave up
And I always loved your daddy
I loved your mama even more
And I always loved their daughter
That's for sure
I know your daddy hates me
I know I probably hate me too
But I also know you don't hate me
Even though you probably like to and ought to
And it's a little too late for writing love songs
But I never did anything on time
Happiness for your big adventure
See you, darling, down the line
And I always loved your daddy
I loved your mama even more
And you always was the apple of my eyes
That's for sure
And I always loved your daddy
I loved your mama even more
And I always loved you, darling
That's for sureEmbed
