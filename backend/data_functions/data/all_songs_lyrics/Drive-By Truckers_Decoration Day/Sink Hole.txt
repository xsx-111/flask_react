Sink Hole LyricsI've always been a religious man
I've always been a religious man
But I met the banker and it felt like sin
He turned my bailout down
The banker man lit into me
Lit into me, lit into me
The banker man lit into me
And spread my name around
He thinks I ain't got a lick of sense
'Cause I talk slow and my money's spent
I ain't the type to hold it against
But he better stay off my farm
'Cause it was my daddy's and his daddy's before
And his daddy's before and his daddy's before
Five generations of an unlocked door
And a loaded burglar alarm
Lots of pictures of my purdy family
Lots of pictures of my purdy family
Lots of pictures of my purdy family
In the house where we was born
House has stood through five tornadoes
Droughts and floods and five tornadoes
I'd rather wrastle an alligator
Than to face the banker's scorn
'Cause he won't even look me in the eye
He just takes my land and apologize
With pen, paper and a friendly smile
He says the deed is done
The sound you hear is my daddy spinning
The sound you hear is my daddy spinning
The sound you hear is my daddy spinning
Over what the banker done
Like to invite him for some pot roast beef
And mashed potatoes and sweet tea
Follow it up with some 'nana pudding
And a walk around the farm
Show him the view from McGee Town Hill
Let him stand in my place and see how it feels
To lose the last thing on earth that's real
I'd rather lose my legs and arms
Bury his body in the old sink hole
Bury his body in the old sink hole
Bury his body in the old sink hole
Under cold November skies
Then damned if I wouldn't go to church on Sunday
Damned if I wouldn't go to church on Sunday
Damned if I wouldn't go to church on Sunday
Look the preacher in the eye, ahEmbed
