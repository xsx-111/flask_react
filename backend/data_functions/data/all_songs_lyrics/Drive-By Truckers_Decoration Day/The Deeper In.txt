The Deeper In LyricsBy the time you were born there were four other siblings
With your mama awaiting your daddy in jail
And your oldest brother was away at a home
And you didn't meet him till you were nineteen years old
Old enough to know better, old enough to know better
But you took to his jawline and long sandy hair
And he made you feel like none of the others
And the way he looked at you touched you deep down in there
So you jumped on his bike and rolled into the sunset
But the sequel it started with the next morning sun
And the dew on the bike seat and you all aglow
From the love he put in you and a life on the run
So you moved to a small town, then to another
Then to another with another on its way
And you both swore to God you would keep it together
And the state wouldn't take your babies away
Now the District Attorney said he might have forgiven
You had lots of reasons to turn out this way
But you'll both go to jail for them four little babies
You made and delivered along the way
Last night you had a dream of a Lord so forgiving
He might show compassion for a heathen He damned
You awoke in a jail cell, alone and so lonely
