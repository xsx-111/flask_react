Heathens LyricsSomething 'bout the wrinkle in your forehead
Tells me there's a fit 'bout to get thrown
If we get the van out of the ditch before morning
Ain't nobody gotta know 'bout what I done
And I never hear a single word you say
When you tell me not to have my fun
It's the same old shit that I ain't gonna take off anyone
And I don't need to be forgiven
By them people in the neighborhood
When we first hooked up, you looked me in the eye
You said "Paw, we just ain't no good."
We were heathens in their eyes at the time
I guess I am just a heathen still
And I never have repented for the wrongs you say I've done
I done what I feel
It was a difficult delivery
Now he's growing up mean and strong
When you tell me that it's getting just a little bit tight
Ain't the first time I been outgrown
And now I'm gonna push a little harder
She ain't revved till the rods are thrown
And I'll walk away
And I don't need to be forsaken
By you or anybody else
And I never had a shortage of people tryin' to warn me
The dangers I pose to myself
Heathens
And these times can take their toll sometimes
And I know you feel the same way too
It just gets so hard to keep between the ditches
When the roads wind the way they doEmbed
