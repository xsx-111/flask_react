My Sweet Annette LyricsMe and my Annette, we was as fond as we could be
We was set to marry in October '33
I set my sights to courtin' her, as fine as she could be
I never ever noticed her best friend Marilee
Took a job at the saw mill and I bought my girl a ring
Had a pre-wedding party, close friends and family
Everything was fine, eatin' homemade ice cream
I swear I never noticed maid of honor Marilee
And my sweet Annette was left standing at the altar
My sweet Annette was left standing at the altar
Marilee was taken ill, it was several miles from home
Back then it wasn't fittin' for a girl to leave alone
Sweet Annette, she asked me to walk her to the door
As innocent as children back before the war
And my sweet Annette was left standing at the altar
My sweet Annette was left standing at the altar
Lord have mercy for what we done
Lord have mercy when two people get alone
Neither one of us had done anything like that, you see
By the next sunset, I had eloped with Marilee
By the next sunset, I had eloped with Marilee
By the next sunset, I had eloped with Marilee
My sweet Annette was left standing at the altarEmbed
