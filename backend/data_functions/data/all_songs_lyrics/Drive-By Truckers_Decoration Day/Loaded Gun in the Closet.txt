Loaded Gun in the Closet LyricsHe kept a loaded gun in the closet
And another one in the dresser drawer
Just in case the one in the closet
Didn't make a big enough hole
She had his breakfast ready every morning
And his lunch in a box sitting out by the kitchen door
She'd make sure he had everything he needed
And hug his neck and tell him how much she loved him
And it was beautiful
You should have seen it
Then she'd make herself a pot of coffee
Just the way she liked it
And sit down and enjoy the quiet of the house all alone
About two o'clock or so every afternoon
The quiet would start getting to her
And she'd watch the clock until he came back home
And she understood just what he needed
When he came home every evening
Was just a couple of beers and a couple of minutes
To cuss about his day
So she'd fix him a nice hot supper
While he ranted and raved about one thing or the other
And she never once told him
What he was going on about didn't add up to a thing
And she never touched that gun in the closet
It was his and it was there just 'cause he wanted it to be
She didn't get out much
So she never knew what it was that made him so afraid
Most women today would say she was a disgrace
Most men would say she wasn't much to look at
And they'd all say she'd be a lot better off
If she cared a little bit more about what they all think
She could have a life of her own if she had a little pride
Some silicone implants and another man on the side
But she's got a loaded gun in the closet
And it's there anytime she wants it
And her one and only man knows it
And that's why he put it there in the first placeEmbed
