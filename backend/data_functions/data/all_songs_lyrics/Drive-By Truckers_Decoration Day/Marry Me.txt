Marry Me Lyrics
Well, my daddy didn't pull out, but he never apologized
Rock and roll means well, but it can't help tellin' young boys lies
A baby on the way's a good enough reason to get you out alive
Get you out without having to swallow any pride

All my friends are restless, all they do is talk it down
Two or eight lanes, it don't matter, it's just another town
There's a fool on every corner, on every street, in everyone
And I'd rather be your fool nowhere than go somewhere and be no one's

So marry me, sweet thing, won't you marry me?
Your mama thinks I beat anything she's ever seen
Well, this old town's alright with me, there's nowhere I'd rather be
Long as they stay mad at one another, they can't get mad at me

Every time I leave here, something bad happens to me
Like a busted hand or finding some man laying where I sleep
She don't mean nothin' to me, that's just how it goes 'round here
It's a cartoon town, I played my part, and I ain't spoke her name in years

So marry me, sweet thing, won't you marry me?
Your mama thinks I beat anything she's ever seen
Well, this old town's alright with me, there's nowhere I'd rather be
Long as they stay mad at one another, well, they can't get mad at me, let's go
I don't want anything I done to be nobody's fault
Even if they got more money and mouth than they got balls
That's just how it went down, right or wrong, it's just that way
And just 'cause I don't run my mouth don't mean I got nothing to say

So marry me, sweet thing, won't you marry me?
Your momma thinks I beat anything she's ever seen
This old town's alright with me, there's nowhere I'd rather be
Long as they stay mad at one another, they can't get mad at me

So marry me, sweet thing, won't you marry me?
Marry me, sweet thing, won't you marry me?Embed
