Careless LyricsBe careful that you don't
Use up your ninth one
We all were careless once
We all were careless once
It can't be too much fun
Just going 'round once
It all can slip away
One banana peel away
You left this big ole void
Sure miss your sweet voice
Gone into the void
We all were careless once
We all were careless once
We all were careless once
We all were careless once
We all were careless onceEmbed
