When the Pin Hits the Shell Lyrics
You can lie to your mama, you can lie to your race
But you can't lie to nobody with that cold steel in your face
And the same God you were so afraid was gonna send you to Hell
Is the same one you're gonna answer to when the pin hits the shell

Well, your sister's been blamin' everybody
And I don't blame her, man, I guess I'd do the same
If you were my brother, man, I'd prob'ly stand by you
But you ain't, man, so I got to go my way

And I ain't gonna crawl up on no high horse
'Cause I got thrown off of one
When I was young, and I ain't no cowboy
So I ain't going where I don't belong
It wouldn't do you no good to let you know
That it damn near killed me too
So I ain't gonna mourn for you, man
Now that you're gone

Me and you, we liked our pills and our whiskey
But you don't want your head full of either one when the house gets quiet and dark
Feeling good, it used to come so damn easy
Racing trains from Second Street to Avalon
Take a trip down memory lane
You don't see no friendly faces
All the houses have been painted
And nobody knows your name
It's enough to make a man
Not want to be nobody's daddy
When all he thinks he's got left to hand down
Is guilt and shame

And I ain't gonna crawl up on no high horse
'Cause I got thrown off of one
When I was young, and I ain't no cowboy
So I ain't going where I don't belong
It wouldn't do you no good to let you know
That it damn near killed me too
So I ain't gonna mourn for you, man
Now that you're gone

You can lie to your mama, you can lie to your race
But you can't lie to nobody with that cold steel in your face
And the same God you were so afraid was gonna send you to Hell
Is the same one you're gonna answer to when the pin hits the shellEmbed
