Decoration Day LyricsIt's Decoration Day
And I've a mind to roll a stone on his grave
But what would he say?
"Keepin' me down, boy, won't keep you away."
It's Decoration Day
And I knew the Hill boys would put him away
But my Daddy wasn't afraid
He said we'd fight till the last Lawson's last living day
I never knew how it all got started
A problem with Hollan before we were born
And I don't know the name of the boy we tied down
And beat till he just couldn't walk anymore
But I know the caliber in Daddy's chest
I know what Hollan Hill drives
The state let him go, but I guess it was best
'Cause nobody needs all us Lawsons alive
Daddy said one of the boys had come by
The lumberman's favorite son
He said "Beat him real good, but don't dare let him die
And if you see Hollan Hill, run."
Well I said, "They ain't give us trouble before
That we ain't brought down on ourselves."
But a chain on my back and my ear to the floor
And I'll send all the Hill boys to hell
I'll send all the Hill boys to hell
It's Decoration Day
And I got a family in Mobile Bay
And they've never seen my daddy's grave
But that don't bother me, it ain't marked anyway
'Cause I got dead brothers in Lauderdale South
And I got dead brothers in East Tennessee
When my daddy got shot right in front of his house
He had no one to fall on but me
It's Decoration Day
And I've a mind to go spit on his grave
If I was a Hill I'd have put him away
And I'd fight till the last Lawson's last living day
I'd fight till the last Lawson's last living day
I'd fight till the last Lawson's last living day3Embed
