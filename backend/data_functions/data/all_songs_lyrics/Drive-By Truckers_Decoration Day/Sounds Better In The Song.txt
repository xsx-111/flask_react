Sounds Better In The Song LyricsWhen I saw her standing there
With her bright eyes and shining hair
She was looking back at me
Some are meant to sing
Some are meant to talk
And some aren't meant to say a thing
But when she opened up her mouth
And that sweet voice came out
I lost track of my own name
Now she's found herself, and I lost mine
And I'm just another guy
Who can't give her anything
Well the drifter, he holds on to his youth just like
It was money in the bank
And "Lord knows, I can't change" sounds better in the song
Than it does with hell to pay
I might as well have slipped that ring on her finger
From a window of a van as it drove away
'Cause now she's found herself, and I lost mine
And I'm just another guy
Who can't give her anything
Well, dreams are given to you
When you're young enough to dream them
Before they can do you any harm
They don't start to hurt
Unless you try to hold on to 'em
After seeing what they really are
She used to dream 'em with me, every single crazy one
Till they started hurting her too
Now she's got some of her own
And outgrowing me might be the best thing for her
She's ever done
A light that's meant to shine as bright as hers
Can't be kept in the shadows for too long
A heart that wants to live
And a soul that wants to give
Can't just sit at home alone
Lord, she gave me everything
I never wanted anything
I couldn't give just what was inside of me
And now she's found herself, and I lost mine
And I'm just another guy
Who can't give her anything
Now she's found herself, and I lost mine
And I'm just another guy
Who can't give her anythingEmbed
