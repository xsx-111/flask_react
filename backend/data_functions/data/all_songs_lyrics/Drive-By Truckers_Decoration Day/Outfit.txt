Outfit Lyrics
You wanna grow up to paint houses like me
A trailer in my yard till you're twenty-three
You wanna feel old after forty-two years
Keep dropping the hammer and grinding the gears
Well, I used to go out in a Mustang
A 302 Mach One in green
Me and your mama made you in the back
And I sold it to buy her a ring
And I learned not to say much of nothing
So I figured you already know
But in case you don't or maybe forgot
I'll lay it out real nice and slow

Don't call what you're wearing an outfit
Don't ever say your car is broke
Don't worry about losing your accent
A Southern man tells better jokes
Have fun, but stay clear of the needle
Call home on your sister's birthday
Don’t tell 'em you're bigger than Jesus, don't give it away
Don't give it away
Five years in a St. Florian foundry
They call it Industrial Park
Then hospital maintenance and Tech School
Just to memorize Frigidaire parts
But I got to missing your mama
And I got to missing you too
And I went back to painting for my old man
And I guess that's what I'll always do
So don't let 'em take who you are, boy
And don’t try to be who you ain't
And don't let me catch you in Kendale
With a bucket of a wealthy man's paint

Don't call what you're wearing an outfit
Don't ever say your car is broke
Don't sing with a fake British accent
Don't act like your family's a joke
Have fun, and stay clear of the needle
Call home on your sister's birthday
Don't tell them you’re bigger than Jesus, don't give it away
Don't give it away1Embed
