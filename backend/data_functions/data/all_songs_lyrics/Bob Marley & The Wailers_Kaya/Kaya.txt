Kaya Lyrics
Wake up and...
Wake up and...
Wake up and turn I loose
For the rain is falling

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

I'm so high, I even touch the sky
Above the falling rain
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so
Here I come again

Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

I'm so high, I even touch the sky
Above the falling rain
I feel so good in my neighbourhood, so
Here I come again
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is falling

Get up and turn I loose
Wake up and turn I loose
Wake up and turn I loose
For the rain is falling
Kaya man, kaya man
Got to have kaya now
For the rain is, rain is falling
Wake up and turn I loose
Wake up and turn I loose3Embed
