Is This Love Lyrics

I wanna love you
And treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread

Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
I wanna know - wanna know - wanna know now
I got to know - got to know - got to know now
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I - I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table

I wanna love you - I wanna love and treat
Love and treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night
We'll be together, yeah!
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, yeah, oh yeah
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provides the bread
Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Is this love - is this love - is this love
Is this love that I'm feeling?
Wo-o-o-oah!
Oh yes, I know; yes, I know - yes, I know now
Oh yes, I know; yes, I know - yes, I know now
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I - I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table

See, I wanna love you - I wanna love and treat you
Love and treat you right
I wanna love you
Every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
Jah provides the bread

We'll share the shelter
Of my single bed
We'll share the same room...36Embed
