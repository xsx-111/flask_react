Time Will Tell Lyrics
Jah would never give the power to a bald head
Run come crucify the Dread

Time alone - oh, time will tell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Time alone - oh, time will tell
You think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Back them up, not the brothers
But the ones who sets them up


Mmm, sold my freedom 'round the world
Sold man to the ground
Sold man, took a man pride
Oh, children, weep no more
Oh, my sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree
Saw you settle the score
Oh, children, weep no more
