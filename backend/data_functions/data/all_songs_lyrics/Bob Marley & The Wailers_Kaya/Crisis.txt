Crisis Lyrics
They say the sun shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all. Mm-mm-mm
They say love is a stream that will find its course
I mean some people think life is a dream
So they making matters worse

But no matter what the crisis is
No matter what the crisis is
Doing it, doing it, doing your thing
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Giving it, giving it, giving it, giving it
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)

So - so - so much have been said, so little (been done) a little been done
They still killing - killing the people
And they - and they having (having their fun) - having-a - having-a lots of fun
Killing the people, oo-yoo! - (having fun) having their fun!
They just want to be the leader
In the house of the rising sun

But no matter what the crisis is
Oh, no, oh, no no - (no what the crisis is) no what the crisis is
Do your - live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up! (Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up! (Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
They say the sun shines for all
But in some people world, it never shine at all. (Mm-mm-mm)
They say love is a stream that will find its course (Never ever)
Some people think life is a dream
So they, so they making matters worse (making matters worse)

No matter what the crisis is
No matter what the crisis is
Do it
Do your - live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up! (Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up! (Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)Embed
