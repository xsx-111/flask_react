Running Away Lyrics
You running and you running
And you running away
But you can't run away from yourself

You must have done (must have done)
Something wrong (something wrong)
Said: you must have done (must have done)
Wo! Something wrong (something wrong)
Why you can't find the
Place where you belong?

Every man thinking his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
Every man thinking his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
You still mean it: Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord

Yeah-eah-eah-eah - from yourself
Brr - you must have done something
Something - something - something
Something you don't want nobody to know about
You must have, Lord - something wrong
What you must have done - you must have done something wrong
Why you can't find where you belong?

Well, well, well, well, ya running away, heh, no -
You running away, ooh, no, no, no
I am not (running away), no, don't say that - don't say that
Because (running away) I am not running away, ooh! (running away)
I have got to protect my life, (running away)
And I don't want to live with no strife. (running away)
It is better to live on the housetop (running away)
Than to live in a house full of confusion. (running away)
So, I made my decision and I left you (running away)
Now you coming to tell me (running away)
That I'm running away (running away)
But it's not true (running away)
I am not running away (running away)1Embed
