Misty Morning Lyrics
Misty morning, don't see no sun
I know you are out there somewhere having fun
There is one mystery - yea-ea-eah - I just can't express
To give your more, to receive your less
One of my good friend said, in a reggae riddim
"Don't jump in the water, if you can't swim

The power of philosophy - yea-ea-eah - floats through my head
Light like a feather, heavy as lead
Light like a feather, heavy as lead, yeah

See no sun! Oh
Time has come, I want you
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow! Uh
I want - I want - I want you - (tomorrow)
Oh, wo-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I want you to straighten out my (tomorrow)

"You can't jump - you can't jump in the water, if you can't swim

I want you (I want you) - I want you to straighten out my today
My tomorrow - my-my-my - my - my
(I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
On a misty morning! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)1Embed
