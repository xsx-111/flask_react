Foreign 2 Lyrics
Well see I never even stretched her faith
This storm would not allow it
As you observe it falls out of place
The time was born around it
I know it calls when you’re bare
Stripped from the mould
Well I stare sometimes and it tears away
With your soul
You may be foreign here, but I was foreign there
By suffering here in sovereign fear
You may be foreign here, but I was foreign there
But suffering here

Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride

Now watch me burn alive as your thoughts deprive
All I know that’s inside
See I was torn by a skunks hand
And now they watch me crawl
See I was born by a young man
And now I’ve lost it all
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride
Isolated heritage
This path was never relative
I watch the way you meddle with
Exhibiting my pride5Embed
