Will I Come LyricsI just want you to know, I just want you to know,I just want you to know.....

Well, if only
I had a heart to rip into
Because you owe me
A breakdown that would not include
Not to stay around
And see this night through
Girl, don't stay around
And bathe with me in blue
Just one of those things
Just one of those things
So i let you know
I just want you to know, I just want you to know,I just want you to know.....

"In God’s name think what you’re doing"
"No! Jesus Christ! Oh my God!? No, no dear God, no, Christ!"4Embed
