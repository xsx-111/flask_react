Out Getting Ribs Lyrics
And hate runs through my blood
Well, my tongue was in love
But my heart was left above
I've got to be leaving now
I thought I'd never be shot down
But, girl, I'm black and blue
So beaten down for you
Well, I'm beaten down and blue

Don't break away
I waste away
Don't break away

And lay me out across the grey
Hours I should have kept at bay
Well, I had no chance to get away
I can't escape my own escape
Even more when it's sweet to the taste
Red stairs lead sense astray
I look up and seek for faith
Oh, but girl, just lean over and say
Well lay me down
Pull me out
Well, take my crown again
He's submerged in doubt
But wait, I make my last request
See, this could be the best
But, blue, I need to rest
See, I been broken down
So much has lost it now
I just stop and say
Girl, don't you worry â€˜bout a thing
