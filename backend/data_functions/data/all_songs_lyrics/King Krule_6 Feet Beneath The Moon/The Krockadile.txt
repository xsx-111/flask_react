The Krockadile LyricsSee my eyes can't see clear
Cause their coated in fear
Shut down the left hemisphere
And it sent me here to abort
My intentions of thought
Or of thoughtful cause are no more and no less
See over there
There’s a storm in the west
Before it gets the best of me
This stress will be eased if you undress
But I think no less of your soul
See how it grows cold
I need to evoke before I lose control
Of my emotions
I don't want you to see
Soul drown in the ocean
With my body is spread across the city
You see these eyes
Can’t see my eyes
You see these eyes
Can’t see my eyes
You see these eyes
Girl I can’t see my eyes
Are they open wide
Or shut dead tight
I know you are all fake
Cause man I'm the same
Well burn at me at the stake
Are you content with this game?
Are you content with what you've made?
And when there was days of dark
Were you witness when I was torn apart
By my own hands and my own heart?
Let me tell you girl
There’s no room to leave a mark
See it’s all just fine if you think it’s okay
When in actual fact you think it’s great
What can I say?
What’s there to say?
Well you're brave
So bring the wet wipes I brought the star signs
And we knew that tonight would be just fine
This ain't a sign if you think it’s okay
It’s just divine, but what can I say?
Well you're brave
So bring the wet wipes I brought the star signs
And we knew that tonight would be just fine
I can’t see my eyes
This is no vice
This is no vice
Can’t see my eyes
It’s what was advised
By the love of my life
Bathed in the core of strife
And it was born inside
My urge to purge is so bold
I need the warmth of a brother to hold
I need the warmth of your mother to hold me down
So hold me down
Can you hear that sound?
It came from six feet beneath this ground
Let me lay here
Girl let me lay here
For a little while I’ll obey fear with style
You see these eyes
Man they sense the light
That could be near
Can’t see my eyes
Can’t see my eyes5Embed
