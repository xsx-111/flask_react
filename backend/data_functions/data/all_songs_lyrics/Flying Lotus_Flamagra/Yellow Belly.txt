Yellow Belly Lyrics
Damn
Ahh!
Hey, darlin'
Baby, are you there?
Hey, darlin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

My shoe is untied
He said I'm trippin' (Trippin', trippin')
My shoes are untied
He says I'm trippin' (Trippin', trippin')
My shoes are untied
Yeah, I go trippin' (Over my words)
My shoes are untied
My shoes are untied

Are you a spy, mister?
Are you a spy, mister?
You lookin' fly, mister
I can see it in your eye, mister
I'm a firm believer, Bible reader, very eager brain feeder
Heard you need a visa, don't desert your leaders
Rare like a purple beetle, I'm Teresa, nice to meet ya
Bye Felicia, diarrhea, I'ma die just like Aaliyah
In the sky, I'm so high, everyone looks up to me
You a virgin, you could not compete (I put my titties in his face)
(Titties in his face)
(He's got titties in his face)
Titties in his face
(I've got to mob him)
(Problem, where are the condoms?)
(Condoms, where all the condoms?)
(Condoms, we've got a problem, problem)

Are you a spy, mister?
Are you a spy, mister?
You lookin' fly, mister
I can see it in your eye, mister1Embed
