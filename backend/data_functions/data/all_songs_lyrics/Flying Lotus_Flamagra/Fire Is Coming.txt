Fire Is Coming Lyrics
The yellow phone on the wall started ringing. Tommy jumped, then ran across the kitchen and picked up the receiver. "Hello?" he said, a little out of breath. Tommy's father was downstairs in the basement wood shop cutting a piece of clear pine on the table saw. The sound of the saw was screechingly loud, and a big plume of agitated sawdust was forming in the air. Tommy's mother was outside on the front lawn tending to a small flower garden. She was visibly upset about her flowers' condition. She was observing a black film on the stems and leaves, then trying to wipe this black substance away while running hose water on it, but it was too greasy, and the water wasn't washing it away. The front door opened and Tommy appeared behind his mother. "Mom, there's a phone call for you." Tommy's mom stood up and turned, the garden hose in her right hand shooting water. "Who is it?" she asked. "I don't know. It's a man. He said you would know what it's about." Tommy's mom stood frozen for a moment, and Tommy saw lines of worry racing across her face. Something else scrambled into Tommy's awareness. He saw that the sky was noticeably darker than usual, and he saw a huge, red-orange glow moving on the horizon. Just then, a man appeared running frantically in the street, the man yelling, "Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming! Fire is coming!"

There's a fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move your feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move your feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet
Fire burning in the streets
Everybody move their feet1Embed
