Burning Down the House LyricsBehind your back, not exactly like you think
No, some things, there are things that I can see
(But I know something that they don't know)
I know something that they don’t know, that I can see
I know something that they don't know, and I can see it
I know something that they don't know, and I can see it
Burning up the charts (Blown up)
Blow down me, baby (Blow dry me, baby)
Want me to be cool, but I’m not (Light)
But the fire won't stop burning
Now help yourself (Now help yourself)
I know something that they don't know
Better watch your step
I know something that they don't know
Ooh, burning down the house (Fire)
Call your firemen (Burning)
They'll all be choking from all the smoke
The fire won't stop burning
Now collect yourself
I know something that they don't know
I know something that they don't know, say
I know something that they don’t know, and I can see it
Should I be doing this?
I should not be doing this
Ow, I’m burning
I should not be doing this
I know better than this
Ow, I'm on fire
(The fire won’t stop burning)
Burning, burning
Burning down the house
(I know something that they don't know)
Blow dry me, baby
(I know something that they don't know)
Wanted to be cool, but I'm not
(I know something that they don’t know)
Hot
(I know something that they don't know)
Burning up the charts
(Yeah, I know something that they don't know)
Want me to be cool, but I'm not
(Yeah, I know something that they don't know)
You need a fan (I know)
(You really need a fan)
You really need a fanEmbed
