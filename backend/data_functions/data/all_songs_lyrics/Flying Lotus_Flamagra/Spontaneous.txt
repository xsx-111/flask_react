Spontaneous Lyrics
If I go crazy
Don't save me
Well, baby
Just mix up a potion for two

Don’t you wanna test my love?
Don't you wanna test my love?
Don't you?
Don’t you wanna rest, my love?
Don't you wanna rest, my love?
Don't you, love?

Catch the wind, come with birds
Catchin' feelings, lost my words with you
Catch a flame, catch a night
Catch a feelin', catch a ride with you

Sippin' on midnight
It tastes like nostalgia
It tastes like a full-set gaze
Or Purple Haze with you
Don't you wanna test my love?
Don't you wanna test my love?
Don’t you wanna rest, my love?
Don’t you wanna rest, my love?
Don't you, love?

Catch the wind, come with birds
Catchin’ feelings, lost my words with you
Catch a flame, catch a night
Catch a feelin', catch a ride with you1Embed
