Heroes LyricsWe are now joined together again
In the space that you've created
The world has changed
And so have you
You're different now
You're different now
The time of heroes has come again
I want to become stronger so I can bring true peace to our universe
On behalf of my family
I wanna be Super-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan
Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Su-Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan
You mean that transformation you and your friend performed earlier?
Yes, that's the one
What are you waiting for, kid? A hand-written invitation?2Embed
