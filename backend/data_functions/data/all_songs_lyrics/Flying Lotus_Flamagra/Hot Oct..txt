Hot Oct. Lyrics
Oh yes, I know, I know
All the things we think we know but can't explain
Can't think of anything to turn away
No way, today
And when it all burns in the wake of October
It's the month when everything can be over, and all turns to dust
When the night comes, think October

And now, the dreams will carry you beyond the flame
We embrace the beauty of the infinite
But the fire, the fire never dies
The fire never dies, the fire never dies
