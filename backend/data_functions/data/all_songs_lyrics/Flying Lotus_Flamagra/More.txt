(Oh yeah)
Oh, where'd you get the thing from? (Thief and beggar)
Uh, get it off me (Leash and chain)
Ooh, they did you wrong (Oh, yes they did)
Look at your heart broke (What's in your pocket?)
You don't need it more than me, though (You a king, though)
Come off your gold chain
What's in your pocket? (Profit and wage)
Come off that lil' tennis bracelet (Increase the pay)
I'm takin' debit cards (Thief and beggar)
Yeah, get it off me (Leash and chain)

Yes, lawd
Someone hit me the other day for a rendezvous
"Long time no see" was the time she used
Bright eyes like the lights at the carnival
Held convos, but never held accountable
How's your Mama Duke? How ya papa doin'?
Oh, me? I been freer than the sample food
But like a sample loop, around and 'round I move
Until it's clear, then I'm back to baggin' bags of loot
Spent years tryna steer both hands on you
'Til I finally understood that I was spinnin' my hoop
Rather spinnin' my wheels, gettin' up in my years
But still I feel like a kid when I'm fuckin' with you
Young nigga gotta live, that's the motto they use
But all them niggas still live in they mama's backroom
So I'm back in my stu', lookin' up at the stars
When they reminisce over you, my God
That's when I caught light of myself (My God)
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself
That's when I caught light of myself
Gotta be somethin' more that I can't tell
Breakin' you down to size
There's gotta be more to life than myself

It won't fade
Won't fade, won't fade
It won't fade
Won't fade, won't fade

Yeah, yeah, huh
And if you would've showed me more than one time
It wouldn't have been clear, I would've just played it off like
"Alright, I'll deal with it when it gets here"
And I remember when I used to live for more
Than just the useless fix, before the allure of sin
Would cast the black mask over the consequence
I did right by you from within, and all of a sudden
After I run in, it all starts comin', comin' back
To what love is, and it don't fade (Don't fade)
It don't fade (Don't fade)
And it don't fade, don't fade (Don't fade)
And it won't change (Won't change)
Kinda like a dream the way it all happened
When all the laws of attraction
Break all the walls I was trapped in
I can see you comin' back to back with me
I wanted to learn more (More)
I wanna love more, more (More)
I wanna get further (Move further)
It's not too far from home (Too far from home)3Embed
