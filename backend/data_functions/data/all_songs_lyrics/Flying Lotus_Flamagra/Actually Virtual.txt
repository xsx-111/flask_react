Actually Virtual Lyrics
High and embellishing on the flow
Actually virtual
Traveling with nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

Black mirrors, real killers, may y'all feel us
Pig spirit, the bottom cheerers, villains' heroes
Tires peelin', eyes glarin', sky's herald
Bird parker, word hardened, pure darkness
Roll it, spark it, count cake up on the carpet
Your fakeness is remarkable, you may have hit his marker
Your moving targets, parades of sharpness, dapper marksman
Flossy star men, steady Darwin, body Tarzan
That's why we call him, we all can hear him pouring
It's never knowin', so we totin' and we floatin'
Our lines is open, we're swingin' from the rope end
Rollin' dice and hopin' for votes from the dopemen

High and embellishing on the flow
Actually virtual
Traveling with nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Style dirty, let's fly low and hurry
Khalil is present, put the reverence with the essence
Amongst the peasants, you far flung of his blessing
You sick of messin' with him, fans hit this at the wedding
The beast expects ya, you finite in two directions
The goons test him, he ain't impressed and so they left 'em
He plastic and it's tragic but we magic like crescent
Crown crushin', another Lo beat, you can trust it
From east blew in a plush wind, with nomads that blow grass
To gold flow that's so passionate, styles dash, we so cash
Dash past the imam, black limb is transcendent
Broke minds mended, it's the genesisEmbed
