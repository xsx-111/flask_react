Land of Honey Lyrics
When you fall from the land of honey
When you fall from the, fall from the, fall from the
And you've given all your stones to nights
So you’re sure it didn't matter
Sure it didn't matter
Sure it didn’t matter
Go on

Yeah, you fall from the land of honey
Where there's land of promise
All from the land of hunts
All from the land of light
All from the land, that's us
When you see smoke, there's fire

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, HallelujahEmbed
