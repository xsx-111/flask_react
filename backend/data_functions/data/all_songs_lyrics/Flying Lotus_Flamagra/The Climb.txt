The Climb Lyrics
Every time that I turn around, something trips me up
Soon as I feel I got a grip, shit starts to slip
When my mind wonders where I've been through all of this
All that I'm reminded of is that I just can't quit
It's for sure an uphill fight, and a downhill fall
If you're gonna get scarred up anyway, then you might as well climb

Live, laugh, learn, don't die, when you fly
Fly high
Live, laugh, learn, don't die, when you fly
Fly high, fly high

I can't believe all the crap that there is to sift
I am so sick of all of it, when's it gonna end?
Most of the things we're going through make no sense
Even though you feel alone, it's not the end
And when you've been feeling out of place and don't believe the hype
Just close your eyes and take a breath and you'll be alright
Don't let the monsters get to you, be the one, my friend
Even if you gotta punch your way to the end

Live, laugh, learn, don't die, and you fly
Fly high
Live, laugh, learn, don't die, when you fly
Fly high, fly high
Live, laugh, learn, don't die, when you fly
Fly high, fly high1Embed
