9 Carrots LyricsWhy?
Was it beauty that I found?
Was it peace and love when everything is unified?
There's a woman that I know
Who now wants me feeling happier when the day breaks
She's worried about how she can't keep it together
So you have to wait until we get there
Why would you give it away?
Don't you give it away, give it away
Don't you give it away, give it away
Why would you give it away?
Don't you give it away, give it away
Don't you give it away, give it away
Why would you give it away?
Why, why, why?1Embed
