Debbie Is Depressed Lyrics
All the days just feel the same
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie, why you lookin' so sad?
And all the days just feel the same
Yeah

Debbie, you seem so sad tonight
All you ever wanna do is stay inside
’Cause all the days just feel the same (Deb)
Sittin' in the dark and the day's so bright
You wanna sleep all day and sleep all night
’Cause all those days just feel the same
All this time I spend with you
I understand what you been through
'Cause all the days just feel the same (Yeah)
Now, I'ma be real honest, nothing's ever promised
And I think in life you should be grateful
Because all the days just feel the same

Debbie, you look so depressed
All the days
But, but Debbie
You know the days just feel the same
The same, the same, the same, the sameEmbed
