One Tribe Lyrics
Whoa-oh, oh-oh-ohh!
Whoa-oh-ohh! Ohh-oh-oh
Woah-oh, oh-oh-ohh..
.. oh-WHOA-oh!

One tri... one tri...
One tribe, one time, one planet, one race
It's all one blood, don't care about your face
Color of your eye or the tone of your skin
Don't care where ya are, don't care where ya been
Cause where we gonna go is where we wanna be
The place where the native language is unity
And the continent is called Pangaea
And the main ideas are connected like a spear
No propaganda, they tried to upper hand us
Cause man I'm lovin this.. peace!
Ma-man I'm lovin this.. peace!
Ma-man I'm lovin this.. peace!
I don't need no leader that's gonna force feed a
Concept that make me think I need to
Fear my brother and fear my sister
And shoot my neighbor with my big missile
If I had an enemy (enemy)
If I had an enemy (enemy)
If I had an enemy, then my enemy
Is gonna try to come and kill me cause I'm his enemy
There's..
One tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil that they feed ya, remember that we one people
We are one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people

One tribe, one tribe
One tribe, one time, one planet, one (race)
Race, one love, one people, one (and)
Too many things that's causing one (to)
To forget about the main cause
Connecting, uniting
But the evil is seeded and alive in.. us
So our weapons are colliding
And our peace is sinking like Poseidon
But, we know that the one (one)
The Evil One is threatened by the sum (sum)
So he come and try and separate the sum
But he dumb, he didn't know we had a way to overcome
Rejuvenating by the beating of the drum
Come together by the cipher of the hum
Freedom when all become one (one) forever
One tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil that they feed ya, remember that we one people
We are one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people

One love, one blood, one people
One heart, one beat, we equal
Connected like the internet
United that's how we do
Let's break walls so we see through
Let love and peace, lead you
We could overcome the complication cause we need to
Help each other make these changes
Brother sister rearrange this
Way I'm thinkin that we can change this
Bad condition wait
Use you mind and not yo' greed
Let's connect and then proceed
This is something I believe
We are one we're all just people
One tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We one tribe y'all
We are one people
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
Forget about all that evil, that evil that they feed ya
Let's catch amnesia, forget about all that evil
That evil that they feed ya, remember that we one people
We are one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people
One people, one people, one people

Let's, let's catch amnesia, Lord help me out
Trying to figure out what it's all about (what it's all about)
Cause we're one in the same (one in the same)
Same joy, same pain
And I hope that you're there when I need ya
Cause maybe we need amnesia
And I don't wanna sound like a preacher
But we need to, be one
One world, one love, one passion
One tribe, one understanding
Cause you, and me, can be-come one

There is no longer a physical record store
But we will continue to let the beat rock2Embed
