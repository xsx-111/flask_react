Party All the Time Lyrics
Party all the time, party all the time​
Party all the time, party all the time​

If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, my life would be easy

I would drink and go out-out with my crew
Party-party all the time, yep, that's what I'd do
Mack models, pop bottles, live life like the Sheik
(Party) Monday through Sunday every day of the week

Hot octane light in the fast lane zoom
And the joint don't pop, 'til I walk in the room
And the DJ's rocking my favorite tune
And they're shaking up the speaker like boom, boom, boom

If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, my life would be easy
If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
It'd would be easy, our lives would be easy
(If we could) party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time​
Party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time​

If we could party, party, party (hey!)
Break that body down (yo!)
Ladies don't stop it (no!)
Shake it round and round
Feel that bass bumping and rock to the beat
This beat is steady bumping
They jumpin off they feet, check it out
Ladies got they hands in the air
Freaking like they just don't care (uh-huh)
Party on down like yeah (yeah)
Somebody say "Yeah!" (yeah)
Check it out, check it out, what?
Check it out, check it out, check it out, what?
Now you check it out
I'm gonna party hard, like there's no turning back
What you gon' do?

Party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, oh yeah
Our lives would be easy
If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, my life would be easy

I don't give a fuck,​ I'm about to get loose
I'mma take shots, get drunk off Goose
I'mma live my life, I'mma party all night
All day, any time, I don't care if it's right
I wanna party, party, party (hey!)
Party all day (okay!)
Party, party (party)
Party all the way
Wanna party like Ibiza, we don't need no visa
(Party like the Peas-a )I don't need one either

Take me to the club, I need to dance
I need to dance, I need to dance
How 'bout a dance?

Girl, I'm gonna take you to the club
So we can dance, so we can dance
So we can dance - the dance
So we can dance - the dance
If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, my life would be easy
If we could party all night and sleep all day
And throw all of my problems away
My life would be easy, my life would be easy

Party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time​
Party all the time, party all the time
Party all the time, party all the time​
I'm so tipsy, so tipsy
Yeah, I said it, I'm so tipsy, hehehehe
Yeah, I said it3Embed
