Rockin to the Beat Lyrics
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rock-in...
Rock-in...
Rock-in...
Rockin to the beat
Rockin to the beat
Rockin to the beat
Rockin to the beat
Rockin to the beat

Here come the man with the disco jam
Stepped in the place and people like "Damn!"
Party get started with the crew and the fam
'Bout to get naughty and do all I can
What is a band that can't really rock?
What's a MC that's rockin the spot?
What is a mic that ain't got no cable?
What's a DJ without the turntable?
What's a hot girl if she can't really dance?
What's electro without wearin tight pants?
What is rhythm if it just don't bump?
Baby let me get in and give you what you want
Give you what you need, baby how you want it?
Time to get nasty, put your ass on it
Time to get on it, on it, on it
Time to get on it...
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rock-in...
Rock-in...
Rock-in...

Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat
Rock-in...
Rock...
Rock...

Rockin' to the beat...
Rockin' to the beat...
Rockin' to the beat...
Rockin' to the beat...
Rockin' to the beat...
Rockin' to the beat...
Rockin' to the beat...
Rockin' to the beat
Rockin' to the beat2Embed
