Showdown Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo
This is how we do it, this is how we go
This is how we rock, this is how we roll
This is how we do it, do it, do-do, do-do it, do it

It's goin down now and not a tad bit later
All around the world, both sides of the equator
Terrorize the funk, call me Bootsy Al'Qaeda
I'll verify that I got lots of hoochies on data
Govern California, Black Eyed Peas the Terminators
We the exterminators, invade ya like the Raiders
Ignore all the haters, inform all the ladies
It's goin down now and not a tad bit later

In 10, 9, 8, 7-6-5
4, 3, 2, 1
1 (one) 1 (one) 1 (one) 1 (one)
You ready, you ready? (ha!)

Get ready for the showdown!
Get ready for the showdown!
Yo it's about to go down!
Yo it's about to go, go dow-oww-own!
Apl's in the buildin and I'm here to motivate you
Show you how we do it, do it, we still demonstrators
The funk for your trunk, take you high like elevators
Give you what you want, courtesy Mr. Pineda
We breakin' down them barriers, call us the penetrators
Electrify your area, bzzzzap, yea-yah
Go ahead and hate us, it only makes us greater
It's going down now and not a tad bit later

In 10, 9, 8, 7-6-5
4, 3, 2, 1
1 (one) 1 (one) 1 (one) 1 (one)
You ready, you ready? (ha!)

Get ready for the showdown!
Get ready for the showdown!
Yo it's about to go down!
Yo it's about to go, go dow-oww-own!

It's goin down, it's goin down, uh-huh, uh-huh
It's goin down, it's goin down, uh-huh, uh-huh
It's goin down, it's goin down, uh-huh, uh-huh
It's comin yeah, it's comin yo, uh-huh (yeah), uh-huh
We the show stoppers (uh-huh), show rockers (uh-huh)
Show y'all how we rock shit, we got'cha (uh-huh)
All open (uh-huh), no jokin (uh-huh)
Wanna rock it like this keep hopin (uh-huh)
Obama, no drama
Keep hittin them skins like karma
Big drummin, we comin
We comin, we come

In 10, 9, 8, 7-6-5
4, 3, 2, 1
1 (one) 1 (one) 1 (one) 1 (one)
You ready, you ready? (ha!)

Get ready for the showdown!
Get ready for the showdown!
Yo it's about to go down!
Yo it's about to go, go dow-oww-own!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo, yo
This is how we do it, this is how we go
This is how we rock, this is how we roll
This is how we do it, do it, do-do, do-do it, do it
The most powerful force on the planet
Is the energy of the youth
One can stimulate the economy
But when this powerful youth becomes activated
And stimulated
And collectively decides not to buy things
What will happen to the economy?1Embed
