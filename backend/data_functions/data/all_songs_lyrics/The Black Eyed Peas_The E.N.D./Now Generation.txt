Now Generation Lyrics
We are the now generation
We are the generation now
This is the now generation
This is the generation now

I want money!
I want it, want it, want it
Fast internet, stay connected in a jet
Wi-Fi, podcast, blastin out a SMS
Text me and I'll text you back, check me on the iChat
I'm all about that H-T-T-P you're a PC I'm a Mac
I waaaan it
MySpace and yo' space, Facebook is a new place
Dip divin, socializin, I'll be out in cyber space
Google is my professor, Wikipedia checker
Checkin my account, loggin in and loggin out
Baby, I waaaant it (Now!)

This is the now generation
This is the generation now
We are the now generation
I want, I want, I want it now
I want the cold hard cash
I want, I want, I want it (Now!)
And I just can't wait
I need it immediately
And I just can't wait
I want it immediately
Cause the time can't wait and
I sure can't wait
I ain't got no patience, nah
I sure can't wait, not today

We are the now generation
We are the generation now
This is the now generation
This is the generation now

I want money
I want cold hard cash
I'll take your dollar and your euro
And you'll have a blast
So take your debt and your credit and stick it
Get up you ass and do it (Now!)
I want it now!

Big money, give me my money (yeah, I want it now!)
I need cash, girl I need it fast (I want it now!)
Quick in a hurry like yo' name was Flash (I want it now!)
You make me wait and I'mma whip yo' ass (I want it now!)
I want it now baby (Now!)
I want it (Now!), I want it (Now!)
Fast, rapido, really quick like torpedo
Need for speed is my creedo, you need to feed this negrito
Sender, buyer, brother boat, rapid like a thunderbolt
Activated, rock the boat, Just ask Barack who brought the hope to (now!)
It was the now generation...

And I just can't wait
I need it immediately
And I just can't wait
I want it immediately
Cause the time can't wait and
I sure can't wait
I ain't got no patience, nah
I sure can't wait, not today
