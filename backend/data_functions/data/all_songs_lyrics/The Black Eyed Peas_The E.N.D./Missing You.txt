Missing You Lyrics
I can't stand another night
Stand another night without you

Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me, cause I'm missing your
I'm missing your love
I'm missing your, I'm missing your love
I'm missing your love, I'm missing your love

Yo, yo, yo
Everyday, everyday that you're gone, I'm singing that sad song
If loving you is wrong, then I must be wrong
Even when I'm gone (don't go away) our love is strong
(Don't go away) You the one I want (Don't go away)
You my num, you my num, you my number one
And yeah, our love ain't going out of fashion
I need to love your passion, the love is everlasting, lasting

Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me, cause I'm missing your
I'm missing your love
I'm missing your, I'm missing your love
I'm missing your love, I'm missing your love
When I'm out, on the road (I'm missing you)
Rocking them shows (missing you) up in Monaco
(I'm missing you) Making dough
When it may seem plush (I'm missing you) and glamorous (Miss kissing you) But I miss your touch
(I'm missing you) Yeah, I miss your touch
I spend all my time (missing you) with you in mind
(Missing you) My mind's on you, cause all I am is missing you (I'm missing you, missing you!)
(I'm missing you! I'm missing you!)

Since you've been away
Everything don't seem like they used to be
Between you and me, cause I'm missing your
I'm missing your love
I'm missing your, I'm missing your love
I'm missing your love, I'm missing your love

Girl, I ain't never had nothing like this
When I'm all sprung, caught up like this
Maybe it's your face, girl, maybe it's your lips
Maybe it's the way you shake them hips
Baby, it's the way you do what you do
Got, got me all lovestruck on you
I be just like an umbrella the way I'm all over you
I know them other boys be calling you
But they just want a piece, I want all of you
Take my time just spoiling you
Cause I know I'm in love with you
Please, baby, don't go
I'm needing you now!

I'm missing you oh, oh, oh
I'm missing you oh, oh, oh
I'm missing you oh, oh, oh
I'm missing you, missing you!
I'm missing you!
I'm missing you!

Hey! I miss your love, girl
I miss, I miss your love
I miss, I miss your love, Hey!
I miss your love, girl
I miss, I miss your love
I miss your love, girl
I miss, I miss your love3Embed
