Alive Lyrics
I've got so much love, for you darling, and I
I wanna let you know how I feel

And it's true that I love you
And it's true, you're the only one, and I do, I adore you
And it's true, girl

You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive

You say that I'm the only one
You say that I'm your number one
Now you're gone and I feel numb
Tell me where do we go wrong?
You are my best friend and boyfriend
Now it seems like you're my worst friend
I gotta do soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I ain't acting like I used to, I don't feel loved like I used to
It was your love I was used to
Why did I have to lose your love, your love, your love?
Your love is what it was, that had me feeling buzzed
You are my true love
And it's true that I love you
And it's true, you're the only one, and I do, I adore you
And it's true, girl

You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive

Hey girl, you're the only one, supposed to be my number one
Now you're gone, I feel so numb
Tell me how did we go wrong?
First friends, then we became best friends
Used to be my girlfriend, now you're my worst friend
Yeah, I gotta do a little soul searching
Without you I'm a whole different person
I don't even act like I was used to
I don't even feel loved like I used to
I guess it's your love that I'm used to
Damn, I feel bad I had to lose you
I got so many things I wanna say
I guess this mean that I'm missing you
Sorry for the things that I did to you
I'm so lost without you
And it's true that I love you
And it's true, you're the only one, and I do, I adore you
And it's true, girl

You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive

La di di da, la di da, la da, la di da, la di da
La di di da, la di da, la da, la di da, la di da
I've got so much love
La di di da, la di da, la da, la di da, la di da
I've got so much love
La di di di, da di di di, da la la la
I adore you and it's true girl

You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive
You make me feel alive, you make me feel alive

So easy to fall in love with you
And all the things that you do
Baby girl, you're so remarkable
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful
So special, so wonderful
Baby girl, you're so remarkable
So special2Embed
