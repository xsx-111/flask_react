Out of My Head Lyrics
That's right...

Ha! You see these shoes on my feet?
I'm 'bout to go, on out that door
And you ain't stoppin it (what?), ain't nuttin gonna stop it (what?)
Cause I'm sick and tired of all the motherfuckin arguin' (hahaha)
What you think? (oh) I'ma go get a drink (yeah)
Relax myself, cause I'm about to blow!
When they open up the bar (what?),  I'ma hit the bar (let's go)
I didn't drive my car (a-ha), so come on let's go! (let's go!)

I'm steppin, outta here
Cause where I'm goin, I don't know
I'm steppin outta here
Cause where I'm goin, is outta my head
Outta my head, outta my head
Outta my head, outta my head
Outta my head, outta my heeeeeaaad, oh!

Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy
Yeah, hehe!
You see these feet? I'ma hit the streets
Yeah I'll be walkin, just talkin...
I'ma hit the bar, get some vodka
Some Red Bull, ya happy now?
When I see a boy, I'ma say "whassup?"
Hey girl, where you goin?
Hehe, why'oncha come with me? We gon' live it up
We steppin out, aight now here we go

Hold up, hold up, hold up, how'd the bridge go?
Ahh, I think I drank too much
Oh wait, I think I know it
Okay, okay, here we go!

I'm steppin, outta here
Cause where I'm goin, I don't know
I'm steppin outta here
Cause where I'm goin, is outta my head
Outta my head, outta my head
Outta my head, outta my head
Outta my head, outta my heeeeeaaad, oh!
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy
Steppin' steppin' out tonight, got me goin crazy

I'm goin out of my head
La-de-dee-la-de-dah
I'm goin out of my head
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go...2Embed
