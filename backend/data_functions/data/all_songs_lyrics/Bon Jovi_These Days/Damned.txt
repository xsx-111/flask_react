Damned Lyrics
I'm lying here beside you in someone else's bed
Knowing what were doing's wrong
But better left unsaid
Your breathing sounds like screaming
It's all that I can stand
His ring is on your finger
But my heart is in your hands

Damned if you love me
Damned if you don't
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go
Damned if you don't need me
Damned if you do
Oh God, I wish it wasn't me standing in these shoes
Damned, damned

A door slams like a shotgun, you jump up to your feet
Just the wind blowing through the secrets that we keep
Made me want to want you, god knows I need to need you
By the time the love is over, I'll be sleeping on the streets

(Why don't you talk to me?) Because I'm too blind to see
(Why don't you look at me?) Because I'm afraid to breathe
(What do you want from me?) All that I can stand
The lies are on my tongue
And I can't turn back I know
My soul is damned

Don't worry
I ain't gonna call you or hear you say my name
And if you see me on the street, don't wave just walk away
Our lives are getting twisted, let's keep our stories straight
The more that I resist you, my temptation turns to fate

Damned if you love me
Damned if you don't
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go
Damned if you don't need me
Damned if you do
Oh God, I wish it wasn't me standing in these shoes
Damned
Yeah damned
Damned if you love me
Damned if you don't
It's getting harder holding on, but I can't let you go
Damned if you don't need me
Damned if you do
Oh God, I wish it wasn't me standing in these shoes
Damned
Oh damned
Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah
Oh damned
YeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyowEmbed
