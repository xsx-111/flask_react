I Thank You Lyrics
You didn't have to love me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you

If you took your love to someone else
I know what I meant to be the loving dare
You made me feel like I've never felt
Your kiss is so good, I got the holler for help


Now every day there's something new
You put your make-up and your mild perfume
You got me trying to do things, too
Just so that I can keep up with you


All my life I've been short changed
Without your love it would be a crying shame
Now I know what love I'm looking for
When they say they're being turned on
I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, baby, thank you, thank you I got to say



Thank you baby
Let me count the ways, for the whole wide world to hear, oh yeah
Now thank you for paying for my cold beer
I wanna thank you for being here with me baby
Thank you for understanding why I was out so late last night
Thank you for giving me your best friend's phone number
Thank you for understanding, that me and your sister are just good friendsEmbed
