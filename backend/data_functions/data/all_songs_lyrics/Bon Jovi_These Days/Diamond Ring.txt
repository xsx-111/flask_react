Diamond Ring Lyrics
Diamond ring, wear it on your hand
Gonna tell the world I'm your only man
Diamond ring, diamond ring
Baby, you're my everything
Diamond ring
Red, red rose, brought it home to you
Blood red rose, tells me that you're true
Red, red rose, blood-red rose
Like a fire inside that grows
Blood-red rose

When you're hungry, I will fill you up
When you're thirsty, drink out of my loving cup
When you're crying, I will be the tears for you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you
When you're hungry, I will fill you up
When you're thirsty, drink out of my loving cup
When you're crying, I will be the tears for you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do...
You know, you know I bleed every night you sleep
Because I don't know if I'm in your dreams
I want to be your everything...
Diamond ring, wear it on your hand
Gonna tell the world I'm your only man
Diamond ring, diamond ring
Baby, you're my everything
Diamond ring
Darling, you're my everything
Diamond ring
Now, you've got me on your string...
