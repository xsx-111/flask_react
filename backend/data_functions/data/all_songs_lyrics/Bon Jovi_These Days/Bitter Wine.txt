Bitter Wine Lyrics
We met some time ago, when we were almost young
It never crossed my mind to ask, where did you come from?
I didn't have much money, so i stole you a rose
You were dressed like an orphan, in salvation army clothes

Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine

I know i wasn't funny, but you laughed at all my jokes
When i was chaking on the words to say
You shoved your finger down my throat
The first night i said i loved you, you told me to go to hell
You were giving he head, on that creeky
Old bed at the ol'duvol motel

Once you were my inspiration, but, that river's run dry
What was once holy water, tastes like bitter wine 

I would drink of your river, it would always get me high
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine
I never thought i'd love ya, no - i'd rather go blind
I thought i saw the future, but the fortune teller lied
I guess she lied

Just like everything, even good love has to die
Ain't no sympathy when it waves goodbye, no one even cried
We were one of a kind
I would drink of your river, it would always get me high
What was once my salvation, now tastes like bitter wine

I never thought i'd love ya, no - i'd rather go blind
I thought i saw the future, but the fortune teller lied
I guess she liedEmbed
