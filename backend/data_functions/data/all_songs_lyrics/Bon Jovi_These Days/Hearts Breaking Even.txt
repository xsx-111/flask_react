Hearts Breaking Even Lyrics
It's a cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold night tonight
And I can't get you off of my mind
God knows I've tried
Did I throw away the best part of my life
When I cut you off
Did I cut myself with the same damn knife
Hide my tears in the pouring rain
Had my share of hurt and pain
Don't say my name, run away, cause it's all in vain

My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try
Hey I cried, yeah I lied, hell I almost died
We've both got our reasons
Let's just fold the cards and say good-bye
It's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight

It's been a long, long, long, long, long time
Since I've had your love here in my hands
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it
But, nothing's fair in love and hate
You lay it all down and walk away, before it's too late
We danced all night as the music played
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made
There in the stains, we remain
No one left to blame

Go on, get on with your life
Yeah and I'll get on with mine
Broken hearts can't call the cops
Yeah - it's the perfect crime
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning
I'm burning alive
I'm paying the price again
But I'll see the light again


Go on, get up
Go on, walk out the door
Say you don't care about me anymore
That's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight
I don't love you like
Not like we used to do
Tell me I would hold on to get better than you
You, hah
Two hearts breaking even tonightEmbed
