My Guitar Lies Bleeding in My Arms Lyrics
Misery likes company, I like the way that sounds
I've been trying to find the meaning, so I can write it down
Staring out the window, it's such a long way down
I'd like to jump, but I'm afraid to hit the ground

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, I've got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange since you went away
I sing this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

I'm tired of watching tv, it makes me want to scream
Outside the world is burning, man that's so hard to believe
Each day you know you're dying from the cradle to the grave
I get so numb sometimes, that I just feel the pain

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, I've got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange, it's strange enough these days
I send this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
Staring at the paper, I don't know what to write
I'll have my last cigarette-well, turn out the lights
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way
But here in my delusion, I don't know what to say

I can't write a love song the way i feel today
I can't sing no song of hope - I've got nothing to say
And I can't fight the feelings that are buried in my veins
I send this song to you, whoever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding
I can't write a love song the way I feel today
I can't sing no song of hope, there's no one left to save
And I can't fight the feelings that are buried in my veins
I send this song to you wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms
As my guitar lies bleeding in my armsEmbed
