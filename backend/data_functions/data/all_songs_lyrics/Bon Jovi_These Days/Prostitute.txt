Prostitute LyricsHey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
I was there like your mother
Like a brother, like a friend
Said you'd be there like a heartbeat
Thought I'd be there 'till the end
Then you took me like a cancer
You turned my conscience black
Tell the cops"here keep the ransom"
'Cause there's no turning back
I ain't here for love or money
And you don't see the truth
So if you want to bleed me honey
Tonight I'll be your prostitute
I will be your prostitute
Yeah
Hey hey hey
Could you tell me one good reason
'Cause I can't think of none
First you love me then you hate me
As the lies slip off your tongue
You say talk for me
Baby smile for me
You tell me I'm the one
You say bleed for me
Baby breath for me
Tell me when it's done
Well I ain't here for love or money
And you don't see the truth
So if you're gonna need me honey
Tonight I'll be your prostitute
I will be your prostitute
Yeah
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
I know there's no forgiveness
For the things I've said and done
At least I know what I am
And I'm not the only one
'Cause I ain't here for love or money
You can't see the truth
So if you want to bleed me honey
Tonight I'll be your prostitute
I will be your prostitute
I will be your prostitute
Yeah
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey hey, hey hey heyEmbed
