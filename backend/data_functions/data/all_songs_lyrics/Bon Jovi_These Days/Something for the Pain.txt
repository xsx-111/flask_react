Something for the Pain Lyrics
Happiness, it's been no friend to me
But forever after ain't what it's all cracked up to be
Yeah, i had a taste, you were my fantasy
But I almost lost my faith when I hit reality

I don't need no guru to tell me what to do
When you're feeling like a headline on
Yesterday's news
Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel i've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you

Loneliness has found a home in me
My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I've tried to need someone, like they needed me
Well I opened up my heart, but all i did was bleed
I don't need no lover, just to get screwed
They don't make a bandage, that's going to cover my bruise
Come on, come on, come on

Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel i've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you
Come on, come on, come on

Pull me under (help i'm falling)
Through my veins
To a place
Where i feel no pain
Be the pillow under my head (night is calling)
Cover me when i'm in your bed
Take me higher than i've ever been(feels like i'm flying)
Take me down and back again
Come to me, be my disguise (christ i'm dying)
Open your coat, let me crawl inside
Come on, come on, come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel i've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for the blues
Give me something for the pain when
I feel i've been dangling from a hang-man's noose
Give me shelter from the rain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right
Something like you
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Gimme
Give me something for the pain
Gimme
Give me something for the blues
Gimme
Got to give me something for the pain, baby
