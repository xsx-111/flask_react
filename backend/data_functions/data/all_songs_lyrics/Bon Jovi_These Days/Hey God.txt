Hey God Lyrics
Ready?
Let's go

Hey God, I'm just a little man, I got a wife and family
I almost lost the house, I bought into the dream
We're barely holding on when I'm in way too deep
We're two paychecks away from living out on the streets
She's a working single mom, like a saint she don't complain
She never says a word, but she thinks that she's to blame
Her son just got convicted, he blew some cop away
She did her best to raise him, but the world got in the way

Hey God
Tell me what the hell is going on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on getting harder hanging on
But hey hey hey hey God
There's nights you know I want to scream
These days you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey hey hey hey God
Do you ever think about me?
Born into the ghetto in 1991
Just a happy child playing beneath the summer sun
A vacant lots' his playground, by 12 he's got a gun
The odds are bet against him, junior don't make 21

Hey God
Tell me what the hell is going on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on getting harder hanging on
But hey hey hey hey God
There's nights you know I want to scream
These days you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey hey hey hey God
Do you ever think about me?


I get down on my knees
I'm going to try this thing your way
I've seen a dying man too proud to beg
Spit on his own grave
Was he too gone to save?
Did you even know his name?
Are you the one to blame?
Hah, I got something to say
Hey God
Tell me what the hell is going on
It seems like all the good shit's gone
It keeps on getting harder hanging on
But hey hey hey hey God
There's nights you know I want to scream
These days you're even harder to believe
I know how busy you must be
But hey hey hey hey God
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about me?
Oh hey God, hey God, think about me?
Do you ever think about me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey God, hey God, hey God, think about me?
