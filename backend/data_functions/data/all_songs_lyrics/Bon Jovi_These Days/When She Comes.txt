When She Comes LyricsOutside this world keeps turnin' 'round
London Bridge keeps burnin' down
But it'll be all right, oooh
No one hears our silent screams
In this land of broken dreams
But it'll be all right, when she comes
It'll be all right, when she comes
It'll all be tight, when she comes
And when I lie she still believes
She don't ask why, she's there for me
When it get's hard, she's all I need to get by
I hear her voice in a thousand places
I try so hard, still I can't escape it
She's the one, when she comes, yeah
And if the sky come fallin' down
I never ever even hear a sound
It's true, she's as great a red
As blue skies are blue
Everything's all right, when she comes
Everything's all tight, when she comes
And when I lie she still believes
She don't ask why, she's there for me
When it gets hard, she's all I really need
Everything's all right, when she comes
It'll all be tight, when she comes
When she comes
It's all right, It's all right, when she comes
It's all right, It's all right, when she comes
It's all right, It's all right, It's all right, when she comes
It's all right, It's all right, It's all right, when she comesEmbed
