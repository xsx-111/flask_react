Hideaway Lyrics
Who could love you in the way that you love you?
You're alone darling and there's nothing to argue
Your life revolves to ruin
Everyone's watching all that you're doing
Just say your head's done in, maybe you should start running

Hideaway, hideaway
Where they'll never say you cannot stay
Come and play, my hideaway
Someday everything will be okay

You’re not strong so you
You could hurt her so badly
You don’t mean to
Hurting her is too maddening
When you do it's a war in your hand
What you mean to say isn't always what's said
Take a deep breath as soon as you've let go


What's the point to this, feeling happiness in life?
As we fight off our demise, or love as we play into it's lies
