On My Way Lyrics
Ballerina, trapped between the
Walls of her own home
Oh God, Kristina
Don’t once think that
This madness is my fault alone
Now a nightmare’s in the hands
Still everyday’s another chance

I’m on my way, I’m on my way
Let’s get married, I’ll buy a ring and then we'll
Consecrate this messy love

Spinning wildly, ‘till I finally
Realize how busy I am
We’re both so broken, done long hoping
Is that we'll stumble upon our love again
Just believe in me, Kristina
All these demons, I can beat them

I’m on my way, I’m on my way
Let’s get married, I’ll buy a ring and then we'll
Consecrate this messy love
I caught you dancing quietly
It felt like being somebody else
Oh my friend, it seems like
Our love is too lovely for everyone else

Let’s get married, I’ll buy a ring and then we'll
Consecrate this messy love
I’m on my way, I’m on my way
Let’s get married, I’ll buy a ring and then we'll
Consecrate this messy love1Embed
