Carried Away Lyrics
Since my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't even note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts?
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favorite little scene

I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about things that I said
Always let it get to my head

Oh a European, once again with feeling
Higher education making sense
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense
Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head

Wake up in the morning, wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
'Cause no one's really watching
Well, she'll have something to say about it but
We all have problems
We're all having problems
And we've all got something to say

I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about things that I've said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head20Embed
