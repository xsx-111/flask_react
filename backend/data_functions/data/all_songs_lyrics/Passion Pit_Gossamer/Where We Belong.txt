Where We Belong Lyrics
It’s gotten cold in here
But a solemn warmth draws near
And with a gentle touch of these burdens
And such fears are wiped clear
Who says you ought to stay?
How’s this the easier way?
It’s far from giving up
Cowards never say enough is enough

And then I’m lifted up
Out of the crimson tub
The bath begins to drain
And from the floor he prays away
All my pain
Who says that God exists?
We kiss the icons of myths, but
Well, I believe in you
Do you believe in me, too?
Gabriel?

All the things you can’t control
Should never destroy the love one holds
I found a place
I found a place
I found a place where we belong
Never did I think I'd be lifted to whitest clouds
Never did I ever think I'd find out all the things I found
It's hard to keep on living when your heart weighs 'bout a million pounds
All I ever wanted was to be happy and make you proud6Embed
