American Blood Lyrics
Oh American Blood
In my eyes and on my hands
Such an awful circumstance
Condone, carry your woes
Just strike a match and then a pose
But for whom? nobody knows

And we're going to be alright
And you're gonna keep me safe this night
And we're going to be alright
Everything will be quite alright for
You and me
For you and me
For you and me

Oh American Blood
How my love always was young
How it always felt so fun
And then, oh, you went to my head
All my limbs instantly dead
Upside down dangling by a thread

Whats it feel like?
Whats it feel like to be alone?
Whats it hurt like?
Does it hurt you because you know
That all of your blood
Could wash away the world in one massive wave
Could reach the highest peak and the deepest cave


Every time she shares her blood
The world starts leaving webs of love
And in that tangled web is you and me1Embed
