Love Is Greed Lyrics
We want a love
A love for us
We want a selfless love
That we can always say we trust, oh
Love has always been a mockery
Of those in love and scared to be lonely
Don’t want to love, don’t want to hurt
If all that loneliness requires just another’s comfort
Better off being all on your own
There's beauty in being alone
Today we're arguing it’s not worth making
Another person as just yours for the taking
All your hoping and praying
Won't do more than saying that

Love, love, love
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love, love, love
Love is just greed
A selfish little need
You follow or you lead
If we really love ourselves
How do you love somebody else?
A love to us, a love to them
It’s just a history repeating itself time and time again
Love is not a veil to hide your voids
All this talk of love just turns to noise
So you want love, a love so tough
That even all its truths don’t seem as though they’re adding up
Haven’t you already had enough?
What's this suffering remind you of?
Someday we’ll all agree it’s not worth making
Another person as yours just for the taking
All your hoping and praying
Won't do more than saying that

Love, love, love
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love, love, love
Love is just greed
A selfish little need
You follow or you lead
If we really love ourselves
How do you love somebody else?
A love all gone is just another story
What’s gone sour once was glory, glory!
If it's romance you want, well, ask for it then
"Honey could you put your arms around me so
Tell me things about you that I wouldn’t know
And tell me that you love me like you do
And maybe I will too"

Love, love, love
Love is just greed
It's almost taken me
But now I can see
Love, love, love
Love is just greed
A selfish little need
You follow or you lead
If we really love ourselves
How do you love somebody else?Embed
