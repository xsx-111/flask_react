Mirrored Sea Lyrics
Well he called the whole thing such a wild mistake
He said he didn't mean no harm
Well it was a big to-do
But nothing else was new
His past checkered like checkerboards in Central Park
You do good in the light and the bad in the dark
Good men are scarce and few
But always passing through

Oh, you mirrored sea
Your waves, they're haunting me
They're all I see
Oh, let me be you mirrored sea
Your waves, theyâ€™re haunting me
Oh, mirrored sea
Leave me be

Born with a chance that everybody takes
With all risk and hardly any reward
Bounce off the wall of your teens
Like in a pinball machine
Slip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life
Like overheard insults or a cheating wife
And then it's down for the count
The lost that won't be found
