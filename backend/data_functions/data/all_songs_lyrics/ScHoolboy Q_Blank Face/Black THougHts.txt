Black THougHts Lyrics
Our circumstance to where we had parents in our lives that was showing us everything
Like didn't nobody walk us andâ€” by our hand and show us like you do this and don't do that
It wasn't like that coming up in our motherfuckin' community where we grew up at
We grew up off of, what? Figueroa, nigga, like a, a, a, a worldwide blade
A real strip (Yeah)
A real, real ho store
I mean, you know like
You got a mama tellin' you somethin' and a daddy
A daddy tellin' you somethin'
And at the same time, you got your daddy, he, he, he, he around the corner
Gettin' high off the heroin
Your mama on the county, you know what I mean? Like
Supportin', wanna take care of ten kids
I mean, you know, man, it's like
Smokin' the gas on the regular, man, you know what I mean?
Word
Sippin' on Henn', nothin' but regular, you know what I mean?
Word, uh

Pissy sofas, sharin' food with roaches, uh
On gangster Crip, my papa was a bitch
Left me where hope just don't exist
And every neighbor got a fence
With bars on windows, my moms slavin' for the rent
Throwin' dices, GT Dyno groovin'
Where you hang, we shootin'
You slip, you stiffen
Creative Crippin', uh
Nigga, uh
Bitches stop in traffic
This that type of shit that make the MAC a classic
Reason I'm pussy magnet
She learned to carry package
I been the best at rappin', uh
I'm hot as Vegas
Your favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper
But claim he got a kilo, been born in '93, though
He tryna fool the people
Man
The joke's on you, motherfucker
The loc is on you, motherfucker
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma

Ain't nothin' changed but the change
Let's put our brains away from gangs
Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves
Shit, we even changed our names
Tiny somethin', Lil Shane, while we bang
But yo, y'all ain't hearin' me
My homie facin' life, he told me that my pride my biggest enemy
But you keep your eyes in that dark
Your mind, it grays your heart
I wrote these rhymes days apart
Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts
How your grandmother see your corpse?
How your big homie make your life a book?
Left you for dead 'cause he ain't lead you right
But I'm gon' freedom write, hmm
Let's put the rags down and raise our kids
Let's put the guns down and blaze a spliff
Let's do it now, man, no buts or ifs
It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips
You can learn to fly or take the ladder
Real nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides
Man
The joke's on you, motherfucker
The loc is on you, motherfucker
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma10Embed
