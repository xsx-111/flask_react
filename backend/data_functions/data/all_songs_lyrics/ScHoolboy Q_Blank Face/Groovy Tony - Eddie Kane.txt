Groovy Tony / Eddie Kane Lyrics

Blank face, trey-eight kill everybody, fuck an AK
Sell narcotics, I step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our Black off
Thug life, nigga, since '96, I wanted to gangbang
Few years later, I'm really from it, we was still kids
Crack off, nigga, I'm squeezing empties 'til the shell break
Fuck my image, I need to drop, I need the blank face

Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keep a tool waist
Sell narcotics, I'm slangin' diamonds with you back then
Stack large commas, you with your riders, where your backbone?
You can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' 'til all the weed blown
Way long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right, uh
Groovy Tony, no-face killer, I see the money right, uh
Yo, blank face, clear everything out the safe, crack the pig bank
Robbin' your kids too, my heart an igloo
The devil in all blue, huh (Yeah)
Die now, go to Heaven or bring 'em through
Lot of brown 'round here, got that white girl for you (Girl for you)
Uh, and she swimming in firewater
Could be double digits piercing through your Civic
Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, ayy, hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around, now you're hellbound, boogie down
Bullshit, I won't allow, slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat, contradictin' every piece
Leave him triple-six laying in defeat
Can you dig it? Struck a match that won't finish
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped
Squeezin' fingertips, ayy (Ayy)
Blank face, trey-eight kill everybody, fuck an AK
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our Black off
Thug life, nigga, since '96 I wanted to gangbang
Few years later, I'm really from it, we was still kids
Crack off, nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image, I need to drop, I need the blank face
Exactly what I'ma have when the cops come (Shh)
Body language the same as when the shots rung (Yeah)
Holdin' a .38 and a shotgun (Woo)
Real nigga, we all know you are not one (Nah)
I'm runnin' with the rebels (Uh)
It's the three-man weave with the Lord and the devil (Woo)
Really all I need's a pitchfork and a shovel (Uh-huh)
If I can't proceed, then I resort to the metal
Gettin' high, watchin' NBA League Pass (Who winning?)
With your family at the repass (My condolences)
My heart's getting colder
When I hug your mom and look over her shoulder
You notice I got the (Blank face)
I ain't heard nothin', I ain't seen nothin' (Mmm)
I ain't in the middle of nothin' or in between nothin' (Nothin')
F y'all, forever hate me
As I sit here while they interrogate me
I'm staring at 'em with the (Blank face)

Uh (Uh, yeah)

Top-rack nigga, yeah, the money came with it, huh
New bitch with me, hope the booty came with it, came with it, uh, yeah
Rims flyin' down the road, uh
Five in the morning, feds knockin' at my door, huh
Toilet full of dope while my burner knee-high, uh
Told me put the gun down, I'm probably gon' die
I know, I know, big guns, sell dope
Eddie Kane's lil' bro, hundred K, one whip, ah
Open Eddie Kane for hire, huh
Been tryna get rich for hours (Hey, yeah)
Nights like this, I wish
Cocaine drops would fall
Woo
Yo, uh
Yo, uh

Need the car with no mileage
Kristoff for my palate, my cigar full of cabbage
Came from the dirt to the carrots
Gettin' dirty dollars, four different baby mamas
Dope between the speakers
So fuck you, Mr. Teacher, 'cause the paper, I ace it
Lead tried to erase it, but I'm still standing
They mad and everything, nothin' given, I'ma take it first
On the trees like a hammock, flippin' work behind the campus
Young Groovy turn your hood into a movie (To a movie)
Gangbangin', dope slangin', GTA-in'
Shoot the whole club up, fuck tryna sneak the K in
On the road to riches
Thank you, Mr. Reagan, you helped them dollars rake in
And to my uncle that fucked up the family
That shit that you was smokin', I was pushin'
Residue lie on the cushion
I'ma blame it on your ass 'cause I ain't gettin' whoopings
And your proof is in the pudding
I'm just grandma's baby, Eddie Kane
Eddie Kane, Eddie Kane, uh
Standing in the white light, and we on
Is there any other smokers in here? Huh, and we on
Is there any other smokers in here? (Ahh), huh, and we on
Is there any other smokers in here? (Ahh), huh
Keys open doors to the road to my heart (Ahh)
Dreams on the floor, bet a nigga stay high, and I know
What makes the world go 'round? Go 'round? Woohoo
What makes the world go 'round? Go 'round? Woohoo
Woo, woohoo (Yeah)

Walk right into the light
Getting a feeling alone in the night (Woohoo)
Vengeance comes, see spite for spice
You're my only Christ (Woohoo)
I have only eyes for you
I have only eyes for you (Woohoo)
Your soul is mine
Your soul is mine
Mine, mine23Embed
