Neva CHange Lyrics
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hoes ain't callin'
The cocaine rock
World keep spinnin'
The block stay hot
The block stay hot
The block stay hot
World keep spinnin'

Thank God for the game
My TV screen off the chain
My bitch, she off the chain
I came from the grain
The sidewalk chalk (Yeah)
The block stay hot
Paranoid, the cop that keep my gear in park
Pull me out the car to give me black thought
But fuck it, this shit's all kinda player
This shit my mama flavor
This that raised by your granny, pistols and Now & Laters
Your pops was way too busy, missin' your mom's labor
Grew up just like your daddy to packin' baggies in alleys
To where the streets is your family
Gettin' burnt by the same cop
Go to jail for a year and come home, two of your niggas dropped
You know how that feelin' feel, in the field, when it's gettin' real
More bullets to go around, come jump in this water, nigga
You still with your mama livin', thirty with no ambition
Your kid got no pot to piss in
You sayin' some nigga fake
You're selfish and sad, nigga you're lame (And go on)
You hatin' on another man's success, because
The nigga blessed and wouldn't let you finesse
You got the game all twisted
You're leechin' worse than these ladies, your inner nigga ain't aging
Reason the hood stay shady
Who you do when you want?
Boy, think you got this
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?
Hoes ain't callin' like you want
Only ones you got passed
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoes ain't callin'
The cocaine rock
World keep spinnin'
The block stay hot

Really wit' it for real
We fuckin' hoes for real
Gettin' paper for real, nigga
I play for the bills, nigga
I really sold pills
Smokin' weed for my ills
Breakin' weed in my whip
Just got an ounce on a bitch
Still our motive be commas
And still my life isn't promised
Still nervous as drivers
You see them lights get behind us
They pull me out for my priors
Won't let me freeze 'fore they fire
You say that footage a liar
They want my flow in the dryer
I'm at the top aimin' higher
My lawyers stay on retainer
When white folks point the finger
Place my neck on that hanger
Shit, no wonder we riot
Niggas still killin' niggas
Child support killin' niggas
Cops enslavin' us niggas
Little girls killin' mothers
They treat their kid like a brotha
Fathers stuck with them lifers
Kept it real with his niggas, but left his kid for the suckas
Shit, no wonder we bang
Damn shame, mane, some things will never change
Who you do when you want?
Boy, think you got this
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?
Hoes ain't callin' like you want
Only ones you got passed
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
