Ride Out Lyrics
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

Young nigga and I'm proper-like
Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah, I'm baller-like
Bitch, I think I'm Dolemite, bitch, I'm going Poltergeist
Who said this was overnight? Album four, it's really like (Yeah)

Cripping on my minibike (Oh), either hoop or selling white
Brillo pad, the smoker's pipe, my pistol cocked, you tryna fight?
Say he wanna be a cuz, put his brains to the right
Bruh, this ain't the eighties, man, niggas shooting everything
Everything, you know the gang we represent
Specialize in pistol grips, shooting out my mama's whip
Always gotta empty clip, Top Dawg in this bitch
Niggas putting dicks inside your baby mama's mama's lips
Shooting all the witnesses, it ain't no fucking murder scene
Crips don't fuck with Crips so now his jeans look like the rival team
Wrong hat and shoes, put your ass on a forever-dream
Heating up the summer 'til the winter fall, spring clean (Oh)
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

Young nigga and I'm proper-like
Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah, I'm baller-like
Bitch, I think I'm Dolemite, bitch, I'm going Poltergeist (Yeah)
Who said this was overnight?
Me and Vince, we cracking like Cripping in our afterlife

Yeah, 'cause at Ramona Park, we beef with everybody
Light or dark, I spark, don't fuck with narcs
So don't be talking 'bout me
My big homie named me "Get Em, Kill Em"
'Cause if I got 'em, I'ma kill 'em, I ain't playing with 'em
I'm from the bottom, that's the top of the town
We on the border, so they cliquing up for knocking us down
My burner tucked, I learned from Chuck, so I ain't turnin' it down
Get to busting, know you bluffing, nigga
If that bitch can't make me rich
Then ain't no need in fucking with her
Turn around and fuck her sister, heard that bitch got EBT
Long Beach ain't seen shit like me since Tracy D and DPG
I went and got a burner on the day they murdered Baby D
I'm in that Benz with Lil' Boy, so, lil' boy, don't play with me
Huh, I'm ridin' cycs through Hoover Street
My knuckles full of teeth
Try to creep on me, you're dying in your homie seat
Keeping to my gun in reach for later beef
Clip reach from Figg Side to Norfolk Beach
In a stolen Expedition, in your hood, 'cause you the mission
Been a mathematician, loadin' nine, subtracting eight
I'm keeping one for just in case, don't cover face, but I ain't trippin'
Blunt was laced, niggas know I'm 'round the way
So ain't no liquor stores today

Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, get smoke
Re-up, get dough
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

Young nigga and I'm proper-like
Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah I'm baller-like
Bitch, I think I'm Dolemite, bitch, I'm going Poltergeist
You said this was overnight
Me and Vince, we cracking like Cripping in our afterlife
