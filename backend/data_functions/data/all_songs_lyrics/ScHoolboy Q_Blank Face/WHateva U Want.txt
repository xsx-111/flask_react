WHateva U Want Lyrics
Now it's time to make our mind, oh, babe
I don't feel a thing
You got the right one, hey
Two-step
Can I rock with ya?
Can I smoke with ya? Hey, uh

Hey
Tryna give you an upgrade
Cherry-bottoms, Dior shades
Take my debit, it go cray
Spend, spend every dollar our way
Turn your closet to a driveway
Your old nigga was the old days
Broke times in a broke place
Teary-eyed with the pout face
You can get it how you want it, my love
Small shoppin', hope a hundred thousand enough
Benz-Benz, put the rims on the truck
Girl, you livin', or no? Stayin' or go?
Whatever you want

Hey
Cribbo in the hills, table full of bills
Dollar, dollar bill
Whatever you want
I can make it real
We— We can split a mil', prolly sail in Rio
Dollar, dollar bills
Whatever you want
Whatever you— you— you— you— you— you—
Whatever you want
Whatever you— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou—
Hey
Nice cars, caviar (Hey)
Whatever you want
Hey
Hey
Whatever you want

Good weed and pain pills
Big boy, we bringin' in big mills
Every dollar, dollar bill caught wheels
Crib in the hills if you call, it's Net', chill
Fly around the world, girl you livin' or not?
We used to run from the cops, now we buyin' the blocks
Started ballin' like I said I would
Came up in the game I love
If you backed it, you must get cuffed
So cold with the cold pull-up
Now I'm never in the hood enough
Had to get up off my ass to get it
Want it, pick it, tag, clip it, yeah

Nice cars, caviar, you can have it all
Palm trees, bomb weed, whatever you want
Pinot Grigio, Noir, you can have it all
Teeth gold, bankroll, whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Hey
Cribbo in the hills, table full of bills
Dollar, dollar bill
Whatever you want
I can make it real
We— We can split a mil', prolly sail in Rio
Dollar, dollar bills
Whatever you want
Whatever you— you— you— you— you— you—
Whatever you want
Whatever you— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou— 'ou—

Hey
Nice cars, caviar (Hey)
Whatever you want
Hey
Hey
Whatever you want

I don't need your money, honey
I just want your love
Make it, tasty, nasty, crazy
Give it all you got
Diamonds last forever, baby
Look at what we got
I don't want your money, darling
I just want your love
Diamonds last forever, baby
Look at what we got
I don't want your money, darling
I just want your love6Embed
