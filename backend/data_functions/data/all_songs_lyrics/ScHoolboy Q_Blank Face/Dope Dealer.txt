Dope Dealer Lyrics
Southside
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga (Uh)

I got a stack of blue faces, but my AR black
I got two bitches in my whip and they gon' hold my strap
I put the knife on the coca leaf and turn that crack
I put the nine to your coconut and pull that back
I see that motherfucker shinin', snatch your whole damn throat
I got a strike in every pocket of my old-ass coat
I use to fly around your city, nigga, no ID
I get a half and I'ma flip it, gotta go OT

I think somebody getting bodied on a weekday
Hey, get out the way
I'm in my new clothes (Huh?)
Now drop it for me for a bankroll (Bitch)

Bruh, I'm lookin' like a motherfuckin' dope dealer, nigga
Where the hoes? Where the blow? I'm just a dope dealer, nigga
Paper in the paper bag, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Latin bitch, the biggest ass, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Fuck your homies and the police, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Couple diamonds in my Rollie, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Got the plug on the dodie, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Bet a buck your auntie know me, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Cali niggas is mannish and we havin' it (Greedy)
We got FN 57s and we savages (Beasty)
My little niggas be impin', they some P's (Hustlers)
Some of 'em sell candy, some sell trees (Customers)
Me personally, I'm a rapper and I'm spectacular (Remarkable)
Got a way with my words, my lingo and vernacular (Marketable)
I'll beat a bitch down, I promise you I ain't playin' (Beat his ass)
Stomp his ass out, throw him up in the garbage can (The trash)
In the heart of the trap you might find me slappin' bones (Dominos)
In the thick of the soil, in the middle of a war zone (Eatin' Dominos)
Where the gumbo pots boil and the task force raid our homes, (Vamanos)
Heavy surveillance, helicopters and drones (Bitch)

I think somebody getting bodied on a weekday
Hey, get out the way
I'm in my new clothes (Huh?)
Now drop it for me for a bankroll (Bitch)

Bruh, I'm lookin' like a motherfuckin' dope dealer, nigga
Where the hoes? Where the blow? I'm just a dope dealer, nigga
Paper in the paper bag, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Latin bitch, the biggest ass, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Fuck your homies and the police, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Couple diamonds in my Rollie, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Got the plug on the dodie, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
Bet a buck your auntie know me, I'm a dope dealer, nigga
I got them egg whites and them oxtails for the low
I got them hot wheels, you gotta push start and it go
I got them sixteens of the Act' right and it's sealed
We on the frontline when it's crunch time to get chilled
You know us lil' niggas love gold chains and them whips
Make me rearrange your whole thang from my hip
I get this motherfucker jumpin', bitch, you know why I came
They told me "thou shalt not kill" when I jumped in the flame
I'm cuckoo for the cocoa leaves and I turned it to dope
The money never grew on trees, but I'm watching it grow
We talk in codes, Latin hoes, told 'em "ven aquí"
I get to swingin' on this chopper, nigga, R.I.P. 

You heard what I mean, it's your boy S-Mac, mayne
Fuck with us, mayne, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
It's better livin' with mines, mayne, you heard me?
We gon' break your bitch, mayne, we gon' send her back to you broke, mayne
You funky-cock bitch
White stones, panties gone, boom
Two phones, man he on, boom
Bankrolls, hella hoes, boom
Big dope, blow your nose, boom
White stones, panties gone, boom
Two phones, man he on, boom
Bankrolls, hella hoes, boom
Big dope, blow your nose, boom25Embed
