Big Body Lyrics
Yeah, c'mon
Hear ye, hear ye
You son of a bitch, you
ScHoolboy Q and Tha Dogg Pound is in the motherfuckin' house
So uh, get your skates, get your...

Get your issue, funky bitch, you slow on your feet
Get your issue, funky bitch, you slow on your feet
Get your issue, funky bitch, you slow on your feet

Man, them niggas ain't hot (Hot)
Man, them niggas ain't cold (Cold)
Man, them niggas ain't hot (Hot)
Man, them niggas ain't cold (Ain't cold)
Man, they jewelry ain't froze (Ain't froze)
Man, them bitches won't go when your money don't grow (Grow)
Big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz, big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz, big body, big Benz

Steppin' in my big blue Chucks
Groovy Q, they all wanna fuck
Park the Cutlass at the pump
Hit the switches over speed bumps
Knockin' six-twelves in the trunk
Where the girls with the rump?
All the pretty bitches to the front
All you groupie niggas to the back
Put the 50s on the map
Got my Hoover star on the hat
'Cause we groovin' like that
Yeah, we movin' like that
Slangin' dick, I shoulda made racks
Nigga, clean dick in that cat
Got my jimmy on strap
Like it when your booty get tapped (Uh)
Why your jewelry ain't froze?
Why your money won't grow? (Won't grow?)
I move the pussy, can't fold (Can't fold)
Bruh, you on the down low
Cuz work on Melrose (Melrose)
I'ma sling an elbow (Elbow)
Get a job? Hell no
Man, them niggas ain't hot (Hot)
Man, them niggas ain't cold (Ain't cold)
Man, them niggas ain't hot
Man, them niggas ain't cold (Ain't cold)
Man, they jewelry ain't froze (Ain't froze)
Man, them bitches won't go when your money don't grow (Grow)
Big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz, big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz, big body, big Benz

Woke up and I'm already drunk
I'ma give the bitches what they want
Put this dick up in your rib
We could bring the party to the crib (To the crib)
Give them bitches dick to mouth and then doggy on the couch (Uh)
Show her what this Crip nigga 'bout (Yeah)
Nigga slangin' D up in the drought
Groovy bring the bitches out
Nigga, West Coast up in the house
Leave your trapping in the South
Bring the grooves to your feet (Yeah)
I could make a million every week
Bro, this big body Benz ain't cheap
Why them bitches want me?
Bro, you want it low-key
Shit, I probably OD, I'ma live it up free
Judge, no, I never couldn't be
Everybody dancefloor, what you got a man for?
Girl, I could do the pussy Rambo (Yeah)
Do I love her? Hell no
Man, them niggas ain't hot (Ain't hot)
Man, them niggas ain't cold (Ain't cold)
Man, them niggas ain't hot
Man, them niggas ain't cold (Ain't cold)
Man, they jewelry ain't froze (Ain't froze)
Man, them bitches won't go when your money don't grow (Grow)
Big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz, big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz (Big Benz)
Big body, big Benz, big body, big Benz

In a drop-top, shit, yeah, the knock-knock
Six in the morning and I'm yelling out, "Don't stop"
Money makes the world go 'round, in case you didn't know
In case you didn't know about these pussies and these hoes
And these sluts, what's up? Heard they actin' up
If you don't give a shit, then nigga, we don't give a fuck
I told you once before that this is how the shit go
ScHoolboy Q with Tha Dogg Pound flow, you know
We hella faded
Man, fuck that bitch, nigga, why you fakin'?
Man, fuck that bitch, nigga, why you hatin'?
Fuck that bitch, you trip (Bitch)
This is what you get (Get)
Fuckin' 'round with this
DPG shit (Shit)
TDE, bitch
We ain't talkin', no conversation
We just bangin' around the nation
If you don't know, now you should know that
Fuck that
We ain't talkin', no conversation
We just bangin' around the nation
If you don't know, now you should know that
Fuck that

Man, them niggas ain't hot
Man, them niggas ain't cold
Man, them niggas ain't hot
