JoHn Muir Lyrics
Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all
Never had a motherfuckin' weed card
I'm down to flatline a nigga, never been soft
Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all
Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all
I was thirteen with my motherfuckin' heat, y'all
Nigga caught cases tryna take your fuckin' screen off
I could put your fuckin' life on the recall, uh, yeah
Lookin' for the bitches with the ass
Got an icy chain 'cause a nigga gettin' cash
Three different pagers goin' up because I'm crackin'
Tryna turn a dollar to a million, ho, what's happenin'? Uh, yeah, ayy
O-orange laces for my shoestrings
Pistol on me, dope is in her G-string
Ridin' in my motherfuckin' Coupe-Ville
Groovin' with my motherfuckin' locs still
Fig' side niggas keep a dope fiend
Ghetto bird here to kill our ghetto hoop dreams
Tryna strike me out before I finish school
I was just a square nigga 'til I took my 52, ooh, yeah, ayy

Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all, ah, on me, though
Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all, ah, on me, though
We love, we go, ayy, we rise, we low, ayy
Our pride, we show, ayy, we love, we go
Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all
Tryna get this motherfuckin' weed off
Gang injunction tell me where we can't go
Shoot me in my back because my afro
Heard I got a strike on my record, then it's true
Cops effin' up my record, never told 'em what I knew
I was in my nigga car garage, yeah, I'm tryna shoot
I was out here sellin' dope at fourteen, what it do?
I was out here fuckin' hoes at fourteen, what it do?
I was ditchin' class, fifth grade, yeah, I'm Groovy Q
Ain't no biggie when the small nigga rob, give me loot
Pop a nigga on his mom porch, kill his brother too
Nigga lost his first fade nine years after school
Nigga tryna get the J's, blue Chucks sick as flu, uh
Runnin' from the crash unit like my name was State Farm
On my nigga handlebars tryna get our groove on, yeah

Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all, ah, on me, though
Bellin' through the motherfuckin' street, y'all, ah, on me, though
We love, we go, ayy, we rise, we low, ayy
Our pride, we show, ayy, we love, we go
