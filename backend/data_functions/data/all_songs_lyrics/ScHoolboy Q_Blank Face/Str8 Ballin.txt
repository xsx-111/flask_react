Str8 Ballin Lyrics
Uh, believe that
Yo
For real, yo (Uh, uh, uh)

Figured that I gotta sell dope or the money won't grow, uh
Figured I was too short and I could never turn pro, uh
You could tell I never had shit, but bet I get that eighty-grand wrist
Told me we could never get rich
Now watch me ride the Chevy, hit the switch
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Ayy, ridin' through the city on chrome (Come on)
Ghetto nigga out the sunroof, hey
Foreign keys, bitch, please, straight ballin' like a bitch
Flossin' in the mind
Stuntin' like the first, shufflin' the work
Uh, I done came from the dirt
Now the engine make the tire go skrrt
Used to sleep with roaches, crackhead uncle and all
Now a hundred thousand just an hour involved, hmm
So easy how I make a mil' flip
Snoop ain't the only rich Crip, nigga (Uh)
From sleepin' on Top's couch to multiple bank accounts
To havin' me a mall for a house, like
They tried to slim my chances as a kid, though
They always said I'd never make it big
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Picture me rollin', oh
Straight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky (Straight ballin' like a bitch)
Picture me rollin', oh, yeah
I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high
So high
I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high (Straight ballin' like a bitch)
(So high)
Straight ballin' like a bitch
(So high)
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Straight ballin' like a bitch

Ayy, wait-waitin' on my turn to get paid (Come on)
Nigga tryna make a mil' a day (Come on)
Put that rental on the interstate
Since a youngin, I was gifted
Mama bought me something for the bitches
Bruh, I got some things you gotta witness
Stomach gets to mumblin' at night
Watchin' every car that drive by
Lookin' every driver in the eye
52nd enterprise
Marchin' in these Chukkas like they boots
Money make a pussy get the juice
Money make the copper give a pass
Money make me cop a bigger roof
Money got me skippin' every class
Tryna kill 'em for the summer
The teachers ain't teachin', the judge taught us numbers
Uh, we was raised by single mothers
Pop wouldn't tuck us under covers
Through the streets, we learned colors
Hidin' from the reaper, tryna dodge the cage
The shit I've done to rhyme on this stage
I went from king of the corner
To breaking down weed on my diploma
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Picture me rollin', oh
Straight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky (Straight ballin' like a bitch)
Picture me rollin', oh, yeah
I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high
So high
I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high (Straight ballin' like a bitch)
(So high)
Straight ballin' like a bitch
(So high)
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Straight ballin' like a bitch13Embed
