TorcH Lyrics
Blank face
Blank face, blank face, blank face, blank face, blank face (Blank face)
Blank face, yo, blank face
Blank face, blank face, blank face
I'll trade the noise for a piece of divine
Uh

This that fuck the blogs
The afterbell, we hang in halls
Underage, smokin' weed and alcohol
Grandma sweeped shells out the driveway
One of the homies got slayed, so we bang at the King parade
I can take you spots where gangsters walk
With real damus and locs, Boyz N the Hood wasn't even close
Where the girls' kitten show, hit the dope and the pussy soaked
Now she get you for your change, Captain Save-A-Ho, man
I ain't been right since out the cervix
I know an M can make it perfect
It came through more than the one I worship
You know I never lied
The truth be told, the dope's been gettin' sold
He got the runny nose
Summertimes, we don't trust niggas in winter clothes
I swear the hood low as the burner get rose, I follow the city codes
My money show (Oh)
Missin' them days of honey oats
Dollar bills in mama's coat
Cartoons and bubble soap
This be the realest shit I wrote
This be that ride that hundred spoke
Red and blue from head to toe
Who needs a motherfuckin' friend?
You see the motherfuckin' rims
Met the devil in disguise
Look through my motherfuckin' eyes

Look at my yard, look at my block, look at my zip code
All of these lies, true to my life, word to my pencil
Take what you want, get what you like, open that window
Ain't that simple? Ain't it that simple?
Look through my motherfuckin' eyes, uh
Vision impaired by the high
No cares on my mind
Couple days, I'll be fine

This shit from 'round the back house
More baggies bagged than at Ralphs
In granny's plastic suede couch
Best play cat and that mouse
A minor pitchin' in major
Stay servin' dope, but we cater
Take you back to my Sega
Slammin' bones on that table
Runnin' errands for grams, the paramedics at Tam's
Forced to grow to a man
Before LA had the Rams
Went to school for the bitches, where scorin' drugs was the goal
Lungs black as a crow, got banned from every hood store
My haters came for the better and money came for the loads
Concrete where we rose, you wasn't built from this mold, uh
Fucked up the game with many flow
I been a loc since embryo
I'm ten toes, you movie role, uh
I do this shit for lifers way before
Jehri curls, cut Dickies, and sherm smoke, uh
Got so many bodies the world knows, shit
Don't worry 'bout no witness, your homies go under oath, oh
But our dreams was big homie
The world done flipped on me, took my soul, then clicked on me
Who needs a motherfuckin' friend?
You see my motherfuckin' rims
Met the devil in disguise
Look through my motherfuckin' eyes

Look at my yard, look at my block, look at my zip code
All of these lies, true to my life, word to my pencil
Take what you want, get what you like, open that window
Ain't that simple? Ain't it that simple?
Look through my motherfuckin' eyes, uh
Vision impaired by the high
No cares on my mind
Couple days, I'll be fine

My picture was in full frame
But my vision had distort
My memory is okay
But my feelings on point
I could be here all day if you let me go, go, go, go
Oh, Lord
You don't know the half of what I had to hold, hold, hold, hold
No, Lord, yeah
I see faces at my window
My patience growin' short
I had no one to lend on
That's why that chip is so cold
Kinda like the cocaine on my fallen bros, bros, bros, bros
Oh, Lord
Guess that's my curtain call, my last go
Said isn't this shit what you wanted to see? Yeah
Ain't it, though? Ain't, ain't this shit what you wanted to see?19Embed
