Blank Face Lyrics
What you say? What you say?
Who you tellin'?
Blank faces
Say

Smokers and dope fiends, hookers and players
Dope in the vein, youngins servin' the meds
Run from the police, jump from the ledge
Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah
Niggas don't understand until you leap over twenty-five
Dancin' with devils, never knew how to treat your woman right, yeah, huh
Feet on the pedal, runnin' over jokers and funny types
Word to my OG, he gone, that nigga fresh out of strikes
I should know better
Heaven knows that I ain't the dummy type, nah, hmm
I should be flyin' home without a care
My baby don't want no toys, she want me there, hah
Trade the noise for a piece of divine, hah
Save up my coins for a piece of the land, hah
Something to pass when I'm passin' my prime, hah
My world in the cards, full deck in my hand, hah
As sure as the smog is pollutin' the land
Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah
Uh
Wise as my Chevy
My life's so fucked up, the drank don't get me buzzed
We ain't blood and they killed my cuz
Chuckin' C's since I was a cub
Young nigga grew up on hate, but where's the love?
Ashin' dubs, uh (Yeah)

Niggas don't understand until you leap over twenty-five
Dancin' with devils, guess you would say I'm one of the lucky types
No, fuck you thought?

Playin' tooth fairy, Santa before I'm buried
Easter egg huntin', pickin' seeds out the pumpkin
Six years straight, the valentine for my munchkin
I made a queen outta nothin'
Told me stay in school, my dream was just a small percentage
Said a million wasn't realistic
Last year, I spent it, what's the laws of physics?
Move pounds or move down to Section 8 livin'
Grew up around Crippin', woo business, uh

And if I never make it to twenty-five
I swear to God I'm still gon' fly, nigga
But it's still my time, nigga
Tell me who gon' fly with me?
Yeah
Who gon' ride with ya?
Who gon' fly with ya?
It's still my time
Yeah
It's still my time, nigga
Yeah
