D.S. Lyrics
Aaow!
Gone babe

Ah, they wanna get my ass dead or alive, ah
You know he really tried to take me down by surprise
I bet he missioned with the CIA, dah
He don't do half what he say

Dom Sheldon is a cold man, ah
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, ah
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, ah
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

He out shock in every single way, dah
He'll stop at nothing just to get his political say
He think he hot cause he's BSTA, dah
I bet he never had a social life anyway
You think he brother with the KKK? Ah, dah
I bet his mother never taught him right anyway
He want your vote just to remain TA, ah
He don't do half what he say
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, gone boys
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, c'mon boys
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, ah

Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man, ah
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, ah

Aaow!
Gone baby!
Hee-hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Hee-hee!

Does he send letters to the FBI?
Did he say to either do it or die?
Dom S. Sheldon is a cold man, gone boys
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, gone boys
Dom Sheldon is a cold man, ah (Hee-hee!)
Dom Sheldon is a cold man

Dom Sheldon is a cold man (He doesn't, he does, does, dah)
Cold man (He doesn't, he does, dah)
Cold man (He doesn't, he does, dah)
