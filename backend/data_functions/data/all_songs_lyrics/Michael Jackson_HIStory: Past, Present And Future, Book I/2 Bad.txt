2 Bad Lyrics
I wake up my girl, get me mad right
The king of rock come on and there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
Standin' out here
Talking, broking, never joking, smoking
Up on the corner
Do what they wanna
Get outta here
Hasta la vista

Told me that you're doing wrong
Word out shocking all along
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nuthin for me
You are disgusting me
Yeah yeah
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing, if you please
Try to bring me to my knees
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?

Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from another hole
Tell her what somebody told
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
Tired of you hunting me
Yeah yeah
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad too bad
Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standing though you're kicking me
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team
Theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel
Organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim
Take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it12Embed
