This Time Around Lyrics
(Hoo!)

This time around I never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're makin' me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna get me, you really wanna get me

He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, (They thought) they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, (They thought) they really had control of me

This time around I'm not gonna get bit
Though you really wanna get me (You really wanna get me)
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna fix me (You really wanna fix me)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
They get people to use me and then falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me (Get me, and fix me)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t jokin'
Indo smoke got me chokin', I'm hopin'
A fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby (This time around, yeah!)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
(Get me, and fix me, they really tried to get me)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
(Use me, accuse me, nobody will abuse me)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
(Take me, shake me, nobody's gonna fake me)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
(Guilt me, and deal with me, I like the way you thrill me)
(Hit it! Control this now!)
He really thought he really had a hold of me (Hoo!)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
(Use me, accuse me, nobody will abuse me)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
(Fix me, and wish me, nobody's gonna diss me)
(Hoo!)
This time around, yeah! (Control of me)
