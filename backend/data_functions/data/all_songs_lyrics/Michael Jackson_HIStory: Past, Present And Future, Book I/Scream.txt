Scream Lyrics
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgusting
So what does it mean, damn it
Kickin' me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls, but I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

With such confusion
Don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream (You just, you just)
I'm tired of you tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (Story your way)
You're causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damn it
You keep changin' the rules
While I, I keep playing the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane
Ah, baby

With such confusion, don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me want to scream

Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (All the injustice)
Yeah, yeah
Baby (Whoa)
With such collusions, don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (Make you want to scream)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream18Embed
