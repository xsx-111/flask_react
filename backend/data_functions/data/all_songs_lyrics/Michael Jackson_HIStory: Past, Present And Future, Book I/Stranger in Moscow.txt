Stranger in Moscow Lyrics
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow, hee!
Lord have mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow
Why have you come from the West
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
The accomplishments of the worker20Embed
