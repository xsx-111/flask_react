Heresy Lyrics
Here we are
In a world of corruption
Human nature is
A violent breed
Who cares if there's no tomorrow
When I die for my future's
Laid out for me
Can't you see
Rise above the lies
Morals on a backwards globe
A sin to you
For me it's hope
It's my life and provision
Black or white
Some pay to pray
You question why they
Act this way
It's their fucking decision

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me
Honesty born in me
Heresy

I know what's right or wrong
And my belief is stronger
Than your advice
People, they go to war
Because religion gives them
Reason to fight
Sacrifice, die for pride
Sacrifice
A group that caters
No one's fees
Or synthetic deities
Is where I belong
My stand is the human race
Without a label or a face
So they can lick my sack

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me
Honesty born in me
Heresy
Honesty born in me
