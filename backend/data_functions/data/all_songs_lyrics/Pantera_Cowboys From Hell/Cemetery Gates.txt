Cemetery Gates Lyrics
Reverend, Reverend, is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins, an image beneath me
What's within our plans for life, it all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world left in my misery

The Reverend he turned to me without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see, I didn't ask him why
I will remember the love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain, all my mind can see now is your

Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy, this love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry, the pride within my soul
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories now unfold

Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me, some place far abound
I must reverse my life, I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free, belong to me at last
Through all those complex years, I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around and make this world my own
And when she died, I should have cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories still remain

The way we were, the chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

The way we were, the chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery
