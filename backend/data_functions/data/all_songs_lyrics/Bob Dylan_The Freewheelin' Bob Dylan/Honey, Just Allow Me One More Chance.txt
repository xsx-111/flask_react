Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance Lyrics
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you
Well, I’m a-walking down the road
With my head in my hand
I’m looking for a woman
Needs a worried man
Just a-one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just a one more chance

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your airplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train
Well, I’ve been looking all over
For a girl like you
I can’t find no better
So you’ll have to do
There's just-a one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just-a one more chance

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I'll do anything for you
Well, looking for a woman
That ain't got no man
Is just looking for a needle
That's lost in the sand
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
Allow me just-a one more chance5Embed
