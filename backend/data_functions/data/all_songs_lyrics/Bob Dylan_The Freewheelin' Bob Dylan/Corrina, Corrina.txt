Corrina, Corrina Lyrics
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, where you been so long?
I been worrying about you, baby
Baby, please come home

I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But I ain't got Corrina
Life don’t mean a thing

Corrina, Corrina
Girl, you’re on my mind
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, you’re on my mind
I’m a-sittin down thinkin of you
I just can’t keep from crying3Embed
