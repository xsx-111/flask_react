Oxford Town Lyrics
Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground
I am a-going down to Oxford Town

He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town

Oxford Town around the bend
Come in to the door, he couldn’t get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?

Me, my girl, my girl’s son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don’t even know why we come
Going back where we come from

Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon1Embed
