Midnight Sun LyricsI have seen the midnight sun shining
I saw you fly away smiling
The dark night sheds no light
It merely serves a warning
I pray for one single ray of hope
Oh, midnight sun
I have seen the midnight sun shining
Watched her rays steadily dying
The candles are alight
I sit alone in mourning
I wonder is there death after life
Oh, midnight sun
While in my life
I have loved
I have lost
I feel no warmth from your days
Yet I have seen the midnight sun shining
Welcomed her full golden lining
For when I have to fight
To wake up in the morning
I look to her for her open arms
Oh, midnight sunEmbed
