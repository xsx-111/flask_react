Autumn Lyrics(a) Heroine's Theme
Instrumental
(b) Deep Summer's Sleep
I sense Autumn coming on
The mist has hung low all day
Small birds gather on the wing
Preparing to make their way
The trees begin to show
A trace of brown among the green
Bringing back the memories
That only you and I have seen
I sense Autumn coming on
The sun sinking red and deep
The fires burning in the fields
As late Summer falls asleep
The leaves begin to scatter
As the North wind calls their name
Folding gently back into
The silent earth from which they came
(c) The Winter Long
Still waters flow
Sea breezes blow
Wild flowers grow
Abundant at your feet
Soft falling snow
Warm candle glow
Flushed faces show
The pleasures when we meet
Hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
The winter long
I will always be with you
Hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
The winter long
I will always be with you
Hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
I will be the one
Who will always see you through
Hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
I will be the one
Who will always see you throughEmbed
