Still Small Voice LyricsI am the depth of age of the mountain
Yet still you believe to know how to be free
You are the life of the stars in the night sky
As constant much brighter yet younger than me
But I am the echo that calls you forever
The conscience that shows you the way to belong
And if you allow me I'll love you forever
And make you the voice of the words of my songEmbed
