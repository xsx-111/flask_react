Shine On Silver Sun LyricsVerse 1
Once I sat upon a hill
To watch the world go by
My friend the young magician
Had forbidden me to cry
But I was the comedian
With the laughs in short supply
Chorus
Shine on silver sun
Shine on everyone
Shine on silver sun
Shine on
Verse 2
The sunlight filtered softly
Through the pale and watery sky
To catch the mirrored salmon
As it rose to take the fly
The flowers on the riverbank
Were left alone to die
Chorus
Shine on silver sun
Shine on everyone
Shine on silver sun
Shine on
Verse 3
The church bells sounded midnight
As I rose to say goodbye
And a solitary tear
Fell from the corner of my eye
Chorus
Shine on silver sun
Shine on everyone
Shine on silver sun
Shine on everyone
Shine on silver sun
Shine on everyone
Shine on silver sun
Shine on
Shine onEmbed
