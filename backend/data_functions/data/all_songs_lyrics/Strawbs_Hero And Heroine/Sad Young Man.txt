Sad Young Man LyricsVerse 1
You look to me a sad young man
Down is where you're going
You've blindly found an easy way
You think that it's not showing
Chorus
Is this what you want
Is this what you're struggling to be
Brought your face to the ground
Won't you ever see
Verse 2
You came down south from Birmingham
Tired of all the faces
A stranger to a strange new town
Unfamiliar places
Chorus
You came down and you didn't know why
And then you didn't even try
Swept along by the crowd
Blown along like a cloud
Bridge
The heavy spell of dark and night
Your created isolation
This loneliness just need not be
You are your own creation
Verse 3
Though you may be down and out
Life need not be so heavy
For even though your dues are high
Should you become the levy
Chorus & Outro
Is this what you want
Is this what you're struggling to be
Is this what you want
Is this what you've struggled to be
Is this what you want
Is this what you're struggling to be
Is this what you want
Is this what you've struggled to beEmbed
