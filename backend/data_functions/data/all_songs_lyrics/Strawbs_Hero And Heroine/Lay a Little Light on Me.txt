Lay a Little Light on Me LyricsVerse 1
Watch my hand
See it shakes
Trembling as my life blood bleeds
Comfortless
Superfakes
Offering their empty creeds
Pre-Chorus
That have no faith or substance
That change to suit the doubter
To satisfy his needs
Chorus
Rid me of my darkness
Lay a little light on me
Clothe me with your brightness
Lay a little light on me
Oh save me someone
Lay a little light on me
Verse 2
Growing boys
Masturbate
Drink the wine and take the bread
Saintly priests
Castigate
Holy water for the head
Pre-Chorus
With shades of John the Baptist
Who came intent to rescue
But danced with death instead
Chorus
Rid me of my darkness
Lay a little light on me
Clothe me with your brightness
Lay a little light on me
Oh save me someone
Lay a little light on me
Interlude
Bridge
Bless the good, curse the bad
Some are wise, others mad
Phoney propheteers
Suitably seeming sad
Pre-Chorus
Preparing for the kingdom
Annointing us with wisdom
Convinced that we'll be glad
Chorus & Outro
Rid me of my darkness
Lay a little light on me
Clothe me with your brightness
Lay a little light on me
Oh save me someone
Lay a little light on me
Oh save me someone
Lay a little light on me
Oh save me someone
Lay a little light on me
Oh save me someone
Lay a little light on meEmbed
