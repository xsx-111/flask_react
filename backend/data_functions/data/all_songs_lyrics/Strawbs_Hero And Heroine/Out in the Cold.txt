Out in the Cold LyricsI walked in the city at midday
It was empty and bare
Looked in the mirror at midnight

I sucked on your breasts, your legs opened wide
I could scarcely believe all the pleasure inside
But now I know how it feels to be old
Out in the cold
Whoever believed in astrological signs

For now I know how it feels to be old
Out in the cold, out inEmbed
