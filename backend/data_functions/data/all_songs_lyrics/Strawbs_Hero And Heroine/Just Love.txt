Just Love LyricsI can see you through my window
With the world you just go passing by
I can hear you in my garden
Waiting for my flowers all to die
Nothing in here is real
Nothing in here is real
No matter how I try
I can't get you out of my mind
It's just love
Don't try to understand it
You can't put your arms around it
You might never love again
It's just love
Don't try to understand it
If you've money you'd best spend it
You might never love again
There's your face right in my mirror
I can hear you calling out my name
Feel your hand upon my shoulder
Will I ever be the same again
Nothing in here is real
Nothing in here is real
No matter how I try
I can't get you out of my mind
Without your song
Something's gone
Something good enough to hang your heart on
If you call me I will answer
You will always be my helping hand
And if I need you in my darkness
I know you will always understand
Nothing in here is real
Nothing in here is real
No matter how I try
I can't get you out of my mindEmbed
