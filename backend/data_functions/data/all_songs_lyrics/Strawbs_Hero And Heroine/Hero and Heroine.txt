Hero and Heroine LyricsHero's face was gaunt and tanned
His sail was set in search of land
His life-raft, solely by him manned
Was guided by the tide
Heroine wore fleecy white
She beckoned like some savior bright
Shipwrecked sailors in the night
Were bid welcome to her side
Where one man's search must surely cease
The irresistible white fleece
Led Hero in search of the peace
When she alone could offer
Thus he knelt before her feet
Wary lest their eyes should meet
He knew his life was incomplete
For he had yet to suffer
Enticing Heroine, so calm
Took Hero firmly by the arm
Told him that she meant no harm
That she alone could save him
Hero could no longer speak
Realizing he was weak
His life increasingly grew bleak
For all the love she gave to him
While storm clouds gathered high above
The heroine, he grew to love
Turned slowly to a snow white dove
And spread her wings to fly
Crushed and broken in the end
Hero watched his soul ascend
Knowing that he was condemned
To sail all alone to dieEmbed
