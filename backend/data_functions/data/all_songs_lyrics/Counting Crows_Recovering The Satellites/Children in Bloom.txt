Children in Bloom Lyrics
Children in bloom, cooking in the sun
Waiting for a room of our own
Leave my sister alone
She doesn't deserve this
She is a flower and I am a flower
And we are all alone

I gotta get out on my own
I gotta get up from this waiting, waiting at home
I gotta get out of this sunlight
It's melting my bones
I gotta get up from this slumber and just get myself home

All these wasted dreams
Just waiting for the sun to open
To open up my heart to anyone
Bring me some rain
Because I'm dying, I'm dying
And I can't get this damn thing closed again


Where's the fun house this year?
The fairground's deserted and the skies don't seem as near
But Nicole's my oldest friend
But the altar is empty and she'll never be a little girl again

I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find, I can't find
I can't find, I can't find
I can't find, I can't find my way home
