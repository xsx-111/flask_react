Goodnight Elisabeth Lyrics
I was wasted in the afternoon, waiting on a train
I woke up in pieces and Elisabeth had disappeared again
I wish you were inside of me, I hope that you're ok
I hope you're resting quietly

I just wanted to say
Goodnight, Elisabeth
Goodnight, Elisabeth

We couldn't all be cowboys, so some of us are clowns
Some of us are dancers on the midway
We roam from town to town
I hope that everybody can find a little flame
Me, I say my prayers, then I just light myself on fire
And I walk out on the wire once again


I will wait for you in Baton Rouge
I'll miss you down in New Orleans
I'll wait for you while she slips in something comfortable
And I'll miss you when I'm slipping in between
If you wrap yourself in daffodils, I will wrap myself in pain
And if you're the queen of California
Baby, I am the king of the rain
