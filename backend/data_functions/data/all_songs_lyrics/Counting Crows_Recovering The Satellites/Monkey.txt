Monkey Lyrics
All dressed up, no place to go
Hey monkey, when you gonna
Show your face around me?
I know all the wrongs and rights
And I just want a little light to fall on me

Hey monkey, where you been?
This lonely spiral I've been in
Hey monkey, when can we begin?
Hey monkey, where you been?

Well, I'm all messed up, that's nothing new
Hey monkey, when you open up your blue eyes
I don't know if I'm wide awake or dreaming
But all I ever need is everything


Just get the world off your shoulders
And close your pretty blue eyes
Hey monkey, what's life without
An occasional surprise?
I got nowhere but home to go
Got Ben Folds on my radio right now
And I'm in trouble for the things I need
Hey monkey, don't you want to be needed too?


Hey monkey, where you been?
Hey monkey, where you been?Embed
