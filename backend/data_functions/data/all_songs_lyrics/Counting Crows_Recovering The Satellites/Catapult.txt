Catapult LyricsAll of the sudden she disappears
Just yesterday she was here
Somebody tell me if I am sleeping
Someone should be with me here
('Cause I don't wanna be alone)
I wanna be the knife that cuts into my hand
And I wanna be scattered from here in this catapult
What a big baby
Won't somebody save me please?
You won't find nobody home
All of these quiet battered voices
Wait for the hunger to come
We got little revolvers and stupid choices
And no one to say when we're done
(Well, I don't wanna bring you down)
I wanna be the light that burns out your eyes
'Cause I know there's little things about me
That would sing in the silence of so much rejection
In every connection I make
I can't find nobody home
I wanna be the light that burns out your eyes
'Cause that I know there's little things about me
That would sing in the silence of so much rejection
In every connection I make
I wanna be the last thing that you hear when you're falling asleep
I wanna be the knife that cuts into my hand
And I wanna be scattered from here in this catapult
What a big baby
Won't somebody save me please?
I can't find nobody home1Embed
