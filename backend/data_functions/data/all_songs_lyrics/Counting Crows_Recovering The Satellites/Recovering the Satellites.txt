Recovering the Satellites Lyrics
Gonna get back to basics
Guess I'll start it up again
I'm falling from the ceiling
You're falling from the sky now and then

Maybe you were shot down in pieces
Maybe I slipped in between
But we we're gonna be the wildest, the wildest
The wildest people they ever hoped to see, just you and me

So why'd you come home to this sleepless town?
It's a lifetime commitment
Recovering the satellites
All anybody really wants to know is
When you're gonna come down
When you gonna come down

Your mother recognizes all your desperate displays
And she watches as her babies drift violently away
'Til they see themselves in telescopes
Do you see yourself in me?
We're such crazy babies, little monkey
God, we're so fucked up, you and me
So why'd you come home to this faithless town?
Where we make a lifetime commitment to recovering the satellites
And all anybody really wants to know is
When are you gonna come down, down, down, down, down
When you gonna come down?

She sees shooting stars and comet tails
She's got heaven in her eyes
She says, "I don't, I don't, I don't need to be an angel
But I'm nothing, I'm nothing if I'm not this high"

But we only stay in orbit for a moment of time
And then you're everybody's satellite
I wish that you were mine, I wish that you were mine

So why'd you come home to this angel's town?
It's a lifetime decision
Recovering the satellites
All everybody really knows for sure
Is you're gonna come down
That you're gonna come down2Embed
