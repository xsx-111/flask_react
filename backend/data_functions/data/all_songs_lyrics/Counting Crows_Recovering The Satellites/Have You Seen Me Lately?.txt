Have You Seen Me Lately? Lyrics
Get away from me, just get away from me
This isn't gonna be easy, but I don't need you
Believe me
Yeah, you got a piece of me
But it's just a little piece of me
And I don't need anyone
And these days, I feel like I'm fading away
Like sometimes when I hear myself on the radio

Have you seen me lately?
Have you seen me lately?
Have you seen me lately?
I was out on the radio, starting to change
Somewhere out in America, it's starting to rain
Could you tell me the things you remember about me?
And have you seen me lately?

I remember me and all the little things that make up a memory
Like she said she loved to watch me sleep
Like she said
"It's the breathing, it's the breathing in and out and in and..."

Have you seen me lately?
Have you seen me lately?
Have you seen me lately?
I was out on the radio, starting to change
Somewhere out in America, it's starting to rain
Could you tell me the things you remember about me?
And have you seen me lately?
You know, I thought that someone would notice
I thought somebody would say something if I was missing
Can't you see me?
Come on, color me in
Come on, color me in
Come on, color
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Give me your blue rain
Give me your black sky
Give me your green eyes
Come on, give me your white skin
Come on, give me your white skin
Come on, give me your white skin

'Cause I was out on the radio, starting to change
Somewhere out in America, it's starting to rain
Could you tell me the things you remember about me?
And have you seen me lately?
Have you seen me lately?
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Have you seen me lately?1Embed
