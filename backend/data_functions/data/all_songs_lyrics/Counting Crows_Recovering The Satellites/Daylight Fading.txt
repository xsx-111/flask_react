Daylight Fading Lyrics
Waiting for the moon to come and light me up inside
I am waiting for the telephone to tell me I'm alive
Well, I heard you let somebody get their fingers into you
It's getting cold in California, I guess I'll be leaving soon

Daylight fading, come and waste another year
All the the anger and the eloquence are bleeding into fear
Moonlight creeping around the corners of our lawn
When we see the early signs of daylight fading
We leave just before it's gone

She said everybody loves you, she says everybody cares
But all the things I keep inside myself, they vanish in the air
If you tell me that you'll wait for me, I'll say I won't be here
I want to say goodbye to you, goodbye to all my friends
Goodbye to everyone I know
