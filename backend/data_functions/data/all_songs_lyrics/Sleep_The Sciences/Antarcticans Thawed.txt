Antarcticans Thawed LyricsIce cap miles thaw to freedom
Sets free Antarctic legion
Awake limbs, to reach a sun's rays
Blood thaws throughout the unused veins
Antarcticans near the titan's base
Matterhorn's climb initiates
Mountain's highest point receives
Boards the skybarge to cross skysea
Matterhorn's children set free
From slab arise stoned priest
Hierophant sun prevails
Windship at last now sails
Glaciers formate upon the ice age siege
Walk the icebergs toward cities
Glaciers formate upon the ice age siege
Rise the icebergs as war machines1Embed
