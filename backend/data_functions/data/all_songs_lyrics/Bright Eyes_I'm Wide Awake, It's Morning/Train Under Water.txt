Train Under Water Lyrics
You were born inside of a raindrop
I watched you falling to your death
And the sun, well, she could not save you
She'd fallen down too, now the streets are wet

Body of water, toxic and timeless
Atlantic Ocean, New York skyline
I always get lost when I leave the village
So I couldn't come meet you in Brooklyn last night

But I sing glory from my lowest
And I will say peace to the people I meet
While the world waits for an explosion
That instant of life that wipes the slate clean

So don't be fooled, no, don't get lied to
Love was always cruel
And don't act strange, don't be a stranger
It happened to me, now it's happening to you
But if you take that train under water then we could talk it through

Well if I could tame all of my desires
Wait out the weather that howls in my brain
Because it seems that it's always changing
The wind's indecision, the sorrowful rain

Yeah, I was a postcard, I was a record
I was a camera until I went blind
And now I'm riding all over this island
Looking for something to open my eyes

But I still sing glory from my high rise
And I will say thanks if you're pouring my drinks
While the world waits for an explosion
That moment in time when we'll be set free

So don't stay mad, just let some time pass
And in the morning you'll wake feeling new
And if I don't come back, I mean, if I get side tracked
It's only cause I wanted to
I'm keeping up with the moon on an all-night avenue
