First Day of My Life Lyrics
This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don’t know where I am, I don’t know where I’ve been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I’d let you know
Yeah, these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home
Mhm, mhm

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up

And you said, “This is the first day of my life
I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now I don’t care, I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”
So if you wanna be with me
With these things there’s no telling, we just have to wait and see
But I’d rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery
Aha, mhm
Besides, maybe this time it's different
I mean, I really think you like me31Embed
