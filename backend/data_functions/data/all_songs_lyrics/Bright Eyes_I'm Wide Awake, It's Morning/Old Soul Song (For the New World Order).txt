Old Soul Song (For the New World Order) Lyrics
Grey light, new day, leaks through the window
An old soul song comes on the alarm-clock radio
We walk the 40 blocks to the middle
Of the place we heard that everything would be

And there were barricades to keep us off the street
But the crowd kept pushing forward
'Til they swallowed the police

Yeah they went wild
Yeah they went wild
Yeah they went wild
Yeah they went wild

We left before the dust had time to settle
And all the broken glass swept off the avenue
On the way home I held your camera like a Bible
Wishing so bad that it held some kind of truth

And I stood nervous next to you in the dark room
You drop the paper in the water
And it all begins to bloom
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild
Yeah they go wild

Just when I get so lonesome I can't speak
I see some flowers on a hillside
Like a wall of new TVs

Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild
Yeah, they go wild5Embed
