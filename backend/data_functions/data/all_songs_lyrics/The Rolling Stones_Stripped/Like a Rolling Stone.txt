Like a Rolling Stone Lyrics
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you
Yeah, people would call, say, Beware doll, you're
Bound to fall
You thought they were just kidding you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
And now you don't walk so proud
Now you don't talk so loud
About having to be scrounging
Your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

You went to the finest schools all right
Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody taught you how to
Live out on the street
But now you are going to have to get
Used to it
You said you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
That he's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, Do you want to make a deal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Just like a rolling stone

Yeah, the princess on the steeple
All the pretty people
Drinking, thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts
But you should better take that diamond ring
You should better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Now go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Just like a rolling stoneEmbed
