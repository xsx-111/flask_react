True Shred Guitar Lyrics
New Orleans!
What the fuck's up?
Come on!
There we go!
There we fucking go!
Woo!
Let's go! Alright!
Here we go!
I wanna see those fucking hands in the air!
Alright, 1, 2, 3, 4!

Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar

Enemies on your knees
Suffer please
Enemies carry the M16

Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
If you've seen what I've seen
Bury me
Burn the trees, baby please
Finish me

Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitar
Push it, push it, push it
True shred guitarEmbed
