Never Say Die Lyrics96 power
You know you wanna wanna
Because you're gonna gonna
Below the low tide
We never say die
I'd like to try to
Sit down beside you
But when I say dark
I don't mean the shade
Well, I'm prepared to
Fight and defend you
I'll never doubt you
A ribbon tied to
Above it's their time
Down here it's our time
Never say die
Live on
Or be gone
Or live on
Or be gone
Or wake up
Or break up
Or wake up
Or break up
Never say die
96 power
You took the low road
When you missed your window
You got it all wrong
With the inferno
Don't give up the ship
Or else the scale will tip
But when I say dark
I don't mean the shade
You took the low road
When you missed your window
You got it all wrong
With the inferno
Don't give up the ship
Or else the scale will tip
But when I say dark
I don't mean the shade
Well, I'm prepared to
Fight and defend you
I'll never doubt you
A ribbon tied to
Above it's their time
Down here it's our time
Never say die
Live on
Or be gone
Or live on
Or be gone
Or wake up
Or break up
Or wake up
Or break up
Never say die
