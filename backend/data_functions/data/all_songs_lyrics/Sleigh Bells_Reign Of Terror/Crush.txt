Crush Lyrics
With your hair in braids
Your mother tips the maid
Blind folded nun
You make the shotgun spray
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
You think you're classic today?
You must be basic, baby
You think you're classic today?
I better check on you
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?

I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you
(baby please)
I got a crush on you
I gotta crush you now

And what goes around
You know it comes around
And if it comes around
You know the kids are down
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
You want your hair pulled tight
You're so essential tonight
You always crush and come
You make the shotgun spray
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you
(baby please)
I got a crush on you
I gotta crush you now

And what goes around
You know it comes around
And if it comes around
You know the kids are down
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
You think you're classic today?
You must be basic, baby
You think you're classic today?
I better check on you
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?
Make you or break you!
Who are you gonna run to now?

I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you
(baby please)
I got a crush on you
I gotta crush you now
You love it!
You love it!
Baby please!
You love it!
You love it!
Baby please!
You love it!
You love it!
Baby please!
You love it!
You love it!
Baby please!

I got a crush on you
(Baby please!)
I got a crush on you
(baby please)
I got a crush on you
I gotta crush you now

And what goes around
You know it comes around
And what goes around
You know it comes around
And what goes around
You know it comes around
And what goes around
You know it comes aroundEmbed
