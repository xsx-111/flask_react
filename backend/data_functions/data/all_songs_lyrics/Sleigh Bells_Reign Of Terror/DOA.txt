DOA LyricsWipe the blood from your nose
How come nobody knows?
How the chorus should go?
How the chorus should go?
How come nobody knows?
Do you know how it feels?
When the rain hits the roof
But the roof of your mouth
Is not wet anymore?
Put the one by the two
Cut the rest into lines
But there's blood on the door
And you're feeling just fine
But you ran out of time
Wipe the blood from your nose
How come nobody knows
How the chorus should go?
Remember who you areEmbed
