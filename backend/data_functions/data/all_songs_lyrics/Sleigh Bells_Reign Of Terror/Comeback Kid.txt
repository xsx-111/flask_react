Comeback Kid Lyrics
I know it's hard but
You gotta deal with it
One look around
Show me what you're made of
Don't turn around
Go get your gun ready
Everyday there's a way to do it just right
Go on and take it and just say it isn't so
But you never know just when you're gonna go
Go on and take it and just say it isn't so
But you never know just when you're gonna go

Don't run away 'cause that's a deal breaker
You gotta turn around, never let your guard down
I see you but no one's gonna save you baby
You always run around breaking all the rules baby

I know you try so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid
I know you try so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid

You'll go away but, you'll come back some day
You'll go away but, you'll come back some day
I know it's hard but
You gotta deal with it
One look around
Show me what you're made of
Don't turn around
Go get your gun ready
Everyday there's a way to do it just right
Go on and take it and just say it isn't so
But you never know just when you're gonna go
Go on and take it and just say it isn't so
But you never know just when you're gonna go

You'll go away, but you'll come back some day
You'll go away, but you'll come back some day


I know you try so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid
I know you try so hard, but you can't even win
You gotta try a little harder, you're the comeback kid

You'll go away but, you'll come back some day
You'll go away but, you'll come back some dayEmbed
