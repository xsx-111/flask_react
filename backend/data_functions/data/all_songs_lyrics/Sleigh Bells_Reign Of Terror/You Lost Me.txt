You Lost Me Lyrics
You lost me

Behind the Circle K
Where our bodies lay
We took our lives away
We wanted it this way
We wanted it this way
Face down in the dirt
In your mini-skirt
Teeth touch the tracks
Yeah I got your back
Oh, I got your back

I don't want you to see me this way
I don't want you to see me this way
I don't want you to see me this way
I don't want you to see me this way
What a way to die
What a way to die
What a way to die
(In 1985)

Down in the ground we can sing from the grave
Take a breath, take a breath
I would never lie to you
But I'm gonna have to tell the truth
Oh (oh-oh), you lost me
Down in the ground we can sing from the grave
Take a breath, take a breath
I would never lie to you
But I'm gonna have to tell the truth
Oh (oh-oh), you lost me
Teenage metal heads
In your denim vests
Cause you're holding hands
Through your favorite bands
All your favorite bands
You're not the only ones
Down beneath the sun
Who never had any fun
You walk around town
With your heads way down

I don't want you to see me this way
I don't want you to see me this way
I don't want you to see me this way
I don't want you to see me this way
What a way to die
What a way to die
What a way to die
(In 1985)

Down in the ground we can sing from the grave
Take a breath, take a breath
I would never lie to you
But I'm gonna have to tell the truth
Oh (oh-oh), you lost me
Down in the ground we can sing from the grave
Take a breath, take a breath
I would never lie to you
But I'm gonna have to tell the truth
Oh (oh-oh), you lost me
