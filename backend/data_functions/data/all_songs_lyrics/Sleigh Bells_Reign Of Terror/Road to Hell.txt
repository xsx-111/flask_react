Road to Hell Lyrics(Machine gun fire)

Go away for awhile, cause you can’t
Cause you can’t see this again
Take a break from your friends if you ever
If you ever wanna see them again
Can you think for yourself just once?
You’re never gonna get back home
Cause you’re gonna discover
Ah-ah, alone on the telephone

Don’t run away from me, baby
Just go away from me, baby
Don’t run away from me, baby
Just go away from me, baby

Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hell
Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hell

Go away for awhile
If you can
You can be my only friend
When you’re tied to the bed
Ah-ah-ah
We can learn how to begin
Take apart this verse, again
If you’re so good at offense
I can say these words again
If you know how to defend
Don’t run away from me, baby
Just go away from me, baby
Don’t run away from me, baby
Just go away from me, baby

Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hell
Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hell

Don’t run away from me, baby
Just go away from me, baby
Don’t run away from me, baby
Just go away from me, baby

Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hell
Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hell
Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hell
Road to hell, road to hell, road to hell, road to hellEmbed
