Born to Lose Lyrics
Heard you say suicide in your sleep
Just get on with it, you were born to lose
Will you hang like the moon from a rope in your room
Oh you long for it, you were born to lose

Where did you go?
(All I know)
Where did you go?
(You can't choose)
Where did you go?
(Here I go. Born to lose.)
Where did you go?
(All I know)
Where did you go?
(You can't choose)
Where did you go?
(Here I go. Born to lose.)

Took a shot to the head in the back near the crib
Such a legend now you were born to lose
Cause I know that the pain keeps you close to the flame
You know everything, you were born to lose
Where did you go?
(All I know)
Where did you go?
(You can't choose)
Where did you go?
(Here I go. Born to lose.)
Where did you go?
(All I know)
Where did you go?
(You can't choose)
Where did you go?
(Here I go. Born to lose.)


Where did you go?
(All I know)
Where did you go?
(You can't choose)
Where did you go?
(Here I go. Born to lose.)
Where did you go?
(All I know)
Where did you go?
(You can't choose)
Where did you go?
(Here I go. Born to lose.)Embed
