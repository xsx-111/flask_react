Leader of the Pack Lyrics
Do you remember when
You used to sleep at night
And when somebody dies
You see them lifting
But you know, you know
It's not over
Do you remember when
You had no need for lies
And now your mother cries
And nothing matters much
You know, you know
It's not over

Don't you know
He's never coming back again
Don't you know
He's never coming back again


Do you remember when
You used to walk on by
And now you run and hide
Pretend they never knew
You know, you know
That it's over
Don't you know
He's never coming back again
Don't you know
He's never coming back againEmbed
