Send to Robin Immediately Lyrics
Baby, forgive me
Baby, forgive me
Baby, forgive me, mmm

If you got something to say
I need to hear it
I need to hear it
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Say it immediately
Say it immediately

If you got something to say, say it right away
If you got something to do, do what's right for you
If you got somebody to love, give that love today
Know you got nothing to lose, there's no time to waste
If you got a letter for me, send it right away
If you know that you really care, don't hold your breath
If you want the gold and the honey, come get it right away
Baby, come get it right away
If you got something to say
(Say it immediately)
If you got something to do
(Ooh)
If you got somebody to love
(Say it immediately)
Know you got nothing to lose
If you got something to say
I need to hear it
(Say it immediately)
I need to hear it
Tonight
(Say it immediately)
Say it tonight2Embed
