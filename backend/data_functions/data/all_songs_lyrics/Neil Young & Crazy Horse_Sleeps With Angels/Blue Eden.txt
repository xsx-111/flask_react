Blue Eden Lyrics
Embracing, distorting, supporting, comforting
Convincing you, consoling you
Controlling you, destroying you
All over you
I know someday we'll meet again
We come and go that way my friend
It's part of me, it's part of you

You feel invincible, it's just a part of life
You feel invincible, it's just a part of life1Embed
