Train of Love Lyrics
Train of love
Racing from heart to heart
Running late
Still in the lonely part
This train will never run me down
But only take me where I'm bound
It's part of me and part of you
I'll always be a part of you
Sail along, sail along silver moon
Don't be blue
Throw shadows in my room
I know in time we'll meet again
We come and go that way, my friend
It's part of me and part of you
I'll always be a part of you
"To love and honor until death do us part"
Repeat after me
This train is never going back
When the lonesome whistle blows
No one knows, no one knows

Train of love, Train of love
It's part of me, it's part of you
Train of loveEmbed
