Safeway Cart LyricsLike a Safeway cart rolling down the street
Like a sandal mark on the Savior's feet
Just keep rolling on it's a ghetto dawn
Baby looks so bad with her TV eyes
Going, going, gone and the picture cries
It's a ghetto dawn
Baby looks so bad with her TV eyes
Going, going, gone and the picture cries
Baby looks so bad with her TV eyes
Like a Safeway cart rolling down the street
Past the Handy mart to the Savior's feet
Going, going, gone and the picture cries
Baby looks so sad
Baby looks so bad
It's a ghetto dawn
Like a Safeway cart rolling down the street
Like a sandal mark on the Savior's feet
Just keep rolling on to a ghetto dawnEmbed
