Western Hero LyricsFrontier town, home of the western hero
Frontier justice, dealt with the iron hand
He wore a long coat to the ground
He wore big boots that made a sound
He wore a six gun on his hip
But now he doesn't carry it
Sure enough, he was a western hero
On the deck, sighting an old Jap zero
And on the shores at Normandy
He fought for you, he fought for me
Across the land and on the sea
But now he's just a memory
And in the distance, the rocket's red glare
The bombs burst in the air
This time we're never going back
Through the years he changed somehow
He's different now
He's different now
Open fire, here comes the western hero
Standing there, big money in his hand
Sure enough, he was a western hero, Sure enoughEmbed
