A Dream That Can Last Lyrics
I feel like I died and went to Heaven
The cupboards are bare but the streets are paved with gold

I saw a young girl who didn't die
I saw a glimmer from in her eye
I saw the distance, I saw the past
And I know I won't awaken, it's a dream that can last


And all the lights were turned down low
And no one wondered or had to go
Out on the corner the angels say
There is a better life for me someday
