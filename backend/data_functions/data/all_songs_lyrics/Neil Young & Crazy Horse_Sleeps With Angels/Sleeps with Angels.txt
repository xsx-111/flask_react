Sleeps with Angels Lyrics
She wasn't perfect
She had some trips of her own
He wasn't worried
At least he wasn't alone (Too late)
He sleeps with angels (Too soon)
He's always on someone's mind

He sleeps with angels (Too late)
He sleeps with angels (Too soon)

She was a teen queen
She saw the dark side of life
She made things happen
But when he did it that night
She ran up phone bills
She moved around from town to town (Too late)
He sleeps with angels (Too soon)
He's always on someone's mind
