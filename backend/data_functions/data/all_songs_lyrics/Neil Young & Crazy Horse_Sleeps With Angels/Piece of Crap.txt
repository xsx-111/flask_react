Piece of Crap Lyrics
Tried to save the trees
Bought a plastic bag
The bottom fell out

It was a piece of crap
Piece of crap

Saw it on the tube
Bought it on the phone
Now you're home alone


I tried to plug in it
I tried to turn it on
When I got it home


Got it from a friend
On him you can depend
I found out in the end

I'm trying to save the trees
I saw it on TV
They cut the forest down
To build a piece of crap
I went back to the store
They gave me four more
The guy told me at the door
