Prime of Life Lyrics
Shadows climb up the garden wall
Upon the green the first leaf falls
It's the prime of life and the king and queen
Step out into the sun, (Oh yeah)

Are you feeling all right
Not feeling too bad myself
Are you feeling all right, my friend?

Footsteps run down the castle hall
To the rooms of the paper doll
It's the prime of life, where the spirit grows
And the mirror shows both ways (Oh yeah)


When I first saw your face
It took my breath away

Shadows fly up the garden wall
Upon the green the first leaf falls
It's the prime of life and the king and queen
Step out into the sun (Oh yeah)
