My Heart Lyrics
Down in the valley, the shepherd sees his flock is close at hand
And in the night sky, a star is falling down from someone's hand
Somewhere, somewhere, I got to get somewhere
It's not too late, it's not too late, I've got to get somewhere
This time I will take the lead somehow
This time you won't have to show me how
When dreams come crashing down like trees
I don't know what love can do
When life is hanging in the breeze
I don't know what love can do
My heart, my heart, I've got to keep my heart
It's not too late, it's not too late I've got to keep my heart
My love, I will give to you, it's true
Although I'm not sure what love can do
Somewhere, somewhere, I've got to get somewhere
It's not too late, it's not too late, I've got to get somewhere
Somewhere, someone has a dream come true
Somehow, someone has a dream come trueEmbed
