Honey Bee LyricsLike a queen bee's honey....Your as sweet as can be
I'm the king baby....Buzz with me
Dive in your hive....And into your life
Tell me little baby that you'll buzz me all the time
'Cause the way we kiss....Just can't miss
Don't make me wait to feel your warm embrace
Each and every time that we get the chance
Come on little baby let's make some romance
Yeah you really groove me baby when you move your hips
Shake it all around and change me pound for pound
I want you all the time just because
You know you really have give me a buzzEmbed
