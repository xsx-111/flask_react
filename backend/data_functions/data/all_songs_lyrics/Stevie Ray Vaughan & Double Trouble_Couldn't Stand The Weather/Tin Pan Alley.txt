Tin Pan Alley Lyrics
Went down to Tin Pan Alley
See what was going on
Things was too hot down there
Couldn't stay very long

Hey hey hey hey
Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
Livin' for their whisky, wine, and gin

I heard a woman scream
Yeah and I peeked through the door
Some cat was workin' on Annie with a
Lord with a two-by-four

Hey hey hey hey
Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
Livin' for their whisky, wine, and gin

I heard a pistol shoot
Yeah and it was a .44
Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didn't
Shake, rattle, and roll
Hey hey hey hey
Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there
Killin' for their whisky, wine, and gin

I saw a cop standin'
With his hand on his gun
Said "This is a raid boys
Nobody run"

Hey, Hey, Hey
Alley's the roughest place I've ever been
Yeah they took me away from tin pan alley
And took me right back...to the penEmbed
