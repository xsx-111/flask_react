Eyes Wide Open Lyrics
Well here it comes, here comes another day
Another decision on the way
Well here it comes, here comes a color display
Of preferences to make
Well here it comes, here comes a knock on the door
Open it for an opportunity
Well here it comes, here comes a another day
For memories to be made

Eyes wide open
Eyes wide open all the time

There it was, it was a perfect take
And were you asleep or awake?
Well there it was, it was a perfect time
To speak your mind
And there it was, it was the chance of a lifetime
Flew right by, and what did you do?
Well there it was, it was another day
For memories to be made

Eyes wide open
Eyes wide open all the time
I've got my eyes wide open
Eyes wide open all the time
'Cause you never know what you might see

Eyes wide open
Eyes wide open all the time
I've got my eyes wide open
All the time
Eyes wide open
'Cause you never know what you might seeEmbed
