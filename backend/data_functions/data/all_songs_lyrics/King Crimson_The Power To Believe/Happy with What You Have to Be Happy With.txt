Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With Lyrics
And when I have some words
This is the way I'll sing
Through a distortion box
To make them menacing, yeah

Yes, I'm gonna have to write a chorus
Iâ€™m gonna need to have a chorus
And this would seem to be as good as any other place to sing it till I'm blue in the face

And for a second verse
Of terse economy
I'll brew another pot
Of ambiguity, yeah

Then I'm gonna have to write a chorus
We're gonna need to have a chorus
And this would seem to be as good as any other place to sing it till I'm blue in the face
Yes, we're gonna need to have a chorus
I'm gonna have to write a chorus
And this would seem to be as good as any other place to sing it till I'm blue in the face

Happy with what you have to be happy with
You have to be happy with what you have
To be happy with what you have
Happy with what you have to be happy with
You have to be happy with what you have
To be happy with what you have
You have to be happy with what you have to happy with
Then I guess I'll repeat the chorus
We're gonna repeat the chorus
I guess I'll repeat the chorus
We're gonna repeat the chorus
Then I guess I'll repeat the chorus
We're gonna repeat the chorus
I guess I'll repeat the chorus
We're gonna repeat the chorus

Happy with what you have to be happy with
You have to be happy with what you have
To be happy with what you have
Happy with what you have to be happy with
You have to be happy with what you have
To be happy with what you have
You have to be happy with what you have to happy withEmbed
