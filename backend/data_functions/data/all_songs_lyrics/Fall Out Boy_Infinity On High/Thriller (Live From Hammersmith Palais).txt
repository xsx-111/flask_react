Thriller (Live From Hammersmith Palais) Lyrics

Last summer, we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, "Now in stores!"

Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix mе in forty-five

I can take your problems away with a nod and a wavе
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am

The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five

Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)
Long live the car crash hearts
(Long live the car crash hearts)

So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five, hehe, woo!
