Supermoon Lyrics
Supermoon
When all the diamond deals are made
We never used to live this long
We’re pioneers, my dear, press on
Move along
And if my smile
Seems painted on once in awhile
I can count on you
To notice and to take me out

Would you like to start a river
And ride it like a painted carousel?
Our life savings aren't enough
We'll have to lobby hard and make it up
Make it up

Supermoon
We never used to live this long
Pioneers, my dear
Pioneers are pressin' on, movin' along
And if my smile
Seems straight as the Tropic of Cancer, it’s because (Cancer, it’s because)
Nature isn’t magic
It’s just a mystery to us
Would you like to start a river?
Ride it like a painted carousel
Our life savings aren't enough
We'll have to lobby hard and make it up
Make it up

Tell me if you feel it
And we'll mine it to reveal it
From the dams up to the turbines
Tell me if you feel it
And we'll mine it to reveal it
From the dams up to the turbines
They're running much too hot
To meter

Would you like to start a river?
*Ride it like a painted carousel*
Would you like to start a river?
*Ride it like a painted carousel*
Would you like to start a river?
*Ride it like a painted carousel*1Embed
