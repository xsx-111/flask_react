Best Kept Secret Lyrics
December, I was lost in darkness that I couldn't shake
Called you in California and you answered right away
You answered right away
You picked up right away
You were workin' at the table that your father made
You were gonna teach guitar to half the kids across L.A
All across L.A
Half the kids across L.A

You're the best-kept secret in Silver Lake

I talked about my misery, you called it pain of pain
How we let it pile on until we go insane
'Til we go insane
Until we go insane

You're the best-kept secret in Silver Lake

Oh, you can sing and you can really play
(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)
You're the real thing
Your heart's in the right place
(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)

When we hung up, I was lifted, turned my head up to the rain
Shortest day of winter, but the light found me again
Found me again
The light came rollin' in

Yeah, you're the best-kept secret in Silver Lake

Oh, you can sing and you can really play
(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)
You're the real thing
Your heart's in the right place
You're the best-kept secret in Silver Lake
(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)
You're the best-kept secret in Silver Lake
(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)
You're the best-kept secret in Silver Lake
You're the best-kept secret in Silver Lake
(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)Embed
