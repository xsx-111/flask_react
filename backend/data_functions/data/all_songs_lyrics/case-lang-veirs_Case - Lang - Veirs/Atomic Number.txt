Atomic Number Lyrics
I'm not the freckled maid
I'm not the fair-hair girl
I'm not a pan of milk for you to spoil

Why are the wholesome things
The ones we make obscene?

Latin words across my heart
Symbols of infinity
Elements so pure
Atomic number

I am the spark
Of this machine
Purring like the city bus

Why are the wholesome things
The ones we make obscene?
Well if your mercy's lost
I have enough for us
Latin words across my heart
Symbols of infinity
Elements so pure
Atomic number
Latin words across my heart
Symbols of infinity
Elements so pure
Atomic number
My atomic number
My atomic number
My atomic numberEmbed
