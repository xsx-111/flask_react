Honey and Smoke Lyrics
I watch as they dance with you
I watch as they sing to you
I watch as they pour honey in your ear
Like moths with their tattered wings
Swing back into your flame again
But dear, can't you see
There’s nothin' for you here?

'Cause I know (I know, I know, I know, I know)
It’s all honey and smoke
They don’t really love you
Like I do

Unaware
Of just how beautiful you are from within
Un-containable
Exquisite to the detail
It hypnotizes people
Robs 'em of their social graces
Swarming to your glow
Fanning you with phrases

I know (I know, I know, I know, I know)
It’s all honey and smoke
They don’t really love you
Like I do
And I know (I know, I know, I know, I know)
It’s all honey and smoke
They don’t really love you
Like I do

I watch as they sing to you
I watch as they dance with you
I watch as they pour
Honey in your ear
It's just honey in your ear
Just honey in your earEmbed
