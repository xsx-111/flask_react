Greens of June Lyrics
Just in the moment
Everything's changed
My dark disposition
Has been rearranged
And what was I thinking
Out there on the ledge?
Your steady eyes pull me
Straight back from the edge

And all the greens of June (All the greens of June)
And all the greens of June
Come blowin' through the door
They make me wanna live (Make me wanna live)
They make me wanna live
Like I never have before

From the Oriental rug
You meet my gaze
And all my desperation
Retreats into the haze
And lilacs in the vase
Still got their life
By their witnesses
Perfume and light
And all the greens of June (All the greens of June)
And all the greens of June
Come blowin' through the door
They make me wanna live (Make me wanna live)
They make me wanna live
Like I never have before

Just in the moment
Everything's changed
My dark disposition
Has been rearrangedEmbed
