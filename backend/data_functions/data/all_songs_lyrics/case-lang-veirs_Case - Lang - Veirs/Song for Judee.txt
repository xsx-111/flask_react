Song for Judee Lyrics
You wrote "The Kiss", and it is beautiful
I can listen again and again
You never really got a break
From the car wrecks and the pain

You loved the Sons of the Pioneers
And the Hollywood cowboy stars
You were just trying to put a hand
To where we are
Where we are
Where we are

Livin' in a '55 Cadillac
Five people sleep in shifts
Robbin' liquor stores and going back
With the cash and rollin' in it

You loved the Sons of the Pioneers
And the Hollywood cowboy stars
You were just trying to put a hand
To where we are
You never talked about your past
About the drugs and walkin' in the streets
They found you with a needle in your arm
Beloved books strewn around at your feet

You loved the Sons of the Pioneers
And the Hollywood cowboy stars
You were just trying to put a hand
To where we are
You loved the Sons of the Pioneers
And the Hollywood cowboy stars
You were just trying to put a hand
To where we are
Where we are
Where we are
Where we areEmbed
