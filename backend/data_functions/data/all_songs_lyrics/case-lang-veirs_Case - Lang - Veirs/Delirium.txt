Delirium Lyrics
I kissed you in the mornin'
But only in my mind’s eye
The sun, it rolls along your sleeping dunes (Sleeping dunes)
The smell upon your skin is fireworks (Fireworks)

Delirium, delirium
Kaleidoscoping in
Could you love me too
In my delirium?

Lions of the lambs come filing in
Pacin' through the still around the bed
Halos of their royal breathing
Break like waves across the ceiling
In our dreams, do you know
I’m the only thing between you
And that heartbreak feeling?

Delirium, delirium
Kaleidoscoping in
Could you love me too
In my delirium?
Is it still the mornin'?
We left no trail of time
You’re camouflaged so fate can’t take you from my
(Take you from my)

Delirium, delirium
Kaleidoscoping in
Could you love me too?
Could you love me too
In my delirium?Embed
