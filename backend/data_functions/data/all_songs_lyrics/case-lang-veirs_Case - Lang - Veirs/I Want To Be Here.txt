I Want To Be Here LyricsI just want
I wanna be here with you
Not bracing
For what comes next
I got some new words
I can see sideways
If there’s a limit
It hasn’t found me yet
My friend is an artist
Doesn’t fit in
Lost a front tooth
Can’t keep a job
But the things you make
Are so beautiful
They bring me joy
Don’t you ever stop
The hungry fools who rule the world can’t catch us
Surely they can’t ruin everything
I just want
I wanna be here with you
Not bracing
For what comes next
The hungry fools who rule the world can’t catch us
Surely they can’t ruin everything
I just want
I wanna be here with you
Not bracing
For what comes next
I got some new words
I can see sideways
If there’s a limit
It hasn’t found me yetEmbed
