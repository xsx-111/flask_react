Why Do We Fight Lyrics
I can meet you in the ring
Let the spit and punches fly
I can meet you in the ring
Where one of us is bound to cry

Why do we fight?
Why do we fight?
Why do we fight?

How can a love so pure and true
Have me falling through the ropes? (Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin')
Can a love make me so cruel
To lose my faith, and lose my hope?

Why do we fight?
Why do we fight?
Why do we fight?

Let’s face up to the fact
That face down on the mat
Won’t solve this or anybody else’s fight
It’s not hard to figure out
There’s no victory in doubt
Why do we fight?
Why do we fight?
Why do we fight?Embed
