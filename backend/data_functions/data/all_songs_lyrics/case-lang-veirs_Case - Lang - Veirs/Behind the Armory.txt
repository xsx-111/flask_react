Behind the Armory Lyrics
Flies in amber, sand in soap
Brass trapped in the glass
Tongue-tied, I cut and run
Fleeing ever faster

Behind the armory
I will never let you see
Behind the armory
Still, I want you to love me

Sleeping giant, Joan of Arc
Fold me in your grace
From the garbage to the stars
We'll make new constellations

Behind the armory
Still, I want you to love me
Still, I want you to love me

Through the vines and the street
Slants the light and the heat
As narrow as the archer’s window grows
But it’s a rare stone
In a century thrown to me
Through the vines from the streets
Slants the light and the heat
As narrow as the archer’s window grows

Behind the armory
I will never let you see
Behind the armory
Still, I want you to love me
Still, I want you to love meEmbed
