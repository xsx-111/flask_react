1,000 Miles Away Lyrics
I’m out in the cold
I gaze through your window
The music’s on
I’m watchin' you sway
Just yesterday
In February’s dark
We watched the stars
Explode until daybreak

How can you stand right there and be a thousand miles away?
A thousand miles away

I saw a light in your eyes
It was the animal kind
All fierce and bright
Now every color fades
I’m out in the snow
In your golden glow
I feel no heat
From my feet up to my face

How can you stand right there and be a thousand miles away?
A thousand miles awayEmbed
