Blue Fires LyricsWhy does the heart of the flame burn blue?
Why do January cherries bloom?
Why do blue fires burn in me
Yet not in you?
How can the prairie flocks keep their courses true
And navigate the stars as they do?
How can blue fires burn in me
Yet not in you?
Yet not in you?
You tell me you’re here (Telling me you're here)
But your words are like fumes
They just disappear
Now all (All) the heat’s (Heat)
Rushing out of the room
The hottest part of this flame
Burns blue
The January cherries bloom
But not in you
Yet not in youEmbed
