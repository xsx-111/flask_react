Down I-5 Lyrics
Drivin' down I-5
I don't ever wanna die
'Cause I'd no more get to see
All this beauty passin' by me
Laundry on the line
Truckers passin' on the right
Every color on the wind
You know you're livin' if you've sinned
Down I-5
(Down I-5)
Shoulder's burning in the window
I should roll it up, I know
I pass the signs that promise hell
They don't know me at all

Some are born to sweet delight, and
Some are born to endless night
Born to endless night

But for now, all is well
I see the horses on the hill
I smell the cut grass on the air
Feel the wind hot in my hair
Down I-5
(Down I-5)
Some are born to sweet delight, and
Some are born to endless night
Born to endless night

I've tasted both, they are the same
To each other, turn again
Drivin' down I-5
I don't ever wanna die
'Cause I'd no more get to see
All this beauty passin' by meEmbed
