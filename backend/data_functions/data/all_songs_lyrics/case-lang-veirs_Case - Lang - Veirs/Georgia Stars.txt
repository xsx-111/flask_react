Georgia Stars Lyrics
We took a trip, my Georgia and me
Up through the wild strawberries
Up past the rivers runnin' loud
We pitched a tent above the clouds

Georgia, Georgia
Can you hear me callin' in the grave?
Alone in fields all frozen
Tiger eyes, you stop and gaze
At the stars goin' blue
My Georgia, I still love you
Stars goin' blue
My Georgia, I still love you

Great bear, dog, bull, flyin' fish
Scorpion, peacock, make your wish
Pleiades sisters, seven on high
Singin' in the heavenâ€™s silver light

Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
You showed me the stars
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
Wherever you are
Georgia, Georgia
Can you hear me callin' in the grave?
Alone in the fields all frozen
Tiger eyes, you stop and gaze
At the stars goin' blue
My Georgia, I still love you
Stars goin' blue
My Georgia, I still love you

Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
You showed me the stars
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
Wherever you are
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
You showed me the stars
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
Wherever you are
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
You showed me the stars
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
Wherever you are
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
You showed me the stars
Ah-ha, oh-woa-ho-oh
Wherever you areEmbed
