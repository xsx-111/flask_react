Springtime Is the Season LyricsThe summer's good for tulips, though pansies disagree
They find the heat most distasteful and humidity
Far too grim to stand up tall and bargain with the bees
They prefer to droop and mope and wait for autumn's breeze
The autumn's good for pumpkins, though apples don't approve
The trees that they've been living on, now forces them to move
And rudely lets them to fall, and sends them quick to their demise
Without so much a bon voyage or even a goodbye
The winter's good for penguins, though brown bears must object
When talk comes to the joys of winter, they must interject
"Hibernating in the snow just isn't where it's at
'Cause sleeping makes you skinny and we bears like to be fat"
The springtime is the season where everyone's a friend
Loneliness and desperation both come to an end
No matter how you died through winter, in spring you're born again
Your life might not be going good but spring helps you to pretendEmbed
