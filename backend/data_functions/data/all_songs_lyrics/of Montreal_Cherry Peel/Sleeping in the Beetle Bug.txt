Sleeping in the Beetle Bug Lyrics
Sleeping in the beetle bug
With a hundred pounds of air in my heart
Don't think that I'm able to sympathize
I'm happier to see it gone

Floating above your house
Like a penguin dropping cherries from my mouth
Tapping the walnuts and the shadows
Out of a dreaming pair of brown eyed ghosts

In each of your eyes, I saw it's spring
Where every mouth wakes up
To a smile and a yawn, grass is long and laughs
When the wind jumps through it

It must have started with that stick in the mud
That there's where clouds are born
Clouds can't stay where they are born
Winds push them so far from home

The sound of your laughter
Tiptoeing across the floor
Makes the deepest of red umbrellas
Able to inflate my smile
In each of your eyes, I saw it's spring
Where every mouth wakes up
To a smile and a yawn, grass is long and laughs
When the wind jumps through itEmbed
