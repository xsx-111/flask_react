Spare Some Love LyricsShadows darkness, follows quiet shadows
You walk beside a shadow
Strangers, people passing constant strangers
You walk beside a stranger
Spare some love
Why won't you spare some love?
Share your love
Why don't you share your love?
Sadness finds the lonely silent sadness
Finds them hard with sadness
Seeking growing you will find with seeking
Knowing you are seeking
Spare some love
Why won't you spare some love?
Share your love
Why don't you share your love?
Spare some love
Why won't you spare some love?
Share your love
Why don't you share your love?
Seasons, nature's pattern of the seasons
Changing with the seasons
Loving peace will come to all with loving
Living lives with loving
Spare some love
Why won't you spare some love?
Share your love
Why don't you share your love?Embed
