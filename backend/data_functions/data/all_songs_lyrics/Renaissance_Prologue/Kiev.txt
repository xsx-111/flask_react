Kiev LyricsHe was a man just a simple man
His thoughts and pleasures were few
His bread he shared with his father
That was the life that he knew
And how the snow fell in Kiev today
And how the wind drove the mourners away
Now there is only one man at the grave of Davorian
And this man's heart is to heavy to pray
He was a man just a simple man
Died at the place of his birth
His tombstone shared by the family
A silent place on the earth
An old man stands by the side of the grave
And this man's heart is too heavy to pray
For he is numb with the pain
Of the love that he couldn't share
Until he died there in Kiev today

He was a man just a simple man
Died at the place of his birth
His tombstone shared by the family
A silent place on the earth
An old man stands by the side of the grave
And this man's heart is to heavy to pray
For he is numb with the pain
Of the love that he couldn't share
And two men died there in Kiev todayEmbed
