Majestic LyricsThere is still no such reality as something
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
The cameras pan up to the audience and we're on TV, we're actually on TV and I'm waving
When you say that kind of thing does that mean that you kind of trip over the words?
That means that I kind of garble it all upEmbed
