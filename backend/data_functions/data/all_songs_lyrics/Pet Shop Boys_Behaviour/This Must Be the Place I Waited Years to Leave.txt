This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave Lyrics
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention

(Everybody e-e-everybody)
Each morning after Sunblest
(Everybody e-e-everybody)
Feel the benefit, mental arithmetic
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
I waited by the staff room
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
In time for benediction
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)

Living a law just short of delusion
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
When we fall in love there's confusion
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
This must be the place I waited years to leave
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention)
(Everybody e-e-everybody)
To our voices nobody's listening
(Everybody e-e-everybody)
We shiver in the rain by the touchline
(Everybody e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
Then a coach ride to the station
(Everybody e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
"My lord, the carriage awaiteth!"
(Everybody e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)

Living a law just short of delusion
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
When we fall in love there's confusion
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
This must be the place I waited years to leave
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention)
This must be the place I waited years to leave
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention)

And how
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
How long?
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
I'm listening to the words I thought I'd never hear again
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
A litany of saints and other ordinary men
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
Kneeling on the parquet, whatever has gone wrong?
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
The fear and feeling hopelessness, I don't want to belong
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)

Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
(Lenin)

I dreamt I was back in uniform
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
And a candidate for examination
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
History, someone had blundered
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
And a voice rapped "knuckle under!"
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
Living a law just short of delusion
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
When we fall in love there's confusion
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
This must be the place I waited years to leave
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention)
This must be the place I waited years to leave
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention)

And how
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
And how
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
How long?
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody)
(Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention)

Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody, e-e-everybody
Everybody, e-e-everybody, everybody jump to attention

"Требует наш народ одного: раздавите проклятую гадину!"Embed
