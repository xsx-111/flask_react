Hyperactive LyricsIt's just another day of my life
In the high res next gen wonderland
I curse the sun
Getting out of bed
I hope my sell-by date
Didn't expire yesterday
The torture porn on the red roy disc
A sweet kiss of liquid modernity
We have no time for your mistakes

"Here, you have to run as fast as you can to stay in the same place."
You're too blurry my friend
You're too slow
You're too predictable
Too below
This is all I can hear in my mind
When I try to believe
I'll stand the pace of this run
Breathe in
Breathe out
It's just another day of my life
