Driven to Destruction LyricsI don't know where to begin
Feel a cleaving in my mind
I can't get my act together
Buzz in my head is too loud
I know something's wrong with me
It's starting to burn out my soul
But I feel so weird in here
When you just sit, listen and nod
All my life
I've been trying to deny and deceive myself
Sense of insecurity
Restlessness
The turning out
Hatred for my inner chaos
And the color of your couch
I've just had this trouble all my life
Of getting out what is inside
Now I run
But cannot hide
No matter how much I do for them
No matter how much I do for myself
No matter which way I look at it
Fulfillment passes me by
Distracted inner self
On the brink of chaos
Lost it's way
Impatient inner self
On the brink of chaos
Lost it's way
Distracted inner self
I'm tuning out
Impatient inner self
I'm spacing out
Distracted inner self
On the brink of chaos
Lost it's wayEmbed
