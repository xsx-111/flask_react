Anna LyricsAnna, do you ever wonder
Why I'm here, sitting with all of the Queen's men?
Is it awkward?
Or are they friends?
I've seen some of these faces before
I'm sure
And I was only asking for what I knew was mine
And I was only asking for what I knew was mine
But I could never ask for love cos that's not right
But I would always ask for
Anna, I know you worry
Whatever you think I'm doing on a night
You're probably right
Well either way
I'm left kicking the sides of the stall
The stall
And I was only asking for what I knew was mine
And I was only asking for what I knew was mine
But I could never ask for love cos that's not right
But I would always ask for her
I'm not yet who I wanna be
So help me to changeEmbed
