I Should Have Helped LyricsYou should take it back in no circumstance
I understand remember
The man on the street is wrong
Again
I used to think I knew something that
No-one else knew, I was a fool
When a lonely voice
In a lonely town
Just couldn't tell
I should have helped out
And the times you'd wait
Outside the corn exchange
With ghosts and rain
You were lost when the cloud came down
My friend
When a loved one's dead
You look at the sky
In a different way, but that's OK
Cos perfect things still can break your heart
That's not to say
I'd ever change that
There's always still guiltEmbed
