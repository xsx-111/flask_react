Pure O LyricsPure O
You have me hurting
You should know that
I was certain in my head
When you know, you know
I can't change
Goddamn the times I thought of nothing
But the things I couldn't prove
So perfect in my devising
I laid it all on you
And your lonely heart, under pressure
A petal in a book
I carry this around for luck
Cos I've got something I can't say
Pure O
You have me hurting
You should know that
I was certain in my head
When you know, you know
And that's the main thing
You should know that
I was certain in my head
Protect me still my treasured secret
In ways misunderstood
She keeps me still with over-thinking
I'd love to hold you but
My hands were tied so the chance was wasted
The thousandth never took
I carry this around
Cos I've got something I can't say
Pure O, oh I have wasted
So many years just on the same trip
Late night fervour
Yeah I was nervous
That she don't know yet
If I was only part timeEmbed
