Like a Gift Giver LyricsLittle birds in a box of tea
Just waiting to die
Like a gift-giver
I will change the way that you see
Or I'll try
But I know, it's not even
But try, when you're in heaven
To call me up
It's hard to believe in anything
That I've learned in my life
But whisper something trivial that sounds good
And I might
But I know, It's not even
But try, when you're in heaven
To call me upEmbed
