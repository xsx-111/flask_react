Confident Men LyricsIt was a Parisian fluke, and what did I do?
I sat on a bollard and didn't move, although I knew that
That there is something I just can't pretend
Confident men and their unwelcome friends
Always win in the end
Always
Read into signs like a knowing wink, more than I should
Emails that drowned in lovers ink know that I would
Make poor excuses for the things I never dared
I would have kissed you but the moon was there
Watching no-one care
No way
With spirit waltzing
I found something
That belonged to you
Years ago
The emails were drowned in lovers ink
For their own good
I'll tell you something I just can't pretend
Confident men and their unwelcome friends
Will kill me in the end
AlwaysEmbed
