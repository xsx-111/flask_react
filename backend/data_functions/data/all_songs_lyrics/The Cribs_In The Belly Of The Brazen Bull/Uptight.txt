Uptight LyricsTonight it seems unsure
If I made it up but then
We got nine hours or more
It makes no difference
Cos that thought drifts right in, on a Foehn wind
And tries to take me back
So I might have to go
Oh no
No-one has to tell me I know I have to let it go
But it's so nice being uptight
So sorry that I never will be the kind of guy you'd like
But it's so nice being uptight
Been treated like a sister
But here's something she don't know
In her basement hangs a picture
That fucked my heart up
A memory takes my hand
A real gentleman in every way but one
That I don't wanna know
Oh no
No-one has to tell me I know I have to let it go
But it's so nice being uptight
So sorry that I never will be the kind of guy you'd like
But it's so nice being uptight
Got a name, all that remains
Some day you know this back will break
We're not a million miles away
Some day you know this back will breakEmbed
