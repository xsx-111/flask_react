Chi-Town LyricsMeet me down in Chi-Town
In Logan Square underground
You know the one
We were always there
Forget the airport and cut my hair short
Eat cookies and cream from the store at the end of the street
There's so much junk in my head
Will I only hear when you're dead?
But I'll still think of you and just take it out on myself…
H.S.S
At the end of the rainbow I took a photo
Add my poses to your calendar to show how long
It's been since I was here
And now I know I won't return
But still I think of you and just take it out on everyone else…Embed
