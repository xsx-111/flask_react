Stalagmites LyricsWe stand here in ceremonial dress
With a knife in the garter
Like the love you never get to feel
This is the fame of the martyr
You are the California smile
You're the cake decorator
"He has this plan which is just keep doing exactly what it is you're doing
And somehow everything's going to be alright
And I was like, I'm growing stalagmites, I don't want to be here anymore
So I guess we're going to live in this haunted city forever more
Where the grey creeps through your front door and all the houses look like jack 'o' lanterns, exactly the same all stood in a row
Glowing with the mundanity of an early evening being lived out inside"
Like the rabbits with ointment in their eyes
Trying to focus in cages
The lines are blurred so what is it?
An hourglass or two faces?
We're only human is our excuse
Let's just keep blaming nature
My heart melts less over the years
Whilst the past rings in my ears
You are the California smile
You're the cake decorator
"So if needs be I'll batter you with unrelenting dignity
My mouth will be sealed tighter than a nervous clam
Because all words will be meaningless when you're washed up on the sand
Try not to think about the future
Try not to live in the past"Embed
