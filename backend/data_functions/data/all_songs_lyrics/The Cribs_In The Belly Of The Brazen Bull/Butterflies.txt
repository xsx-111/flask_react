Butterflies LyricsWaiting, for my friend to wake up
So we can talk in the night
Like the old days
Though you like the songs I sing to you
All the words they are untrue
But I'll promise, just like I always do
Though you like the songs I sing to you
All the words are no longer true
But I'll promise, just like I always do
I need to see the world through her eyes now
It seems she thinks all leaves
Are butterflies nowEmbed
