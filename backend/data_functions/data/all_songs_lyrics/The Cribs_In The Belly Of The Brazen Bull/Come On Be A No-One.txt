Come On Be A No-One LyricsCome on I'll be a no-one
For you...
Got you wrong, it's not your fault
Sometimes I'd rather feel cheap
You can't keep suckling me
I was trying so hard to enjoy everything
That I ended up enjoying nothing
Seriously I'm really well fed
I know previously you needed me like a hole in the head
Come on I'll be a no-one
For you
Stay home and write a song
For you
Like a shooting star, or a change of heart
I'm something that you rarely see
Smell the lilies on me
Roadside, covered in flies
And caustic soda
We're giving off the same odourEmbed
