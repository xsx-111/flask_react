Jaded Youth LyricsYou mean a lot to me
But I never listen to a word you say
Cos I've got money in my wallet
I've got bruises on my knees
But that don't matter cos the point was lost
On a jaded youth
Check out these words, they're deep
Smoke cigarettes down at the end of my street
But the curse of days forgotten is playing on my mind
If I went back to school would I feel cool?
I don't knowâ€¦
And it's time that you were told
The young people got too old
Dye your hair red cos it's back in fashion
And I've got no libido
Seems a long long time ago
Since I was looking for a piece of the action
I'm a jaded youth
In the meantime I'll write down all of these words
And sing songs of being lost then found
Being loved and lost
I'm a jaded youth since I learned the truthEmbed
