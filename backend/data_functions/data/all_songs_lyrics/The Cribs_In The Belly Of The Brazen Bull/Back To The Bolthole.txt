Back To The Bolthole LyricsYou follow Aurora and hope no-one saw you
Peel back the screen door like everyone before
Cartoons run on repeat in the room across the street
So you go out to find her in some crappy roadside diner
You're a long long way from home
And as the room grows cold you'reâ€¦
Crying in secret about the things you're thinking
On a night
That you, one day will die
Just try to think it's the one thing
That makes it all worthwhile
That I, one day will die
So where do we go?
We go back to the Bolthole
Crack open the Rainiers
The oxygen makes you thin here
A Cascadian rainfall
The couch has gone AWOL
It's as good place as any to forget about your familyEmbed
