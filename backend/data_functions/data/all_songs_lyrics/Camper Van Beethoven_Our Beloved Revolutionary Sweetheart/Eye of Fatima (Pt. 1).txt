Eye of Fatima (Pt. 1) LyricsHe's got the Eye of Fatima on the wall of his room
Two bottles of tequila, three cats and a broom
He's got an 18-year-old angel and she's all dressed in black
He's got 15 nickels of cocaine tied up in a sack
And this here's a government experiment and we're driving like Hell
To give some cowboys some acid and to stay in motels
We're going to eat up some wide open spaces like it was a cruise on the Nile
Take the hands off the clock, we're going to be here a while
And I am the Eye of Fatima on the wall of the motel room
And cowboys on acid are like Egyptian cartoons
And no one ever conquered Wyoming from the left or from the right
But you can stay in motel rooms and stay up all nightEmbed
