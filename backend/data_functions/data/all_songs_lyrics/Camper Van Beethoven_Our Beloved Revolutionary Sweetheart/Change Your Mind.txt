Change Your Mind LyricsWalk, oh walk away
Put my head down on the table, rub two coins together in my pocket
For good luck
'Cuz how far can you walk in a night so restless
Though the moon may cross from horizon to horizon
Change your mind, you can change your mind
I'll be glad to let ya, even if you walk awayEmbed
