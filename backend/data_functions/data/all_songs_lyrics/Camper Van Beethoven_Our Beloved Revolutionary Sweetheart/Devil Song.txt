Devil Song LyricsHey, ya wanna start a fire?
One that will never go out?
Burn a hole through the center of my mind
Let all the bad thoughts out
This is not a love affair
This is something more complex
Hey, ya wanna start a war?
I'm tired of this old one
And history is true
And it goes round in circles
Burn down the house, there's a devil in the closet
And everything I say is true
And I go round in circles
I'll burn down the house, there's a devil in the closet
Hey, ya wanna start a fire?
One that will never go out?
Burn a hole through the center of my mind
Let all the bad thoughts out
This is not a love affair
This is something more complex
Hey, ya wanna start a war?
I'm tired of this old oneEmbed
