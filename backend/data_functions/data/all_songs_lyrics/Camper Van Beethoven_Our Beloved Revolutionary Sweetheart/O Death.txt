O Death LyricsMy name is death and I excel
I can open the gates to Heaven or Hell
Cast aside the flesh of the
Cast aside and set you free

Oh, oh Death
Oh, oh Death
Can't you spare me over 'til another year
Oh, oh Death
Oh, oh Death
Can't you spare me over 'til another year
I lock their jaws so they can't talk
Stiffen their legs so they can't walk
Close their eyes so they can't see
The chill you feel, it comes from me

Oh Mama, Mama, come to my bed
Place a cold rag on my head
My eyes are aching and I cannot see
I feel the sheet pulling over me
