Turquoise Jewelry LyricsCome down from your tree house condominium
And start driving around that station wagon
With the wood on the side
Take off that jumpsuit, you look like Grace Slick
Stayin' up all night & drinkin' that 7-11 coffee
And take off your turquoise jewelry
Shake your medicine rattle
And fill a sock with an herb
Put on your fringe skirt
Come sit down next to your man, he's hankering for some company
Come sit down next to your man and let him cough in your ear
'Cuz you bring me sticks and stones
You bring me everything
Take off your turquoise jewelry
Shake your medicine rattle
'Cuz you bring me sticks and stones
You bring me everythingEmbed
