Never Go Back LyricsNever gonna go back to The Rat
Play another Mafia show again
For a man who's had more feet kicked in his face than I can begin to count
And if you see me sitting around
Thinking the same old thoughts over and over again
Or going back to old ways I've long ago abandoned
Please, tell me
Never go back
There might come a time when things between us get
Just a little bit too weird
We'll move to different cities for a temporary vacation
But it's just as you feared
Never go back
If you see me sitting around
Thinking the same old thoughts over and over again
Or going back to old ways I've long ago abandoned
Please, tell me
Never go backEmbed
