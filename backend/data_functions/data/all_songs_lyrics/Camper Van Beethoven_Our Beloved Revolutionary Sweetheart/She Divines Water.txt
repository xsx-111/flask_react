She Divines Water LyricsHow can I believe that everything in this world is going to be fine?
How can I believe that everything in this world has its place and time?
When I lay down to sleep, I feel the world spin
Slightly off axis, it's shaped like a fig
And when I lie next to you, I shiver and shake
You tell me you love me, I dream I'm awake
How can I believe that everything in this world is going to be fine?
And how can I believe that everything in this world has its place and time?
'Cause when I lay down to sleep, I have the same dream
Of a world-famous actress in a pink limousine
And she flies through the sky in that pink Cadillac
While the boys of the Press, we drink vodka in back
And she tells us our fortune by crumbling leaves
And she teaches us card tricks, the Jack makes us weak
She divines water by dancing a jig for the boys of the Press
She will wrestle a pigEmbed
