Big Fat Mama LyricsSay you need me, say you need me, tell me that you want my love
Say you will be mine and I am yours
You think that you're way above me, I'm telling you that I can see
All those things that you might wanna be
I am yours tonight
You be mine tonight
You keep telling me you're not having me, I'm telling you that I can see
All the things that you might wanna be
Say you need me, say you need me, tell me that you want my love
Say you will be mine and I am yours
I am yours tonight
You be mine tonight
I got a big fat Mama with a big fat motor
Really thinks she's something else
I'm gonna love that woman like a fish loves the water
Man, there ain't nobody else
I'm gonna tell you woman better do as you're told
If you don't, I'm gonna bring you down
I've got a big fat Mama and there's no one else around
I said say you need me, come on say you need me
I said say you need me
Say you need me, come on say you need me
I said say you need meEmbed
