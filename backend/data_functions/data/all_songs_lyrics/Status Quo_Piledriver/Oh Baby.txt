Oh Baby LyricsOh baby, why don't you come home?
Oh baby, don't you leave me alone
Oh baby, been away for far too long
When you get home, gonna sing you this song
They're gonna know 'cos you've been treating me wrong
Oh baby, been away for far too long
Oh baby, why don't you come home?
Oh baby, don't you leave me alone
Oh baby, been away for far too long
When you get home, gonna sing you this song
They're gonna know 'cos you've been treating me wrong
Oh baby, been away for far too longEmbed
