Unspoken Words LyricsIf I could only share with you
Once more the fruits of yesterday
Could I forget unspoken words?
The change in colours of your way
I can still see you standing there
Clutching my hand and begging not to go
Don't hide the tears, I'm crying too
It doesn't matter too much, no
I'll always be with you by your side
Watching over you, feeling every pain
Hold your head high, think of me there
I'll still be with you once again
I'll always be with you by your side
Watching over you, feeling every pain
Hold your head high, think of me there
I'll still be with you once againEmbed
