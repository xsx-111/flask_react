Roadhouse Blues Lyrics1-2-3-4
1-2-3-4
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're going to the roadhouse
We're gonna have a real good time
Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse they got someone to love
Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse they got someone to love
That sort of people like to go down slow
Let it roll, baby, roll, let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll, let it roll, all night long
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're going to the roadhouse
We're gonna have a real good time
In the back of the Roadhouse they got someone to love
At the back of the Roadhouse they got someone to love
That's sort of people like to go down slow
Let it roll, baby, roll, let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll, let it roll, all night long
You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta ease my soul, all right
You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta jump up and get me baby
I know you want me baby
You gotta roll, roll, roll
You gotta ease my soul, all right
I shoulda made you, I shoulda made you
Give up your vows, give up your vows
Save my city, save my city
Right now, oh baby, baby
I woke up this morning, I got myself a beer
I woke up this morning, and I got myself a beer
The future's uncertain, and the end is always near
Let it roll, baby, roll, let it roll, baby, roll
Let it roll, baby, roll, let it roll
All night longEmbed
