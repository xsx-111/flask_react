Paper Plane LyricsRiding on a big white butterfly
I turned my back away towards the sky
I closed my eyes to look for something
Saw myself as really nothing
Then I realized my butterfly
Wasn't really up there with me
We all make mistakes, forgive me
Would you like to ride my butterfly?
Riding on a long blue paper plane
Getting seasick, sorry once again
Landing strip is getting nearer
Hope the fog lifts, makes it clearer
Then I realized my paper plane
Wasn't really up there with me
We all make mistakes, forgive me
Would you like to ride my paper plane?
Riding in a three grand Deutsche car
A to B is often very far
Home is near, but such a long way
Legs and heads all feel the wrong way
Then I realized my Deutsche car
Is only there to get me somewhere
Even so I really do care
Would you like to ride my Deutsche car?Embed
