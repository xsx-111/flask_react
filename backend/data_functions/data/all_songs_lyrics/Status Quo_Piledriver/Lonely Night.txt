Lonely Night LyricsSitting by the window where I used to sit with you
Playing all the old songs like we often used to do
It was a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night
It was a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night
Went by a friend, he said, this is not a lie
You're back again, and I couldn't laugh or cry
'Cos I never thought I'd see or hear you again
Took me down to Sally's where the band was playing loud
Didn't take me too long to find you there with a crowd
It was a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely night
I had a lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
I tried to find something right for me to say
Can't you decide when you left me on that day
'Cos I never thought I'd see or hear you again
Oh no, I never thought I'd see or hear you again
No, I never thought I'd see or hear you again
Oh no, I never thought I'd see or hear you again
No, no, I never thought I'd see or hear you again
No, I never thought I'd see or hear you again
No, no, I never thought I'd see or hear you again...Embed
