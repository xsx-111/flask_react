How Low Can a Punk Get? LyricsI didn't mean to rip off
I thought it was a get off in mine
I tried to make the scence off
The plan was doomed to set off on time
The time that I was wastin'
I spent on only chasin in the pits
And now I pay the price
To make the sacrifice of the fool
I was on me
I chose not to be
Cheated on part of the thrill
Bargain was not fulfilled
Lost in a crazy scheme
That got strapped up in my dream
And now my times run out
What's it all about
Another DOA can you help me...
How low can a punk get?
My, my, my...
How low can a punk get?
I was on me
I chose not to be
Cheated on part of the thrill
Bargain was not fulfilled
Lost in a crazy scheme
That got strapped up in my dream
And now my times run out
What's it all about
Another DOA can you help me...
How low can a punk get?
My, my, my...
How low can a punk get?
I was on me
I chose not to be
Cheated on part of the thrill
Bargain was not fulfilled
Lost in a crazy scheme
That got strapped up in my dream
And now my times run out
What's it all about!1Embed
