I And I Survive Lyrics
Why must all people (Why?)
Keep on shooting and robbing (Why?)
Why must must all people (Why?)
Keep on killing and fighting

No, I
I and I will never try
Listen, no, not I
I and I will never try

And why must the rich man (Why?)
Keep on hoarding all the money? (Why?)
And why must this poor man? (Why?)
My living, it ain't very funny

No, I
I and I will never try
Listen, no, not I
I and I will never
Try to live that way

No, not I
I and I will never try
No, not I
I and I will never

And what did Jah show them? (I and I survive)
Them tried to stop this nation, but (I and I survive)
To chant down creation (I and I survive)
An Israeli nation (I and I)


Try to live that way
So why must I and I want each way? (Why? Oh, why?)
And why must I and I want each way?

No, not I
I and I will never try
Listen, no, not I
I and I will never try

Without any money, I and I survive
Without any food to eat, I and I survive
Why?
Why?
Why?
Oh
Say I and I
Say I and I
I and I survive
Say I and I
Say I and I
I and I surviveEmbed
