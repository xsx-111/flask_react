Rock For Light LyricsSo you say you gonna live the truth
Well have you checked out the future of the youth
Doesn't seem to be much left for them
But there is an answer for all of Jah Children
We don't want no wars
We don't need no violence
We just want what's right
Some peace and love
We don't want no violence
We don't need no wars
We just want what's right
Rock for light
Rock for light
Rock for light...
We come
We come to rock for light
We come
We come to rock for light
We come
We come to rock for lightEmbed
