The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth LyricsJah Children, Jah children
Yeah the meek shall inherit the earth
Jah children, Jah children Yeah
The meek shall inherit the earth
Why must the Rasta live this way?
The creator has shown us a better way
So why must I n' I fight each other?
With unity and love for your brother, there's always a better day
Jah children, Jah children Yeah
The meek shall inherit the earth
Jah children, Jah children Yeah
The meek shall inherit the earth
In due season each will pay according to works that they have done on earth today
So I n'I
We shall live in truth
His Majesty, His Majesty has shown us a better way
Blessed is the man who walketh not
In the counsel of the ungodly
Nor standeth in the way of the sinners
Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
Nor taketh delight in the way that the unrighteous go
And he should be like a tree
Planted by the rivers of water
That bringeth forth fruit in it's due season
Nor shall his leaves wither
Nor shall his locks wither
Nor shall he be smitten by the sun of the day
And nor shall he be smitten by the moon of the night
But be prosperous in the way that he goes
In the way of our lord JAH! RASTAFARI!
The only way...Embed
