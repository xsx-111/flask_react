We Will Not LyricsMs. Babylon, your queendom is doomed
Across this land, you'll spread your no more gloom
Cause one of these days, you gonna get your jilt
And we'll never have to deal with no more of your filth
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
Oh, Mr. Bacon, your future time is near
We read the bible and see your 666
And now we'll never have to deal with no more tricks

We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh no
Ms. Babylon, your queendom is doomed
Across this land, you'll spread your no more gloom
Cause one of these days, you gonna get your jilt
And we'll never have to deal with no more of your filth
We will not do what they want or do what they say. Oh noEmbed
