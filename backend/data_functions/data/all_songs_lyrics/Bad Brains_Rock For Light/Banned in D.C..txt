Banned in D.C. LyricsBanned in D.C. with a thousand more places to go
Gonna swim across the Atlantic, cause that's the only place I can go
You, you can't hurt me
Why? I'm banned in D.C
D.C
We, we got ourselves
Gonna sing it, gonna love it, gonna work it out to any length
Don't worry, no worry, about what the people say
We got ourselves, we gonna make it anyway
You, you can't hurt me
Why? I'm banned in D.C
D.C., D.C
And if you ban us from your clubs
It's the right time, the right mind
And if you think we really care, you won't find in my mind
No! You can't afford, to close your doors, so soon no more
My oh my I let you down upon the ground
So soon no more
No! You can't afford to close your doors, so soon no more
My, oh my I'll let you down upon the ground4Embed
