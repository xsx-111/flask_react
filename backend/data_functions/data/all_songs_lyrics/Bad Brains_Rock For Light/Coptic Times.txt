Coptic Times LyricsThese are Coptic times
Got a right to live my life
With no burdens over me
So I choose to read the holy bible
And take what Jah has given me
It seems that all through life, one fact prevails
That the righteous all live on
These are Coptic times
Leaving this place won’t be no big disgrace
Let lose of those lies and hold onto your faith
Cause in a matter of time there won’t be no space
Let lose of those lies and hold onto your faith
Revelation been foretold, now the next step is up to you
I choose to do the right and live in truth
Israel must unite
It’s the youth who God has ordained
And he’s calling youEmbed
