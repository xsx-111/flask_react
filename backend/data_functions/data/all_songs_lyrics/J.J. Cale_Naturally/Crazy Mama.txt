Crazy Mama Lyrics1,2,3,4
Crazy mama, where you been so long?
Crazy mama, where you been so long?
You've been hiding out, I know that's true
Crazy mama, I sure need you
Crazy mama, where you been so long?

Standing on the corner, looking for you, babe
Standing on the corner, looking for you, babe
Lord mercy, I can not see, crazy mama coming back to me
Crazy mama, where you been so long?Embed
