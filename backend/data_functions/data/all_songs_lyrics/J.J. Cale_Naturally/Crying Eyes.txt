Crying Eyes LyricsIt ain't easy drying these crying eyes of mine
It ain't easy drying these crying eyes of mine
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
It ain't easy drying these crying eyes of mine
What can you do when those tears make you blind
What can you do when those tears make you blind
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
What can you do with these crying eyes of mineEmbed
