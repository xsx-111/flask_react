Nowhere to Run LyricsNowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No way to relieve this feeling inside
You done gave me them blues and then you took a ride
Left me with nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Shame, oh shame, on what you do
Can't you see that I, I, I, been feeling so blue
Cast a spell on me, then you took a ride
Left me with nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Pardon me, if I sound so sad
I can't get to you when I want you so bad
You done gave me them blues, then you took a ride
Left me with nowhere to run, nowhere to hideEmbed
