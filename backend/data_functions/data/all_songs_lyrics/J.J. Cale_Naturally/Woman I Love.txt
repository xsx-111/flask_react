Woman I Love LyricsWoman I love ain't much more than skin and bone
Woman I love ain't much more than skin and bone
If she ain't round the house - out of the door, daddy no more
Woman I love ain't much more than skin and bone
Treat me right, oh no no, can't complain
Treat me right, oh no, can't complain
She got to be nice, she got me hypnotised
Treat me right, oh no, can't complainEmbed
