River Runs Deep LyricsWell, the river runs deep and the water is cold as ice
The river runs deep and the water is cold as ice
I go down there every chance I get
It's where my baby she met her death
And the river runs deep and the water's cold as ice
Ain't no woman gonna make a fool out of me
Ain't no woman gonna make a fool out of me
Running 'round, that's what they said
She's at the bottom of the river dead
And the river runs deep and the water's cold as ice
No cheating woman gonna get a good man down
No cheating woman gonna get a good man down
Running 'round like a silly fool
You're gonna end up at the bottom of the pool
And the river runs deep and the water's cold as iceEmbed
