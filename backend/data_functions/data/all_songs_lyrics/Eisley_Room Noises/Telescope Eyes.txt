Telescope Eyes LyricsOhh
You humor me today
Calling me out to play
With your telescope eyes, metal teeth
I can't be seen with you, you see
Please don't make me cry
Please don't make me cry
I'm just like you I know you know
I'm just like you so leave me alone
I wonder, why can't you see
You're just not near enough like me
With your telescope eyes
Metal teeth, I, can't be seen with you
Please don't make me cry
Please don't make me cry
I'm just like you I know you know
Im just like you so leave me alone
Please don't make me cry
Please don't make me cry
I'm just like you I know you know
I'm just like you so leave me alone
Please don't make me cry
Please don't make me cry
I'm just like you I know you know
I'm just like you so leave me alone
Oh, you humor me today...Embed
