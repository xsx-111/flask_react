One Day I Slowly Floated Away LyricsOne day I-I slowly floated away
One day I-I slowly floated away
All the war horses wore rubber bands
To hide their hooves from sinking sand
The commander in charge was hoping that
Their destiny was not to die
Wake up in the morning
I shall wake up, and so shall you
And I wake up, the sun is beautiful
And it is warming you and I
Fragile as we lie
Hard to foresee the future
Our bodies are growing thin
Glimpsing the peeling paint of
The nurse's ivory chin
You got a lot of nerve coming here
Your eyes are beating rhythms
Way faster than the speeding bullet
That took the life of your radio
Wake up in the morning
I shall wake up, and so shall you
And I wake up, the sun is beautiful
And it is warming you and I
Fragile as we lie
And in the corner chair
Soft and soap-scented
My darling cries apologies
We foresee the mercy
That's been shown my young limbs
Will not go unthanked or unseen
Wake up in the morning
I shall wake up, and so shall you
And I wake up, the sun is beautiful
And it is warming you and I
Fragile as we lie
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ahEmbed
