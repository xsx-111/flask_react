Trolley Wood LyricsOut one day
Walking one day
Out one day with you, hallelujah
We found a wood with trolleys on wheels
Rolling all around the hills
Hallelujah
And just as soon it had slipped into
The sleepy dusk and it's not very likely
That we'll see it, I will see it again
Out one day
Walking one day
Out one day with you, hallelujah
We found a wood, we unfound a wood
And then we cried, oh no
And please tell me will we ever find it again?
In the depths of Trolley Wood
Do trolleys still drive?
Gone for the day to the Trolley Wood
I've gone for the day to the Trolley Wood
The Trolley Wood is taking me away
Out one day
Walking one day
Out one day with you, hallelujah
We found a wood, we unfound a wood
And then we cried, oh no
And please tell me will we ever find it again?
In the depths of Trolley Wood
Do trolleys still drive?
Gone for the day to the Trolley Wood
I've gone for the day to the Trolley Wood
I've gone for the day to the Trolley Wood
The Trolley Wood is taking me away
Out one day
Walking one day
Out one day with you, hallelujahEmbed
