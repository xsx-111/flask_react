My Lovely LyricsWhy do you wait for me?
And how do you wait for me?
I'm feeling alone without you here in my arms
I'm lost and alone without you here by side
Oh...oooh...
Here's a song for you lovely
Remember that it is for you only, for you only
Why do you wait on me?
And how do you wait on me?
I'm feeling alone without you here in my arms
I'm lost and alone without you here by side
Oh...oooh...
Here's a song for you lovely
Remember that it is for you only, for you only
My heart was caught in a landslide
And now it feels for you only, for you only
Oooh-aahhh oooh-aahhh, oooh-aahhh oooh-aahhh, oooooh...
Here's a song for you lovely
Remember that it is for you only, for you only
My heart was caught in a landslide
And now it feels for you only, for you only, yeahEmbed
