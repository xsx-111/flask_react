Brightly Wound LyricsIt's happening all the time
When I open my eyes
I'm still taken by surprise
I hold sunlight and swallow fireflies
And it makes me want to cry
I love you
I shall never grow up
Make believe is much too fun
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
(Sherri's singing)
We were walking there
And I had tangles in my hair
But you make me feel so pretty
You have shining eyes
Yes like those forest lights
And it makes me want to cry
(Stacy's singing at the same time)
I am just wishing you were there
So we could walk down to the stream
And we would throw all our leaves in
Seeing our dragon when we look
I love you
I shall never grow up
Make believe is much too fun
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
I shall never grow up
Make believe is much too fun
Can we go far away to the humming meadow
This place is so lovely
It kind of makes me very happy
Let's go far away to the humming meadow
To the humming meadow
To the humming meadowEmbed
