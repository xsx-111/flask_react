Lost at Sea (remix) LyricsSailing over wave and tide, oh-ho-ho
Fantastic waves against our sides, oh-ho-ho
And I'm not so afraid
Lost at sea, as I should be
And I'm not so afraid
Lost at sea, you and I, you and me
Congratulations
'Cause we've made it
All the way home
All the way home
And you know that
Until the stars fall
I'll always love you
I will always love you, oh
The mystery of salt and sea, oh-ho-ho
Has never been intriguing, oh-ho-ho
And to me but the sea
Green is set so beautifully
Against your thoughtful face
That I must close my eyes
And turn my face
Congratulations
'Cause we've made it
All the way home
All the way home
And you know that
Until the stars fall
I'll always love you
I will always love you
Still floating soft
I am dreaming
And I'm glad I lost
And still with my fingers
I'm drawing circles
In the water, in the water
And still, still you're always there
Congratulations
'Cause we've made it
All the way home
All the way home
And you know that
Until the stars fall
I'll always love you
I will always love you, ohEmbed
