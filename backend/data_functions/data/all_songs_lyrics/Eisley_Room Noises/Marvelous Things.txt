Marvelous Things LyricsI awoke the dawn
Saw horses growing out the lawn
Ah...
Ah...
I glimpsed a bat with butterfly wings
Oh, what marvelous things
Ah...
Ah...
Dark night, hold tight
And sleep tight my baby
Morning light shall burst bright
And keep us here safely
I followed a rabbit
Through rows of mermaid-entwined shrubbery
Ah...
Ah...
Oh, what marvelous things
But they are, they are, they are
Giving me the creeps
Dark night, hold tight
And sleep tight my baby
Morning light shall burst bright
And keep us here safely
Oh, lying in the sun
Everyday feeling all of
The magic in life and the wonder
Dark night, hold tight
And sleep tight my baby
Morning light shall burst bright
And keep us here safely
Morning light shall burst bright
And keep us here safely
Ah...
Ah...Embed
