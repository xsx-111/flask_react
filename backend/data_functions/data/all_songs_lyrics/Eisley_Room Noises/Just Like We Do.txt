Just Like We Do LyricsDear, did you know that people love each other
Just like we do, just like they do?
Dear, did you know you're all I ask for?
So hold on to me, hold on with me here
And there are things that follow this quietly to the past
We've seen all those faces, we won't go looking for trouble
The rain, it tumbled down
Through the cracks in the sky
Which made your hands grow
Watch your hands grow
And we still see through their plankshifting laughs
We'll hold the hands of sinners and then we will pass
Ooh-aah, ooh-aaah, ooh-aahEmbed
