I Just Get Caught Out LyricsShe wiped the hair right out of my eyes
Tempted me through with desire
I was trying my best at this stage
To set myself on fire. Then she said hello
I just get caught out
All I get is all day long
On me, and I stand much higher
You can always get what you want
If you're burning enough by fire. Then she said hello
I just get caught out
Out again tonight, I'm tired. We need a room but there is no room
Then she said good-bye
I just get caught out
Out again tonight, through these moonlit streets
We need a room
But there is no room. Then she came again
I just get caught outEmbed
