Right Here LyricsIt rains for days
So you stay inside
And lock your door
Crying all the time
Crying for ...
You don't know what for
You say your're undone by his kiss
But don't you think
That for once in your life
It should be like this?
Your hands are tired
Your eyes are blue
I'm keeping you right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right here
Climb aboard my pony
Now you've been thrown
Get back in the saddle
And let it be known
That you're made of steel
Don't you think that
For once in your life
He should be made to feel?
Your hands are tired
Your eyes are blue
I'm keeping you right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right here
I know you're 32
But you look 55
You walk around
With your eyes wide open
But you're barely alive
You say you've lost your touch
But don't you think
That for once in your life
He could walk without a crutch?
Your hands are tired
Your eyes are blue
I'm keeping you right here
Whatever I have is yours
And it's right hereEmbed
