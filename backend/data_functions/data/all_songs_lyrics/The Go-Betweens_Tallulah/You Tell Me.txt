You Tell Me LyricsTallulah took a shower for an hour
Then walked down the street feeling beautiful and clean
Taulah met a man at a newstand
Who asked her how does she dream
What she's missing
Is someone
Who will listen
And then and then and then, you tell me
Tallulah your make-up needs a shake-up
Your hair frames a perfect face
Tallulah wasn't liberated
By France or any other revolution
What she's missing
Is someone
Who will listen
And then and then and then, you tell me
You tell me, I have a choice. You. You. You. Come onEmbed
