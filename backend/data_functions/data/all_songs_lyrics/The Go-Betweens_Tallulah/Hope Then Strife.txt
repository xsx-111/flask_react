Hope Then Strife LyricsI think I'm getting it right this time;
I can tell by the way she grins
She put the postcards up on the head of our bed
I can see Algiers
She said "don't the streets on Sunday look great
The way they open up their windows
And offer you things you know you'll never buy. "
Lord I'm tired, I'm just so tired
Don't say that you agree
With the price you paid
For your captivity
Sweet surrender and your
Poison pen are gonna take you
And make you whole again
Never gonna be the one
Who said you were the one
Who liked the lonesome life
All the times you stayed
And prayed and thought you
Had it made it was for
Hope then strife
So I went and asked my friend the doctor
"What is it I've got this time? '
He said "apart from that albatross
Around your neck, the tests are
Negative, you really are quite fine"
So I went out to the airport
To play for my ticket
And someone comes up to me and says
"Hey man, they don t pay for that any more
Lord I'm tired, I'm just so tired
Don't say that you agree
With the price you paid
For your honesty
Sweet surrender and your
Poison pen are gonna take you
And make you whole again
Never gonna be the one
Who said you were the one
Who liked the lonesome life
All the times vou stayed
And prayed and thought you
Had it made it was for
Hope then strife
Lord I'm tired, I'm just so tired
I should retire
Don't say that you agree
With the price at the end
Of hostility
Sweet surrender and your
Poison pen are gonna take you
And make you whole again
Never gonna be the one
Who said you were the one
Who liked the lonesome life
All the times you stayed
And prayed and thought you
Had it made it was for
Hope then strifeEmbed
