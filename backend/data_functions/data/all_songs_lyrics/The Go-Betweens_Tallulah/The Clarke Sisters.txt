The Clarke Sisters LyricsThey had problems with their father's law
They sleep in the back of a feminist bookstore
The clarke sisters
The eldest sister keeps a midnight vigil
The youngest sister she's not spiritual
The clarke sisters
Their steel grey hair, their lovely steel grey hair
The clarke sisters
Why don't i introduce you
I'm sure they won't mind
But don't you dare, laugh at their collections
Handed down, handed down for love
The middle sister gets her period blood
The flood of love. the flood of love
The clarke sisters
Their steel grey hair, their lovely steel grey hair
The clarke sisters
The afternoon world, the bees have stung the softball girls
The midnight world, the crystal ball down the wooden hall
The treehouse stands, their early childhood, were treehouse plans
And right above
The clarke sisters, handed down to love
Handed down to love. handed down to loveEmbed
