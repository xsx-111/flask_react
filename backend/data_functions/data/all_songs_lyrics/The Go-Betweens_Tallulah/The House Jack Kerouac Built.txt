The House Jack Kerouac Built LyricsYou and I together, with nothing showing at all
In a darkened cinema, I'll give you pleasure in the stalls
Want to give you tenderness, and my affection too
If it's through clenched teeth, that's what you driven me
To
I want us to be lovers
I want us to be friends
Want it like; it's the living end
Keep me away from her
With your kittens. On the patchwork quilt
Oh no, what am I doing here, in the house Jack Kerouac built
There's white magic, and bad rock'n'roll
Your friend there says, he's the gatekeeper to my soul
The velvet curtains
The Chinese bell
With friends like these; you're damned as well
Keep me away from her
Shake off your despondency, and your country girl act
You are reading me poetry, that's Irish, and so black
I know you're warm, the warmest person alive
But are you warm, deep down inside?
I want us to be lovers
I want us to be friends
Want it like; the world crumbles and then it ends
Keep me away from her
Baby, I'm lonely
You're on the road with a bad crowdEmbed
