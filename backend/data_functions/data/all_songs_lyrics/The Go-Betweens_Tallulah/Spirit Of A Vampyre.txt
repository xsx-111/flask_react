Spirit Of A Vampyre LyricsI was slowly dying in a clinic just outside of L. A
You came and saw me (thank you) that picked me up straight away
You said "Learn to dance, learn to act, learn the piano"
And most of all you said
"Learn to live again"
That's when it starts. That's when it starts
The electric train of soft cylinder parts
Together at last
I dream of losing you, I wake up holding you so tight
I don't want to lose you now that I've passed midnight
I'm in deep with the blue waters around you
I'm in deep, so blue with everything around you


That's when it starts. That's when it starts
The electric train of soft cylinder parts
The dull mask of action on circus staff
Mobility the hood of the Hindu scarf
Together at last
Making jewellery at lastEmbed
