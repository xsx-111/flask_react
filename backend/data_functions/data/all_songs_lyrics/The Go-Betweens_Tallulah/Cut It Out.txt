Cut It Out LyricsWhat would you do
If i told you
To run from him?
What would vou say
If i told you to
Abandon him?
I khow you drink
You've had a lot to drink
Do you have to talk like that?
If you go to parties
And cut your hair
People grab their hats
Ah, but i know with a heart like that
In times like these with a heart like
That you cut it out
What would you do
If i told you
To pack your bags?
What would you say
If i told you
To take off those rags?
I know you're down
I know you're blue
You broke his spell
If you want life
You take that life
And you live it well
Ah, but i know with a heart like that
In times like these with a heart like
That you cut it out
Have you lost vour marbles?
You're not that crazy yet
Listen to me, don't you forget
What would you say
If i told you
You had to run from him?
Ah, but i know with a heart like that
In times like these with a heart like
That you cut it outEmbed
