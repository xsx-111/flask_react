Fermi Paradox Lyrics
Lights paint the windows in the sky
The past is sown
In pursuit our spirit shown
But for now there's no one home

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

My sweet Medusa, reflect the empty in our being
Snakes born of fire conjure the demons in our dreams

In void we illustrate our lives
Emerge in small
Heed the sign meant to evolve
To the end we send the call

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

Where children shiver in the cold
The sun will shine
Just a touch to heal the blind
In ourselves we hope to find

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind
