Paradigm Lyrics
You've been breaking down for far too long
Far too many moons since you felt well and strong
You see, you could say goodbye but you don't have to die
Not ever

Engineer the wires to your brain
Architect a code so you won't feel the pain
With your family by your side and vigor in your eyes forever
Live forever

I'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm

What's it really mean to be a man?
Think about your answer but please understand
While it's natural to fear, I'll make it disappear forever
I forever

I'm way up, a god in size, beyond the reach of mortals
I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm
(Singular I am)
I have to question if these thoughts are mine
To live forever but did something in me die?
I'm clawing my skin but I can't feel it inside
I know the agony of pain would hurt so much better

I'm way up, so far up
Have I lost myself tonight?
Father, O' Father
Have you lost that boy you used to know?2Embed
