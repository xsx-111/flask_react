Mic Check Lyrics
Oh, wait a minute now
Huh-huh
Come on
Oh, wait a minute now
Check

To the Young R to the E, the B to the E, the L
Never give up, just live up
Fed upon America, I'll be spittin' it up
Rippin' it up for an even amount in each cup
To my brothers' burning bare feet on black top
Whose curled 'neath the shadows from the gaze of the cops
Whose huntin' for 9 to 5's through factory locks
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block

Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?
Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?
Check, check, check, check, the check
Oh, packin'

Flexin' and mashin' with complex text
Fast and in a fashion that snap back necks
Quicker than a fed cash the company checks
I be the "Fire" only Marley could catch
Yes, I be the flame in the cellar, beware
Nameless cold millions gaspin' for air
The naked and wageless, scream within cages
What, they make you pull your shit
Just to get your share, what?

Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?
Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?

We'll walk 'em down with the warrior's sound
With this mic device, I spit nonfiction (Fiction)
"Who got the power?", this be my question (Question)
The mass or the few in this torn nation? (Nation)
The priest, the book, or the congregation? ('Gation)
The politricks who rob and hold down your zone? (Zone)
Or those who give the thieves the key to their homes? (Homes)
The pig who's free to murder one Shucklak
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?
With this mic device, I spit nonfiction
"Who got the power?", this be my question
The mass of the few in this torn nation?
The priest, the book, or the congregation?
The politricks who rob and hold down your zone?
Or those who give the thieves the key to their homes?
The pig who's free to murder one Shucklak
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back?

Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?
Mic check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker
Mic check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?5Embed
