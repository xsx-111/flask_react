New Millennium Homes Lyrics
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
The spirit of Jackson now screams through the ruins
Through factory chains and the ghost of the Union
The forgotten remains disappear to their new homes
The knife, the thrust, the life burns to the raw bone
The blood on the floor of the tear is still dryin'
Cover the spread sheets, the Dow Jones skyin'
The cell block live stock, the bodies they buyin'
Old south order, new northern horizon!

Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)

A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as the weak grow strong
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for the dawn
Yo, yo, check the high tech terror of the new order athletes
Peering into the eyes of the child already on trial
These armies rippin' families apart, get 'em on file
Convictions fit the stock profile all the while
Films of dogs, cuttin' through homes
Ripping skin from bones, yes, the new millennium homes
Privatizing through private eyes, an era rising
Of the old south order, new northern horizon

Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)
Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)

A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set
A fire in the master's house is set3Embed
