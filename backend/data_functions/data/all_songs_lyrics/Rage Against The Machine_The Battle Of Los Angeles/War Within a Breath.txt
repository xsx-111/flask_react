War Within a Breath Lyrics
Every official that comes in, cripples us, leaves us maimed
Silent and tamed
And with our flesh and bones, he builds his homes
Southern fist, rise through the jungle mist
Clenched to smash power so cancerous
A black flag and a red star
A rising sun loomin' over Los Angeles
Yes, for Raza livin' in La La
Like Gaza on to the dawn of Intifada
Reach for the lessons the masked pass on
And seize the metropolis, it's you it's built on

Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
And everything changed on a new year's day
Come on

War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land
Their existence is a crime
Their seat, their robe, their tie
Their land deeds, their hired guns
They're the crime
Shots heard underground 'round the rapture
The world's eye captured at last in a Mexican pasture
The masked screaming land or death
Within a breath, a war from the depth of time
Who shot four puppet governors in a line
Who shook all the world bankers who think they can rhyme
Shot the landlords who knew it was mine
Yes, it's a war from the depth of time

Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Everything can change on a new year's day
Come on
Ugh, hear the masked scream

War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
It's land or death
Yeah, uh
Come on
Come on
Yes, yes
Yes

It's war within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death
War within a breath
It's land or death1Embed
