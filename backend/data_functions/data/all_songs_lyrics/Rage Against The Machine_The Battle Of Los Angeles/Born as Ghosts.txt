Born as Ghosts Lyrics
The hills find peace, locked armed guard posts
Safe from the screams of the children born as ghosts
Gates, guns and alarms shape the calm of the dawn
Peering down into the basin where death lives on
When young run foaming at the mouth with hate
When burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Of walls deny the terror faced
By the children born as ghosts

Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)

One book and forty ghosts stuffed in a room
Ah, the school as a tomb
Where home is a wasteland, taste the razor wire
And thought is locked in the womb
The tales that tear at the myth of the dream
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
A suffering that shocks the lives off the screen
(Myth of the dream, myth of the dream)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(A warning, you sufferers, begin to speak our word)
Born as ghosts
(We are the children born as ghosts, born as ghosts)
