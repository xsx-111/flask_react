Voice of the Voiceless Lyrics
Come on, check it
Through steel walls, your voice blastin' on
True rebel, my brother, Mumia, I reflect upon
You the spark, that set the prairie fires on
Make the masses a mastodon path to trample the fascists on
At fifteen exposed Philly's finest killing machine
Boots and mad guns, they pacify ya young
Cause and effect, smell the smoke in the breeze
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless

Well, the powerful got nervous 'cause he refused to be they servant
'Cause he spit truth that burned like black churches
Prose and verses, a million poor in hearses
Watch the decision of Dred Scott as it reverses
Long as the rope is tight around Mumia's neck
Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect
Cause and effect, can't ya smell the smoke in the breeze?
My panther, my brother, we are at war until you're free

You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
You'll never silence the voice of the voiceless
And Orwell's hell, a terror era coming through
But this little brother's watching you too
And Orwell's hell, a terror era coming through
But this little brother's watching you too, watching you too2Embed
