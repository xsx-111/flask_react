Hand Springs LyricsI took my girl to go bowling downtown at the Red Door
After an argument I started because I thought she didn't like me anymore
I can't help it, sometimes I feel pitiful
And of course, she's so young and beautiful
I bought us two glasses of Coke
That's her favorite, and I wanted to make up for earlier
But I dropped her glass and it broke
So I just gave my glass to her
She laughed and so did I in our lane
Then she went to the vending machine to buy a candy cane
But right next to that was a boy I knew with a spring in his hand
Playing a country pinball machine called "Stand By Your Man"
I saw him talk to her, but I stayed in my lane and played my game steady
And was thinking of the day when i'd be too old to throw a ball this heavy
But I guess I'm young now, so it's easy to knock 'em all down
Then I looked and saw her say to him, "you're really hitting that ball around"
And he's looking at her the way I did when i first met her
I could see in his face white flowers and cups of coffee and love letters
I was sorry to interrupt that game
But I went and did it anyway
I dropped my red bowling ball through the glass of the machine
And said, "Are you quick enough to hit this ball, Mr. Clean?"
I was scared to lose her, so I couldn't help being mean
And that ended both of our games
I said I was sorry, but my girl left with him just the same
I thought how much I hate when love makes me act this way
I was bent over a broken pinball machine in a bowling alley and I threw it all away
Well, isn't it all just a big game?
Isn't it all just a big game?Embed
