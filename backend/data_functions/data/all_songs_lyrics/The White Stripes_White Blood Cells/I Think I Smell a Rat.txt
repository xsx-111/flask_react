I Think I Smell a Rat Lyrics
Oh I think I smell a rat
I think I smell a rat
All you little kids seem to think you know just where it's at
Oh I think I smell a rat
Walking down the street carrying a baseball bat
Oh I think I smell a rat
Oh I think I smell a rat
Oh I think I smell a rat
All you little kids seem to think you know just where it's at
Oh I think I smell a rat
Using your mother and father for a welcome mat
Oh I think I smell a ratEmbed
