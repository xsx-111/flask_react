Now Mary Lyrics
Now Mary
Can't you find a way
To bring me down?
I'm so sorry
That I had to go
And let you down

Knowing you I'll think things are gonna be fine
But then again you'll probably change your mind

I'm sorry Mary but being your mate
Means trying to find something that you aren't going to hate
What a season
To be beautiful
Without a reason

Knowing you I'll think things are gonna be fine
But then again you'll probably change your mind
Mary
Can't you find a way to bring me down?1Embed
