I Can Learn Lyrics
I wish we were stuck up a tree
Then we'd know that it's nicer below
I don't know any lullabyes
I don't know how to make you mine
But I can learn
In lonely days long ago
I saw lovers put on a show
Well now it's my turn

Drive you home then wait by the phone
For that call, for a walk in the fall
No harm will come of this
One little midnight kiss
It will not burn
So many lonely days
I feel like a throw away
Well now it's my turn

Falling down is no longer around
Feeling sun, I'm no longer one
Well isn't this fun?1Embed
