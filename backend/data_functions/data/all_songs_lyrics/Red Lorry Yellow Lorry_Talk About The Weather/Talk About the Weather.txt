Talk About the Weather Lyrics
Well, you keep coming up to me
You keep saying that it's up to me
You ain't nothing but a true embrace
You ain't nothing but a hidden face
And you're looking fair enough to me
You just see what you want to see

I want to know if you really care
I want to take you way down there
And stand in the rain and get you wet
You say you love me but not quite yet
I want to go out there to an open space
Those tears to cry and show your face

Oh, I'm so soaked to the skin
Yeah, I'm so soaked to the skin
You want to talk about the weather

Saturation is a point
There's nothing left you know
Nowhere left for me to hide
Nothing left but still alive
To face it all and here today
There's nothing left in you and me
And I can't show you this inside
If all you want to do is hide
I want to take you out and get you wet
You say you love me but not quite yet
I want to go out there to a sheltered place
Those tears to cry and show your face

Oh I'm so soaked to the skin
Yeah, I'm so soaked to the skin
You want to talk about the weather


Sheltered from tomorrow
As though it may never come
You hide behind a wall of stone
And then you feel you're not alone
So face it all, it's here today
You love me in your sheltered way
And I can't hold you in my hands
And talk about these hidden charms
I want to take them
Take them
Take them
Take them
Take...

You want to talk about the weather
Oh, I'm so soaked to the skin
Yeah, I'm so soaked to the skin
You want to talk about the weather2Embed
