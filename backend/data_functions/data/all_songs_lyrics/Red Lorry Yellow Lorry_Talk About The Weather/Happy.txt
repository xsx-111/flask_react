Happy LyricsHave you been above the ocean
Have you been below the sky
You know there are a thousand notions
And yet you ask the reason why
I'm happy, happy, happy, yes I'm happy
You always ask the same questions
You always tell the same lies
You're looking for a reason
And yet I see no surprise
That I'm happy, happy, happy, I'm happy
Have you been above the ocean
Have you been below the sky
You know there are a thousand notions
And yet you ask the reason why
I'm happy, happy, happy, yeah I'm happyEmbed
