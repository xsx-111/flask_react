Hollow Eyes Lyrics
I've seen that look I know those eyes
I think this is a thin disguise
Alone at last, but no surprise
I'd seen it in those hollow eyes

You should have seen them
You should have seen them
You should have seen them
You should have seen them

An empty room an empty space
But you can't really hide your face
I've seen that look of hate inside
I've seen it in those hollow eyes

You should have seen them
You should have seen them
You should have seen them
You should have seen them

This is the place where I have seen
You hide behind your sunken dreams
I had this feeling deep inside
You hid behind those hollow eyes

You should have seen them
You should have seen them
You should have seen them
You should have seen themEmbed
