Feel A Piece LyricsSeeing is believing, I have seen these things before
Hold a conversation, pick yourself up off the floor
Destination nowhere, but the truth is close at hand
All the feelings of a lifetime, but I never knew your name
I need something
Just someone to hold onto
Yes, something
Feel a piece of me now
Hidden in the floorboards, there's a secret to be told
If I knew where I could find you, wrap you up and take you home
And if I had a secret, I would hold you in my arms
I would have you, I would take you, and we could fly away
I need something
Just someone to hold onto
Yes, something
Feel a piece of me now
Value of your virtue is the price I have to pay
With a lengthy explanation, I could never understand
Just what is inside you, finds the doorway to my soul
The flesh is weak, the spirit strong, so take me now, so take me now
Something
Just someone to hold onto
Yes, something
Feel a piece of me nowEmbed
