Eyes on the Prize Lyrics
Paul and Silas bound in jail
Had no money to go their bail
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
Paul and Silas thought
They was lost
Dungeon shook and
The chains come off
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
Freedom's name is mighty sweet
And soon we're going to meet
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
I got my hand on the gospel plow
Won't take nothing for
My journey now
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on

Hold on, Hold on
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
Only chain that a man can stand
Is that chain of hand and hand
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
I'm going to board
That big Greyhound
Carry the love from
Town to town
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on

Hold on, Hold on
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on

The only thing I did was wrong
Was staying in the
Wilderness too long
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
The only thing we did was right
Was the day we started to fight
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
Hold on, Hold on
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
Hold on, Hold on
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on
Hold on, Hold on
Keep your eyes on the prize
Hold on

Haven't been to heaven
But I been told
Streets up there are
Paved with goldEmbed
