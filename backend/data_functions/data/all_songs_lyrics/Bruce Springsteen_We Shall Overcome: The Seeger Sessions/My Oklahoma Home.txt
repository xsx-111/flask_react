My Oklahoma Home Lyrics
When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip
I wanted some place to call my home
And so I made the race and I staked me out a place
And settled down along the Cimarron

It blowed away (blown away), it blowed away (blown away)
My Oklahoma home, it blown away
Well it looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there
My Oklahoma home, it blown away

Well I planted wheats and oats, got some chickens and some shoats
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face
Got a mule to pull the plow, I got an old red muley cow
And I also got a fancy mortgage on this place

Well it blowed away (blown away), it blowed away (blown away)
All the crops that I've planted blown away
Well you can't grow any grain if you ain't got any rain
Everything except my mortgage blown away
Come on!
Well it looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there
I figured I was all set for life
I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
Then I went to town to pick me out a wife

She blowed away (blown away), she blowed away (blown away)
My Oklahoma woman blown away
Mister, as I bent to kiss her, she was picked up by a twister
My Oklahoma woman blown away

Well then I was left alone just listening to the moan
Of the wind around the corners of my shack
So I took off down the road, yeah, when the south wind blowed
I traveled with the wind upon my back

I blowed away (blown away), I blowed away (blown away)
Chasing that dust cloud up ahead
Well once it looked so green and fair and now it's up in the air
My Oklahoma farm is over head
Come on!
And now I'm always close to home, it don't matter where I roam
For Oklahoma dust is everywhere
Makes no difference where I'm walking, I can hear my chickens squawking
I can hear my wife a-talking in the air
It blowed away (blown away), it blowed away (blown away)
Yeah my Oklahoma home is blown away
But my home Sir, is always near, it's up here in the atmosphere
My Oklahoma home is blown away
Come on!

Well I'm a roam'n Oklahoman but I'm always close to home
And I'll never get homesick until I die
'Cause no matter where I'm found, my home's all around
My Oklahoma home is in the sky

It blowed away (blown away), it blowed away (blownd away)
And my farm down on Cimarron
But now all around the world wherever the dust is swirled
There is some from my Oklahoma home
It blowed away (blown away), it blowed away (blown away)
Yeah my Oklahoma home is blown away
Yeah it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud over n' by
My Oklahoma home is blown away
Yeah!
Let me see that horn now, thank you!
Come on one more time!

Well it's blown away (blown away), blown away (blown away)
Oh my Oklahoma home is blown away
Yeah it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud over n' by
My Oklahoma home is the sky
Yeah!Embed
