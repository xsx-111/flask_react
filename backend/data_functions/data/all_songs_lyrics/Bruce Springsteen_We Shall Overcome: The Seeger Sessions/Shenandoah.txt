Shenandoah Lyrics
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away you rolling river
I'll take her across the water

Away, bound away
Across the wide Missouri

My Shenandoah, I long to meet you
Away you rolling river
I'll not deceive you

Away, bound away
Across the wide Missouri

For seven years I've been a roller
Away you rolling river
Seven years I've been a roller

Away, bound away
Across the wide Missouri
Shenandoah, I love your daughter
The way you rolling river
I'll take her across the water

Away, bound away
Across the wide MissouriEmbed
