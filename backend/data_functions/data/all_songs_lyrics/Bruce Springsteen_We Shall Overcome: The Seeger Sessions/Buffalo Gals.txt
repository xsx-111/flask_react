Buffalo Gals Lyrics
As I was walking down the street
Down the street, down the street
A pretty girl I chanced to meet
And we danced by the light of the moon

Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon

I danced with a girl with a hole in her stocking
And he knees was knocking and her shoes was rocking
I danced with a girl with a hole in her stocking
And we danced by the light of the moon

Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon

I danced with a girl with a hole in her stocking
And he knees was knocking and her shoes was rocking
I danced with a girl with a hole in her stocking
And we danced by the light of the moon
Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight
Come out tonight, come out tonight
Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moonEmbed
