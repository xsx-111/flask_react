Jesse James Lyrics
Jesse James was a lad that killed many a man
He robbed the Glendale train
He stole from the rich and he gave to the poor
He'd a hand and a heart and a brain
Well it was Robert Ford, that dirty little coward
I wonder how he feel
For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed
Then he laid poor Jesse in his grave

Well, Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life
Three children now they were brave
Well, that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
He laid poor Jesse in his grave

Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor
He'd never rob a mother or a child
There never was a man with the law in his hand
That could take Jesse James alive
It was on a Saturday night and the moon was shining bright
They robbed the Glendale train
And people they did say over many miles away
It was those outlaws, they're Frank and Jesse James
Well, Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life
Three children now they were brave
Well, that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
He laid poor Jesse in his grave

Now the people held their breath when they heard of Jesse's death
And wondered how he ever came to fall
Robert Ford,It was a fact,He shot Jesse in the back
While Jesse hung a picture on the wall
Now Jesse went to rest with his hand on his breast
The devil will be upon his knee
He was born one day in the County Clay
And he came from a solitary race

Well, Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life
Three children now they were brave
Well, that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
He laid poor Jesse in his graveEmbed
