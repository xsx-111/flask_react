How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live Lyrics
Well, the doctor comes 'round here with his face all bright
And he says, "In a little while, you'll be all right"
All he gives is a humbug pill
A dose of dope and a great big bill
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?

"Me n' my old school pals had some mighty high times down here
And what happened to you poor black folks, well, it just ain't fair"
He took a look around, gave a little pep talk
Said, "I'm with you"; then he took a little walk
Tell me how can a poor man stand such times and live?

There's bodies floatin' on Canal and the levees gone to hell
Martha, get me my sixteen gauge and some dry shells
Them who's got, got out of town
And them who ain't got left to drown
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Go 'head!


Got family scattered from Texas all the way to Baltimore
Yeah, and I ain't got no home in this world no more
Gonna be a judgment, that's a fact
A righteous train rollin' down this track
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?2Embed
