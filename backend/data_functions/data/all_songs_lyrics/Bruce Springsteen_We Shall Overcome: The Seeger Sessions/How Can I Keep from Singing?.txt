How Can I Keep from Singing? Lyrics
My life goes on in endless song
Above earth's lamentation
I hear the real, though far off hymn
That hails the new creation
What though the tempest loudly roars
I hear the truth, it lives
What though the darkness round me close
Songs in the night, it gives
When tyrants tremble, sick with fear
And hear their death-knell ringing
When friends rejoice both far and near

How can I keep from singing?

No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging
Since love is Lord in Heaven and Earth

How can I keep from singing?Embed
