When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes LyricsHe gave me the eye
But I just passed him by
I treated him unkind
But he didn't seem to mind
I told him be on his way
Not a word did he say
He just stood there kind of bored
What am I acting for?
When the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realise I should apologise
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, oh baby I knew
That he'd won my heart
So I quickly apologised
Hopin' he hadn't changed his mind
Not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away
When the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realise all he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my lips
Then I knew, oh baby I knew
That he'd won my heart, oh yeah
Then he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things he'd say
Then he smiled a-kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight
When the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realise all he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, oh baby I knew
A-that he'd won my heart, oh yeah
When the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realise all I felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, oh, baby, I knew
A-that he'd won my heart, oh yeah
That he'd won my heartEmbed
