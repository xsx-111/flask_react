Will You Love Me Tomorrow LyricsTonight you're mine completely, oh
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?, oh
Is this a lasting treasure?, oh, no, no, no
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Tonight, with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one
But will my heart broken
When the night meets the morning sun?
I'd like to know that your love, no, no, no, no, no
Is a love I can be sure of
So, tell me now
And I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?, oh
So tell me now
And I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?, ah, hey
Will you still love me, love me tomorrow?, no, no, no, no
Will you still love me, love me tomorrow?Embed
