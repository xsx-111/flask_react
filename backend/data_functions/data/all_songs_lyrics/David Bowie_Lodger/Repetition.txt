Repetition Lyrics
Johnny is a man and he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you
When you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevyâ€™s real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table but the food is cold
(Don't hit her)
Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through1Embed
