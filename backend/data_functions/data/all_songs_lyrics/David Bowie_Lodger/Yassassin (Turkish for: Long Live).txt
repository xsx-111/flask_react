Yassassin (Turkish for: Long Live) Lyrics
(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known

We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world

You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known

Look at this, no second glances
Look at this, no value of love
Look at this, just sun and steel
Look at this, then look at us
If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing is wrong
'Cause I have got a love and she is-a feared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known
(Yassassin) I'm not a moody guy
(Yassassin) I walk without a sound
(Yassassin) Just a working man, no judge of men
(Yassassin) But such a life I've never known
Yassassin, Yassassin, Yassassin1Embed
