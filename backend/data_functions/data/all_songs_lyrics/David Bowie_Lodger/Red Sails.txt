Red Sails Lyrics
I feel a little roughed up, feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action, wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around

Thunder ocean, thunder ocean
Red sails take me, make me sail along
Red sails, and a mast so tall
Red sails, red sails

Do you remember, we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall keep us all in tune
Bringing us all back home

Red sails, thunder ocean
Red sails, sailor can't dance like you
Red sail, red sail action
Red sail, some reaction

Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along
Life stands still and stares
The hinterland, the hinterland
We're going to sail to the hinterland
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da
1, 2, 3, 4
