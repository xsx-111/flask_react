Fantastic Voyage Lyrics
In the event that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion
And we never get old

Remember it's true
Dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

It's a very modern world
But nobody's perfect
It's a moving world
But that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again
Will we?
And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world

Remember it's true
Loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose

But any sudden movement
I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated
But I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again
How can I?Embed
