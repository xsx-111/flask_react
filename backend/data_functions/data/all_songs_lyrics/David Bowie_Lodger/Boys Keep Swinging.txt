Boys Keep Swinging Lyrics
Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry when you're a boy

When you're a boy, you can wear a uniform
When you're a boy, other boys check you out
You get a girl, these are your favorite things
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Uncage the colours, unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone you, you are always first on the line
When you're a boy
When you're a boy, you can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy, learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it outEmbed
