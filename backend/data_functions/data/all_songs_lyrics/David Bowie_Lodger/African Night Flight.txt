African Night Flight Lyrics
African night flight one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman, I went too far
Bent on a windfall, rent a Sony
Wonder how the dollar went down
Got to get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey ho, he wished me well
Seemed like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days

Getting in the mood for a Mombasa night flight
Pushing my luck, going to fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff, skimming over Rhino
Born in slumber, less than peace
Struggle with a child, whose screaming, dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine
Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life, quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one left unnamed
Seems like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Seems like another day I could fly
Into the eye of God on high
Over the bushland, over the trees
Wise like orangutan, that was me

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days
His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Got to get a word through one of these days
