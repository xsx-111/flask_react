Move On Lyrics
Sometimes I feel the need to move on
So I pack a bag and move on
Move on
Well, I might take a train or sail at dawn
Might take a girl when I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone is calling me
When the chips are down
I am just a travelling man
Maybe it is just a trick of the mind
But somewhere there is a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo
Mahi-ya, mahi-yo, mahi-ya, mahi-yo

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you
Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
I can't forget you, can't forget you

I can't forget you, can't forget youEmbed
