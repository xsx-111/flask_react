Island LyricsThere is an island
Where it should never be
Surrounded by suburban sea
And through the tired and hopeless waves
To where it's free
I want to be there
For the rest of my time
There on the island
The sun is always bright
The moon sends the darkness away in the night
I know that it's waiting
I know there's a place ready for me
I want to be there
For the rest of my time
Warm sounds of windsongs
Come down through the trees
But far away tears are borne on the breeze
I'll follow the raindrops
Cause sunshine and smiles are waiting for me
I want to be there
For the rest of my timeEmbed
