Wanderer LyricsWanderer, oh wanderer
Chasing up every star
Run for one and then catch none
Then you will know what you are
Then you will know what you are
Wanderer, oh wanderer
Be not afraid of unknowns
Live them through and then will you
Know the truth deep in your bones ?
Know the truth deep in your bones ?
Wanderer, oh wanderer
You are unique as the rest
See your goal and cleanse your soul
Settle and find successEmbed
