Kings & Queens LyricsThe kings and queens are running wild, lonely for each other
Princes gallant, are no more staying under cover
Jesters' jokes aren't even funny, poking fun at sorrow
Lords and ladies hoard their riches fearful for tomorrow
Fantasies turning into truth
Fantasies turning into truth
Fantasies turning into truth
Fantasies turning into truth
Knight in chromium plated armour looking for a reason
Kingdoms crops so fresh and pure are going out of season
Maidens locked in some far tower stay inside forever
Minstrels rhyming songs of reason changing with the weather
(instrumental)
Kings and queens are running wild, lonely for each other
Princes gallant, are no more staying under cover
Jesters' jokes aren't even funny, poking fun at sorrow
Lords and ladies hoard their riches fearful for tomorrow
Fantasies turning into truth
Fantasies turning into truth
Fantasies turning into truth
Fantasies turning into truth
Faces the fanfare, only the fool
Faces the fanfare, only the fool
Faces the fanfare, only the fool
Faces the fanfare, only the fool
Faces the fanfareEmbed
