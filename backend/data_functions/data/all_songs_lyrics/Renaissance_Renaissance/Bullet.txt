Bullet LyricsHey Lady Sodom Ramanah
Black mamba bamboo business
On a red sun night
All over cry forgiveness
For the last gunfight
So cool in your compensation
That you keep next to your skin
Cold sudden shock reminder
That you can't come in
Changing from pain to pleasure
Is an easy ride
Sweating under the sunfire
Till you cried and died
Till you cried and diedEmbed
