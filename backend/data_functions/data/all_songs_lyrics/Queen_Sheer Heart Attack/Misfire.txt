Misfire Lyrics
Don't you misfire
Fill me up with the desire
To carry on

Don't you know, honey
That love's a game?
It's always hit or miss
So take your aim
Got to hold on tight
Shoot me out of sight

Don't you misfire, fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you misfire, fill me up
With the desire to carry on

Your gun is loaded
And pointing my way
There's only one bullet
So don't delay
Got to time it right
Fire me through the night
Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire
