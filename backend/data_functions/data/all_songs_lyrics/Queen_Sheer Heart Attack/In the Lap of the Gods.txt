In the Lap of the Gods Lyrics
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts
With you and only you
Anything you ask I do, for you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end, I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do?

Leave it in the lap of the Gods
(I leave it to you)
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
(I want you to)
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
