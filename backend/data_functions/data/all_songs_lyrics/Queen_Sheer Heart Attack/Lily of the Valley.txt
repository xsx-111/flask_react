Lily of the Valley Lyrics
Baby, you've been had
I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no?
Neptune of the seas, (seas)
Have answer for me, please (please)
The lily of the valley
(Valley) doesn't know
I lie in wait with open eyes (oo-ooh)
I carry on through
Stormy skies (oo-oo-oo-ooh)
I follow every course
(Follow every course)
My kingdom for a horse
(Kingdom for a horse)
But each time I grow old (oo-oo-oo-wah)
Serpent of the Nile, (Nile)
Relieve me for a while (while)
And cast me from your spell
And let me go (oo-oo-ooh, let me go)
Messenger from Seven Seas
Has flown (ooh, oo-oo-ooh)
To tell the King of Rhye
He's lost his throne (Aah)
Wars will never cease (cease)
Is there time enough for peace? (peace)
But the lily of the valley
(Valley) doesn't know
