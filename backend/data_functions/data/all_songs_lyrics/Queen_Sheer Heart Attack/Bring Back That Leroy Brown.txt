Bring Back That Leroy Brown Lyrics
Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown, yeah!
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring that Leroy Brown, back!

Bet your bottom dollar bill
You're a playboy, yeah, yeah!
Daddy cool, with a ninety dollar smile
(Woo, woo, woo, yeah)
Took my money out of gratitude
And he get right out of town
Well, I got to getty up
Steady up, shoot him down
Got to hit that latitude, babe

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown, yeah!
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring back Leroy Brown, yeah!

Big, bad Leroy Brown
He got no common sense
No, no, he got no brains
But he sure got a lot of style
Can't stand no more in this, here, jail
I got to rid myself of this sentence
Got to get out the heat
Step into the shade
Got to get me there
Dead or alive, babe
Woo, woo, big, bad Leroy, woo, woo
Woo, woo, big, bad Leroy Brown

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown, yeah!
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring back Leroy Brown, yeah!

Big mama Lulu Belle
She had a nervous breakdown
(She had a nervous breakdown)
Leroy's taken her honey Chile away
But she met him down
At the station, (ooo-hoo)
Put a shotgun to his head
And unless I be mistaken
This is what she said
Big bad big boy, big bad Leroy Brown
I'm gonna get that cutie pie

Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown, yeah!
Big bad caused a mighty
Fine sensation, yeah, yeah!
Gone and got himself elected President
(We want Leroy for President)
Next time you got to
Hit a bitty baddy weather
This time like a shimmy shammy leather
He's a big boy, bad boy Leroy
I don't care where you get him from

Bring that big, bad Leroy back
Want him back6Embed
