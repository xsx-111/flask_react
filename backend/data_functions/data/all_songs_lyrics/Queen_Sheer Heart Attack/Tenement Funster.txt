Tenement Funster Lyrics
My new purple shoes
Been amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll 45's
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I've got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual

Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place


I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young
And you're poor, and you're crazy
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
Young and you're crazy!
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place4Embed
