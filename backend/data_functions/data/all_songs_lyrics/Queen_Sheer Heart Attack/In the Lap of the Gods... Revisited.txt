In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited Lyrics
It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky, but I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and
Forgive me when I ask you, "Where do I belong?"
You say, "I (You can do it) can't (You can do it)
(You can go and set him free) Set you free from me"
But that's not true

It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh3Embed
