Only Loved at Night LyricsA beauty only loved at night
At daytime a face full of marks
Her eyes have been in flames all night
The sun won't have eyes for her again
Only loved at night, the lady in the dark
Knew the size of tall buildings
How dear a day-kiss could be
Those buildings that saw all the airplanes
That kissed the air in vain fantasy
Only loved at night, the lady in the dark
Didn't her eyes reflect all of this?
Why couldn't they look into her eyes?
Didn't each night love her another time?
Male nights and sometimes female
Boys loved her at night
Girls loved her in the darkEmbed
