Odyshape LyricsShe looks
She looks embarrassed, embarrassed
She looks in mirror
In magazine
She looks embarassed, embarassed
(I’m not glamourous or polished
In fact I’m no ornament
It could be my body shape
I wonder if I’ll ever look right)
Blot on the landscape, unrefined
Quite out of place
Her nose is too big
Maybe operation
Her waist too wide
Her hair is not shining
Oh! It isn’t fair, she isn’t fair
You’re walking sad
You’re looking bad
You’re talking sad
You’re looking bad
Hung up for fractional inches
Hung up for the cloth that pinches
Do I measure up to your expectations?
Am I owed any explanations?
Hung up for fractional inches
Hung up for the cloth that pinches
Do I measure up to your expectations?
Am I owed any explanations?
You’re walking sad
You’re looking bad
You’re talking sad
You’re looking bad
Blot on the landscape, unrefined
Quite out of place
Her nose is too big
Maybe operation
Her waist too wide
Her hair is not shining
Oh! It isn’t fair she isn’t fair...
She looks
She looks embarrassed, embarrassed
She looks
She looks embarrassed, embarrassed1Embed
