Family Treet LyricsMelts in your mouth
But not in your hands
It’s not in your hands
It’s not in your hands
Family, class, and nation
Romantic expectations
With a duty to perform for her man
Or for this fair land
But scratching at the window
You can’t be heard
Melts on the carpet
Mess on the first night
She will clean it up
She will clean it up
Melts her resistance
Seen through a rainy lens
She isn't in the cutting room
She’s not in the cutting room
Family class and nation
Romantic expectations
With a duty to perform for her man
Or for this fair land
But scratching at the window
You can’t be heard
So you succumb
To the dumb processions
Of acts of faith
Of woman born
Of man slain
Do we have the power to will any other way
Come dance this day away away away
Come dance this day away away away
Come dance this day away away away (Come dance this day away)
Melts her resistance
Seen through a rainy lens
She’s not in the cutting room (she's not in the cutting room)
She’s not in the cutting room1Embed
