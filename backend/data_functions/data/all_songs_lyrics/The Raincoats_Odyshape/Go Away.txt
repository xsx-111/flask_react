Go Away LyricsGo away, go away, go away
I feel insane
Go, go, go away
I feel insane
You know they've killed the fool
You know they’ve crushed her soul
I've seen them crushing the fool
You know they've killed her soul
She tried to fulfill a space
She thought was meant for power
For living her life and leaving the lies
By using her eyes
For looking at it
By making it (the buildings)
By creating it (the claws)
By taking it (the dreams)
Not destroying it
By living it
The clues to our lives
The clues to our deaths
We’re going to rejoice
Rejoice ‘cause this landscape is alive
The buildings, the claws, the dreams
I'll be living my life
Leaving the lies
I’ll be using my eyes
My eyes for looking at them
The buildings, the claws, the dreamsEmbed
