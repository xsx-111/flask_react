Baby Song LyricsAnimal function
Shaped by culture
Animal function
Motherhood in culture
My body beats to new rhythms
To new rhythms of my own
Wholeness with nature (Don’t look away, don’t look away, look away)
Can I reject it? (Don’t look away, look a- look a- look away)
Can I accept it as my own? (Don’t look away, look away, look a- look a- look away)
Animal function
Motherhood in culture
Maternal power and the value of caring
Obscured by history
Naturally
A choice to stretch
A limit to lose
A limit to choice to stretch or lose (Baby, baby, baby x 7)
Don't look away
Don't push me away
Don’t look away
Don’t push me away
Awakening
Moon mother's transformers
Changing it all about
Inside out
And outside in
And upside down
And downside up (x2)
(murmuring)
Don't look away (Don’t look away)
Don't push me away (Don’t push me away)
Don't look away (Don’t look away)
Don't push me away (Don’t push me away)
Animal function
Motherhood in culture
Maternal power and the value of caring
Obscured by history
Naturally (Baby, baby, baby x4)
Inside out
And outside in
And upside down
And downside up (x2)
Changing it all about
Inside out
And upside down
And downside up
And outside in
Baby baby baby
Upside down
And downside up
Inside out
And upside down
And downside up
Inside out
And outside in
Upside down
And downside up
And inside outEmbed
