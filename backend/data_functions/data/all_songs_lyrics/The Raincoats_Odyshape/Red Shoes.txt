Red Shoes LyricsI was caught by the warmth of a drunken heart
I was caught by the warmth of a drunken heart
I heard the whispers that quietened noises around
The walls have no color and the music no sound
I was caught by the fear of the tears on my shoes
I was caught by the fear of the tears on my shoes
I almost started dreaming, dreaming of something real
But the walls kept tripping, and that's all I could feelEmbed
