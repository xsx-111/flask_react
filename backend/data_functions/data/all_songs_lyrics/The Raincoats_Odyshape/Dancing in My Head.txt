Dancing in My Head LyricsHand in hand with the physical is the spiritual
Hand in hand with myself I feel you feel
Spirit inside of me I feel you
Let's fly
Physically feeling tired
But my spirit is dancing
Dancing in my head and in my heart
Have to live, to work, to eat, to share, and to be fair
Have to work to improve the physical, the physical
But my spirit is dancing
Dancing in my head and in my heart
Hear you laughing
Music is spiritual
Dancing notes and atmosphere
Now itâ€™s 
We've got a long, long way to go
With the physical, with the physical
With the classes and the colors and the sexes and the races
You've got a long, long way to go with the spiritual, spiritual
Spirit I see you dancing, hear you laughing, hear you laughing, see you waving
Sense you beckoning, rocking, seeing, gently flowing, beckons me 
Communication, our minds to meet
Spirit I see you dancing, see you waving
But my spirit is dancing, dancing in my head and in my heartEmbed
