Deep Ocean Vast Sea LyricsDeep ocean vast sea
Your ocean heart
Clothed in respect
And sweet caress
My uneasy mind
You dip and you swell
Float and you find
And sweet caress
My uneasy mind
Deep ocean vast sea
Deep ocean vast sea - well that's deep
Imagine set of steps easily climbed
The tower of pride
The plastic of mind
Where there lies a table
The table stands
For the power of success
Respect on the sign
Intelligence so cold
A heart like glass
From the surface to deep
You wave and you dive
Like the heart and the sun
You wave and you dive
You hold me so cold
You wave and you dive
Deep ocean vast sea
Deep ocean vast sea - well that's me
You're clothed in respect
You smell of sweet caress
Dip and swell beyond the power of fists
Your ocean heart
Healing uneasy minds
And I wanna dive in with you
Clinging to the rock, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting
Deep ocean vast sea
Deep ocean vast sea - well that's deep
Your heart is hard
You think your legs hurt
You smell of aching sweet success
Your head's a supernova
And you would like
Anything to stop the pain from your fingers
Screaming
And you stand naked in the sun
Without leather
Whose pain you think you need
Well all you need to do is undress
Let go and wash
Take the step through the other side
Up-turned razor
The air is thick with karma
A sutra of the way down
Well listen boy it's a long way down
Down through heaven's gate
To heaven's gate the step's the step
The tower of pride
The devil lied
Dive up to the highest point where the lives are save'ed
Where all the lives the tables stand
Power to success, respect and climb the steps2Embed
