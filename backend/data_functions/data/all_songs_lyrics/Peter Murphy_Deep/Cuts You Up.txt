Cuts You Up Lyrics
I find you in the morning
After dreams of distant signs
You pour yourself over me
Like the sun through the blinds
You lift me up and get me out
Keep me walking but never shout
Hold the secret close, I hear you say
(Here we go)

You know the way, it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out
It spits you out when you desire
To conquer it, to feel you're higher
To follow it you must be clean
With mistakes that you do mean
Move the heart and switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place

On and on it goes
Calling like a distant wind
Oh, through the zero hour we'll walk
We'll cut the thick and break the thin
No sound to break, no moment clear
When all the doubts are crystal clear
Crashing hard into the secret wind
You know the way, it twists and turns
Changing colour, spinning yarns
You know the way, it leaves you dry
It cuts you up and takes you high
You know the way, it's painted gold
Is it honey? Is it cold?
You know the way, it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out

(Oh...) Cuts you up
(Oh...) Cuts you up
(Oh...) Cuts you up
La, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la, la, la
Oh...
Oh...

You know the way, it throws about
It takes you in and spits you out
It spits you out when you desire
To conquer it, to feel you're higher
To follow it you must be clean
With mistakes that you do mean
Move the heart, switch the pace
Look for what seems out of place
(Oh...) Cuts you up
(Oh...) Cuts you up
It's OK, it goes this way
The line it twists, it twists away
Cuts you up and spits you out
Keeps you walking but never shout
It's OK, it goes this way
The line it twists, it twists away
Cuts you up and spits you out
Keeps you walking but, ah, never shout
La, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la, la, la, la
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh...3Embed
