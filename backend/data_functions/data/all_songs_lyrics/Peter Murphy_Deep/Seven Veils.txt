Seven Veils Lyrics
The day grows older the moon appears in a mirror
A fire side mirror a distant walker hears the words
Go do good deeds so you feel ok
The moon and the sun partners in light separating
Feflecting one light hearing this confusion wanes
No need to ask for wealth or one thing more now

And the night feels the same
As a cool hot summers climb
With the voice comes no shame
As the walker walks the line

The day grows older the moon appears reflecting on his heart
Heavy weighed and pierced the walker looks at his days
Bad deeds gone by for which he must pay
The moon and the sun partners in light
Separating reflecting one light hearing this confusion wanes
Another image hits the seven veils of mind

But the night feels the same
As a cool hot summers climb
With the voice comes no shame
As the walker hunts the line

But the night feels the same
As a cool hot summers climb
With the voice comes no shame
As the walker hunts the lineEmbed
