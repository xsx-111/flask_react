I Dance Like This Lyrics
In another dimension
Like the clothes that you wear
A mighty, mighty battle
Sproutin' illegal hair
A fitness consultant
In the negative zone
Wanderin' the city
Lookin' for a home

I dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If I could dance better (Heheh)
Well, you know that I would

How the rumor got started
Oh, one can only guess
And the truth don't mean nothin'
If you ain't got the cash
A credit card mommy
An invisible dad
Career opportunities
That you never had
We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better
Well you know that we would

I'm working on my dancing
This is the best I can do
I'm tentatively shaking
You don't have to look
Can't say I'm sorry
I can't say I'm ashamed
Can't think of tomorrow
When it seems so far away

We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better (Hehe)
Well, you know that we would
We dance like this
Because it feels so damn good
If we could dance better (Hehe)
Well, you know that we would1Embed
