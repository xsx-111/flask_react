Gasoline and Dirty Sheets Lyrics
Someone in a dangerous place (Hey)
Someone got lost somewhere
Many people are locked outside (Hey)
Many people lost out there
Many people, they can't get in (Hey)
Many people, they pay no mind
Many people, they leave this place
And many people afraid of time
Well now, this man, he could be king
This woman, she's royalty
This woman, she's brave and strong
She's got no name, but she is family

Gasoline and dirty sheets
Politics and a painted face
She says that freedom costs too much
She says the mind is not a place

This situation drags me down
They form a country in my house
On the stage and in the street
I will be a human being
I will come down off the stage
The marketplace and the shopping mall
Into the house, the rooms of war
Look at me now and recall, hey

Vacuum-packed don't rock my world
And the money-back guarantee don't make my day
And no feeling of security
They say the answer's one click away

Gasoline and dirty sheets
Politics and a painted face
She says that freedom costs too much
She says the mind is not place, yeah
Gasoline and dirty sheets
Politics and a painted face
She says that freedom costs too much
She says the mind is not placeEmbed
