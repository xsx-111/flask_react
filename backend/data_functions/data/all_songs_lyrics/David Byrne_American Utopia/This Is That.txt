This Is That Lyrics
When the song comes on
When I hear them say
Everything stops
Everything changed
It's nothing special now
It's nothing profound, but
Something about the way it sounds
When the melody ends
And the rhythm kicks in
It knows where I'm at
And it knows where I've been, well

That's when I call you up
That's when my river overflows
That's when I use my cash card
That's when I think of who you are

That's when there's a knock at the door
And that's what we're doing it for
Well, that's when I got your message
And that's when I sing this song, ah
That's when he says it's over
That's when my life is in your hands now
That's when I call you up
That's when my river overflows
That's when I use my cash card
That's when I think of who you are

This is when
This is now
This is that
This is how
This is what
This is then
This is where
This is when
This is now
This is that
This is how
This is what
This is then
This is where
This is whenEmbed
