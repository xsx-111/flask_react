Doing the Right Thing Lyrics
I'm always, I'm always doing the right thing (That's right)
I'm always, I'm always doing the right thing (Help me now)

What am I supposed to do with this?
What am I supposed to know about this?
What am I supposed to have in my hands?
What is written on that paper you have?

Now I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing (Help me now)

What am I not supposed to do now?
What's that and is it my business?
What exactly, exactly did you tell me?
What's good, does that mean it's right?

I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing

She and I visit the tourist shrines
We are proud of our automobile
She picks out some arts and crafts
I'm deep into the local cuisine
Let me show you my latest CD
Let me take you to the restaurant
Let me drive you to my country house
I hope you appreciate fine works of art now
I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing (Now)

Woo!

Now, I'm not alone
And we're all the same
And the, the world won't end
It will just change its name
Now, give me the bat
Give me the ball
This is my job
Let's get involved
Give me the phone
Give me the sign
Give me good luck
What's yours is mine

Now, I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing
I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing
I'm always doing the right thing
I'm doing the right thing1Embed
