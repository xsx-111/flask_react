Noble Nobles Lyrics
Dining debutantes in pearl and powdered sugar face
Their refined tastes
Come suckle from mama’s wet maid, you know
Drinking dapper gents in wig and rosy cultured views
Toasting the news
All cargo on Jesus was sold today

Manifest and lavish
God wants him to have this
And without a doubt believe his
Ends are noble so the savage means
Are deleted from the scene so
We can believe that we are
Noble nobles what a savage myth

Walking pioneers in blazing trails and rushing gold
So far from home
But none of them shed any tears at all
Not at all
Talking founding fathers with a free philosophy
That don’t mention me
Or the stain of red blood on their hands, at all
Now, we all
Replay it till we understand
The moral
Of, the story we’re shooting again
Tomorrow's savages!

Manifest in lavish
God wants him to have this
And without a doubt, believe his
Ends are noble so the savage means
Are deleted from the scenes
So we can believe that we are
Noble nobles, what a savage myth1Embed
