Unconditional Love Lyrics
We could change the whole story of love
Same old play I’m getting tired of
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living unconditional love
(Could we be real love?)
(We see a real love start unfolding...)

Faded cliches and makeup
Dancing and singing scripted delight
Every act ends in breakup
That, same old boring story I’ve played too many nights
The curtain ends up falling
Then arrows strike my heart
Oh, but oh
If some magic should find me
Like the magic in your eyes, oh
If your eyes would invite me, oh

We could change the whole story of love
Same old play I’m getting tired of
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living unconditional love
(Could we be real love?)
(We see a real love start unfolding...)
For my finale, waiting
Off in the wings, to sing the last song
And when we’re done pretending
Throw me a white bouquet
Oh I, close the curtain behind me
And enclose me in your arms, oh
If your arms would invite me, oh

We could change the whole story of love
Same old play I’m getting tired of
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living unconditional love
(Could we be real love?)
(We see a real love start unfolding?)3Embed
