Good Lava Lyrics
See this pretty girl?
Watch this pretty girl flow

Lone Ranger
I see you like the view
Wondering from a distance what my pretty peak can do
Come brave me

Don't march up
In your discerning shoes
I see right through the cooler all around your blowing fuse
So let loose
The mountain

Oh good times, good lava
We all know you wanna

(If you believe it's good)
See this pretty girl flow
(Wait 'til you feel it)
You wanna
With this pretty girl flow
Good Lava
Good Lava
You stranger
One day you're gonna be
Planting your own flattered, conquered fear and fantasy
Right on me
With this pretty girl flow
Promise not to name it and I'll even let you climb
Inside
My mountain

Oh good times, good lava
We all know you wanna

See this pretty girl flow
You wanna
With this pretty girl flow
You wanna, mmm
See this pretty girl flow
You wanna
With this pretty girl flow
Good lava
Good lava
Oh good times, good lava
We all know you wanna4Embed
