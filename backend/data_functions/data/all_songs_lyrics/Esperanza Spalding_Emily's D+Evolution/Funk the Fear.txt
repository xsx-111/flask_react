Funk the Fear Lyrics
Funk the fear
Live your life

Why don’t we seize the day
And frost it in our own way
Why don’t you dare take a slice of this sitting out paradise
Eating it with your eyes
Just shy of your smarts or rights
To reach out and lift the glass
But there’s no one here to ask

(The invisible beat of a drum)
March in line
(Keeping all you are under the gun)
For no reason or rhyme
No facing that dream about
Paradise pigging out

I wanna break the rules with you
And see the dream come true
All I need you to do is
(Funk the fear, live your life)
Just like we came here to
(Funk the fear, live your life)
I want to do it with thee
(Funk the fear, live your life)
Just like we came here to
(Funk the fear, live your life)
Live your life
Funk the fear, live your life x2

Why don’t we go and do
Just what we came here to?
Nobody has to know
The moral of our show
(We could be)
Spiritual spouting fools
Or bombshells to cash their drool
Innocent as a fox
And other unchecked boxes

(In the margin of error for one)
We appear
(With a beautiful slip of the tongue)
That you hear from a reason
Waking you from a daze
Follow me down the maze
Through every craft and craze
For every dead end we find
Ways open in my mind

(There's a pitiful quip on the tongue)
I can tell
('Bout the marginal mission of one)
Very well
But your heard me calling you you up and out
That’s what this show’s about

I wanna break the rules with you
And see the dream come true
What I need you to do is
(Funk the fear, live your life)
Just like we came here to
(Funk the fear, live your life)
I want to do it with thee
(Funk the fear, live your life)
Just like we came here to
(Funk the fear, live your life)
I want to do it with thee
(Funk the fear, live your life)
Just like we came here to
(Funk the fear, live your life)
Live your life
Funk the fear, live your life (repeats until song fades out)

Cause in an instant it could be gone
And all the waiting was in vain
Cause in an instant it could be gone
It could be gone x7Embed
