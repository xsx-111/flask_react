One Lyrics
I'm not lacking in love
Not haunted by its pain
Of romance, life's given me enough
I can't complain
But now in this quiet midnight mind
I faintly see

The one so strong
It stops the world and my heart's spinning
One to prove what I've always known

But couldn't see when he crossed my sky
From a star, fell out, shot across my mind
In the fiery pull of bodies floating along, hot
Gravity does burn inside me
I would orbit all who invite me
Oh, then again

There could be one so strong
It stops the world and my heart's spinning
One to prove what I've always known
But couldn't see this modern mind
Won't deny the times that it can't defy
When a primal urge just calls me down to the shore, hot
Devolution burns inside me
I would dive in all who delight me
Oh, then again

There could be one so strong
It stops the world and my heart's spinning
One to prove what I've always known
But couldn't meet

The one so strong
It stops the world and my heart's spinning
One to prove what I've always known
But couldn't meet3Embed
