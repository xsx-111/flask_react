Rest in Pleasure Lyrics
Ooo
Now what are we gonna do
With our two fiery souls
You act like you don't know
Now let me show it to you

And rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x15)

Ooo
The moment I saw you, I knew
We've both been looking for this
I found my long lost bliss
And I will share it with you

And rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x47)

Now, truth be told I may not be, really in love with you
It's the idea of love I'm really into
But in case you ever get the mind to wonder
I do care
Just stay there

Ooo
Now, someday we may lose
Our thrill, but never forget
The greatest love made yet
And while I make it with you

Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
Rest in pleasure
Ah (x13)
