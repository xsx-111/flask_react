Unconditional Love (Alternate Version) Lyrics
We could change the whole story of love
Same old play I'm getting tired
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living
Unconditional love

Faded clichés and makeup
Dancing and singing; scripted delight
Every act ends in breakup
That same old boring story I played too many nights
The curtain ends up falling
Then arrows strike my heart
Oh, but oh
If some realness should find me
Like the magic in your eyes, oh
If your eyes would invite me, oh

We could change the whole story of love
Same old play I'm getting tired
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living
Unconditional love
For my finale, waiting
Off in the wings to sing the last song
And when we’re done pretending
Throw me a white bouquet
Oh I, close the curtain behind me
And enclose me in your arms, oh
If your arms would invite me, oh
 (x2)
We could change the whole story of love
Same old play I'm getting tired
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living
Unconditional love
We'd see a real love start unfolding
La, la la
(Instrumental)

We could change the whole story of love, and
Same old play I'm getting tired of
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us... living
We could change the whole story of love
Boring play I'm getting tired of
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living, unconditional love
Woah, the whole story of love's a
Boring play I'm getting tired of
No more acting these predictable roles
Just us living
Unconditional LoveEmbed
