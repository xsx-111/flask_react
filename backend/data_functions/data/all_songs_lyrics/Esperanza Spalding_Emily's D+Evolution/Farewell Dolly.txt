Farewell Dolly Lyrics
Change the way I see my life
Why would I, why would I
I'm the dolly, I'm the wife
Damned if I, do or die
Maybe time is gonna make
An exception for me
I'm exceptionally, busy
Judging by the times
He's not worried 'bout my kind, or is he?

Damn the way I go and bide
All the rest, of my time
Waiting for a man to die
For a piece, of the pie
Maybe time is gonna wait
And expect less from me
I'm exceptionally, pretty
I can testify
Nature's dead up in my mind, with me2Embed
