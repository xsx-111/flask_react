Change Us Lyrics
Soon as it's quiet, then a storm
Is already a' formin'
Rumbling with your lover's doubt
And then you cloud me out
And the lightning flies
But then I see you on the corner
Shining for Simone
Or Sherilee and Baby Doll
They're leashin' flat up all
To fetch your mind
Look, we can fight and stay on the same team in the same room
But if you walk away
That'll be your last play
I already know when my grass is greener, don't you?
Why just complicate it
You know I love ya, but I hate it
When you start kicking dust

Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good, you wanna change us
Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good, you wanna change us
Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good, you wanna change us
Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good?

Soon as you see a happy ending
Up around the bend
We break into your lover's swerve
And end up on the curb
With a stalling grind
And then I hear that you were told
Our engine's getting cold, to
Malcolm, Ben and Johnathan
Letting pedestrians
Steer ya from behind
Look, there are breakdowns all along this road to love
And some hitchhikers, too
Looking to just ride along
We can steer back on to the good road; hand-in-glove
Please don't complicate it
You know I love you, but I hate it
When you start kicking dust

Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good, you wanna change us
Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good, you wanna change us
Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good, you wanna change us
Why must we fuss?
Just when it's good?

Look in the mirror, darling
Try to see clearer, darling
Not getting younger, darling

Why, must we fuss?
Just when it's good, you wanna change us
I don't wanna change us...1Embed
