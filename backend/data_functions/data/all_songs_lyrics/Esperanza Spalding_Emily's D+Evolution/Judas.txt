Judas Lyrics
Judas, you know the lonesome road; don’t you?
Collecting bottle caps of rum
Honest sinning, to chase the blues
Blur ya ‘til kingdom come

Take a little girl who gets to see her mama broke down
Now she’s a lady made for the modern world, my life
But if you ask my advice
Us raging girls are china dolls fed up with all that follows
All the way down
Digging up holy scriptures to shame her while she drowns
But if you ask my advice
That shallow grave's a bargain next to Judgment Day
It’s only a matter of time, honey
Good money
Sinks through her teeth
She’s not evil
Forgive this innocent wrecking ball (man-made)

Judas, you know the lonesome road; don’t you?
Collecting bottle caps of rum
Honest sinning, to chase the blues
Blur ya ‘til kingdom come
Take a little boy who gets to see his papa broke down
Now he’s a shadow made for the modern world, my life
But if you ask my advice
Us raging boys are Indian cowboys high on toys, that follow
All the way down
Locking up holy figures to shame the whole damn town
But if you ask my advice
Their island cage can’t hold the rising sea of rage
It’s only a matter of time, honey
Good money
Made on the street
He’s not evil
Forgive this innocent wrecking ball (man-made)

Judas, you know the lonesome road; don’t you?
Collecting bottle caps of rum
Honest sinning, to chase the blues
Blur ya ‘til kingdom come

You either love him or you leave him
You either love him or you leave him
Are you a lover or a leaver
Are you a lover or a leaver
A matter of time, honey
Good money
Earned in defeat
It's not evil
Forgive this innocent wrecking ball (man-made)

Judas, you know the lonesome road; don’t you?
Collecting bottle caps of rum
Honest sinning, to chase the blues
Blur ya ‘til kingdom comeEmbed
