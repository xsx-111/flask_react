Earth to Heaven Lyrics
Thought and strength and breath
Ain't much else left
Better have your fill before you know, it's over
Say the natural laws
And if the heavenly goddess, should call
Is it heaven at all? (sober)

These poor drunks don't know
Money won't flow
On the other side, they're sure to go
Withdrawlin' from the need to achieve
Be careful what you believe, in strong
For you carry it on (over)

There are no perfect amends here
You get to just keep on getting there, getting there
There's no promise or test here
You get to just keep on getting there, getting there (soldier)
No virgins or saints here
You get to just keep on getting there, getting there
All good children and evil
Are even here; just getting there
War man's cross on their (shoulders)
Kings die ringed in gold
Slaves die consoled
On the other side, a meek's reward
Is better
Like a pearly resort
Except without a report, from hell
How on Earth can you tell?

Burn or charge or hate
Church men debate
How to curse a sin and compensate?
Their burden
Of upholding the law
But if the heavenly boss, turns out
To be ruling without (orders)

All legacies end here
You get to just keep getting there, getting there
No promise or test here
You get to just keep getting there, getting there
No virgins or saints here
You get to just keep on getting there
All aliens illegal
Crossing even here
They come to just keep on getting there
Statesmen lost in their (borders)Embed
