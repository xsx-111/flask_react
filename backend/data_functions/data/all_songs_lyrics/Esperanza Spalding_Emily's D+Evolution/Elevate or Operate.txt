Elevate or Operate Lyrics
Four walls surround, us with a glassy top
We're going down
Or has the sky gone up?

Honey don't interrupt me!
(Look at the cloud!)
(Looks like, we're going down...)
Honey don't make me turn this thing around!
(Or is the sky, rising up?)
(Look at the top!)
(Looks like, we're going down!)
Honey don't interrupt me!
(Or is the sky, rising?)

Just keep riding 'til you scrape the sky
There's so many pies to try, in so little time
You won't exactly taste none in your mouth
But anything worth reaching must, cut folk like us out
So honey stop your whining, wishing, scheming
Press a floor to waste your dreams in

(Look at the cloud...)
(Looks like, we're going down!)
Honey don't interrupt me!
(Or is the sky, rising up?)
(Look at the cloud!)
(Looks like, we're going down!)
Honey don't try to turn this thing around!
(Or is the sky, rising?)
Just keep riding 'til your wonder stops
Boot straps up around your neck, in case the thing drops
No one exactly knows what's at the top
But anything worth working for, must hide a whole lot
So honey stop that whining, wishing, dreaming
'fore you make me start believing

You know we can't stop it abruptly!
(Look at the top!)
(Looks like, we're going down!)
Now just how do we turn this thing around?
(Or is the sky, rising up?)
And are we going up or down?
(Look at the top!)
(Looks like, we're going down!)
Honey don't interrupt me!
(Or is the sky, rising up?)
I'm trying to turn this thing around!
(Look at the top!)
(Looks like, we're going down!)
Honey come help me turn this thing around!
(Or is the sky, rising up?)
Are we going up or down?
(Look at the top!)
(Looks like, we're going down!)
Honey just help me turn this thing around!
(Or is the sky, rising up?)
I think were going down!
Four walls surround, us with a glassy top
We're going down...
And yes the sky's gone up!1Embed
