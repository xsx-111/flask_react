PERPETUAL FLAME OF CENTRALIA LyricsI am covered with the blood of Jesus
Fear is nothing when the path is righteous
I rest my head in a holy kingdom
Mine is the venom of the snake of Eden
Life is a song, a song
And the fires of hell burn long and dull
Life is a song, a song
And the raging fires of hell burn long
I am covered with the blood of Jesus
Fear is nothing when the path is righteous
I rest my head in a holy kingdom
Mine is the venom of the snake of Eden
Life is a song, a song
And the fires of hell burn long and dull
Life is a song, a song
And the raging fires of hell burn long2Embed
