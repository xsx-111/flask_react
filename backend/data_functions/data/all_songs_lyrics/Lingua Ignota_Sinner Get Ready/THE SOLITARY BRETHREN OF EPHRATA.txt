THE SOLITARY BRETHREN OF EPHRATA Lyrics
"Aren't you concerned you could infect other people if you get sick inside?"
"No..."
"People who don't go to this church-"
"No, I'm covered in Jesus's blood. I'm covered in Jesus's blood."
"But what about other people who don't go to this church, who you might encounter?"
"All of these people go to this church."
"No, but you're gonna be in places where other people-"
"I go to the grocery store every day, I'm in Walmart, Home Depot, all of those people!"
"But you could get them sick from what happens in the church."
"They could get me sick but they're not because I'm covered in his blood! Thank you very much."
Paradise will be mine
Paradise will be mine
Paradise will be mine
All my pains are lifted
Paradise is mine
All my wounds are mended
Paradise is mine
Paradise is mine
Paradise will be mine
Paradise will be mine
Paradise will be mine
No longer shall I wander
Ugliness my home
Loneliness my master
I bow to him alone
I bow to him alone1Embed
