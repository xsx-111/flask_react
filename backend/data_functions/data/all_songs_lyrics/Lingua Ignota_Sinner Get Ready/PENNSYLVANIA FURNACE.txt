PENNSYLVANIA FURNACE LyricsMe and the dog we die together
Within the Lord I cast off all my earthly bonds
There is victory in Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Do you want to be in Hell with me?
I know you want to stop but you can't stop
I've watched you alone
In the home where you live with your family
And all that I've learned is everything burns
Do you want to be in Hell with me?
I wish things could be any other way
I've watched you alone
In the home where you live with your family
But one thing I've learned is everything burns
Above all others
Above all
Above all others
Above all
I fear your voice
Above all others
Above all others
Above all
I fear your name
Above all others
Above all others
Above all
I fear your voice
Above all others
Above all others
Above all
Me and the dog we die together6Embed
