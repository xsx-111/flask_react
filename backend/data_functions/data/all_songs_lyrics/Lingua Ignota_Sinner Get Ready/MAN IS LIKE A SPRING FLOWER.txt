MAN IS LIKE A SPRING FLOWER Lyrics
"He's up there, crying and I know those tears aren't real."
"How do you know?"
"They just can't be. Because he was up there preaching about all this stuff, and then, turned doin' it, you know and and..."
"But couldn't his tears of repentance be real?"
"Well, maybe but..."
"Wha-"
"...To me I don't really think so because, y'know uh, I watch him on TV, I mean I don't really watch him but, some of the things I've seen. And he's a totally different person than when he came when hе seen me. That's the real pеrson I think he was."
The heart of man is an orchid
The heart of man is the open gulch itself
The heart of man is the Seventh Gate of Hell
The heart of man is the crushed horse's tail
The heart of man is a furnace
The heart of man is the open fiery pit
The heart of man is the hand of God extended
The heart of man is the burning barn upended
The heart of man is an orchid
The heart of man is the open gulch itself
The heart of man is the Seventh Gate of Hell
The heart of man is the crushed horse's tail
No love is enough
Love is not enough
No one is enough
The heart of man is unbearable to hold
No love is enough
One is not enough
Love is not enough
The heart of man is unbearable to hold
No one is enough
One is not enough
No one is enough
The heart of man is impossible to hold
One is not enough
Love is not enough
No one is enough
The heart of man is impossible to hold
One is not enough
No one is enough
No love is enough
The heart of man is unbearable to hold
No one is enough
No one is enough
One is not enough
The heart of man is impossible to hold1Embed
