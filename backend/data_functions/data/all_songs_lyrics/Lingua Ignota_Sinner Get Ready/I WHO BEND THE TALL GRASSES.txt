I WHO BEND THE TALL GRASSES Lyrics
Glorious Father, intercede for me
If I cannot hide from you, neither can he
Always your voice bites the back of a cold wind
And the tall grasses bend for you

Where does your light not shine?
Where does your light not shine?

Take hold of my gentle axe and split him open
Gather up my quiet hammer and nail him down
Use any of your heavenly means
Your golden scythe
Your holy sword
Your fiery arrows studded with stars
I don't give a fuck
Just kill him
You have to
I'm not asking

I have made my body your vessel
I preach your word in every room
I have walked the earth weeping
I whip my back with my many sorrows
Are my sacrifices not extravagant?
All I have is yours
And I swear I can't do it again
I swear to you, Lord, he has to die
There is no other way, there is no other way
Where does your light not shine?
Where does your light not shine?

I have never loved him more than I do now
But I can't do it again
I have to be the only one
I'm not asking
You understand?
He belongs to me
You understand?
It is my voice that bites the back of a cold wind
It is my voice that bites the back of a cold wind
And I, it is I who bends the tall grasses
It is I, I am the one
I am the only one
I have to be
I don't care that he can't help it
I can't do it again
I can't do it again
He belongs to me

Where does your light not shine?
Where does your light not shine?
Glorious Father, intercede for me
If I cannot hide from you, neither can he3Embed
