THE ORDER OF SPIRITUAL VIRGINS LyricsHide your children, hide your husbands
Hide your children, hide your husbands
I am relentless, I am incessant, I am the ocean
And all who dare look upon me swear eternal devotion
So hide your children, hide your husbands
Hide your children, hide your husbands
I am relentless, I am incessant, I am the ocean
And all who dare look upon me swear eternal devotion
And all who dare look upon me swear eternal devotion
Sicknеss finds a way in
Eternal devotion
Sickness finds a way in
Etеrnal devotion
Eternal devotion
Eternal devotion
Eternal devotion
Eternal devotion

...You've ever been with somebody, even in a crowd, I don’t know, and just kind of always... Just kind of always... and I learnt that way. Dead silent right now, dead silent and calm. Everything has a rhythm and a beat and the silence is one of the most soothing ones, I just love to hear the dead silence, if that makes any sense. In the dead silence you can hear your departed mother sing a hymn in church from 30 years ago, that's what you get out of the silence2Embed
