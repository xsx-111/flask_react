REPENT NOW CONFESS NOW LyricsRepent now, repent now
Remember this body is not your home
No pleasure in this year
No wound as sharp as the will of God
Repent now, repent now
The surgeon's precision is nothing
No wound as sharp as the will of God
Repent and He will abundantly pardon
He will take your legs and your will to live
Confess now, confess now
Confess now, confess now
O he will knock the breath from you
He will ram your eyes with glass
He will take your legs and your will to live
If you do not confess now, confess now
I can't say I don't deserve it
He will take my legs and my will to live
God's will be done, no wound as sharp
No pleasure in this year
Repent now
Repent now, repent now
I can't say I don't deserve it
He took my legs and my will to live1Embed
