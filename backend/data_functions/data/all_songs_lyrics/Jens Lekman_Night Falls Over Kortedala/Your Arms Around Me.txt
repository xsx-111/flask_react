Your Arms Around Me Lyrics
I was slicing up an avocado
When you came up behind me
With your silent brand new sneakers
Your reflection I did not see
It was the hottest day in August
We were heading for the sea
For a second my mind started drifting
You put your arms around me

You put your arms around me
You put your arms around

Blood spraying on the kitchen sink
"What's this" I have time to think
I see the tip of my index finger
My mind is slowly creating a link
From your mouth speaks your lovely voice
The softest words ever spoken
"What's broken can always be fixed
What's fixed will always be broken"
You put your arms around me
You put your arms around me
You put your arms around me
You put your arms around


I must have passed out on the porch
Dreamt I was carried in a kangaroo's pouch
When I wake up, I'm in the waiting room
On a dirty hospital couch
My hand is wrapped in toilet paper
And my body is wrapped in debris
You're sitting next to me reading the paper
I put your arm around me
