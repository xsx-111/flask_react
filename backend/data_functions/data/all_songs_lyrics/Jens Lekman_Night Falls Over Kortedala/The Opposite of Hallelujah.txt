The Opposite of Hallelujah LyricsI took my sister down to the ocean
But the ocean made me feel stupid
Those words of wisdom I had prepared
All seemed to vanish into thin air
Into the waves I stared
I picked up a seashell
To illustrate my homelessness
But a crab crawled out of it
Making it useless
And all my metaphors fell flat
Down on the rocks where we sat
She asked where are you at?

But sister, it's the opposite of hallelujah
It's the opposite of being you
You don't know cause it just passes right through you
You don't know what I'm going through
You don't know what I'm going through
You don't know what I'm going through
You don't know what I'm going through
We made our way home on the bikes we had borrowed
I still never told you about unstoppable sorrow
You still think I'm someone to look up to
I still don't know anything about you
Is it in you too?
You've got so much to live for, little sister
You've got so much to live for
