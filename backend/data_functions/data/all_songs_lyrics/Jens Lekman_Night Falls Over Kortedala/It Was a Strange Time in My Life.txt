It Was a Strange Time in My Life LyricsWhat have you done to my heart?
The Spanish girl pointed at me and said "silencio"
Making a little gesture as if switching off a radio
Sliding her fingers 'cross her lips as if shutting a zipper
I clearly got the message, I didn't need to ask her
Making the reverse zipper 'cross my lips, opening for conversation
Signaling the international sign of reckless contemplation
Shrugging her shoulders and lifting up the hand that rested on her thigh
Her middle finger extended until its simple message could not be denied
I turned 17 and I swore to never speak a word again
But then someone came along and ruined everything
It was a strange time in my life
People seem to think a shy personality equals gifted
But if they would get to know one I'm sure that idea would have shifted
Most shy people I know are extremely boring
Either that or they are miserable from all the shit they've been storing
I turned 17 and I swore to never speak a word again
But then someone came along and ruined everything
It was a strange time in my life
I had a good time at the party when everyone had left
I flirted with a girl in sign language 'cause she was deaf
It was a strange time in my life
It was a strange time in my life2Embed
