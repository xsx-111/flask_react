Into Eternity LyricsIf I had to choose a moment in time
To take with me into eternity
I would choose this
This moment with you in my arms
I know we've lost the final battle
I know we are prisoners
I can hear chains rattle
But I'm a prisoner of this moment with you in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
I have a love
I have a love for this world
A kind of love that will break my heart
A kind of love that reconstructs and remodels the past
That adds a dryness to the dry august grass
That adds the sunshine to the magnifying glass
And makes me fight for something that just can't last
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
If I had to choose a moment in time
To take with me into eternity
I'd choose this moment with you in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in my arms
You in myEmbed
