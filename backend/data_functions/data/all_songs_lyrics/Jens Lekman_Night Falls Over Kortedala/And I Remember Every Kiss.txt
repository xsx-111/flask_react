And I Remember Every Kiss Lyrics
There will be no kisses tonight
There will be no holding hands tonight
Cause what is now wasn't there before and should not be
I know I've broken some hearts, I understand
Some firecrackers blow up in your hand
Oh, I fucked up, I've always tried to be true

But I would never kiss anyone
Who doesn't burn me like the sun
And I remember every kiss like my first kiss
Like my first kiss

When I think back on that night, it was lovely
By the lake in your daddy's 240
But I would like to keep the memory of that kiss as it is
Things get more complicated when you're older
Before you know it, you are somebody's soldier
You get a gun and you name it after a girlfriend

But I swear I'll never kiss anyone
Who doesn't burn me like the sun
And I will cherish every kiss like my first kiss
Like my first kiss
Like my first kiss
Like my first kiss1Embed
