The Worst in You LyricsI stepped out the front door
Went out into the night
Took out a cigarette
Then I felt for my light
In my front pockets it was nowhere to be found
I went back in the door
Kicked off both of my shoes
Looked around for your coat
And then went looking for you
Thought that I heard your laughter stepping down the stairs
I walked carefully up
Til I was almost half way
I saw two closed doors
So I let my heart break
Are you running around or just running away?
Why do I always find the worst in you?
Do you always find the worst in me?
Or do I only find the worst in you?
So I stood still for a while
Trying to hear again
But then from the living room
I heard you calling my name
I found you smiling, asking me where I had been
Oh why do I always seek the worst in you?
Do you always seek the worst in me?
Do I only seek the worst in you?3Embed
