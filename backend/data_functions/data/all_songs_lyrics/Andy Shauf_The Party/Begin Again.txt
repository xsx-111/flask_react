Begin Again Lyrics
Begin again
This time you should take a bow at the very end
It’s quite an act you put on
Wait ’til the cameras roll
You’re the leading man
In a film where the end of the world
Is decided by you, whenever you choose

Oh from the sky a brilliant light will dissolve us all

Begin again
And tell me all about the one that you love
And all about the other one
That you’ve got on the side
I don’t give a damn
About you fooling around behind Sherry’s back
It’s just the one that you found
Is one that I need

Oh from the sky a brilliant light will dissolve us all
Listen to this half-wit
Spilling his guts after a bottle of wine
Thought this would be a good time
Now I can’t finish my drink
Let him laugh it off
"Hey, it’s a city the size of a dinner plate
It’s hard not to overlap
What could you expect?"

Oh from the sky a brilliant light will dissolve us all

Now I’m kicking leaves
Cursing the one that I love and the one I don’t
I wonder who you’re thinking ofEmbed
