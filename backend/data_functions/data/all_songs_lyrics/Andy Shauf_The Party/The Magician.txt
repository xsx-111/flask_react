The Magician Lyrics
Do you find
It gets a little easier each time you make it disappear?
Oh fools, the magician bends the rules
As the crowd watches his every move

Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Sidesteps to a death-defying feat
Wait for him to reappear
Look close, you’ll see him sweat the most
Each time his options disappear

Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
Just a shaking hand without a concrete plan
I’m a shaking hand without a plan
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo3Embed
