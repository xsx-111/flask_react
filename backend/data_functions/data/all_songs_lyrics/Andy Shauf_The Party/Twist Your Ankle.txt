Twist Your Ankle LyricsLast night, dancing slow in turning light
With you caught in my eye
Well twist your ankle, leave my side
Goodnight, I’m tossing in the towel again
Go laugh with all your friends
Oh I don’t really understand them
Everybody’s laughing at me
Just let me walk home
Oh god, stumble over to the door
Trashed and out of line
Oh I don’t think the fault is all mine
Last night, dancing slow in turning light
I watched you walk right by
Well twist my ankle, stay by your side
Everybody’s laughing at me
I can’t make a sound
Everybody’s laughing at me
I wish I’d just stayed homeEmbed
