Eyes of Them All Lyrics
Camera kisser fakes another smile
Bends my ear so I stay awhile
Oh I know this town can feel so small
I need to stretch my legs
Find some big mistakes
Find some big mistakes

Dream maker takes another sip
Starts a fire with her fingertips
Head to toe I’m falling into light

Oh it seems like truth
I could fall for you
I could fall for you

Oh you’ve got the eyes of them all
When you’re just dancing on your own
Oh you’ve got the eyes of them all
When you’re just dancing on your own

She’s talking circles
Start to feel her words
Float on past without being heard
I’m awash poured out into night
I’ll keep my eyes holding onto hers
Holding onto hers

Oh you’ve got the eyes of them all
When you’re just dancing on your own
Oh you’ve got the eyes of them all
When you’re just dancing on your own
Oh you’ve got the eyes of them all
When you’re just dancing on your own
Oh you’ve got the eyes of them all
When you’re just dancing on your own
Dancing on your own

I light another so that I can breathe
Deep in the cracks when she finally leavesEmbed
