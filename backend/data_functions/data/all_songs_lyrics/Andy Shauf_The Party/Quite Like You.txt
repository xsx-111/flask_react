Quite Like You LyricsJeremy's so stoned I'd be surprised if he saw the tears in Sherry's eyes
She's standing in the corner staring at the floor
I wonder what the hell he did this time
Normally I wouldn't care to be so bold
Tonight I think I'll ask her what is wrong
She seems a bit embarrassed and I understand
I say "I wish that you were having a good time."
She says "You know I've never really met someone like you."
"You know I've never really met someone like you."
I'm not one to speak up but I've had a few
So I start cutting Jeremy right in two
I said "I don't know what you see in him,"
"It seems to me all he ever does is bring you down."
I'm spilling my drink as I really start
Tearing one of my best friends apart
She's getting uneasy and my drunken speech ends as my hand finds its way to hers
I say "You know I've never really met someone like you."
"You know I've never really met someone like you."
Jeremy walks over and, to my surprise, Sherry puts her arm around his side2Embed
