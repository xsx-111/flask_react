To You LyricsJeremy can we talk a minute?
I've got some things that I need to
Get off of my chest
I know that we have had a few
And it's far too late
But if I wait I might never tell you
Can we find somewhere quiet?
Let's go outside
I've got some smokes if you've got a light
It's just that sometimes when I'm by your side
It feels so right
It feels like nothing could go wrong
Does it ever
Feel like that to you?
Does it ever
Feel like that to you?
Oh I don't know what I mean
It sounded wrong and I'm just tired
Not being weird
I just mean that you're a good friend
It's hard to explain
Just forget I said anything
Get over yourself
I'm not in love with you
It just came out all wrong
Yeah
Tell the guys and laugh it up
Why am I even surprised?
That it never
Feels like that to you
That it never
Feels like that to you
I guess it never
Feels like that to you
I guess it never
Feels like that to youEmbed
