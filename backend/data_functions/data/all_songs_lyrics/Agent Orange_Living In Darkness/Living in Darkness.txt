Living in Darkness LyricsLook at me now, I've got no reason to be
Like everybody else - so dumb, so happy
I like things that bite
Things that creep at night
Everybody's asking me
What's it like down there?
The concrete floor is cold
The walls are bare
I feel safest being alone
Living in darkness
Living in a world of my own
I'm so selfish
Doing everything by myself
I feel so cold
I'm gonna live
To be a couple thousand years old
Ashes to ashes - dust to dust
I thought I knew somebody
That I could trust
Now I'm not so sure
I feel safest being alone
Living in darkness
Living in a world of my own
One whole lifetime
I'm never gonna last
Unless I live until
Dying is a thing of the past
And all these girls I know
Out turning boys into men
I know I am never going down again
Never again
