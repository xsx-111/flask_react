The Last Goodbye Lyrics
Some day, somewhere, someone, somehow
Is going to make you understand
These words will drill into your head
You'll undergo the process then

You will do anything they say
They will have power over you
You will not question their authority
You know what they can do

I shake my head, I don't know what to say
I see my chance to turn and walk away
I will not be a part of this romance
I just can't take a chance
Because I see my opportunity to shout
The last goodbye
The last goodbye

I bet you never did expect
To have a big important name
They all will have exquisite taste
But everyone will look the same
You will be quickly photographed
You will be shot from every side
They'll teach you what you need to learn
And they will take you for a ride!

I shake my head, I don't know what to say
I see my chance to turn and walk away
I will not be a part of this romance
I just can't take a chance
Because I see my opportunity to shout
The last goodbye
The last goodbye

The last goodbye
The last goodbye!Embed
