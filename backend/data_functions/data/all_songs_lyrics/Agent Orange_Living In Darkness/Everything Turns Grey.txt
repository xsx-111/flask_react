Everything Turns Grey LyricsThings don't seem to be as easy
As they used to be
And it's getting harder every day
To think of better things to say
About whats going on around you
And what's happening inside you
When it's time to change you won't know how
It won't matter years from now
No matter what you think
Or do, or say
Everything turns grey
This is it the darkest hour
Isn't it depressing how our
Minds create an atmosphere
That won't happen here
Unless we make some new demands
To grasp the future in our hands
You know I wish I could
But it's too late
For senseless minds who love to hate
No matter what they think
Or do, or say
Everything turns grey
No matter what they think
Or do, or say
Everything turns greyEmbed
