Neverland LyricsWhen the darkness takes me over
Face down, emptier than zero
Invisible you come to me
..quietly
Stay beside me
Whisper to me "Here I am"
And the loneliness fades
Some people think I'm something
Well you gave me that, I know
I always feel like nothing
When I'm in the dark alone
You provided the soul, the spark that
Drives me on
Makes me something more than
Flesh and bone
At times like these
Any fool can see
Any fool can see
Your love inside me
All these years
Truth in front of my eyes
While I denied
What my heart knows was right
At times like these
Any fool can see
Any fool can see
Your love inside me
I want to be someone
I want to be someone
I want to be someone
Who someone would want to be
Someone would want to be
Wendy
Darling
In the kitchen
With your dreams
Will you fly
Again
Take to the sky
Again
Undo the hooks
Once and for all
Banish the tic tic tic tok tok tok
Again
Will you be
Yourself for me
Cause I can take it
I can stand
Anything
When you're with me
I can stand it
I can stand
But when you're gone
I never land
In Neverland
Want to be someone someone
Would want to be
Someone someone would want to be
Someone someone would want to be
Someone someone someone someone
Any fool
Any fool can see
Any fool can see
Your love
Inside meEmbed
