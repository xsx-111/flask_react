Tenderness Lyrics
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less

Love me with a tender touch
Kindness, I need very much
It is so hard for me to trust
But deep inside I know I must

Love me all through the night
Hug me 'til the first rays of sunlight
Be sweet, make me unafraid
'Cause tonight, I'll play with you
Please be gentle

Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less

Love me
Try to be understanding
Tenderness is all that I'm asking
Don't feel like I'm making conditions
I wanna to overcome my inhibitions
Love me all through the night
Hug me 'til the first rays of sunlight
Be sweet, make me unafraid
'Cause tonight, I'll play with you
Please be gentle

Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less

Love me with a tender touch
Kindness, I need very much
It is so hard for me to trust
But deep inside I know I must

Love me all through the night
Hug me 'til the first rays of sunlight
Be sweet, make me unafraid
'Cause tonight, I'll play with you
Please be gentle
Love me
Kindness
Love me
Hug me
Please be gentle

Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, I confess
Tenderness is the best
Tenderness, nothin' less

Try to be understanding
Try to be understanding2Embed
