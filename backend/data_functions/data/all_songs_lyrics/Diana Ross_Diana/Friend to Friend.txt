Friend to Friend Lyrics
When I gave all of my love to you
I said you were a dream come true
Good to you
So good to you is what I'm gonna be
And I hope you fall in love with me

Persevere is what we'll do
What we'll do to make our love everlasting

Oh, friend
I owe all of my life to you
I said you were a dream come true
I don't want
No, I don't want to be so cold to you
It's just a defense that I sometimes use

I have often thought
That I had no love to give
But it's yours for the asking, oh

I have often thought
I had no love to give
It's yours, yours for the asking

Oh, friend
I give my life to you
I say you are a dream come true
Oh, friend, oh, friend
I give my life to you
I say you are, you are a dream come true
