Stone Monkey LyricsPut on your cloud stepping shoes and dance
Shake off the lonely bad blues, take a chance
Seek out and find a green jade pool, hide behind the moon
Don't let the judges sing your name
Remember from where you came
He rolls and tumbles and he laughs, when he speaks
And heaven's sweet wine brings a blush to his cheeks
Who showed him the way to live forever, longer than anyone
For he stole the petals from the dying sun
Fresh when the day was done
Now over the seas or the mountains, he calls
There must be a way I can stay, Lord immortal
Wanna go to heaven on my flying trapeze
Eat all the fruit I please
Wanna drink my fill of that heavenly wine
Till the judges call my time
Stone monkey gather your family round
And follow the sun on downEmbed
