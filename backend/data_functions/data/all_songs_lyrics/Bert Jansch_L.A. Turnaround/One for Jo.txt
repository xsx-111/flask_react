One for Jo LyricsIt's one for Jo
Don't let your man go
He's a dreamer darling
He's even kind'a slow
I don't believe the tales he tells
But they're always nice to hear
He's a dreamer darling
Always keep him near
In a white tuxedo
He's remarkably cool
A prince of living
Who knows all the rules
In a black sedan so royally
He takes his love to school
And no-one can reproach him
No-one but a fool
He's a bold sea captain
In his boots and oilskin hat
Struggling blindly
Through seas wild and black
Down the river he glides
With his baby by his side
And when you think of that gal
How can your love hide
It's one for Jo
Don't let your man go
He's a dreamer darling
He's even kind'a slow
I don't believe the tales he tells
But they're always nice to hear
He's a dreamer darling
Always keep him nearEmbed
