There Comes A Time LyricsThere comes a time, babe
When we've gotta go
Our time has been
Great up till now
But we've gotta go love
Hit the road
And start another show
One too many mornings
We've been lazing
And one too many
Nights of foolin' round, babe
Not caring and not knowing
How we're faring
We're living side by side, babe
Not knowing where we are bound
Or where on earth love we are going
And our seed of love still growing
Comes the spring next year, love
We could be laughing
We could be riding high
And free with the sun
Upon our backs
Could be singing
And with the birds a winging
Let us pack our things
And leave tonight, babe
Keep going till the road runs out
And comes to an end, babe
And hope that life turns out rightEmbed
