Cluck Old Hen LyricsMy old hen, she's a good ol' hen
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Sometimes eight and sometimes ten
That's enough for the railroad men
Cluck ol' hen, cluck, when I tell you
Cluck ol' hen or I'm gonna sell you
Last time she cackled, she cackled in the lot
Next time she cackles, cackles in the pot
My old hen, she's a good ol' hen
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Sometimes one and sometimes two
Sometimes enough for the whole damn crew
Cluck ol' hen, cluck and sing
You ain't laid an egg since late last spring
Cluck ol' hen, cluck and call
You ain't laid an egg since late last fallEmbed
