Open Up the Watergate (Let the Sunshine In) LyricsWell, I thought my love
My love was true now
Well, I've been jilted
What can I do now, with my blues
Oh, don't crowd me, I've got a right to be free
Open up the watergate, let the sunshine in
Got my Saturday night special
And I'm going downtown
I'm gonna have me a good time
Find me a sweet love I can call mine
Oh, don't crowd me, I've got a right to be free
Open up the watergate, let the sunshine in
Jump down, turn around
Spin your love around
Happiness can be found
Pick your feet up and stroll around
Oh, don't crowd me, I've got a right to be free
Open up the Watergate and let the sunshine inEmbed
