The Blacksmith LyricsOut walking in the country
Met a bold jolly blacksmith
He was shoeing a lively mare
And he was singing a strange air
One for the master
One for the owner
But none for the poor boy
A-doing the best he can
Out walking in the country
Met a bold jolly blacksmith
He was shoeing a lively mare
He was singing a strange air
It's one for the master
And One for the owner
And none for the poor boy
Who's a-doing the best he canEmbed
