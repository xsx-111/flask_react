Mad as Rabbits Lyrics
Come save me from walking off a window sill
Or I'll sleep in the rain
Don't you remember when I was a bird
And you were a map?
And now he drags down miles in America
Briefcase in hand
The stove is creeping up his spine again
Can't get enough trash

He took the days for pageant, and became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits, who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?
(Come on)

His arms were the branches of a Christmas tree
Preached the devil in the belfry
He checked in to learn his clothes had been thieved
At the train station
The rope hung his other branch and at the end
Was a dog called Bambi
Who was chewing on his parliaments
When he tried to save the calendar business
He tried to save the calendar business
He took the days for pageant, and became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits, who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?

The poor son of a humble chimney sweep
Fell to a cheap crowd
So stay asleep and put on that cursive type
You know we live in a toy
You know that Paul Cates bought himself a trumpet
From the Salvation Army
But there ain't no sunshine in his song
We must reinvent love, reinvent love, reinvent love

He took the days for pageant, and became as mad as rabbits
With bushels of bad habits, who could ask for anymore?
Yeah, who could have more?
We must reinvent love, reinvent love, reinvent love14Embed
