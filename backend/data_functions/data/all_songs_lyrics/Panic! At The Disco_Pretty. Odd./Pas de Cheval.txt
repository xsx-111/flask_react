Pas de Cheval Lyrics
Oh, little did she know
Couldn't let me go, already a part of her
So often do I meet people in between
That just can't get a hold of it

So we'll just sing it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just sing it for them
(Just can't get a hold of it)
So we'll just sing it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just sing it

It's the greatest thing that's yet to have happened
Imagine knowing me
It's the greatest thing you'd ever imagine
But you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there

Slow, leave walking to the world
Give your feet a chance, they'll do all the thinking
Toast high until they find less pathetic wine
Until they get a better blend
Then we'll just drink it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just drink it for them
('Til they get a better blend)
So we'll just drink it for them (Ahhh)
Yeah, we'll just drink it

It's the greatest thing that's yet to have happened
Imagine knowing me
It's the greatest thing you'd ever imagine
But you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there


It's the greatest thing that's yet to have happened
Imagine knowing me
It's the greatest thing you'd ever imagine
But you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there
No, you'll never know until you're there5Embed
