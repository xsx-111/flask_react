When the Day Met the Night Lyrics
When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

When the sun found the moon
She was drinking tea in a garden
Under the green umbrella trees
In the middle of summer
When the moon found the sun
He looked like he was barely hanging on
But her eyes saved his life
In the middle of summer

In the middle of summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
(Summer, summer, summer, summer)
Golden when the day met the night

So he said, "Would it be alright
If we just sat and talked for a little while
If in exchange for your time
I give you this smile?"
So she said, "That's okay
As long as you can make a promise
Not to break my little heart
Or leave me all alone, in the summer"
Well, he was just hanging around, then he fell in love
And he didn't know how, but he couldn't get out
Just hanging around, then he fell in love

In the middle of summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
Summer, all was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night
(Summer, summer, summer, summer)

When the moon fell in love with the sun
All was golden in the sky
All was golden when the day met the night

(Summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of summer, summer, summer, summer)
(The middle of...)31Embed
