Northern Downpour Lyrics
If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea
For diamonds do appear to be
Just like broken glass to me
And then she said she can't believe
Genius only comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

The ink is running toward the page, it's chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don't you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Sugarcane in the easy morning (Hey moon, hey moon...)
Weathervanes my one and lonely (Hey moon, hey moon...)

Sugarcane in the easy morning
(Hey moon, please forget to fall down)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Hey moon, don't you go down)
Sugarcane in the easy morning
(You are at the top of my lungs)
Weathervanes my one and lonely
(Drawn to the ones who never yawn)
(Sugarcane in the easy morning)
Hey moon, please forget to fall down
(Weathervanes my one and lonely)
Hey moon, don't you go down
You are at the top of my lungs
Drawn to the ones who never yawn61Embed
