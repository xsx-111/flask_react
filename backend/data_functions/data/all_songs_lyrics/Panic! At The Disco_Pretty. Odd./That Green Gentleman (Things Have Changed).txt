That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed) Lyrics
Things are shaping up to be pretty odd
Little deaths in musical beds
So it seems I'm someone I've never met
You will only hear these elegant crimes
Fall on your ears from criminal dimes
They spill unfound from a pretty mouth

And everybody gets there, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I’m the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay

I want to go where everyone goes
I want to know what everyone knows
I want to go where everyone feels the same
I never said I'd leave the city
I never said I'd leave this town
A falling out we won't tiptoe about
Well, everybody gets there, everybody gets their
And everybody gets their way
I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her
Now I’m the only one to blame

Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, I'm on my way and I say
Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I feel the same, and I say

Things have changed for me (Well, things have changed for me)
And that's okay (Come on, everybody, let's dance and sing)
I feel the same (I'm singing it all night long)
And I say (Come on, everybody, yeah, join along, I'm singing)
Things have changed for me (Well, things have changed for me)
And that's okay (Come on, everyone, let's dance and sing)
I feel the same (I'm singing it all night long)
And I say (Come on, everybody, yeah, sing along)
Things have changed for me, and that's okay
I'm on my way and I say

Things have changed for me14Embed
