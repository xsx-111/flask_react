I Have Friends in Holy Spaces Lyrics
You remind me of a former love
That I once knew
And you carry a little piece with you
We were holding hands walking through
The middle of the street, it's fine with me
I'm just taking in the scenery

You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends

Take a chance, take your shoes off, dance in the rain
Yeah, we're splashing around
And the news spread all over town
I'm not complaining that it's raining
I'm just saying that I'd like it a lot more than you'd think
If the sun would come out and sing with me

You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
You remind me of a few of my famous friends
Well, that all depends what you qualify as friends
Hey moon!
Hey moon! Hey moon, hey moon
Hey moon! Hey moon, hey moon
Hey moon! Hey moon, hey moon15Embed
