Good House LyricsBy my hands or with fire
I’ll be cleaning black temples that I’d built in defense
My polishing shines
I find, I find, I find
Spent my time fearing age
And retreating from answers to the questions I’d asked
In each passing stage
Poked myself blind
I lost time
Oh, I lost minds
You might find that there’s eyes
You might find only your eyes
Well, retrain them to send
At first just pretend
But later for searching much further
Each trial leaves you open
Decide you’re light
Cause brother it’s time
You’ll always find life
Hold on, keep up
I’ll show you inside
In this good house for it’s light
I spend all my time
Here taste, good bread
I bake for my mind
Inside I fold
My well lived advice
It says when you feel tired
There’s more left inside
Slow down, breathe deep
If you cry in mourning revive
Lay down, be quiet
Is this how we pray?
My hands can show us the way
But feel how they shake
Too bright, but then too dim
You always find reasons you’re frightened
So frightened that you won’t go in
And reason may fight you, so even then
Don’t wait, feel shy
Come sit at your place
Cause you can
Your body rewired, you may feel strange
Breathe in without
Breathe out, you’re alright
Breathe in with all
Breathing out all that shame
No cowering fright
Keep building up waves
Replenish in flight
So I breathe my way down
And I breathe my way deeper
When I’ve grown I ascend
At sea, see my hands
They’re stretching much further and stronger
They’re holding my life to the fire
No tries
Fire builds fire
Shiva, come home
I’m ready to play
When we dance, great heights are required
I won't feel ashamed
Divine and spun right round
The center unwinds, you’re unfolding
Divine and spinning round
Your pleasure is binding
And held in trance
As I spin, I grow
Embracing decay
With each turn, delight comes alive
Loss slipping away
Breathe in without
Breathe out, you’re alright
Breathe in with all
Spit out all that rage
You're safe now, don’t fight
Your body’s engaged
Just flow and get right
Like following angels
You're following angelsEmbed
