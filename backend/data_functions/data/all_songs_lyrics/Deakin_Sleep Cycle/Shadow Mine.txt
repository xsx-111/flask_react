Shadow Mine LyricsI wanna rise up
I wanna rise up
I wanna rise up right now
Even though I know I'm not much
Then when I get lonely, I
Then when I get lonely, I
Then when I get lonely
I'm not even a shadow, but
When I get lonely, I'm
When I get lonely, I'm not
When I get lonely
I'm not even a shadow, but
I'm only a man
I'm only a man
I'm only a man
Who's only what I thought I'd be
Only a shadow of a man
Then why is it always like this?
Then why can I come home
Only when I made it mine?
I'm only wide open
I'm only wide open
I'm only wide open
And I never would've held a diamondEmbed
