Seed Song LyricsWhen you're open
There is something happening
You and I both can
Grow together
Seeds in our hands
We can always grow together
Seeds can get old and tired from the opening
With our hands
Then when I handle water
The plants get old, they're always there
Leave seeds out there
You can always leave seeds out there
Leaving all
Grab justice where you are
You can always leave seeds
And when you're open out here
You can always growEmbed
