Golden Chords Lyrics
Days fog
Can’t see past the edge of what’s gone but I’m hoping I’ll try
And the rain shines
And the showers and the fawns in the field arrange in my eyes
So why fight?
With nature’s call around
You talk about frights
In the verse of every song

You tell me what’s wrong
But what’s right?
You’re seeing creation
That crushing never ending change is so full of love

And so you’re waking to face the change in your role
And with each restless shiver you wretch from your soul
You’re asking
"Is that something I’m not anymore?"
A brother to shake these broken chords till they turn gold

And I tried
To survive without that gold
And wondering why
Our exchange can never hold
Am I what’s wrong?
Well what’s right?
Stop trusting in demons
You’re scattered ever lonely buddy, but so full of love

Please stop repeating your terror you choose what you see
It’s always “What if?” and “Why not?”
Man, you gotta just be
Simplify, define your goals and watch them grow
Be your own true self; the you that I know

Days gone
As I peer past the edge of what’s lost, I’m starting to cry
But the rain’s fine
And the tears feel warm and my body is humming alive
In time
You’ll revive what you thought dead
You’ve stopped your own climb
On the verge of every end

You tell me what’s wrong
But what’s right?
Stop believing your being’s been shattered and distorted cause, brother, you're so full of love
And so you’re hoping to make a change in your role
Repeating mantras to find some ground for your soul
Stop asking
Is that something I’m not anymore?
A brother to shake these broken chords till they turn goldEmbed
