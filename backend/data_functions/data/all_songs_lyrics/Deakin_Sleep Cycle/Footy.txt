Footy LyricsAll my life I have travelled in needs
Now I’ve found what I crave
You’ve got to be brave
Brave, brave
I know it’s hard when you feel I’m sleeping
Friend in rain, I’m awake
Let’s shake, we’ll shake
You've got to
And whether you would or you won’t
Isn’t traced across every word
The place and the smell will
Instantly place your evident crime
Rotten, replaced, regrown, and renamed
A bottomless game
And if you’re unsure, just look in his face
You’ll see he’s alright
Ooh, he’s fine
The same as all man
Ooh, in time
I’ll have to ask him
What's here
I just want to see you happy
Man, I know that you try
Your high, always fine
You’ve got to get
And when you’re awake your eyes shine bright
You’re so fine
My pride lifts me up into places so right
And I know on my mark
We’ll trespass again and again, it’s all mine
And I’m all fine
I’ll always tear up when I see how you shine
In your unwary nights
Ooh, you’re fine
I'm rolling over
Ooh, this time, what
No run for cover
He’s shaking us1Embed
