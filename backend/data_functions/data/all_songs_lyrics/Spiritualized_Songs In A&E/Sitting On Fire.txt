Sitting On Fire Lyrics
Baby I'm sitting on fire
There's an old flame still burns in my heart
When we're together a fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

Baby you know that I love you
But the memory still haunts at my door
When we're together we stand so tall
But the part of me still falls to the floor

Set me free
I do believe
It'll burn up in me
For the rest of my life

Baby I'm sitting on fire
But the flames put a hole in my heart
When we're together a fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

It's so hard to fight when you're losing
I got a little tear in my soul
In my own time I've been losing fast
And I can't even hold what I own
Set me free
I do believe
It'll burn up in me
For the rest of my lifeEmbed
