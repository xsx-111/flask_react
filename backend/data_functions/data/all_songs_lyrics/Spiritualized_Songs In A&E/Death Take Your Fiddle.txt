Death Take Your Fiddle Lyrics
I think I'll drink myself into a coma
And I'll take every way out I can find
But morphine, codeine, whisky, they won't alter
The way I feel the way now death is not around

So death take your fiddle
And play a song for me
Play a song we used to sing
The one that brought you close to me
Play a song and I will sing along

I think I'd like to take myself to heaven
Because I ain't been there many times before
And Jesus Christ, I don't know about lightning
Because I've been struck a thousand times and more

So death take your fiddle
And play a song for me
Play a song we used to sing
The one that brought you close to me
Play a song and I will sing along
Think I'll drink myself into a coma
And I'll take every pill that I can find
But morphine, codeine, whisky, they won't alter
The way I feel now death is not around
The way I feel now death is not around
The way I feel now death is not aroundEmbed
