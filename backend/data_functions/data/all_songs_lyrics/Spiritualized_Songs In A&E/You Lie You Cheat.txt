You Lie You Cheat Lyrics
You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down you'll see
You've made too many enemies

You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down you'll see
You gotta lift yourself, lift your soul, baby, then you're free

There ain't nothing I can do
You've got your parents' attitude
There ain't nothing more to say
Gonna cut you deep and make it quick

You lie, you cheat, you take it all
I cross my heart, I watch you fall
When they cut you down you'll see
You gotta lift yourself, lift your soul, baby, then you're free

Ain't no better wayEmbed
