Sweet Talk Lyrics
Well, you sweet talk like an angel
But you’re driving this blind
But don’t you sweet talk like an angel tonight?

Well, you sweet talk like an angel
With a heart full of lies
But don’t you sweet talk like an angel tonight?

And you talk like your mother and your father
But you just close your eyes
You don’t care who you’re messing around
This time

I can’t take care of my baby
I can’t take care of mine
Because no God given war in this world’s
About life…

And you say “Where do you stand on the war?”
Well you stand right where you stood before
As far from the bullets and bombs
As they fall
And you stand there and fight for it all
But you don’t own a gun
And when the shells start to fall all around
You don’t have to run

And you sweet talk like an angel
But you’re driving this blind
Don’t you sweet talk like an angel tonight
But don’t you sweet talk like an angel tonight?Embed
