Soul on Fire Lyrics
You were born on a black day
Shot through with starlight
And all the angels singing
Just about got it right

Cut through with silver
And goodness did heaven know
I don't know where we're going
But darling bless your soul

Baby, set my soul on fire
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher
Baby, never should say never
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever

Sweetheart, it may not be easy
But we're trying hard to hold on
Trying to make it better

Sweetheart, you get so much freedom
But freedom is just another word
When you've no one left to hurt
And I said

I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to stay forever
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay foreverEmbed
