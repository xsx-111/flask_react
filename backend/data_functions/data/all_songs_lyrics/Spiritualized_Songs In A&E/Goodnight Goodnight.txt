Goodnight Goodnight Lyrics
Goodnight goodnight, you’re coming down
But it’s all right
And don’t look down
There’s better things for you and I

I’ll hold you close, you’ll be all right
Until morning comes, I’ll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you’re coming down
Sweetheart

Goodnight goodnight, till morning light
You’ll be okay
And don’t look down
There’s better things another day

I’ll hold you close, you’ll be all right
Until morning comes, I’ll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you’re coming down
Sweetheart

Goodnight goodnight, you’re coming down
Well bless your soul
And don’t look down
There’s better things that you will know
I’ll hold you close, you’ll be all right
Until morning comes, I’ll hold you tight
Goodnight goodnight, you’re coming down
Sweetheart
