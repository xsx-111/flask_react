I Gotta Fire Lyrics
Gotta fire inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Gotta fight to call my own
Freedom's mine to hold

Gotta fire and bide my time
Praise the Lord and I'll find out
Holding on with all my might
Freedom's one more fight

3000 miles from home
Gotta a gun to call my own
Ain't no religion here
Gotta fire, Lord I got a fire now

Gotta letter from my home
Didn't know my mind was wrong
Gotta get the feelin' back
Gotta fire, Lord got a fire now

Gotta light inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Gotta cause to call my own
Gotta fire, Lord got a fire now
Freedom's lost its sense
Ain't got no love in here
Gotta job that's in my sights
Gotta fire Lord I got a fire now

Sometimes you know it ain't right
Get  to get it right
Ain't no religion here
Gotta fire Lord I got a fire now

Gotta fire inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Ain't no religon here
Gotta fire Lord i got a fireEmbed
