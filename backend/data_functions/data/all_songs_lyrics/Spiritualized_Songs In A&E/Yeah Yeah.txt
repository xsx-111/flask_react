Yeah Yeah Lyrics
Hey babe, gonna make you mine
Been mine since the day I arrived
Ain't gonna let it go that way
Gonna make you mine and make my day

Yeah yeah, gonna take it all
Have faith and yet to fall
Gonna gather mine right by my side

Gotta lay it on, alone we die
What a waste of precious time
I swear my mind ain't round oh yeah
I wanna know how long we're here

I don't know but I'll make a guess
About a life away from death
I ain't so over qualified
I'm out of here a long time

Yeah yeah, get it on
Yeah yeah, get it on
It's so undignified
I'm out of here a long timeEmbed
