The Waves Crash In LyricsThe waves crash in and the waves crash out
The wind blows the air and my thoughts fly about
And I know I would call you
If ever I could
But the wind takes its toll
On the salt in my blood
And I know I would die
If I ever should leave you alone
The moon comes up and the stars above
The tide holds its sway on the ache in my blood
And could I have loved you
A little bit more
But I know that I tried
Like I never before
And I know I would die
If I ever should leave you alone
Don't let me stop you
You gotta find out

Lately I've been holding back my thoughts
Trying to keep them down to one or two
Lately I've been holding back my tears
Just to stop them all from pouring through
I know you think I'm staggering
But lately I've been staggering
Lately I've been holding back my fears
Just to stop it all from coming true
I know you think I'm staggering
But lately I've been staggering back homeEmbed
