Peggy-O Lyrics
As we marched down to Fennario
As we marched down to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And they called her name pretty Peggy-O

Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come a runnin' down the stairs
Combin' back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest little girl I have ever seen-o

In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-O
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-O
In a carriage you will ride
With your true love by your side
As fair as any maiden in the area-o

What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-O?
What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-O?
What will your mother say
When she finds you've gone away
To places far and strange to Fennario?
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return
All your cities I will burn
Destroying all the ladies in the area-o
Destroying all the ladies in the area-oEmbed
