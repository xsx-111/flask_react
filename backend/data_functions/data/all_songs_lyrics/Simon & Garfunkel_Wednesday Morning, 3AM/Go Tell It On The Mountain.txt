Go Tell It On The Mountain Lyrics
Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Down in the lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watch
O'er silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shown a holy light
Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born

Down in the lonely manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Hallelujah!
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go tell it on the mountain
Jesus Christ is born
Jesus Christ is bornEmbed
