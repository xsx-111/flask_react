The Drapery Falls Lyrics
Please remedy my confusion
And thrust me back to the day
The silence of your seclusion
Brings night into all you say

Pull me down again
And guide me into pain

I'm counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again
And guide me into...

There is failure inside
This test I can't persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criteria is demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder
Puzzled by shrewd innocence runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves, nails bleeding from the struggle
It is the end for the weak at heart, always the same
A lullaby for the ones who've lost all reeling inside
My gleaming eye in your necklace reflects stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away, never again

Spiraling to the ground below like Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away
Waking up to your sound again and lapse into the ways of misery3Embed
