Magpie LyricsFeed the kittens in the kitchen
Set food out for the strays
Try hard to do your best
The magpie will have his way
Fill your mouth with berries
By the full light of the moon
Work all night if you have to
The magpie comes at noon
Shore up the crucifixes
Above the archways and the doors
The magpie will come at midday
And you will go down on all fours
And when the cherry's ripe with blossoms
Be ready and be brave
And remember what we had here
When there was something left to saveEmbed
