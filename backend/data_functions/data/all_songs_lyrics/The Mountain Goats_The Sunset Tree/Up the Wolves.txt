Up the Wolves Lyrics
There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
That you're going to find really difficult to forgive
There's gonna come a day when you feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch
Lighter than the air
Just when that day is coming, who can say? Who can say?

Our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party when the wolf comes home

We're going to commandeer the local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's been going on
And they will shake their heads and wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions
And by daybreak we'll be gone
I'm going to get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
I'm gonna bribe the officials
I'm gonna kill all the judges
It's going to take you people years to recover from all of the damage
Our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome
But there's going to be a party when the wolf comes home11Embed
