Hast Thou Considered the Tetrapod LyricsYou are sleeping off your demons
When I come home
Spittle bubbling on your lips
Fine white foam
I am young, and I am good
It's a hot southern California day
If I wake you up, there will be hell to pay
And alone in my room
I am the last of a lost civilization
And I vanish into the dark
And rise above my station
Rise above my station
But I do wake you up, and when I do
You blaze down the hall and you scream
I'm in my room with the headphones on
Deep in the dream chamber
And then I'm awake and I'm guarding my face
Hoping you don't break my stereo
Because it's the one thing that I couldn't live without
And so I think about that and then I sorta black out
Held under these smothering waves
By your strong and thick-veined hand
But one of these days I'm going to wriggle up on dry land3Embed
