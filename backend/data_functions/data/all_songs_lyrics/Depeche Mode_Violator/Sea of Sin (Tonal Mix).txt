Sea of Sin (Tonal Mix) Lyrics
Sea of Sin
I'm swimming in
And I'm taking a dive
My mind's in need
So my body feeds
And it keeps me alive

It gets better and better
As it gets wetter and wetter

Sea of Sin
Know where you've been
But I don't care


Sea of Sin
Through thick and thin
For better or worse
My mind's in need
So my body feeds
And it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper
As we sink deeper and deeper

Sea of Sin
Know where you've been
'Cause I've been there

Here, under God's sky
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize

Sea of Sin
My second skin
My home from home
When I'm in doubt
My hands reach out
And I'm never alone

It gets wetter and wetter
As it gets better and better
Sea of Sin
Know where you've been
And I'm prepared
Sea of Sin
Know where you've been
Yes I'm aware
Sea of Sin
Know where you've been
'Cause I've been there
Sea of Sin
Know where you've been
And I don't care
Sea of Sin
Know where you've been
And I don't care2Embed
