Dangerous Lyrics
The things you do aren't good for my health
The moves you make you make for yourself
The means you use aren't meant to confuse
Although they do, they're the ones that I would choose

And I wouldn't want it any other way
You wouldn't let me anyway

Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm

The lies you tell aren't meant to deceive
They're not there for me to believe
I've heard your vicious words
You know by now it takes a lot to see me hurt
And I couldn't take it any other way
But there's a price I have to pay

Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm


Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous

Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for
Dangerous
When I am in your arms
Dangerous
Know I will come to harm
Dangerous
The way you leave me wanting more
Dangerous
That's what I want you for...2Embed
