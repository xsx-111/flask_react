Nobody LyricsStill I feel the pain from that day
When you stepped in to take my dreams away
The stage was set for what would be my night
But you called time and threw my fight
Still I'm yearning
To claim back what's mine
Still I'm clinging
To dreams that won't die
Still I'm dreaming
Of one more chance
But you still tell me
My time has passed
Give me back my right
To prove that I can fight
Let me show them all
Tonight can be my night
Still you think that it's okay
For you to state the rules of play
But if you could know the length to which I've come
To reclaim my pride and break down your world
Still I'm yearning
To claim back what's mine
Still I'm clinging
To dreams that won't die
Still I'm dreaming
Of one more chance
One more chance
But you still tell me
My time has passed
Give me back my right
To prove that I can fight
Let me show them all
Tonight will be my nightEmbed
