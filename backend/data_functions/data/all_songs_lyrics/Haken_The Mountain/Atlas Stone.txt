Atlas Stone LyricsHearts will burn come what may
With lessons learned along the way
To free myself I make a choice
Just to be heard I lose my voice
Finding strength in solitude
I fight to fly with much to prove
Is this the way it's meant to be?
I risk it all I will not fall

Carry the weight of the world
On my shoulders
Rise to the challenge I set myself

Salvation waits without reprieve
I'm on a razor's edge and it cuts my feet
As good as life will ever get
I wish that I could give it up and go home
"The blood drawn from the Atlas Stone
It draws a path from hell to home"
Fight to survive
Succumb to the path
Conquer the fear and nothing will fail
The quest to define this struggle of mine
Gravity defied
I climb beyond heights
Carry the weight of the world
On my shoulders
Rise to the challenge I set myself

Shadows of doubt creep into the light
A glimmer of hope never out of sight
Out of sight
Paralyzed under suppressive fire
Holding firm against a thin red line
Out of mind
Shadows of doubt creep into the light
A glimmer of hope never out of sight
Out of sight
Paralyzed under suppressive fire
Holding firm against a thin red line
Out of mind
Carry the weight of the world
Rise to the challenge I set myself

Carry the weight of the world
On my shoulders
Rise to the challenge I set myself1Embed
