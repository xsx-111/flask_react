In Memoriam Lyrics
Take a step, put one foot in the grave
Catch a breath, submerged in holy water
Watch a moving scene of former days
Shed a tear as memory starts to falter
Familiar faces try to hide the pain
Medicate to alleviate the pressure
Make amends with the ones I used to hate
Feel the agony give way to pleasure

Tearing down the walls of eternity
All in my loving memory

Final scene humility

I succumb to universal law
Another system's energy disperses
Mother nature red in tooth and claw
It's the game that everybody loses
Show your cards and accept what you've been dealt
Guardian or harbinger of sorrow?
Pour a drink, raise a glass and toast to health
Is the truth too hard for us to swallow?
Tearing down the walls of eternity
All in my loving memory

Master of creation
Lead us from temptation
Father of invention
Please guide my ascension
So much left unspoken
Life leaving heartbroken
A sense of acceptance
One final repentance

Read these words upon my stone
In piam memoriam
(
Medicate to alleviate the pain
Make amends to the ones I used to hate
Take a step put one foot in the grave)

Tearing down the walls of eternity
(Read these words upon my stone)
(
Medicate to alleviate the pain)
All in my loving memory
(In piam memoriam)
(Make amends to the ones I used to hate
Take a step put one foot in the grave)Embed
