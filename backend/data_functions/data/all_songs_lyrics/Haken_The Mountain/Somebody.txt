Somebody Lyrics
Still I feel the pain from that day
When you stepped in to take my dreams away
The stage was set for what would be my night
But you called time and threw my fight

Still I'm yearning to claim back what's mine
Still I'm clinging to dreams that won't die
Still I'm dreaming of one more chance
But you still tell me my time has passed

Give me back my right to prove that I can fight
Let me show them all; tonight can be my night

Still you think that it's okay
For you to state the rules of play
But if you could know the length to which I crawl
To reclaim my pride and break down your walls
(You'll never know the lengths to which I will crawl
'Cause tonight is my night, you will not tear down my wall)
{x2}
Still I'm yearning to claim back what's mine
Still I'm clinging to dreams that won't die
Still I'm dreaming of one more chance, one more chance
But you still tell me my time has passed

Give me back my right to prove that I can fight
Let me show them all; tonight will be my night

I wish I could have been somebody
{repeated}
Just as a bird was meant to fly
Unbind these wings or let me die

Give me back my right to prove that I can fight
Let me show them all; tonight, this is my night
