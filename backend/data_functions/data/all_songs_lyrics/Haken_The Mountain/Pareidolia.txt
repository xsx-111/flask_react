Pareidolia Lyrics
All my kingdom's gone, it's burning to the ground
Reason leaves me
As future sits upon a solitary throne
A treasure is sinking

Seems now long gone
The desert takes away our fears and dreams but they
Always will return

Be the moon and sun, be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm, read the writings in the stone
Be the moon and be the sun, be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm, read the writings in the stone

Seeking patterns, envisaging pictures of a dying dream
Fallen prison, the facade of wisdom in old scars

Be the moon and sun, be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm, read the writings in the stone
Be the moon and be the sun, be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm, read the writings in the stone

Breathe in the air (Breathe deeper)
Don't lose the stare (Keep sinking)
The old spirit dwells (Perceiving)
Speaking within (Conceiving)
Show me the way (Old spirits)
Uncertainty (Deceiving)
Feelings arise (Believing)
Take what is mine (Retrieving)
{x2}

As I've been forsaken
My veins feel unshaken
In the skies a secret lies
(The Universe is all around us kept in motion)
(Alleviate our pain and fear, test our devotion)
Well disguised before my eyes
(The Universe is all around us kept in motion)
(Alleviate our pain and fear, test our devotion)
{x3}

Breathe in the pain (Keep breathing)
Won't break these chains (Keep digging)
For what you've foreseen (Believing)
Was only a dream (Deceiving)
Give me what's yours (Retrieving)
You've dug your own tomb (Keep digging)
Your kingdom is gone (Keep grieving)
It's burned to the ground (Defeated)
All my fears have drowned
All my fears have drowned

Seems now long gone
The ocean took away my fears and dreams but they
Never returned

Be the moon and sun, be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm, read the writings in the stone
Be the moon and be the sun, be the wind and cross the storm
See the stars begin to swarm, read the writings in the stone

The universe is all around us
Read the writings in the stone
