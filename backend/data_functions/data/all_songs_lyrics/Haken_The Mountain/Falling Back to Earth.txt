Falling Back to Earth LyricsPart I: Rise

Save me now, set me free
(If you could only show me how)
Show me how to live my dream
(Living the dream I will die)
Aiming high, shooting low
(You won't be laughing when I'm)
To raise the bar, or take the fall?
(Climbing the mountain)

Someone rescue me; help me, please!
Against all odds, I long to be free

Will no one listen to my plea?
The sky is falling in on me!

Intervention now
(Save me now, set me free, show me how live a dream)
I'll defeat
(Aiming high, shooting low, raise the bar, take the fall)
All the people who
(Rescue me, help me please, how I long to be free)
Stepped on me
(Intervene, I'll defeat, all those who stepped on me)
You have been standing in my way
You won't believe it when I'm

Soaring through the sky, free from your burden
Say your last goodbyes, I won't be back again


When my name becomes tomorrow's news
On top of the mountain, I cannot be moved
I scale the summit like an unstoppable force
With iron wings I will prove my worth to you all

I will be dancing on your grave
You won't be laughing when I'm

Soaring through the sky, free from your burden
Say your last goodbyes, I won't be back again
Too close to the flame, ambition has burned me
With my wings ablaze, I'm falling back to earth
Part II: Fall

Now that my feathers are broken, crestfallen, my head is bowed
Splashing down into the ocean, something seems different now
The world I once knew has eroded, humanity's fossilized
The beasts have become the new masters; is reality compromised?
Advanced technological breakthroughs and superior firepower
The frontiers of war and resistance seem abstract and vacant now
For countless years I have been longing to apologize, apologize
A world without end is upon us, but time is in short supply

Soaring through the sky, free from your burden
Say your last goodbyes, I won't be back again
Too close to the flame, ambition has burned me
With my wings ablaze, I'm falling back to earthEmbed
