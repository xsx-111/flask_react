Cockroach King LyricsTantalized by the cockroach and its promise
I fantasised about soaring with golden wings
"Flying with gold wings"
Hypnotized by the cockroach and its promise
I was compromised by a treasure
That was fit for fools
"Lured by a fool's gold"
Blinded by a fickle fortune
Diamonds in my eyes
Blinded by the grand illusion
Golden wings to fly
The hunter draws closer to its prey
Vacantly I was gazing at the mirage
I yearned to be an apostle
Of the self-made man
Hopelessly I bathed in my ignorance
Desperately toking on the roach of irony
My fickle fortune beckoned
A treasure fit for fools
The hunter draws closer to its prey
I blindly wandered down the golden path
In pursuit of a misbegotten dream
The Great Gatsby whispered in my ear
The road from rags to riches leads nowhere
The grand illusion beckoned
With promises of deceit
(Chorus)
The Cockroach King sits on his throne
With the Midas touch and a heart of stone
An empire built on guile and greed
A bleeding ground for those who heed
The grand illusion's faded
The hunter snares its prey
I fear and loathe the cockroach
The mirage melts away
(Chorus)
The Cockroach King sits on his throne
With the Midas touch and a heart of stone
An empire built on guile and greed
A bleeding ground for those who heed
Lured by a treasure that was fit for fools
"Searching for the truth"
Lost in this labyrinth in search of the truth
"With your promises of deceit"
Trapped in your kingdom built on greed and guile
"Built on greed and guile"
Only to find the insects have multiplied
(Chorus)
The Cockroach King of guile and greed
With a broken crown he's left to bleed
An empire falling to its knees
A bleeding ground for those who heed
I longed to be a disciple of the cockroach
I was hopelessly choking
On the roach of fallacy
"The roach of irony"
Thankfully when the mirage finally melted
The impurity of the cockroach was revealed to me
"The roach of irony"
Blinded by the grand illusion
Blackened wings to fly
Burning ashes of the hunter
Scattered in the sky8Embed
