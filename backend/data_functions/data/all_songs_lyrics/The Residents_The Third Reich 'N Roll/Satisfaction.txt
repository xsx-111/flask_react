Satisfaction Lyrics
I can't get no
I can't get no
Satisfaction

When I'm at the football game
And the jack falls down and fumbles
And his skull goes back
And he breaks his neck
I just laugh and crack my knuckles!

I can't get no
I can't get no
Satisfaction
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
That's what I say

When I'm at the picture show
And I can't get no popcorn
And I grab a knife
And I stab at it
And I beat on Dina Shore
And you think I'm all messed-up
Well I think you're all messed-up!
And I 
When I'm goin' to my job
And I'm riding on the bus
And I grit my teeth
And I clench my fist
And I rip up this whole bus!
