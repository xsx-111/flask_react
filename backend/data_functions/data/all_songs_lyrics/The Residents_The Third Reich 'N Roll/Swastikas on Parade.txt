Swastikas on Parade Lyrics
Na, na na na na, na na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na na

Got to know how to pony like Bony Maroney
Mashed potato, do the alligator
Put your hand on your hips now
Let your backbone slip now
Now do the Watusi
Like my little Lucy
I saw her walking on down the line
You know I saw her for the very first time
A little girl walking all alone
Pretty baby, can I walk you home?
I never saw her, never, never saw her
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
Does the hanky panky, does the hanky panky
Does the hanky panky, does the hanky panky...

Woke up this morning, my head was so bad
It was the worst hangover that I've ever had
What happened to me last night
That girl of mine she loved me so right
Loved me so long, yeah she loved so hard
I finally passed out in her front yard
It wasn't wine that I had too much of
It was a double shot of my baby's love
Double shot of my baby's love yeah

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to baby again
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
She wrote me a letter...
Listen mister, can't you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway yeah
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter

I feel depressed, I feel so bad
Cause you're the best girl that I ever had
I can't get your love, I can't get a fraction
Uh-oh, little girl, psychotic reaction
And it feels like this!


Hey, little girl, you don't have to hide nothin' no more
You didn't do nothin' that hadn't been done before
You can leave, little girl, I don't want you 'round no more
Too bad, little girl, it's all over for you...

I got me a complication
And it's an only child
Concernin' my reputation
As something more than wild
I know it serves me right
But I can't sleep at night
Have to hide my face
Or go some other play-ay-ay-ay-ay-ace
