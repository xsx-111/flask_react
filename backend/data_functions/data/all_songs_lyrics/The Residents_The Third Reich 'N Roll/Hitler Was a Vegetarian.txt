Hitler Was a Vegetarian Lyrics
(Instrumental)

Too many teardrops for one heart to be cryin'
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on
You're way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughin'
Way down at me
But watch out now
I'm gonna get there
We'll be together
For just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you
Way down here
And you'll start cryin'
Ninety-six tears
Cry
Cry cry cry

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine

Yes, it's your party, I know it's your party
And, you know that you can cry, and, it's cool
But you have to remember that I too cried my 96 tears
And... it's just something we all have to go through some time or another
And, you know, it would be unfair and it would be untrue
If I was to say to you that you couldn't get much higher
So, you know, even if it's your party and all...

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire

Fearless men fighting soldiers from the sky
Fearless men who jump and die
Men who mean just what they say
The brave men of the Green Beret
Yummy yummy yummy
I got love in my tummy
And I feel like lovin' you
Love, you're such a sweet thing
Good enough to eating
And that's what I'm gonna do
Ooh love, to hug you
Ooh love, to kiss you
Ooh love, I love it so
Ooh love, you're sweeter
Sweeter than sugar
Ooh love, I won't let you go
Yummy yummy yummy
I got love in my tummy
And I feel like lovin' you
The lovin' that you re giving
Is what keeps me livin'
And your love is like
Peaches and cream
Kinda like sugar
Kinda like spices
Kinda like, like what you do
Kinda sounds funny
But you know, honey
Honey. I love you

(Instrumental)

Pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' too hard
Pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' too hard
Pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' too hard
Pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' pushin' too hard

Good lovin'
Good lovin'
Good lovin'
Good lovin'
I was feelin' oh so bad
I asked my family doctor just what I had
I said "Doctor
Mr. M.D
Can you tell me
What's ailin' me?"
He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
And said "all you really need..."
Good lovin'
Good lovin'
Good lovin'
Good lovin'

I'm crazy about my baby
You know she comes around
She make me feel so good
From her head to the ground
And her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria

In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand?
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land?
