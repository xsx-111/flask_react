Let Me Move You Lyrics
Baby, let me move you
Ooh baby, let me move you
Baby, let me move you
Ooh baby, let  me move you
You know you're looking so good there mama
Ooh baby, let me move you
With your pretty fine self
You know you're looking so good
I just want to move you
I just want to move you
You know you're looking so good, mama
Have you ever been moved
Come on let me move you
Have you ever been moved
You looking so good
I like the way you groove baby
I just want to move you
Tell me, have you ever been moved
Baby let me move you
Early in the morning
Let me move you
Darling, in the midnight hour
Oh baby, let me move you
Anytime, anywhere, anyhow
I just want to move you
I just want to move you
I don't care, I don't mind
It don't matter how you let me move you
Come on baby
And let me move you, ah!
Come on little girl
Take me, take me by my hand
Come on, come on tell me
I'm your sweet loving man
Come on, come on and tell me
That I'm the best man in the land

Good God almighty, let me move you
Little girl, come on let me move you
Let me move you
Got your body, I just want to move you
If I don't live another day
I just want to move you, little girl todayEmbed
