Izabella Lyrics

Izabella

I’m dreaming about you every night in my bed
Every night
You know good and well darling
We got this war to fight
So I hope you're receiving me baby
You know I hope everything’s all right

Izabella

Girl, I'm fighting this war for the children and you
Hey sweet darling, please give me a chance to get myself together for you
You wait for me and save your love child
When I know I may pretend true

Izabella

Girl, here comes the rays of the rising sun
Oh my heart is coming by baby
I think I can feel it just begun
Keep those dreams coming in strong
Maybe one day I’ll be holding you instead of these machine guns
Izabella
