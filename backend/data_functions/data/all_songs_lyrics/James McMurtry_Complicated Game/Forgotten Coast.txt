Forgotten Coast Lyrics
Down the highway South I'll go
Wewahitchka to Port St. Joe
I'm gonna walk the beach with a pirate's ghost
We'll haunt that old forgotten coast

I'm gonna trade my car and change my name
Put Wesson Oil in my bar and chain
I'm gonna fix a road-kill black bear roast
And get fat on that forgotten coast

No one's gonna find me there
With my steel guitar and my rockin' chair
Among the seafood shacks and oyster boats
I'll hide out on that forgotten coast


No one's gonna find me there
With my fishin' pole and my rockin' chair
Tell the one I'll miss the most
"He's down on that forgotten coast"
Down the highway South I'll go
Wewahitchka to Port St. Joe
I'm gonna walk the beach with a pirate's ghost
We'll haunt that old forgotten coast

I'm gonna cut my hair and change my name
And when the Percodan won't touch the pain
Tell the one I'll miss the most
"He's gone down that forgotten coast"

Tell the one I'll miss the most
"He's down on that forgotten coast"Embed
