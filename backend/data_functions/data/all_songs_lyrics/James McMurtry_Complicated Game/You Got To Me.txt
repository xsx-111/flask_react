You Got To Me Lyrics
To celebrate undyin' faith
We're gathered here like drifted wrecks
For a late September wedding
October breathin' down our necks
And I knew this town in another time
I knew this town a younger man
With the world in my hip pocket
And a subway token in my hand

Mmm
You got to me

And they got candle light and a reggae band
Champagne by the bucket load
Limos lined up down the curb
To take us where we need to go
And I need to go somewhere I've been
To find the place I lost the trail
Way back then, so long ago
I don't suppose you even know

You got to me
Brought all this empty down on top of me
You got to me
We danced between the snowflakes fallin'
Trippin' on the cobblestones
And the trolley tracks, we had it all then
Christmas break, your roommates gone
We stoked the fire and let it burn
Til the embers glowed in the mornin' light
Trust in the tangle of skin on skin
I've not known quite that feeling since

You got to me
Brought all this empty down on top of me
I didn't know, but we were not to be
But I know a thing or two now

The wedding party's ragin' yet
How the old and desperate misbehave
The limo smells like cocaine sweat
Cheap cologne and aftershave
It's gotta be one of these row house doors
I knew the number long ago
I'll step out on the curb
And tell the driver "just go on and go"
You got to me
Brought all this empty down on top of me
I didn't know know, but we were not to be
But I know a thing or two now

The paper boy wants a smoke
Leans his bike against a tree
And he's tired and cold and broke
And he don't know what to make of me
Standing here in my three piece suit
Standing here just like I am
With my vest unbuttoned and my necktie loose
Impervious to all abuse

You got to me
Brought all this empty down on top of me
 dollar odyssey
And I know a thing or two now

Yeah, I know a thing or two now
Yeah, I know a thing or two nowEmbed
