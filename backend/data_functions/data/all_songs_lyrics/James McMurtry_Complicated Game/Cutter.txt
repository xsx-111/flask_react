Cutter Lyrics
I don't know what to say to you
I shouldn't judge, but I often do
When you gonna come back home?
Why'd you leave me all alone?

I cut myself sharp and deep
It's the only thing that lets me sleep
Takes the pain from off my face
And puts it in one tiny space

Where I can keep it down out of sight
Way off to the side
It won't come at me on a cold dark night
The red ridges I can't hide
They're on the outside

I don't know what to say to you
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want me to
Despite conviction, I still lack proof
As the rain beats down on the motel roof

And I miss those long hot summer days
When I can keep that beast at bay
Long shadows bring it back to life
'Til it sees its reflection in a short sharp knife
Then I can keep it down out of sight
Way off to the side
It won't come at me on a cold dark night
The red ridges I can't hide
They're on the outside

I remember all my gifts
In the early hours when the panic lifts
Thoughts go racin' 'round and around
And only daylight slows 'em down

I miss my dog from long ago
Where he went, I still don't know
Whiskey and coffee while I burn my toast
And build a cage for all my ghosts

So I can keep 'em down out of sight
Way off to the side
They won't come at me on a cold dark night
The red ridges I can't hide
They're on the outside
I don't know what to say to you
I shouldn't judge but I often doEmbed
