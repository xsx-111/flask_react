She Loves Me Lyrics
My love, she's got her notions
I mostly know the drill
She expects to be remembered
As a pretty woman will
And when she's not, she's angry
And somehow I'm to blame
Don't know if I can hang
In such a complicated game

But she loves me
She loves me

I hear she has another
I hear she likes him well
I won't be home 'til Christmas
They'll be at it for a spell
It was part of our agreement
I signed off on the deal
I must admit I never saw it
Happenin' for real

'Cause she loves me
She loves me
It's an airport novella
Adapted for late night TV
I'm not writing the screenplay
It's writin' me
It's writin' me

He's a parking lot attendant
At a fancy restaurant
He rides his brother's Harley
And he gives her what she wants
And he knows his days are numbered
As far as she's concerned
She'll vote him off the island
The minute I return

She loves me
She loves me
She loves me
She loves meEmbed
