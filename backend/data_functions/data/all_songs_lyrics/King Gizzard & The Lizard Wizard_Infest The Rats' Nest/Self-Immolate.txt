Self-Immolate Lyrics
I have gone insane-o
I lust for volcano
Be with molten lava
Give me my nirvana
I have no vertigo
I lust for tornado
Be a leaf upon air
Venusian mal-de-mer (Oh)

Venusian sickness dire
I want to be set on fire
Venusian, gather while I
Venusian-ly catch on fire
Auto-cremate
Self-immolate

Like a bird in a cage
Aerostat habitat
To motion, I am slave
Give me hell, I want that
Venusian sickness
Venusian bilious
Venusian nausea
Venusian mal-de-mer (Oh)
Venusian sickness dire
I want to be set on fire
Venusian, gather while I
Venusian-ly catch on fire

Auto-cremate (Auto-cremate)
Self-immolate (Self-immolate)13Embed
