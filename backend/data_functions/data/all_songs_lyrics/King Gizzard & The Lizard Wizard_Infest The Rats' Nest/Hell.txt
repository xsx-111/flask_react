Hell Lyrics
God, it's pretty hot down here
Under surface
Antichrist has tempted me
With a purpose

Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell, hell, hell, hell

Here I was thinking I'd die
I see a thousand flies and wings and tails and spines
Nausea-less, resoluteness near the entrance
Satan points me to the rats' nest

Remember where to enter
Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber
Hell, hell, hell, hell

Remember where to enter
The door to hell is amber

Fifteen infantry paratroop into the propylene new scene
Hell's where they wanna be
Infest the rats' nest8Embed
