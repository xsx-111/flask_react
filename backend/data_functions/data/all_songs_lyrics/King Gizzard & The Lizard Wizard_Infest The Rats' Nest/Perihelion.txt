Perihelion Lyrics
Space is the place for the human race
Chasing the race for the new place
Days on our old place waste
Starship's team full of everybody keen
Pilot in the twilight is a deep dream
Men and machine convene

Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion

Giver of life and the giver of speed
Ever we take even her gravity
Her glowing beauty is something to see
Bigger and brighter, she cometh to me

Solar mountain comes on the perihelion
No rerouting, only countin' till we're done
Shoutin' sins until we're in the sun
(Peri-perihelion)
Melting humans and everything they bring
In a blink, the sun will drink their things
Grinning sun has sinners for dinner
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion
Peri-perihelion

Giver of life and the giver of speed
Ever we take even her gravity
Her glowing beauty is something to see
Bigger and brighter, she cometh to me

Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)
Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)
Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)
Peri-perihelion (Peri-perihelion)3Embed
