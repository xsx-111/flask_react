Planet B Lyrics
Open your eyes and light the fluid
Get into it, petrol siphon
Low on meals, browning fields
Bury children

Urbanization
Scarification
Population exodus
There is no Planet B
Open your eyes and see


Open your eyes and shoot the dingo
While this shit goes out the window
Multi-factions
Rusting tractors
Dying hero

Only way through is colonization
Acclimatization
Population exodus
Monetization
Civilization
The operation has begun
There is no Planet B
Patient seasons
Blacked out for ages
Dreaming of cake
Snowflakes blanket
Old deserts
Outskirts disperse
Earth is a blank verse
Last hearse
Dry nurse
(Oh!)

Open your eyes and see
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
There is no Planet B
Open your eyes and see

Sinners are grinners, ear to ear
Baby Jesus sheds a tear9Embed
