Superbug Lyrics
Superbug coming up
Feels like he'll never stop
Shoulda used phages
Instead you took ages
Superbug gave a shrug
And ate all your prescription drugs
And never, ever, ever stopped
Deadly contagious
And inter-generational
Never ever ever stops
And never ever gives a fuck

Pony up
Join the club
Shake my hand
Let's run amok

Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff

Superbug coming up
H1N1 was a flop
Anti-microbial
Resistance is futile
Superbug is like a truck
Penicillin is a duck
That's sitting on the road for luck
Faceless and ageless
It's simply outrageous
Never ever, ever stops
And never ever gives a fuck
Unnecessary
Anti-Bs
Likely killed humanity

Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff


Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff
Superbug in my blood
Superbug made of the disturbing stuff5Embed
