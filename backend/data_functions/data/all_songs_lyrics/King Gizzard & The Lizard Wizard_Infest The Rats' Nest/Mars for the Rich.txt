Mars for the Rich Lyrics
Red Mars for the rich

I'm just a poor boy
Living frugally
I see Mars on TV
I see people happy
I work fields with
Blistered fingers
I look starward
That world has no place for me

Red Mars
The tsars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich

Mars for the privileged
Earth for the poor
Mars terraforming slowly
Earth has been deformed
Just forget it, ya ain't coming here
The ticket's too dear
I stare sadly into my beer
That world has no place for me
Red Mars
The tsars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich


Red Mars
The tsars
Live large
Red Mars for the rich, rich, rich, rich9Embed
