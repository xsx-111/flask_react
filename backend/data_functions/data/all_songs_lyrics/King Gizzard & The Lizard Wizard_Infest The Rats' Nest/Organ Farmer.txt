Organ Farmer Lyrics
Make the incision
Careful precision
Blood minestrone
Decomposition
New life christened
Fatty rolls of brie

Organ farmer
Organ farmer

Delicatessen
Of our profession
Growing muscle meat
Bring in the carcass
Waken departed
Speak our blasphemy

Organ farmer
Organ farmer

Counterfeit hypocrite
Runs the mall, runs 'em all
Citadel guards it well
Counting coins, counting stem cells
Wiretap divinity
Human laboratory
Kill the squid, cut the tree
Arrogant human being
Meadow's vast, body parts pulled apart
Partly smart, partly art, partly not
Part of me wants to breathe eternally
Part of me wants to cut out my heart
Farm colossal
Wake the fossil
In the fields of beef4Embed
