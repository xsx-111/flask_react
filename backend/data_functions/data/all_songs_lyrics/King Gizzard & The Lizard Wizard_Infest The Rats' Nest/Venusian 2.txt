Venusian 2 Lyrics
In the lap of the gods
The last one did explode
In a blaze all fiery
I sit in the cockpit
It may be a sinking ship
But fortune favours bravery

Road trip with me
Vitamin V
In focus now

Venu (Venu)
-sian two (-sian two)

Fingers getting warm
And eyes are turning gold
Evil twin is coming in
Weathering the storm
I put the birdie down
For the sin, I have a grin

Road trip with me
Vitamin V
I see the ground (Oh)
Venu (Venu-)
-sian two (-sian two)
Venu (Venu-)
-sian two (-sian two)4Embed
