Real World Lyrics
Mister trouble, come walkin' this way
Year gone past feels like one long day
But I'm alive and I'm feelin' all right
Well, I run that hard road outta Heartbreak City
Built a roadside carnival out of hurt and self-pity
It was all wrong, well now I'm movin' on

Ain't no church bells ringing
Ain't no flags unfurled
Just me and you and the love we're bringing
Into the real world
Into the real world

I built a shrine in my heart, it wasn't pretty to see
Made out of fool's gold, memory, and tears cried
Now I'm heading over the rise
I'm searching for one clear moment of love and truth
I still got a little faith, but what I need is some proof tonight
I'm lookin' for it in your eyes

Ain't no church bells ringing
Ain't no flags unfurled
Just me and you and the love we're bringing
Into the real world
Into the real world
Well tonight I just wanna shout
I feel my soul waist-deep and sinking into this black river of doubt
I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside
And when the morning comes, baby, I don't wanna hide
I'll stand right at your side with my arms open wide

Well tonight I just wanna shout
I feel my soul waist-deep and sinking into this black river of doubt
I just wanna rise and walk along the riverside
Till the morning comes, I'll stand right by your side

I wanna find some answers, I wanna ask for some help
I'm tired or running scared, baby, let's get our bags packed
We'll take it here to hell and heaven and back
And if love is hopeless, hopeless at best
Come on put on your party dress
It's ours tonight and we're going with the tumblin' dice

Ain't no church bells ringing
Ain't no flags unfurled
Just me and you and the love we're bringing
Into the real world
Into the real world
Oh into the real worldEmbed
