I Wish I Were Blind Lyrics
I love to see the cottonwood blossom in the early spring
I love to see the message of love that the bluebird brings
But when I see you walkin' with him down along the strand
I wish I were blind when I see you with your man

I love to see your hair shining in the long summer's light
I love to watch the stars fill the sky on a summer night
The music plays, you take his hand, I watch how you touch him as you start to dance
And I wish I were blind when I see you with your man

We struggle here but all our love's in vain
Oh these eyes that once filled me with your beauty, now fill me with pain
And the light that once entered here is banished from me
And this darkness is all, baby, that my heart sees
And though this world is filled with the grace and beauty of God's hand
Oh I wish I were blind when I see you with your man

We struggle here but all our love's in vain
Oh these eyes that once filled me with your beauty, now fill me with pain
And the light that once entered here is banished from me
And this darkness is all, baby, that my heart sees
And though the world is filled with the grace and beauty of God's hand
Oh I wish I were blind when I see you with your man
Oh I wish I were blind when I see you with your man
Oh I wish I were blind when I see you with your manEmbed
