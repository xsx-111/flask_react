Silver Line Lyrics
Don't wake the dreamer
Don't shake the axis
Be faith, I need it
I pray I believe it

Never let the darkness leave us
If you can't, I'll be the dreamer
Be the night and I will be your shining light

I'm your silverline
Only you will find
Silverline
I'll save you every time

Don't wake the lover
The spell I'm under
Be grace, I need it
I pray I believe it

Never let the darkness leave us
If you can't, I'll be the dreamer
Be the night and I will be your shining light
I'm your silverline
Only you will find
Silverline
I'll save you every time

Don't burn my hope
Don't let the moonlight leave
I shine for him
Don't wake the dreamer
Don't burn my hope
Don't the moonlight leave
I shine for him
Don't wake the dreamer
Don't wake the dreamer

I'm your silverline
Only you will find
Silverline
I'll save you every time
Silverline
Only you will find
Silverline
I'll save you every time
I'll save you every time
I'll save you every time6Embed
