Just Like a Dream Lyrics
I'm letting you go
I'm setting you free
I no longer love
Head over heels
Morning will come
My will break
So before you replace me
Lie, lie with me one last time

Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling, I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream

Before you forget
Was I ever real?
Before you forgive me darling
For love I can't feel
Before I replace you
Lie, lie with me one last time
Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling, I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream

You're making my heart bleed, Honey
Don't ever forget me, Honey

Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me

Just like a dream
Oh come, come back to me
I'll still believe
If you stay baby, stay with me
Darling, I beg, come back to me
Just like a dream5Embed
