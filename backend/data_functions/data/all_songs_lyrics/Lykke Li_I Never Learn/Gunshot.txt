Gunshot Lyrics
I am longing for your poison
Like a cancer for its prey
Shot an arrow in your harbor
Where you waited in the rain
I am siren, I am ivy
I am no one, I'm nobody
I am longing for your honey
I am longing for your love

And the shot goes
Through my head and back
Gunshot
I can't take it back

Lay me down in your ocean
Carry me and my burden
I was dreaming about you, honey
I was hoping you'd save me

And the shot goes
Through my head and back
Gunshot
I can't take it back
My heart cracked
Really loved you bad
Gunshot
Never get you back
And I ache, while you're not here
Feel you aching
Wide awake, while you're not here
I can feel you firing straight into my heart

Goes
Through my head and back
Gunshot
I can't take it back
My heart cracked
Really loved you bad
Gunshot
Never get you back

Never get you back
Never get you back
Never get you back
Never get you back20Embed
