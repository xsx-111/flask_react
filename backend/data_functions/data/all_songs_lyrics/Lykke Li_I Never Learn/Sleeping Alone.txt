Sleeping Alone Lyrics
How can I get used to
How can I forget you?
Will I get used to
Sleeping alone?

I never used to
How did I get to
Ever get used to
Sleeping alone?

Tomorrow is a long time
Forgetting so long
I loved you a lifetime
I loved you long

Someday, somehow
Somewhere down the line
If you save your heart for mine
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

Will I get used to?
Can I forget you?
Don't want to get used to
Dancing alone
Love was my shoreline
I stare myself blind
Now was not our time
No, I let you down

Someday, somehow
Somewhere down the line
If you save your heart for mine
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

Some last, some die
Some love wait till its time
If you save your heart for mine
We'll meet again, we'll meet again
We'll meet again
We'll meet again4Embed
