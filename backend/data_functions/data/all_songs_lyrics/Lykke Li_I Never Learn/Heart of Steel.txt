Heart of Steel Lyrics
Oh, heart of steel, don't kill thy song
That sings so we can heal the harm inside
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
Don't me leave me dying, without a lover to hold

Oh, my heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, uh-ooh

Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
You reel me in (oh, heart of steel)
Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
I can't let you win

Don't run, don't hide, don't fight when I finally find
A hand to hold, a song that clings with mine
Don't leave me stranded, don't leave me alone
Don't leave me dying, with out a lover to hold

Oh, my heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, uh-ooh
Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
You reel me in (oh, heart of steel)
Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
I can't let you win

Every night I feel you burning
Every night I hear you calling
Every night it's only you and I

Oh, my heart, don't break the promise
Every time I pay the price
For a heart that can't be broken, uh-ooh

Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
You reel me in (oh, heart of steel)
Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
I can't let you win
Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
You reel me in (oh, heart of steel)
Oh, heart of steel (oh, heart of steel)
I can't let you win
(Oh, heart of steel)
(Oh, heart of steel)
(Oh, heart of steel)
(Oh, heart of steel)
(Oh, heart of steel)3Embed
