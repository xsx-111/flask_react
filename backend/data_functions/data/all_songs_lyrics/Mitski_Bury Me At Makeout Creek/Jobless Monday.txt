Jobless Monday Lyrics
It's a windy afternoon
Can't afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go
Further than they said I'd go
He only loves me when
There's a means he means to end
Oh, I miss when we first met
He didn't know me yet

So take me out, baby
Makes no difference where we'll be
As long as we're out in the sun
Take me out, baby
Take me out, baby
Doesn't matter where we'll be
But please under the light of day
Take me out
Take me out
Take me out, baby

Take me out to-8Embed
