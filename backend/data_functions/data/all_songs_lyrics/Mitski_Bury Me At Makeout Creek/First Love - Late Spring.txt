First Love / Late Spring Lyrics
The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that lately, I've been crying like a tall child

So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sōde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sōde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe55Embed
