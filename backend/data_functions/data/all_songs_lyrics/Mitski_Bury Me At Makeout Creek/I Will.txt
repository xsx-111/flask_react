I Will Lyrics
I will take good care of you
I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good
If you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night
And dry it off with care
I will see your body bare
And still I will live here

So stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave

And all the quiet nights you bear
Seal them up with care
No one needs to know they're there
For I will hold them for you
'Cause all I ever wanted is here
All I ever wanted
All I want is
Always you
It's always you
And we're not out of the tunnel
I bet you, though, there's an end
Stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave
And while you sleep
I'll be scared
So by the time you wake
I'll be brave
I'll be brave
I'll be brave11Embed
