Carry Me Out Lyrics
At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night

The scent of flowers
Still in bloom from morning shower
And I
Say your name
In hopes you'll hear it in the stars

And carry me out
Carry me out

I drive when it rains
At night, when it rains, I drive
And the headlight spirits
They lead me down the Styx
So black it shines
And carry me out
Carry me out

At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night8Embed
