Trapdoor LyricsIt's such a sorry sight to see you now
I swear it hurts me to the bone
How cone I never see you laugh anymore?
You could've been made outta stone
From far away I thought I heard you call my name
But I tell you I ain't coming back again
If you don't know how to shut that trapdoor tight
I just can't help you through the night
Gone are those lovely eyes that I once knew
Why can't I see them anymore
If there is anything that I can do
You'll have to open up the door
Standing on your back-porch
Lookin in your window
It felt like summertime had blown a fuse
I smashed that window
And cut my wrist wide open
Why can't this feeling just bleed away
Bleed away....
From far away,.........etcEmbed
