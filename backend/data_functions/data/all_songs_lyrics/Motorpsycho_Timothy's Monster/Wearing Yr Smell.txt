Wearing Yr Smell LyricsYou took my hand in yours
Fed me lies and locked the doors
Showed me truths I never saw
I can't belive them anymore
Now I'm looking through you
Oh,yeah..
You suck the will from my soul
Leave me naked in the cold
Tie the noose around my neck
Can't yousee I'm not dead yet
But I'm working on it
Wearing yr smell
Fading from myself
Feeling sorry for myself
Feeding the pity inside
The pathetic feelings I should hide
But I'm thriving on it
Yes,I'm thriving on it
Wearing yr smell
Fadeing
Feeling
