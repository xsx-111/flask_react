Leave It Like That LyricsThey all look the same when their dreams unfold
Endless clutching at straws that will never hold
All the pain and the weight of the world
There’s no way to look any other way
That rage I can understand
There's no book of rules and no masterplan
Just dacts that will change overnight
And no way to look any other way
Skin deep, potentially grand
Left alone it will grow 'till it's outta hand
Outta sight and outta mind
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Don't take my guilt on
That's only mine to bear
Just do your thing
Cos you’re the only one that really cares
And leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other way
Leave it like that
There’s no way to look any other wayEmbed
