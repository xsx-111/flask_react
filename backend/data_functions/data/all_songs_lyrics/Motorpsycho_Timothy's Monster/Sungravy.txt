Sungravy LyricsYou say that I don't understand
That it's how I survive
Now there's nothing that can touch you
I pretend that I really care
When I just shrug it all away
I know that it's wrong,but it keeps me breathing
Staring at the sun
Watching so tall
I went blind and saw
Nothing at all
I wish that I could fly away
Walk on air
Really see things as they are
To show you everything
To learn from you
To rise and fall in my own time
Staring at the sun
Watching so tall
I went blind and saw
Nothing at all
But if I could, I'd fly you to the moon
And if I could, I'd chase away your gloom
Until you shone like a thousand suns, so bright
That when it was over, you'd laugh and pretend I was never even there
Lock up and run away
I won't betray you
Lost on a rainy day
In the sunEmbed
