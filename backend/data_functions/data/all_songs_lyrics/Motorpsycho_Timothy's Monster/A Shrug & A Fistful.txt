A Shrug & A Fistful LyricsSenseless I'm soaring elevated off of my cloud
Flying, I'm catervauling - a spring/snap kinda loud
Don't fuck me over again
Don't fuck me over, my friend
A shrug and a fistful later
Down on all fours again
To beat me black'n'blue won't prove a thing
She said
Don't fuck me over again
Don't fuck me over, my friend
You know a shrug and a fistful will teach even angels to hate
You know a shrug and a fistful will teach even angels to hate
Senseless I'm soaring elevated off of my cloud
Flying, I'm catervauling - a spring/snap kinda loud
Don't fuck me over again
Don't fuck me over, my friend
You know a shrug and a fistful will teach even angels to hate
You know a shrug and a fistful will teach even angels to hate
A shrug and a fistful
A shrug and a fistful
A shrug and a fistful
A shrug and a fistfulEmbed
