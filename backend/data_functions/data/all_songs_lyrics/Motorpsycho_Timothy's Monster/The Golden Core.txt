The Golden Core LyricsThese are sungod days
Like subtle layers of yawning
The dewrops die like fireflies
Before this hungry mouth
Slowmotion days are dawning
Why don't it all just burn away?
There is a time for everything
When even you can be a king
Or a queen of no fixed stature
A prince amongst the castaways
On this sungod day
Too boring to pay heed to
I'll dream of you in wintertime
There is a time for everything
When even you can be a king
There is a day for everything
When even you can be a kingEmbed
