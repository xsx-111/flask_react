Giftland LyricsYou don't know me, and I don't think you ever will
Cos I don't even know myself today
You can't own me, and I don't think you ever could
Cos I don't even own myself these days
There's no point in trying
So you might as well quit
Fooling yourself this way
Poke around the embers, no Phoenix is hiding there
There's nothing left to steal from the giftland
This hollow deathwish void will never be filled by any other
Not knowing what you need,you'll never convey it
There's no point in trying
So you might as well quit
Fooling yourself this way
There's no point in trying
So you might as well quit
Fooling yourself this way
