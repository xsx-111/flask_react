Watersound LyricsYou dove and you float
In the afterglow
The night felt so right
Let you go
Breathing light
Breaking light
Who would've thought that I see you like this
You never told me ‘bout the sights that I've missed
Now you're everywhere
Damn all your faults, I can't see them no more
You bled right open, I can see to your core
And it’s beautiful
Shut down shut up
Twisted round
Breathe in breathe out
Like watersound
Breathing light
Breaking light
Relief is painted on the eyes that I see
You changed you face before looking at me
Now I'm scared to death
My vision blurred, now I can't see what's right
Like counting stars on an Aurora night
It don't matter much...
You’re faceless anyhow
Leaving them to comprehend
You tie a rope to the eternal blueEmbed
