Beautiful Sister LyricsSeeing your soul on that butterfly day
I saw myself with other eyes
All those beautiful shades of grey
Grew into colorful lies
The mirror man grew and said things that he knew
He'd discovered them scant minutes before
But when the lights went out and he said goodnight
I knew I'd cheated you
I'm so sorry that you misunderstood me
I'm so sorry that it didn't connect
I'm so sorry that you thought I was someone else
I just didn't mean it quite that way
That way just yet
I haven't seen your face for ages now
I'd forgotten how you made me feel
It was a real tight fit,but my fuses re-lit
And now you're stuck on my mind for real
A summertime hero is a wintertime clown
And knowledge is the odd man out
You've gotta hang on to the trip you're on
I still wish I was a part of yours
I'm so sorry that you misunderstood me
I'm so sorry that it didn't connect
I'm so sorry that you thought I was someone else
I just didn't mean it quite that way
That way just yet
Beautiful sister
Beautiful sister
Beautiful sister
Beautiful sister
I'm so sorry that you misunderstood me
I'm so sorry that it didn't connect
I'm so sorry that you thought I was someone else
I just didn't mean it quite that way
That way just yet
I'm so sorry that you misunderstood me
I'm so sorry that it didn't connect
I'm so sorry that you thought I was someone else
I just didn't mean it quite that way
Guess I had a crush on myself that dayEmbed
