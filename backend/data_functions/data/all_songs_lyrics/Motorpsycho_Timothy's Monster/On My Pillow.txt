On My Pillow LyricsTurn the lights out,and draw the curtain
Dive into my pillow sleeping
Won't hear the phone ring
Distress is the one thing I can't stand
Tell my friends I'm on vacation
And say that I'm OK (x3)
Just wanna sleep all day
I'm within-I'm in orbit
Sweet regression cruise contol
Diving deep in shallow water
I'm home again
Tell my friends it feels like dying
Say that I'm OK (x3)
Just wanna sleep all day
The wolves are howling
I'm out walking
I ain't going back again
If you find me
Please remind me of who I am
Tell my friends it feels like dying
Say that I'm OK (x4)
Just wanna sleep all day
Your hair on my pillow
You're here on my pillowEmbed
