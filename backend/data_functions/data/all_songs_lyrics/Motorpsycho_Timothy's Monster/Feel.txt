Feel LyricsSo now you've found all the letters that you wrote-
They look kinda silly now
It's such a lucky strike that you never even mailed them
They'll never catch you,there's no evidence or proof
Avoidance is foolproof
She'll never know just what she missed
It feels so good to feel again
Those heavies laughing can laugh themselves to death;
They never figured it-
They never saw it like you did
So sweet,so soft,so shure,so scary
And in the end it'll all be forgotten in a month
It feels so good to feel againEmbed
