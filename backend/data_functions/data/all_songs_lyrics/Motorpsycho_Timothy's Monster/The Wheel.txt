The Wheel LyricsThere she goes
Away out of the garden
It'll never be the same
She's never going back again
Kissed by worm
Touched beyond emotions
She'll never feel the same
She'll never feel like that again
Lock the gate
Close that off forever
It'll never be the same
It'll never be the same again
I know
I felt
I lived in that hell
And it hurts
Just a little bit more
Every time you peek through that door
Dug a hole
Saw your long hated face in it
She's never coming back
You might as well face it
Bird has flown
It's eggs are cold and rotting
Feeling like your soul's
Dying, dead and cold
Dying, dead and cold
Dying, dead and cold
Dying, dead and cold
Dying, dead and cold
Put on your travelling boots and start walking
That dirtroad its mud and its tiretracks
Is as long as a lifetime in these parts
Is as long as a lifetime in these parts
As the rain pours down
As the rain pours down
Your hair is so wet you could scrub floors with it
Well, he did
Yes he did
Yes he did
This is all you're gonna get
This is all you're gonna get
This is all you're gonna get
This is all you're gonna get
This is all you're gonna get
This is all you're gonna get
This is all you're gonna get
This is all you're gonna get
I've taken more than enough already, thank you
I've taken more than enough already, thank you
I've taken more than enough already
I'd really like to touch you
But not in that way
I'd really like to touch you
But not in that way
I'd really like to touch you
But not in that way
I'd really like to touch you
But not in that way
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
There's no way out
I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
I still love youEmbed
