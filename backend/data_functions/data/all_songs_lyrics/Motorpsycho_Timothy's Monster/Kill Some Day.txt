Kill Some Day LyricsAll I know is that I dreamed of you
I somehow can't wipe you off my Iris
All I know is that I'm lost in you
Like a bonedry log in your fire
But I see things somewhat different now
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill some day
Leave me alone, yes I'm going home
I won't bother you no more
But if I tried I could make you come back
And de-rail that train from its dead-end track
I'd do anything to be rid of that smile tonight
Tonight
Tonight
These things I can't explain, Lord
You left him hanging out on a limb
All that time you knew it would make him spin
I get so mad, frustrated and sick
I wish I knew just who or what to kick
I used to think it was a personal thing
But that was way before it started killing him
But I see things somewhat different now
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill some day
Leave me alone, yes I'm going home
I won't bother you no more
Oh I see things somewhat different now
Leave me alone, yes I'm going home
I see things somewhat different now
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill some day
Leave me alone, yes I'm going home
I won't bother you no more1Embed
