Everybody Knows (Except You) Lyrics
Everybody knows that I love you
Everybody knows that I need you
Everybody knows that I do
Except you

I told the stars above about the one I love
I told the morning sun, yeah, I'm telling everyone
I told my mum and dad, they seemed to understand
And I'll get through to you if it's the last thing that I do

Everybody knows that I love you
Everybody knows that I need you
Everybody knows that I do
Except you

Everybody knows I live for you
Everybody knows I adore you
Everybody knows that it's true
Except you

I told all of my friends again and again and again
I drove them 'round the bend, so now you're my only friend
I told the passersby, I made a small boy cry
And I'll get through to you if it's the last thing that I do
'Cause everybody knows that I love you
Everybody knows that I need you
Everybody knows that I do
Except you

I'm going crazy, baby (Everybody)
What do I have to do? (Knows I love you)
You know I love you, baby (Everyone)
Maybe you'll love me soon (Except you)
Everybody knows I live for you (Everybody)
And everybody knows I adore you (Knows I love you)
Everybody knows that it's true (Everyone)
Except you
Except you
Except you
Except you
How come everyone knows, except you?
Yeah, and everybody knows that I love you (Everybody)
Yeah, everybody knows that I need you (Knows I love you)

And everybody knows that I do
Except youEmbed
