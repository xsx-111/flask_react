Someone Lyrics
Someone I once knew
Told someone like you
Love is just a word
Now I'm not so sure
That's true

Someone made me see
How someone like me
Needn't be so closed
Just cause they once chose
To be

I need to be someone's somebody

Someone heard my call
When I was all at sea
Someone rescued me
When my life was all
But through

Someone made me feel
Like someone really cares
I hardly even knew
To believe it's real
It's really true
I need to be someone's somebodyEmbed
