If... LyricsIf you were the road
I'd go all the way
If you were the night
I'd sleep in the day
If you were the day
I'd cry in the night
Cause you are the way
The truth, and the light
If you were a tree
I could put my arms around you
And you could not complain
If you were a tree
I could carve my name into your side
And you would not cry
Cause trees don't cry
If you were a man
I would still love you
If you were a drink
I'd drink my fill of you
If you were attacked
I would kill for you
If your name was Jack
I'd change mine to Jill for you
If you were a horse
I'd clean the crap out of your stable
And never once complain
If you were a horse
I could ride you through the fields at dawn
Through the day until the day was gone
I could sing about you in my songs
As we rode away into the setting sun
If you were
My little girl
I would find it hard to let you go
If you were
My sister
I would find it doubly so
If you were a dog
I'd feed you scraps from off the table
Though my wife complains
If you were my dog
I am sure you'd like it better then
You'd by my loyal four-legged friend
You'd never have to think again
And we could be together till the endEmbed
