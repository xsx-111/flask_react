Thank You Too! Lyrics
Really didn't think I was gonna make it
Really didn't think I was gonna make it this way
Put on my robot face
Hide my emotions way far away from me

Oh, you really saw my naked heart
You really brought out the naked part
I don't know what you were doing
I know I just want to thank you for thinking of me

I want to take you for all that you are
I know our worlds seem far apart
I want to see you for all that you do
I want to thank you

It was strange and it was soothing
And you could even say amusing, the way you came to me
You devised a simple plan that would change the fate of man
You thought of everything

Oh, you really saw my naked heart
You really brought out the naked part
I don't know what you were doing
I know I just want to thank you for thinking of me
I want to take you for all that you are
I know our worlds seem far apart
I want to see you for all that you do
I want to thank you
I want to take you for all that you are
I know our worlds seem far apart
I want to see you for all that you do
I want to thank you2Embed
