Remnants Lyrics
Remnants of the empire
Artifacts of love
Will I meet the designer
What will he dream up?
Remnants of the empire
Gravity awake
What's held down to the ground
Next round goes into space
Raising up the empire
Innocence and faith
What will hold you up
And what will stand in your way, way?

Then I saw a new Heaven
Formed in the bleeding light of dusk
All souls, all faiths
Always we were one

Raise a bayonet in the dark
For all the human race
Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out
You can go my same way
Taking out the empire
Watching from afar
It's not too late, never too late
To make our new fate
Then I saw a new Heaven
Formed in the bleeding light of dusk
Then I saw a new Heaven
Formed in the bleeding light of dusk
All souls, all faiths
Always we were one, ow!Embed
