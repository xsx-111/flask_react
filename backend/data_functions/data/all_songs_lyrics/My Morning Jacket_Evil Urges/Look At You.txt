Look At You Lyrics
Look at you, you
Such a fine citizen
Look at you, you
Such a glowing example

Of peace and glory, glory, glory
Of peace and glory, glory, glory
Let me follow you

We believe in your power
To lead without fear
Not above in some tower
But here, right down here
With us in this world
Look at you, you
Everywhere at once
You
Such a glowing example

Of peace and glory, glory, glory
Of peace and glory, glory, glory
Let me, let me follow
Let me, let me follow youEmbed
