Aluminum Park Lyrics
You can care if you want to
You can care if you don't
But come on it's a big big world now
You got to get what you want
Got no lack of frustration
Got no lack of disease
But come on, it's a big, big world now
You got to like what you see and I do

Well you can ride, ride, ride on down to the aluminum park
Well you can ride, ride, ride on down with your head in the dark
Well, it's a little bit important to me
You get a whole lot of what you need
So you can ride, ride, ride on down to the aluminum park
Ride!

You can care if you want to
You can care if you don't
But come on it's a big big world now
You got to get what you want
Got no lack of frustration
Got no lack of disease
But come on, it's a big, big world now
You got to like what you see and I do
Well you can ride, ride, ride on down to the aluminum park
Well you can ride, ride, ride on down with your head in the dark
Oh, it's a little bit important to me
You get a whole lot of what you need
So you can ride, ride, ride on down to the aluminum park
Yeah, you can ride, ride, ride on down to the aluminum park
Well, you can ride on down, hey
Ride!Embed
