Sec Walkin Lyrics
Left leg, right leg
One leg at a time
I keep on walking
I keep on walking
Red light, green light
First light I see tonight
I am walking
Yeah, I am walking

Fever, breathe in your own cool, blue air
Look for eyes that hypnotize and sparkle (sparkle)
Look for eyes that hypnotize and sparkle everywhere
Brother, brother, don't you care?
Brother, brother, don't you care?


Fever, breathe in your own cool, blue air
Demon eyes, demon eyes are watching (watching)
Demon eyes, demon eyes are watching everywhere
Brother, brother, don't you care?
Brother, brother, don't you care?Embed
