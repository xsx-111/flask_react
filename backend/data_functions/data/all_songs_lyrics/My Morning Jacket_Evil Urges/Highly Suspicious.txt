Highly Suspicious Lyrics
Wasting time home alone dotting your i's
Peanut butter pudding surprise
Ain't nobody care what's going on in your mind
But they got they eye on your prize

I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)
I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)

Now, daddy's got you home alone, solving your crimes
Peanut butter pudding surprise
Ain't no jokin', smokin', strokin', tapping your lines
Peanut butter pudding surprise

I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)
I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)

Wasting all your time on drama
Could be solving real crime
Waste away your mind too
I'm high
I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)
I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)

I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)
I'm high (Highly suspicious)
Highly suspicious of you (Highly suspicious of you)

Highly suspicious
Highly suspicious of you
Highly suspicious
Highly suspicious of you1Embed
