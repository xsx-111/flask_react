Evil Urges Lyrics
What is what? Man, they got us so scared
Thinking we're so evil way down under there
Hoo, I made a nasty decision
To love whoever I want just a-whenever I can

Things they say are evil urges, baby
They be part of the human way
It ain't evil, baby, if it ain't hurting anybody
Evil urges, baby, they be part of the human way
It ain't evil, baby, if it ain't hurting anybody, anybody

If it's all the same, we're tired of waiting, c'mon then
And dedicate your love to any woman or man
No racial boundary lines, no social subdivisions
If you want it, you can

Well, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that I want it someday
I'm not saying, I'm not saying that I want it somehow
I'm not saying, I'm not saying that I want it someday, somehow
Ooh, I'm ready it for now (I'm ready for it now)
I'm ready it for now
I'm ready it for now (I'm ready for it now)
I'm ready it for it, ha
I'm ready for it (I'm ready for it now)
I'm ready for it, ha
I'm ready for it now (I'm ready for it now)
I'm ready for it now
Things they say are evil urges, baby
They be part of the human way
It ain't evil, baby, if it ain't hurting anybody
Evil urges maybe good and bad, all the same, but c'mon now
It ain't evil, baby, it it ain't hurting anybody, anybody
Evil urges, baby, they be part of the human way
It ain't evil, baby, if it ain't hurting anybody, anybody
Anybody, anybodyEmbed
