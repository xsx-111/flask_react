Fire Editorial LyricsTwo blinded in Detroit!
Something must be done
Jaws dropping at ringside
In the blood tide
When the fireball hits
Down Indiana way
Make 'em check their guns
Real tears when it's over
Smell the sulfur
When the dark vault splits
Lord of the hidden pocket knife
Tawdry dreams all come to life
Save yourselves
Save this town, save everything not nailed down
War in Ontario! Dead before the bell
Crushed hopes of the young breed
All the best bleed
All the proud boys break
Who will stand before the flood?
Who will mop up all the blood?
Who alone?
Skin, bone, steel, stone
Swim or drown
Save this town, save everything not nailed downEmbed
