Heel Turn 2 Lyrics
Get stomped like a snake
Lie down in the dirt
Cling to my convictions
Even when I get hurt
Be an upstanding, well-loved man about town
In your child’s mind, that’s how it goes down
But I tried the losing side

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here

Drift down into the new, dark light
Without any reservations
You found my breaking point
Congratulations
Spent too much of my life now trying to play fair
Throw my better self overboard
Shoot at him when he comes up for air
Come unhinged, get revenge

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here
Stay good under pressure
For years and years and years and years
President of the fan club
Up there choking on his tears

Let all the trash rain down
From way up in the rafters
I’m walking out of here in one piece
Don’t care what comes after
Drive the wedge, torch the bridge

I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here
