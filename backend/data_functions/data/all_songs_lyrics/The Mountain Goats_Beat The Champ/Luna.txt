Luna LyricsAll gone, all gone
Watching it go up out front on the lawn
Stay on my feet somehow, Iâ€™m strong now
Stuck there, no air
Head high, head high
Tongues of fire that reach up for the sky
Rise through the smoke, the dust of the grave
I will be saved
Pause in mid-stride
Pause in mid-stride
And ride, and ride
And ride, and ride
Burn hard, burn hard
Smoldering pieces landing in the yard
Trace names in ash, big names, old friends
And dead ends
Those last few frames
Go down so fast
Rise through the flames
And end again in flames at last
Stay free, stay free
Invisible armies march by night for me
Stay on my guard, burn hard
Rage on, all gone
Pause in mid-stride
Pause in mid-stride
And ride and ride
And ride and ride1Embed
