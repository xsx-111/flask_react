Choked Out LyricsDiamonds in the firmament
All reserves completely spent
Someone set up the oxygen tent
Everybody here's real proud to present
Choked out
Two hundred dollar take-all purse
Half-nelson to suplex reverse
Worried look on the face of the ringside nurse
At one, for once, with the universe
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
I stretch and strain with all my might
Drift off into the velvety arms of the night
Kick and claw and scratch and bite
Fire up the grill, everybody eats tonight
Choked out
No brakes down, an endless dark incline
Most of the boys won't ever cross this line
If they all want to die dead broke that's fine, that's fine
Everybody's got their limits, nobody's found mine
Crowd screaming like hounds at the heat of the chase
All the colors of the rainbow flood my face
I lift right off into space
I can see the future, it's a real dark place
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out
Choked out1Embed
