Have You Passed Through This Night? Lyrics
This great evil
Where's it come from?
How'd it steal into the world?
What seed, what root did it grow from?
Who's doing this?
Who's killing us?
Robbing us of life and light
Mocking us with the sight of what we might've known?
Does our ruin benefit the earth?
Does it help the grass to grow or the sun to shine?
Is this darkness in you, too?
Have you passed through this night?3Embed
