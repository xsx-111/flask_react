Aikea-Guinea LyricsWhen he pushes away
‘Cause he really had a hard day
Dream (nightmare)
When he pushes away
‘Cause he really had a bad day
Please hold me (nightmare)
Oh, please
Breathes
When he pushes away
‘Cause he really had a bad day
Dream, did dream
As he pushes away (men)
Is he catching every jug bar
Far (so far)
So lover
Please bend astray
I’ve got a marvelous drunk
As he plays look away (yeah)
Is she judging every jug bar
Far (from home )
So lover
Please bend astray
I’ve got this marvelous drunk
Oh, please
Breathes
As she breathes, she knew
He’s squeezing every jug bar
Far from home
Oh, please
Breathes
As she breathes, she can see
That she’s judging every jug bar
Far
My god
As he pushes away (men)
‘Cause he really had a hard day
Dream (yes drunk)
So lover
Please bend astray
I’ve got a marvelous drunk
As he plays look away (yeah)
Is he catching every jug bar
Far from home (yes drunk)
So lover
Please bend astray
I’ve got a marvelous drunk
As he breathes, look away (men)
‘Cause he really had a nightmare
Dream (yes drunk)
So lover
Please bend astray
I’ve got a marvelous drunk
As he plays look away (yeah)
Is he catching every jug bar
Far from home (yes drunk)
So lover
Please bend astray
I’ve got a marvelous drunk
Oh, please
Breathes
When she breathes, then she knows
That he really had a bad day
Dream, did dream
Please
Breathes
As she breathes, then she knows
That she’s judging every jug bar
Far from homeEmbed
