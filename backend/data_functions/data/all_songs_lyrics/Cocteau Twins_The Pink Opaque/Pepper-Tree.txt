Pepper-Tree LyricsY’gotta yatta yatta gain his lies
Oh, pepper-tree
Oh no, no, knots and no no walls
Make bruised, she
Y’gotta yatta yatta gain his lies
Cold ember skies
Oh no, no, knots and no no walls
Great news of Jack
Days to weeks
Cold pepper-tree
Heart sins swallowed whole
Hearts leave you searching
Y’gotta yatta yatta gain his lies
Cold ember skies
No, no, no, knots and no no walls
Make noise, he’ll die
Days, weeks
Cold pepper-tree
Heart sins swallowed whole
Hearts leave you searching
Heart sins swallowed whole
Hearts leave you searching
Y’gotta yatta yatta gain his lies
Cold ember skies
No, no, no, knots and no no walls
Make lonesome tiesEmbed
