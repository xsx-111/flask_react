Wax and Wane LyricsCarrion grows
More foul we find
The devil bites dirty
We wax and we wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
Licking our wounds
The devil bites dirty
Reckoning we'll taste
We wax and we wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
And if you got any children
The devil bites dirty
Up to the wee wanes
We laugh in their faces
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane
The devil bites dirty, we wax and wane2Embed
