Hitherto LyricsHitherto your heavy side
I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep
Physical and cynical
I must have left her bloody holes
Hitherto your heavy side (hitherto your heavy side)
I couldn’t tell your head is so deep (I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep)
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep
Physical and cynical
I must have left her bloody holes
Hitherto your heavy side (hitherto your heavy side)
I couldn’t tell your head is so deep (I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep)
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
Hitherto your heavy side
I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep
Physical and cynical
I must have left her bloody holes
Hitherto your heavy side (hitherto your heavy side)
I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep (I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep)
Physical and cynical (physical and cynical)
I must have left her bloody holes (I must have left her bloody holes)
Hitherto your heavy side (hitherto your heavy side)
I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep (I couldn’t work out why your head is so deep)1Embed
