From the Flagstones LyricsAt times I've seen you from the oriel
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
At times I’ve seen you from the oriel
At times I've seen you from the balustrade
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
(Another floor, another long hall)
(You can’t cajole)
You can’t cajole
And you can’t cajole
And you can’t cajole
(And can’t cajole)
At times I've seen you from the oriel
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
At times I’ve seen you from the flagstones
(Another me, another cold doubt)
(You may cajole)
You may cajole
And you may cajole
And you may cajole
(You may cajole)
You may cajole
And you may cajole
And you may cajole
(You may cajole)
You may cajole
And you may cajole
And you may cajole
(And may cajole)
At times I’ve seen you from the balustrade
At times I’ve seen you from the flagstones
At times I’ve seen you from the balustradeEmbed
