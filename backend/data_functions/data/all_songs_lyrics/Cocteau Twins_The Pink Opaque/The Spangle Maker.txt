The Spangle Maker LyricsIt’s the droplet
It’s the droplet on my tooth
It’s the spangle
It is the spangle maker
All for that
All for that work that showered it
She is his
She’s a spangle baby
Unless they suffer
Droplet singing, broken-winded
Broken-winded, whistling
Singing, broken-winded
Broken-winded, whistling
It’s the droplet
It’s the droplet on my tooth
It’s the spangle
It is the spangle maker
I’m glad they chose the
Droplet singing, broken-winded
Broken-winded, whistling
Singing, broken-winded
Broken-winded, whistling
It’s the droplet
It’s the droplet on my tooth
It’s the spangle
It is the spangle maker
I’m glad they chose the
Droplet singing, broken-winded
Broken-winded, whistling
Singing, broken-winded
Broken-winded, whistling
It’s the droplet
It’s the droplet on my tooth
It’s the spangle
It is the spangle maker
It’s fallen, but it hadn’t fallen there yeah
It scattered, yeah, it didn’t fall, yeah, yeah
All life is just the droplet singing
Broken-winded whistling
It’s fallen, but it hadn’t fallen there yeah
It scattered, yeah, it didn’t fall, yeah, yeah
All life is just the droplet singing
Broken-winded whistling
It’s fallen, but it hadn’t fallen there yeah
It scattered, yeah, and didn’t fall, yeah, yeah
All life is just the droplet singing
Broken-winded whistlingEmbed
