Lorelei Lyrics
Can’t look out
Can’t look in
You just might
Get yourself kissed right
Out of the doors
In the light
We’ll make love
And then we can go

And we can go
And we can go

We’re covered by the sacred fire
Then you cut me to, you cut me to the bone

Can’t look out
Can’t look in
You just might
Get yourself kissed right
Out of the doors
In the light
We’ll make love
And then we can go
And we can go (and we can go)
And we can go (and we can go)
And we can go (and we can go)
And we can go (and we can go)

And we’re covered by the sacred fire
Then you cut me to, you cut me to the bone

Da-dow, da-dow, da-dow, da-dow, oh
Da-dow, da-dow, da-dow, da-dow
Da-dow, da-dow, da-dow
Da-dow, da-dow, da-dow, da-dow

We’re covered by the sacred fire
Then you cut me to, you cut me to the bone

Can’t look in
Guilty boy
Guilty girl
‘Cause you’re both cursed
Out of the doors
In the light
We’ll make love
And we can go
Can’t look in
Guilty boy
Guilty girl
‘Cause you’re both
‘Cause you’re both cursed
Out of the doors
In the light
We’ll make love
And we can go1Embed
