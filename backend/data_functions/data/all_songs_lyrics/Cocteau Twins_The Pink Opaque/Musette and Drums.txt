Musette and Drums LyricsTragedienne
You were fast for a genius
Humoredienne
What a genius to all
For this song
I would favor a genius
Strawberries
She turned thirteen, oh
Tragedienne
Humoredienne
Tragedienne
Humoredienne
Tragedienne
Humoredienne
Musette and drums
Our answer genius
Strawberries
She turned thirteen, oh
For this song
I would favor a genius
Strawberries
She turned thirteen, oh
Tragedienne
Humoredienne
Tragedienne
Humoredienne
Tragedienne
Humoredienne
Musette and drums
They are genius too
They are genius too
Musette and drums
They are genius too
They are genius tooEmbed
