Gradated Grey Lyrics
My car radio's playing a song
That makes me feel very strange
It's taking so long for the gradation
Of the gray-scale
A landscape like I've never seen
As far as my eyes can see
Out on the road, I've seen so many shades
Shades of gray
Now I'm back in the tunnel again

Every minute, every second
I can feel it getting closer... 

My car radio's playing a song
That makes me feel very strange
It's taking so long for the gradation
Of the gray-scale
A landscape like I've never seen
As far as my eyes can see
Out on the road, I've seen so many shades
Shades of gray
Now I'm back in the tunnel again

Every minute, every second
I can feel it getting closer... 
(Speeding on
To where the gray meets white)1Embed
