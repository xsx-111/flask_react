Seoul Music Lyrics
An example of life in old Korea
The girl wouldn't let me take her picture
Dongdaemon
Kimpo Airport
An old man with a stick, in white baji chogori
With a black katsu on his head
The taxi driver kept asking if I wanted a woman
ハイウェイは滑走路
Myongdong St. has no neon signs
Roadside pillboxes with armed police in front
国の花はムクゲ
There is a curfew from midnight till 4
ハイカラな明洞娘
From Busan you can see Tsushima
The speed limit for passenger cars is 37 miles per hour
夜間の道路上での駐車は駐車灯を点灯すること
Korea has air raid drill once a month
東京―ソウル間は約二時間
People over 46 speak JapaneseEmbed
