Key Lyrics
I feel so bad, my spirit's weak
Somebody please, what's wrong with me?

(What do you see?)
I see a forest
(What kind?)
There's a light in the darkness
(Whatcha gonna do?)
I wanna walk in it
(What you say?)

I feel so bad, my body's weak
Somebody please, what's wrong with me?

(What do you see?)
I see a moth
(What kind?)
It looks like my lover
(Whatcha gonna do?)
I wanna chase it
(何言ってんお?)
I feel so bad, my mind is weak
Somebody please, what's wrong with me?

(What do you see?)
I see a key on the ground
(What kind?)
Just a key, but it's shining
(Whatcha gonna do?)
I wanna pick it up
(What you say?)

I've got a feeling something's happening
It gives me a thrill but it's also very
Frightening
Frightening

I feel so bad, my spirit's weak
Somebody please, what's wrong with me?

(What do you see?)
I see a long wall
(What kind?)
It has no end
(Whatcha gonna do?)
Use the key to open it
(What you say?)
I've got a feeling something's happening
It gives me a thrill but it's also very
Frightening
