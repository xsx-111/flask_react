Pure Jam Lyrics 
 
This must be the ugliest
Piece of bread I've ever eaten 
 
 
 
This must be the ugliest
Piece of bread I've ever eatenThis must be the ugliest
Piece of bread I've ever eatenThis must be the ugliest piece of bread I've ever eaten
Wrapped in a foil-like substance
It's an unidentified object
Shapelessly square
God, it's so ugly
ジャムでしょ
God, it's so ugly
ジャムでしょ
I wonder why
Maybe the answer lies
(それジャムでしょ、どぞ)
In the thickness or the sizeEmbed
