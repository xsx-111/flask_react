Stairs LyricsIn the shadows by the wall
The stairs go on forever
They could be steel
They could be stone
They could even be paper
Are they leading up or down?
The stairs go on forever
Crowds of people in confusion
Are they moving in or out?
Are they moving, are they still?
The stairs go on forever
People going up stairs
People going down stairs
Ascending people
Descending peopleEmbed
