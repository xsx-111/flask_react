Housebreaker LyricsWhen I first met you
You were not house trained
A backwoods trier
The world's your oyster
Your time is mine
What's yours is mine, all mine
There's no honour among thieves
So we worked together
Varied rich and famous crime
Had your motives I had mine
For a soul to find
A little piece rub off to mine
Trinkets, memorabilia
Diamonds for the taking
One man's treasure never meant a thing
When I was housebreaking
Took a buckshot landing
My most famous client
Must have lost it in the fall
Came away empty handed
For a soul to find
A little piece rub off to mine
When I first met you
You were not house trained
A backwoods trier
The world's your oyster
Your time is mine
What's yours is mine, all mine
When I first met you
I was not house trainedEmbed
