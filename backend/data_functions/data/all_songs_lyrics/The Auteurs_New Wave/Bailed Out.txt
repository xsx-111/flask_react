Bailed Out LyricsYour star is descending round here blindly
Tell your dancing daughter that there's no room on the wing
We can bitch, but it ain't tinsel town, hey! Starchild
Can't dance, left out on a useless limb
This party will start
To drag you down
Slap your face
And pull your hair
Bailed out, bailed out
Bailed out, this skin is shed
Bailed out, bailed out
Bailed out, this thing is dead
I was in traction, started off smiling, couldn't help laughing
I was astounded when whey caught you unaware
And some missionary said that this week we've got to shoot all the dancing girls
And then replace them with satellites instead
This party will start
To drag you down
Slap your face
And pull your hair
Bailed out, bailed out
Bailed out, this skin is shed
Bailed out, bailed out
Bailed out, this thing is dead
Like to see something change
Around here, around there
Bailed out, bailed out
Bailed out, this skin is shed
Bailed out, bailed out
Bailed out, this thing is deadEmbed
