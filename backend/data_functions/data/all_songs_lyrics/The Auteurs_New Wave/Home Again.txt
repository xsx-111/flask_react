Home Again LyricsHome again
Housesitting again
Rifling through
Your possessions and stuff
Things that you
Are ashamed of
Home again
Housesitting again
Looking through photos
At the back of your drawer
The way that you looked
When you were small
Safe there's no prowler
Lover
No creeper in your lane
It's better than drugs
It's cool
To be in your home again
Home again
Housesitting again
It's just a little bit far
From the main crowd
Reading your poems
When you're not around
Home again
Housesitting again
Hospital letters
A clinic on hold
A test that you took
Awaiting results
Safe there's no prowler
Lover
No creeper in your lane
It's better than drugs
It's cool
To be in your home again
Safe there's no prowler
Lover
No creeper in your lane
It's better than drugs
It's cool
To be in your home again
To be in your home again
To be in your
Home againEmbed
