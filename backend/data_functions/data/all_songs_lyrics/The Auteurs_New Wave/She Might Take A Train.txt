She Might Take A Train LyricsNeed a line for a life
Need to get some advice
Whoa, oh
Column inches are brief
Need to find some relief
Then we must talk
She might take a train
She might take a train anyway
She might take a, she might take a
Possessions bar none, mean nothing at all
You can have them all
If I try to explain like a suicide
They miss their aim
She might take a train
She might take a train anyway
She might take a, she might take a
She might take a train
She might take a train anyway
She might take a, she might take aEmbed
