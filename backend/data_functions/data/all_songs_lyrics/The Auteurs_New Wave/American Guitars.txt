American Guitars LyricsThey were failing dutifully
If you're going to fail at all
Failing came more easily
Than it did to us all
And I wanted to be there
See them again
It was easy to see they were
The best band to be in
I gave up drugging
When you spiked my drink
Stopped freeloading
When I could not get in
I gave up singing
When I was told I could not dance
Knew my place in the world
When I heard them start
American guitars
American guitars
American guitars
American guitars
Woke up Sunday morning
With a hole the size of my pool
Couldn't believe I'd grown so ugly
Couldn't believe I'd been so cruel
I should've set back
Thought about their past
East coast to west coast
How they'd struggled for their art
Some people were born to write
Some people were born to dance
Thought I knew my place in the world
Thought I knew my art
Glad to be there
See them begin
It was easy to see
They were the best band to be in
American guitars
American guitars
American guitars
