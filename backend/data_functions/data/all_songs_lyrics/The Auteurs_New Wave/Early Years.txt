Early Years LyricsEarly years were a shroud man
Only a grey cloud shot in the dark
Hanging out with your dad
His plans for revenge
In some hick-town caravan park
Never keep a good one
Never keep a good one
Never keep a good one down
Early years were a dreadnought
Waiting to tread board
And my work down the pan
Hanging round by the back door
One foot in the stage door
Some disaffected fly-by-man
Never keep a good one
Never keep a good one
Never keep a good one down
Got wired by a cable
Got wild on a table
Scared the shit out of me
All for the free state
The snow and the greasepaint
I left the singing family
Never keep a good one
Never keep a good one
Never keep a good one downEmbed
