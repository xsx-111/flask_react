Junk Shop Clothes LyricsJunk shop clothes will get you nowhere
They're out of season
Betrayal without treason
Junk shop clothes will get you nowhere
There is one reason
Why your mother was a seamstress
Chaim Soutine
Never spent a thrift shop dime
In his life
Lenny Bruce
Never walked in a dead man's shoes
Even for one night
Junk shop clothes will get you nowhere
No summer pavilion
No shooting season
Junk shop clothes will get you...
For the rest of your life
You'll be drunk the rest of your life
And the sun
Never shone
On your frame
Pale and wan
Junk shop clothes will get you nowhere
No summer pavilion
No shooting season
Junk shop clothes will get you...
For the rest of your life
You'll be drunk the rest of your life
And the sun
Never shone
On your frame
Pale and wanEmbed
