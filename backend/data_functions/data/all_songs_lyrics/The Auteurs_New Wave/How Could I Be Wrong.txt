How Could I Be Wrong LyricsIn my role as a groundbreaker
As a pallbearer uh huh
In my past life as a benefactor
My lost years as an actor
The stars are brighter
Are lighter than they have been for years
Those stars are tighter
At one time I've never seen so many stars
How could I be wrong?
How could I be
How could I be
How could I be wrong?
In my role as a peacemaker
As a lifesaver uh huh
In your room as a plan hatcher
A soul snatcher
The stars are brighter
Are lighter than they have been for years
Those stars are tighter
At one time I've never seen so many stars
How could I be wrong?
How could I be
How could I be
How could I be wrong?
How could I be wrong?
How could I be
How could I be
How could I be wrong?Embed
