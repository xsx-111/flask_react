Show Girl Lyrics
I took a showgirl for my bride
Thought my life would be right, yeah
Took her bowling, got her high
Got myself a showgirl bride
Took a job on the side
In a health shop, keeps me well now
Got my mantra for life
Got my karma, and a showgirl bride

All my life
All her life
All our life
I married a showgirl
That's for life
I married a showgirl
That's for life

She can't work in the wintertime
I can't work anytime now
Go to libraries all the while
Looking for a notice, bide my time

All my life
All her life
All our life
I married a showgirl
That's for life
I married a showgirl
That's for life
I took a showgirl for my bride
Sprinkled stardust on my wife
Took her bowling, got her high
Got myself a showgirl bride
Got myself a showgirl bride
Don't you recognise us?
Don't you recognise us?Embed
