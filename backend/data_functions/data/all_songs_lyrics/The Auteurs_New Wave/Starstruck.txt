Starstruck Lyrics
First child and a showbiz son
Always hide where you come from
Mother got out rehab and I was born
I was starstruck when I was young
It's never too soon to tread the boards
I was in Vaudeville at age five
My career took its first nosedive
I've been starstruck all my life

Starstruck
Starstruck over you
Starstruck
I'm struck dumb by you
Starstruck
I struck out my luck
I was always starstruck

Can't get an agent for a child star
My act effete and failing
So I moved to, the old backlot
Where I exercise daily
Starstruck
Starstruck over you
Starstruck
I'm struck dumb by you
Starstruck
I struck out my luck
I was always..

So you're between
A peak time show
I hear you're now married
She was born to be seen
Not to be carried

Starstruck
Starstruck over you
Starstruck
I'm stuck here with you
Starstruck
I struck out my luck
I was always starstruck
I was always starstruck1Embed
