Valet Parking Lyrics
Never saw your driver's eyes
Or me on parking street
We were planning your demise
Your chauffeur's tired
But you're still on heat

Downtown
You're burning down
I'm sick of parking cars
Sick of parking cars
Parking cars, parking cars

There are only
Two people here
Who are worthy of your pool and your palace
So stand down now

Stand down
You're standing down
I'm sick of parking cars
Sick of parking cars
Parking cars, parking cars
Downtown
You're burning down
I'm sick of parking cars
Sick of parking cars
Parking cars, parking cars

Never thought I'd see the day
When your blue face turned grey
Got no guts, got no fame
Your epitaph sorely missed
Your unfaithful slave

I'm sick of parking cars
Sick of parking cars
Parking cars, parking carsEmbed
