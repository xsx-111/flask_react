A Change Is Gonna Come Lyrics
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like river, baby
I've been running ever since

It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there,  baby
Beyond the sky

It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come

Well, I go down to my brother
And I say
Brother, help me please, yeah
But he winds up
Knocking me back down
On my knees, yeah
Yeah!
There'd been times where I thought I
Couldn't last for long
Now I think I'm able
To carry on

It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will
It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change gonna come
Well, it's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
Change
I know it, I know it
I know, I know, I know
Change, change gonna come3Embed
