Talk on the Street LyricsOh mama you lie in ruin
Can't you see what you've done
Well I've been there before
What's this war that you won
Oh mama you walk this way
And I'm crying inside
Well I've been there before
And you know that it's time
And everybody's talking
But you never let them know
Yes I can hear them talking
Everyone knows
That's there's talking on the streets
Remember the days
When there's no one to defeat
Follow me down
To the mountain of the sun
Forgetting the end
As your new life has begun
Look mama the light is low
And the darkness near
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
And the night's what you fear
Look, someone, they follow us
And they're all undone
Yes everyone is looking for me and you
And the war has begun
And everybody's talking
But you never let em know
Yes I can hear them talking
Everyone knows
That's there's talking on the streets
Remember the days
When there's no one to defeat
Follow me down
To the mountain of the sun
Forgetting the end
As your new life has begun
And everybody's talking
And you never let them know
Yes I can hear them talking
And you never let them know7Embed
