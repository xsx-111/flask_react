Flower Power Lyrics
She is a lady, comes from all around
She's many places, but she's homeward bound
And now she walks kinda funny
I think she knows
Day by day by day
Our love grows
She's a lantern in the night
She's outta sight

Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Hey

Turn to night, firelight
Star shines in her eye
Makes me feel like I'm alive
She's outta sight, yeah
Aw yeah
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
She's outta sight, outta sight

Electric gold our love with tender care
Hills of satin grass and maiden's fair
Now she rides through the night
On a silver storm
Sword in hand
Our fate's torn
She's a sparrow of the dawn
Our love is born
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
Ma ma ma
Hey

Turn to night, firelight
Star shines in her eye
Makes me feel like I'm alive
She's outta sight, yeah
Aw yeah
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
She's outta sight, outta sight

Yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah


As the days pass by my mind
Are the wrong, the right
You are my sunshine
And as the night begins to die
We are the morning birds that sing against the sky3Embed
