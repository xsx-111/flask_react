Safari Song Lyrics
Ah yeah

Oh, lady, when you come on down
Won't you come on down
I said, to my town?
Oh, mama, when you come on down
Won't you come on down
I said, to my home?
Oh, lady, won't you move my way?
Can't you move my way?
I'm getting hazy
Oh, mama, when you give your lovin'
When you give your love
You drive me crazy

Ah, mama, what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart?
Ah, mama, what you gotta say
About that love in your heart?
Oh, mama, when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'?
Oh, mama, what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart?
See, mama, gotta feel your everything
I feel your everything
I really wanna know
See, mama, when you shine, you're shinin' bright
Give your given right
I really want our love to grow
See, mama, when your heart is in its place
See that smilin' face
It's all I wanna do
See, mama, every time that you are near
It's when you're gonna fear
You're never wanna come back home

Ah, mama, what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart?
Ah, mama, what you gotta say
About that love in your heart?
Oh, mama, when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'?
Oh, mama, what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart?

Do you remember what I said
When I got down on my knees?
Gotta get your lovin', baby
Loving's all I need
Don't make me beg now, baby
Don't make me bleed
I gave you all a man could give
And you still walked out on me

Ah, mama, what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart?
Ah, mama, what you gotta say
About that love in your heart?
Oh, mama, when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'?
Oh, mama, what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart?

Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Your heart
Lovin'
Burnin'
Fire
