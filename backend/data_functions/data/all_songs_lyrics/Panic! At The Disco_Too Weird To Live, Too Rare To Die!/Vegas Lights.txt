Vegas Lights Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two, one

Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh!
Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh!

Oh, if you only knew what we've been up to
I guarantee you'd keep it secret
So give it to me now, we're lost in a dream now
Do it (Five, four, three, two) one more time

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend, the deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations, sensation
We're winning till the curtain's coming down
Ain't it so, ain't it so perfect?
Our cynical minds will make it totally worth it
So give it to me now, we're lost in a dream now
Do it (Five, four, three, two) one more time

In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend, the deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations, sensation
We're winning till the curtain's coming down

Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh!
Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one
Whoa-oh!

And we're all not here for nothing
And we're bored with looking good
We gotta be starting something
Would you change it if you could?
And we're all not here for nothing
(Would you change it if you could?)
And we're bored with looking good
(Would you change it if you could?)
We gotta be starting something
(Would you change it if you could?)
Would you change it if you could?
In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend, the deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations, sensation
We're winning till the curtain's coming down
In the Vegas lights
Where villains spend the weekend, the deep end
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
The Vegas lights
The lies and affectations, sensation
We're winning till the curtain's coming down

Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one! Whoa-oh!
We're swimming with the sharks until we drown
Whoa-oh! Five, four, three, two, one! Whoa-oh!
We're winning till the curtain's coming down20Embed
