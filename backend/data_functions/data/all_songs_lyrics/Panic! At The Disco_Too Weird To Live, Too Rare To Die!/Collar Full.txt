Collar Full Lyrics
We've waited so damn long, we're sick and tired
I won't leave any doubt or stone unturned
I've got a collar full of chemistry from your company
So maybe tonight, I'll be the libertine

Oh, show me your love (Your love), your love (Your love)
Give me more but it's not enough (Your love)
Show me your love (Your love), your love (Your love)
Before the world catches up (Your love)
'Cause there's always time for second guesses
I don't want to know
If you're gonna be the death of me
That's how I want to go

You've got it all worked out with so little time
Memories that I'd black out if you were mine
You've got a pocket full of reasons why you're here tonight
So, baby, tonight just be the death of me

Oh, show me your love (Your love), your love (Your love)
Give me more but it's not enough (Your love)
Show me your love (Your love), your love (Your love)
Before the world catches up (Your love)
'Cause there's always time for second guesses
I don't want to know
If you're gonna be the death of me
That's how I want to go
Oh show me your love, your love
Give me more but it's not enough
Show me your love, your love
Before the world catches up

Oh, show me your love (Your love), your love (Your love)
Give me more but it's not enough (Your love)
Show me your love (Your love), your love (Your love)
Before the world catches up (Your love)
Show me your love
Show me your love21Embed
