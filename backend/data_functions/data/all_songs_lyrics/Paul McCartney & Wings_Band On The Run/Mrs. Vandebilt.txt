Mrs. Vandebilt Lyrics
Down in the jungle, living in a tent
You don't use money, you don't pay rent
You don't even know the time, but you don't mind

Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho

When your light is on the blink, you never think of worrying
What's the use of worrying?
When your bus has left the stop, you'd better drop your hurrying
What's the use of hurrying?

Leave me alone, Mrs. Vandebilt
I've got plenty of time of my own
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of anything?

Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of anything?

Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho

When your pile is on the wane
You don't complain of robbery
Run away, don't bother me
What's the use of worrying?
No use!
What's the use of anything?

Leave me alone, Mrs. Washington
I've done plenty of time on my own
What's the use of worrying?
What's the use of hurrying?
No use!
What's the use of anything?
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho
Ho, hey ho1Embed
