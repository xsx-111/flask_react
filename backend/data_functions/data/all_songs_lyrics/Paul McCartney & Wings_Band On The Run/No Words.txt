No Words Lyrics
You want to give your love away, and end up giving nothing
I'm not surprised that your black eyes are gazing
You say that love is everything, and what we need the most of
I wish you knew, that's just how true my love was

No words for my love

Your burning love, sweet burning love
It's deep inside
You must not hide your burning love
Sweet burning love, your burning love

You want to turn your head away, and someone's thinking of you
I wish you'd see it's only me--I love you

No words for my loveEmbed
