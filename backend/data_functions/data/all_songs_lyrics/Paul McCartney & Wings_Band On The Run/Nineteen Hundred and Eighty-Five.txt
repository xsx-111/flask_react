Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five Lyrics
Oh, no one ever left alive In nineteen hundred and eighty five
Will ever do
She may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine 'cause I got you
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind

Shake it
Baby don't break it

Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh

Oh, my mama said the time would come
When I would find myself in love with you
I didn't think, I never dreamed
That I would be around to see it all come true
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady gets behind
Woo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Woo ooh ooh

Oh, no one ever left alive in nineteen hundred and eighty five
Will ever do
Well, she may be right, she may be fine
She may get love, but she won't get mine
Because I got you
Oh, I
Oh, I
Well, I just can't get enough of that sweet stuff
My little lady left behind
