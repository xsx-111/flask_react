Mamunia Lyrics
Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh

The rain comes falling from the sky
To fill the stream that fills the sea
And that's where life began for you and me
So the next time you see rain it ain't bad
Don't complain, it rains for you
The next time you see L.A. rain clouds
Don't complain, it rains for you and me

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh
It might have been a bright blue day
But rain clouds had to come this way
They're watering everything that they can see
A seed is waiting in the earth
For rain to come and give him birth
It's all he really needs to set him free
So the next time you see L.A. rain clouds
Don't complain, it rains for you

So lay down your umbrellas
Strip off your plastic macs
You've never felt the rain my friend
Till you've felt it running down your back

So the next time you see rain, it ain't bad
Don't complain, it rains for you
The next time you see L.A. rain clouds
Don't complain, it rains for you and me

Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh
Mamunia, mamunia
Oh oh oh oh1Embed
