Silly Sam Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm-mm, mmm

Silly Sam, what a man
Not a fan, oh yeah, damn
You play so many games
Tic-tac-toe, Mario
Dominoes, and Uno

If you play your cards right, it’ll be alright
And if you don’t you’re in Trouble for Life

Sorry don’t live here, it ain’t sincere
Patty cake, Patty Cake, fuck Patty, Patty fake
Get a Clue, Guess Who, yes, you, that’s who
Checkers, Chess too, player one, I'm a player too

Silly Sam, what a man
Not a fan, oh yeah, damn
You play so many games
Tic-tac-toe, Mario (And Luigi)Embed
