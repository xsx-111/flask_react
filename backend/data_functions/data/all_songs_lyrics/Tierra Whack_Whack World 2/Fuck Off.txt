Fuck Off Lyrics
Well, honey, I’ve been so sick, so sad
Whenever I’m happy it makes you mad
I hope your ass breaks out in a rash
You remind me of my deadbeat dad

Fuck off! Go 'way!
Yeah, fuck off!
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, honey, I’ve been so sick, so sad
Whenever I’m happy it makes you mad
I hope your ass breaks out in a rash
You remind me of my deadbeat dad

You broke, you ain’t no good for me at all
I wrote this 'cause I feel ten feet tall
I know you don’t ever wanna see me ball
Ice cold, in a coat, baby, I won't thaw
Okay, baby, I'm gonna be alright
No way, you ain't even my ****in' type
Olay, did me dirty, ain’t leave no wipes
No way, tell the truth, won't believe no lies
Both ways, I was blind, ain't seen no signs
Okay, baby, I’m gonna-2Embed
