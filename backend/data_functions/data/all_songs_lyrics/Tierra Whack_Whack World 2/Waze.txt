Waze Lyrics
I was lost, ’til I found my way, yeah
You can never say "I love you" too many times a day
I ain’t have no GPS (One, two, three, four)
When I was sick ain’t nobody go to CVS (Say i-it once more, uh)
They just wanna see me stressed (One, two, uh, three, four, uh)
They don’t wanna see me blessed (Say it baby once more, uh)
They cannot take away what I worked for
I know that I am worth mo-o-o-ore, yeah1Embed
