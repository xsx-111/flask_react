Hookers Lyrics
I'm tired of trying love
Don't try to buy my love
I'm tired of crying out
You tried to buy my love, my love, my love

Money won't make me stay, I got my own paper
Move cause you're in my way
Why you gotta ruin my day, my day?
Money won't make me stay, I got my own paper
Move cause you're in my way
Why you wanna ruin my day, my day?

Ching,-ching-ching-ching (Why you wanna?)
Ding-a-ling ding ding (So tired of ya)
Ching-ching-ching-ching (Why you wanna?)
Ding-a-ling ding ding (So tired of ya)
