Hungry Hippo Lyrics
He likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thank you, I designed it"
Not your average girl
He needed swag and I provided
'Vided, open up and bite it
Bite it, open up and bite it
Bite it, open up and bite it
Bite it, shut up, boy, bite it

He donâ€™t know no better, yeah
Heard he got that cheddar, yeah
Now that boy with me
He gon' spend it better, yeah
Put him on that Alyx
Gucci on his wallet
Rick Owens on me
They think I'm his stylist
Bite it

He likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thank you, I designed it"
Not your average girlEmbed
