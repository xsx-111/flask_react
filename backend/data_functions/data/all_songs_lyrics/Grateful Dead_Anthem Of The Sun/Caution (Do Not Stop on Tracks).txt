Caution (Do Not Stop on Tracks) Lyrics
I went down one day
I went down to see a gypsy woman just one
Day, yes I did
I wanna find out
What's wrong with me and my baby
We ain't been getting down like we used to do
I mean it's pretty good now
But there was a time when it didn't work out
Too well
I went down to see this gypsy woman, you
Understand
And I told her my story
I told her what was going on
And she turned to me and she said
All you need
All you need
All you need
All you gotta have
Just a touch, that's all you gotta have
Just a touch of mojo hand
And it feels pretty goodEmbed
