Alligator Lyrics
Sleepy alligator in the noonday sun
Lying by the river just like he usually done (oh no)
Call for his whiskey
He can call for his tea
Call all he want to (now) but he can't call me

Oh no, well I been there before
(there before)
And I'm not coming back around
There no more
(there no more)
Hold up, waiting for a windy day

Creepy alligator coming all around the bend
Talking 'bout the times when we was mutual friends
I'll check my memory and I will check it quick
Yes I will (yes I will)
I'll check it running some old kind of trick

Whoa no
Oh no, well I been there before
And I ain't coming back around there no more
No I'm not
(Burn down the Fillmore, gas the Avalon)
(Turn on the hippies, leave the heat alone)
(Bird shit over on the avenue)

Riding down the river in an old canoe
A bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
Out of the river all ugly and green
The biggest old alligator that I have ever seen
Teeth big and pointy and his eyes were bugging out
(were bugging out)
Contract the union, put the beggars to rout
Screaming and yelling, he was picking his chops
He never run, he just stumbles and hops
Just out of prison on six dollars bail
Mumblin' bitches and wagging his tail

Come on everybody
Get up and dance, it won't ruin ya
Alligator running round my door
Alligator running round my door
Alligator running round my door
Alligator running round my door
Alligator's creepy friend
Been crawling round my cabin floor
Been comin' around to bother me some more
Alligator!
