Dorothy Lyrics
Come down in a  house
No sailor, no mast
No rope they would only have hung before
The disorder of the roof around my feet

Hall in my head for the 
A nail presses my skull
And all the  are mangled
You could only make me shape 
Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heaven
Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heaven
Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heaven
Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heaven

Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heaven
Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heaven
Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heaven
Don't cry children
Mother's gone to heavenEmbed
