The Ray LyricsShe is a husk to be blown away by the wind
Has no hopes, no escape routes
Mould her with her calloused hands and give her a magic seed
Something to call her very own
Make her a conjurer
Make her the god of someone's world
Her brain is a web of chains
Put there to hold her down
Each heartbeat spills the sticky shadows
A negative of every life
That throws its light into her shape
She's spinning it for daddyEmbed
