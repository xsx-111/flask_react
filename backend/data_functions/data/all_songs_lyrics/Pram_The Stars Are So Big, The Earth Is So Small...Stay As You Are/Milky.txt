Milky Lyrics
I'm shutting down
Waiting for the right wave to crash over me
What I am is yours, dear
And there the shadows start to try and touch
Whose hands will curse you

A malignant tower
Could poison or comfort you
Just when I think Iâ€™ve learned to like my own voice
You frown
And I'm back with her menaceEmbed
