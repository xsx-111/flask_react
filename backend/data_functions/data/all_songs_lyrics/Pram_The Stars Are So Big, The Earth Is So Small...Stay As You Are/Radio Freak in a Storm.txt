Radio Freak in a Storm Lyrics
When you speak your voice goes to outer space
My words are typhoons, who suck the light out of a star
And all the satellites are Russian spies in fifty suits
Tampering my coat and into theories

With bleeps and hiss the sky eyes talk to themselves
Too many screens flicker and I walked out
A radio freak in a storm
At the edge of the downs
With braindead smell of my cells disconnecting

At this mind of a telescope I squirm like a bug
Under scrutiny under gloves that's thick for short-sighted distant objects
Whirl on my spinning chair
I can't defy gravity
The centre of the universe is in my solid blood cellsEmbed
