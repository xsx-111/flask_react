Loredo Venus Lyrics
I guess he just walked out of the frames
Ranges on his jacket set alight by the split fuel from his ship
And there's a  around his feet
Cast him in iron shadows cutting over the grass

He held me in his arms
And threw me high up where
He could show me
All of the stars
All of the planets
In a big world of air

Nobody saw him here but me
Lost in my throbbing brain caught like a subtle bird
Gravity killed him very slow
Started at his feet and ran like ivy round his limbsEmbed
