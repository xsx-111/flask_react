All My Life Lyrics
I've waited all my life
For you
And now
You're here
You never knew me though
I knew you long ago
Your name has been my life
Always
And now
I'm yours

My heart and I agreed
To wait
For you
I'm glad
It seems so long ago
Jive that i never knew
Time never will exist
For me
And you
AgainEmbed
