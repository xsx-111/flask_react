What Reason Could I Give? LyricsWhat reason could I give, to live
Only that I love you
How many times must I die for love
Only when I’m without you
Where will the clouds be
If not in the sky
When I die?
What reason could I give, to live
Only that I love you
How many times
Must I die for love
Only when I’m without you
Where will the clouds be
If not in the sky
When I die?
What reason could I give, to live
Only that I will love youEmbed
