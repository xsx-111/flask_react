Girl on the Wing LyricsOne wound up punch of intuition
Lays flat my whole take on us
You're the girl on the wing of a barnstormer
The tidal rabbit who came of age before her time
We could have been so good-natured
If I'd relented when you insisted
But we've been backed against
All nature's walls far too long
You felt abandoned by me
I recall the sunshine as you were melting
And though the comedy softens the fall
They still hear us with their ears to the wall
I sold all my evil motives
No icicles stuck in my hide
I'm through with riddles, I know we're little
Just help me feel warm inside
Before we take this ride and let it slide
Into the cracks where fall and winter collide
I surrender all my gall in a song of modern love
Remember you're the one who summoned me above any other kind
We could have been so good-natured
If you'd relented when I insisted
We take a week off, let the garden grow by itself
And let the gluttons fill themselves with all the worst of the gory nineties
And though the comedy softens the fall, we still fall short
Before we take this ride and let it slide
Into the cracks where fall and winter collide
I surrender all my gall in a song of modern love
Remember you're the one who summoned me above any other kind2Embed
