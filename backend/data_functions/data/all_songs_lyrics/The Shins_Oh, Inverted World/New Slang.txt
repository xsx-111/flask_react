New Slang Lyrics
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Were all in my mouth
Only I don't know how
They got out, dear
Turn me back into the pet
I was when we met
I was happier then
With no mindset

And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
Well, I'd've jumped from my trees
And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

New slang when you notice the stripes
The dirt in your fries
Hope it's right when you die
Old and bony
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
Never should have called
But my head's to the wall
And I'm lonely
And if you took to me like
A gull takes to the wind
Well, I'd've jumped from my trees
And I'd've danced like the king of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well


Godspeed all the bakers at dawn
May they all cut their thumbs
And bleed into their buns
'Til they melt away

I'm looking in on the good life
I might be doomed never to find
Without a trust, a flaming field
Am I too dumb to refine?

And if you took to me like
Well, I'd've danced like the queen of the eyesores
And the rest of our lives would've fared well

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh29Embed
