One by One All Day Lyrics
"Howdy, lem," my grandpa said with his eyes closed
Wiping the eastbound dust from his sunburned brow
A life before doubt

I smell the engine grease and mints the wind is blending
Under the moan of rotting elm in the silo floor

Down a hill of pine tree quills we made our way
To the bottom and the ferns where thick moss grows
Beside a stream

Under the rocks are snails and we can fill our pockets
And let them go one by one all day in a brand new place


You were no ordinary drain on her defenses
And she was no ordinary girl
Oh, Inverted World
If every moment of our lives
Were cradled softly
In the hands of some strange and gentle child
I'd not roll my eyes soEmbed
