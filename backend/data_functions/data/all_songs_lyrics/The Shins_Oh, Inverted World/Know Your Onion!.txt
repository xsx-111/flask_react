Know Your Onion! LyricsShut out, pimpled and angry
I quietly tied all my guts into knots
Gave up on trying to make them
I figured it'd take 'em too long to look up
And besides
It was undeniably clear to me I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we've always been
Lucked out, found my favorite record
Lying in wait at the Birmingham mall
The songs that I heard
The occasional book were the only fun I ever took
And I got on with making myself
And the trick is just making yourself
But when they're parking their cars on your chest
You've still got a view of the summer sky
To make it hurt twice when your restless body
Caves to its whims
And suddenly struggles to take flight
Three thousand miles northeast
I left all my friends at the morning bus stop
Shaking their heads
"What kinda life you dream of? You're allergic to love"
Yes I know but I must say in my own defense
It's been undeniably dear to me I don't know why
When every other part of life seemed locked behind shutters
I knew the worthless dregs we are
The selfless loving saints we are
The melting sliding dice we've always been4Embed
