Weird Divide Lyrics
Several days a month you made
The mile to my house
And had me do a stroll with you
Far below a furry moon
Our purposes crossed
The weird divide
Between our kinds

(Ooh
Ooh
Ooh)

The silver leaves of ailing trees
Took flight as we passed
So long ago
But a short time I know
It pleases me this memory
Has swollen up with age
Even time can do
Good things to you
(Ooh
Ooh
Ah)Embed
