Numb Bears Lyrics
Fishing for a friend
Can't remember when it was dark
Or the sun coming up
Far across the ocean alone
While numb bears at home
Said I could never get there
Never get there

Breaking little twigs with my feet
And underneath
Is a road that's so steep
Far across the ocean alone
While numb bears at home
Said I could never get there
But I'm already there

Already there
Already there
Already there
Already there
Already there
Already there
Already there
Already
La, la-la-la la la la la, la la, la
La, la-la-la la la la
La, la-la-la la la la la, la la, la
La, la-la-la la la la

Already there
Already there
Already there
Already there
We are already2Embed
