Six Weeks Lyrics
Slow
Slow me down
Her blood
On my bones
Let go
Lay to rest
We fall, we fall, we fall
We fall to the ground

Sleep
Sleep all night
While the young
They wait alone
So get up
Shake the rust
We crawl, we crawl, we crawl
We crawl on the ground

Alone
I fight these animals
Alone
Until I get home
A wolf
Wolf and I
We share
The same cold meal
I float on
Float on down
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all out

We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all
Ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all
Ride, we ride, we ride
We ride it all out

Alone
I fight these animals
Alone
Until I get home

Alone
I fight these animals
Alone
Until I get home
Alone
I fight these animals
Alone
Until I get home

Alone
I fight these animals
Alone
Until I get home

Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home

Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home

Coming back, I'm coming back
Coming back, I'm coming back
She follows me into the woods
Takes me home
