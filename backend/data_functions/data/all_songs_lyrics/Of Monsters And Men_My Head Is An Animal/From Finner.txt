From Finner Lyrics
We came here on his back
And we caught your eye
The salty ocean wind
Made the seagulls cry
The rocking of his house
Had me holding on
But I knew that I was safe
From there on out

And the waves that hit his face
Marked the past
And the the furrows on his skin
Oh, how time goes fast

And we are far from home
But we're so happy
Far from home, all alone
But we're so happy

La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la
La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la
After every sunny day
Came a stormy night
That's when Finner would say
"Keep your heads held high"

And we are far from home
But we're so happy
Far from home, all alone
But we're so happy

La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la
La, la-la la
La-la la, la-la la

And we are far from home (La, la-la la)
But we're so happy (La-la la, la-la la)
Far from home, all alone (La, la-la la)
But we're so happy (La-la la, la-la la)

Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!15Embed
