Cayman Islands Lyrics
Through the alleyways to cool off in the shadows
Then into the street, following the water
There's a bearded man paddling in his canoe
Looks as if he has come all the way from the Cayman Islands
These canals, it seems they all go in circles
Places look the same and we're the only difference
The wind is in your hair, it's covering my view
I'm holding on to you on a bike we've hired until tomorrow
If only they could see, if only they had been here
They would understand how someone could have chosen
To go the length I've gone to spend just one day riding, holding on to you
I never thought it would be this clear3Embed
