Know-How Lyrics
Riding on this know-how
Never been here before
Peculiarly entrusted
Possibly that's all
Is history recorded?
Does someone have a tape?
Surely, I'm no pioneer
Constellations stay the same

Just a little bit of danger
When intriguingly
Our little secret
Trusts that you trust me
'Cause no one will ever know
That this was happening
So tell me why you listen
When nobody's talking

What is there to know?
All this is what it is
You and me alone
Sheer simplicity
What is there to know?
All this is what it is
You and me alone
Sheer simplicity3Embed
