Gold in the Air of Summer LyricsWithout giving anything away
I can say it's by the sea
It's a house that used to be
The home of a friend of mine
Without giving anything away
We find ships inside of bottles
And the garden's overgrown
The house is white, but the paint is coming off
I didn't know if you wanted to
But I came to pick you up
You didn't even hesitate
And now you and me are on our way
I think I've bought everything we need
Don't look back, don't think of the
Other places you should've been
It's a good thing that you came along with me
Gold in the air of summer
You'll shine like gold in the air of summer
You'll shine like gold in the air of summer
You'll shine like gold in the air of summerEmbed
