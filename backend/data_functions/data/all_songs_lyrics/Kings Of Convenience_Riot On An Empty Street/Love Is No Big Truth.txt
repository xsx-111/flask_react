Love Is No Big Truth LyricsAll I do is sleep all day and think of you
A memory of the cushioned life I'm clinging to
The image of a mutual one, our haven
The sombre chords of our song, the fading
Love is no big truth driven by our genes
We are simple selfish beings
A symphony that's you
Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping
Passion and its brother hate, they come and go
It could easily be made to stay for longer though
Many people play this game so willingly
Do I have to be like them, or be lonely?
Love is no big truth driven by our genes
We are simple selfish beings
A symphony that's you
Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping
Another view of what there is to it
Getting me through it
I'll never need it again
Not again, not again
Not again, not again
Not again, not again
Not again, not again2Embed
