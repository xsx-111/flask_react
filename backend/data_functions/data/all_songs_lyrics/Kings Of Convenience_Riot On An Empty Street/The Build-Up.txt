The Build-Up Lyrics
The build-up
Lasted for days
Lasted for weeks
Lasted too long
Our hero withdrew
When there was two
He couldn't choose one
So there was none

Worn into the vaguely announced
Worn into the vaguely announced

The spinning top made a sound
Like a train across the valley
Fading, oh so quiet
But constant 'til it passed
Over the ridge, into the distances
Written on a ticket
To remind you where to stop
And when to get off
The spinning top made a sound
Like a train across the valley
Fading, oh so quiet
But constant 'til it passed
Over the ridge, into the distances
Written on a ticket
To remind you where to stop
And when to get off
When to get off
When to get off
When to get off3Embed
