Stay out of Trouble LyricsOne, two
One, two
I walked around for hours
Two ten-pence pieces in my hand
I was alone and freezing
Still trying hard to understand you
I left the others knowing
I had to work this by myself
But now the feeling's growing
I would be better off with their help
So baby, what we've got
Has lately not been enough
Not been enough
I wish I had your scarf still
That once embraced and kept me warm
I wish you could be with me
In these last days when I am still hopelessly poor
Stay out of trouble, stay in touch
Try not to think about me too much1Embed
