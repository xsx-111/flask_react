Sorry or Please LyricsFive weeks in a prison, I made no friends
There's more time to be done, but I've got a week to spend
I didn't pay much attention first time around
But now you're hard not to notice right here in my town
Where the stage of my old life meets the cast of the new
Tonight's actors: me and you
Each day is taking us closer
While drawing the curtains to close
This far, or further, I need to know
Your increasingly long embraces
Are they saying sorry or please?
I don't know what's happening
Help me
Through the streets, on the corners, there's a scent in the air
I ask you out and I lead you, I know my way around here
There's a bench I remember and on the way there
I find that the movements you're making are mirrored in mine
And your hand is held open intentionally
Or just what I want to see?
Your increasingly long embraces
Are they saying sorry or please?
I don't know what's happening
Help me
I don't normally beg for assistance
I rely on my own eyes to see
But right now they make no sense to me
Right now you make no sense to meEmbed
