Live Long LyricsSummerchild that sits by the water
Weaving sunlight threads in his hands
The golden river that day a shelter
A stream where he could make pebbles dance
You looked around you, nobody had taken
Any notice of what you saw
Against the evening sky a formation
A million black birds looking like one
Live long
Save ten years to remember
Live long
Hold it in front of your eyes once more
Live long
Save ten years to remember
Live long
Hold it in front of your eyesEmbed
