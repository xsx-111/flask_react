San Tropez Lyrics
As I reach for a peach, slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakin’ a stick with a brick on the sand
Ridin’ a wave in the wake of an old sedan
Sleepin’ alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her callin’

“If you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home”

Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain, on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I’m drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I’ll gather my far-flung thoughts together
Speeding away on the wind to a new day

If you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home

And I pause for a while by a country stile
And listen to the things they say
Diggin’ for gold in a hole in my hand
Open a book, take a look at the way things stand
And you’re leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone

And if you’re alone, I’ll come ho-ho-home
