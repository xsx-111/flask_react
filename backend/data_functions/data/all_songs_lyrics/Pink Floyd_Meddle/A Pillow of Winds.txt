A Pillow of Winds Lyrics
A cloud of eiderdown
Draws around me
Softening the sound

Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low

And the candle dies

When night comes down, you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls and waves roll by
The seasons change, the wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn

And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down

Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And she’s breathing low

And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky
And the night winds die10Embed
