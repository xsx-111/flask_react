Undertow Lyrics
Your brown eyes are my blue skies
They light up the rivers that the birds fly over
Better not to quench your thirst
Better not to be the first one diving in
Though you caught me and you know why
You breathe in the deepest part of the water

What’s the matter? You hurt yourself?
Opened your eyes and there was someone else?
Now I’ve got you in the undertow
Now I’ve got you in the undertow
Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself
Nobody ever has to find out what’s in my mind tonight

Let tonight pass us by
Do you really want to be the one to fight?
And I said, “You’re better not to light that fire
It will take you to the darkest part of the weather”

What’s the matter? You hurt yourself?
Opened your eyes and there was someone else?
Now I’ve got you in the undertow
Now I’ve got you in the undertow
Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself
Nobody ever has to find out what’s in my mind tonight
Nobody ever has to find out what’s in my mind tonight
Nobody in my mind, nobody in my mind
I feel it in my heart tonight
I lay on the floor, pressing in my eyes
Seeing little lights
Please light these decisions that only one could make
I wanted to stay home but I went
Running running running running from the troubles
Running running running running from the troubles
Running running running running from the troubles
Running running running...
What’s the matter? You hurt yourself?
Opened your eyes and there was someone else?
Now I’ve got you in the undertow
Now I’ve got you so
Why you wanna blame me for your troubles?
Ah ah ah you better learn your lesson yourself
Nobody ever has to find out what’s in my mind tonight
I went running running running running from the troubles
Running running running...
Running running running running from the troubles
Running running running...9Embed
