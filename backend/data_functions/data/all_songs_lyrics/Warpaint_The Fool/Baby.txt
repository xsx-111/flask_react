Baby Lyrics1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3

Don't you call anybody else baby
Cause I'm your baby still
You took a long time to make it
But I never changed my mind
I never tried to fake it
Never drew a line
Don't you call anybody else baby
Cause I'm your baby still
You took a long time to make it
But I never changed my mind
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
How I love you
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
You speak your fears
Thinking in circles
And checking what mirrors don't see
You live your life like a page
From the book of my fantasy
(Thinking in circles and checking what mirrors don't see)
Don't you call anybody else baby
(You live your life like a page from a book of my fantasy)
Don't you call anybody else baby
Don't you call anybody else baby
Don't you call anybody else baby
(You speak your fears)
Don't you call anybody else baby
Don't you call anybody else baby
(You live your life like a page from a book of my fantasy)
