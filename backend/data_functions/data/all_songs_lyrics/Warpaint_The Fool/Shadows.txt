Shadows LyricsI know I'm afraid, I know I'm afraid
I'm drunk and I'm tired
And the city I walk in, the city I walk in
It feels like it swallows
With my hand in my pocket
I feel like a shadow
I feel like a shadow
Though I'm afraid
Afraid that I have made mistakes
Now there's nothing here for me
The things you once told me
The thoughts you once gave me
Sound like the wind in my ears
That blows out the knots I've got in my long brown hair
I feel like the shadows
I don't even bother for anymore than that
What did you whisper in my ear?
What did you tell me that I wanted to hear?
What was the answer you wanted me to find out?
There's no lies, the lies, the lies, the lies...
Brought back something
A bit for you, a bit for everyone
You and all your pieces
You and all your pieces made me come
And all that love you gave was strong enough to make me stay and now it will be alright
I feel like the shadows
I don't even bother for anymore than that
I feel like the shadows
I don't even bother for anymore than that
What did you whisper in my ear?
What was the answer you wanted me to find out?
There's no lies, the lies, the lies, the lies...4Embed
