Majesty LyricsWhen I held your hand
When I held your hand
When I helped you
When I held your hand
You still went the other way
And you wanted me to stay
With my arms stretching away
With my arms stretching away
I couldn't stand that sight
Cause I adored your face
I adore your face
Could it be that I'm the same
Could it be I'm your mirror
Showing you all those things
That you never wanted to face
So you let me slip away
You just watched me walk away
And I just have to ask, do you know your fate?
Do you know your fate?
Could it be that I'm your
Could it be that you are my majesty
When it all comes back
When it all falls into place
Could it be that I don't want it anyways
Could it be as sad as that?
There was a day we used to laugh
And I wanted you by my side
The perfect match
I want to understand
The perfect match
Could it be that I'm your
Could it be that you are my majesty
You could have been my king
You could have been my king
You could have been my king4Embed
