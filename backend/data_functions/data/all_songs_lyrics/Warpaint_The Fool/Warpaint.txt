Warpaint LyricsThe war you fight is underneath
The water, getting deeper
The wall, the wall, the falling wall
The wall is bursting open
The wall is bursting open
(In like a dull knife
Pulls out all the stops
I fall out like)
You were burning even when I was whispering
(Time running out)
You hold on, the water was slippery
(In like a dull knife)
You listen, the weather was answering
(Time running out)
I let go, I wanna get into it
You've got your reasons that "hey, hey"
Turned by the seasons and long days gone
Too many minds in my "I don't know"
Cold and under, I almost forgot to
Face up to what I ought to
Willing and I do give offering to you
Willing and I do give offering to you
Don't know why I feel so different
Feel just like a different person
You're tied in a knot, can't throw you back here up
You've got the floor, they say, you gotta lock it up
Late into the night you wore off that fever
That fever
Cold and under, I almost forgot to
Face up to what I ought to
Willing and I do give offering to you
Willing and I do give offering to you
Aaah, I'm over here by your way
Aaah, tight as a knot, I want to fade
Aaah, I'm over here by your way
Aaah, tight as a knot, I want to fade4Embed
