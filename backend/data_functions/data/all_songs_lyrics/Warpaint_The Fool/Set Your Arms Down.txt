Set Your Arms Down LyricsOut on the back porch
You say tonight
We bring our pocket, our pocket knives
You wanna fight me, you want to fight
Forgotten sense of me
Say ah, say ah
And in the backyard
Into the night
We walk through fire
My love is your flashlight
They wanna fight me, they want to fight
Forgotten sense of me
Say ah, say ah, oh...
Walk through the fire
Walk till it gets dark
There is no hiding
To save your life
You've got to try
Say you're me now
Set your arms down
Say ah, say ah
Say ah, say ah
Say ah, say ah5Embed
