Open Your Eyes Lyrics
As I walk along these streets
I see a man that walks alone
Distant echo of people's feet
He has no place to call his own
A shot rings out from a roof overhead
A crackhead asks for change nearby
An old man lies in an alleyway dead
A little girl lost just stands there and cries

What would you do (What would you do)
If it was you (If it was you)
Would you take everything
For granted like you do

A boy just 13 on the corner for sale
Swallows his pride for another hit
Overpopulation there's no room in jail
And most of you don't give a shit
That your daughters are porno stars
And your sons sell death to kids
So lost in your little worlds
Your little worlds you'll never fix
What would you do (What would you do)
If it was you (If it was you)
Would you take everything
For granted like you do

You turn away
You turn away
You turn away
You turn away

As I walk along the streets
Soaking up the acid rain
Underneath the taxicabs
I hear the streets cry out in vain

What would you do (What would you do)
If it was you (If it was you)
Would you take everything
For granted like you do

What would you do (What would you do)
If it was you (If it was you)
Would you take everything
For granted like you do1Embed
