Take It Lyrics
I feel like this won't go away
No matter how hard I try to
Squeeze my eyes shut so I can't see
The pain in you, this pain in me... in me

Everything that I can say to you
Won't help you
Everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

I know that I'm really not here
To represent what I'm not clear
About in my head
Sometimes I feel fucked up just like you do... like you do

But everything that I can say to you
Won't help you
Everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

Try to make it through the daily pain
That you feel
Maybe tomorrow won't be so bad
I know it
'Cause I once felt that way
Nothing I could say
Made it go away
I lived through this, I still feel this
I just live for my tomorrow

Just make it go away
Just make it go away
She'll make it go away
She'll make it go awayEmbed
