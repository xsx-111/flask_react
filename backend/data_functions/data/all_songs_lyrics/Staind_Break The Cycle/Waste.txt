Waste Lyrics
Your mother came up to me
She wanted answers only she should know
Only she should know
It wasn't easy to deal
With the tears that rolled down her face
I had no answers 'cause, I didn't even know you

But these words, they can't replace
The life you, the life you waste

How could you paint this picture?
Was life as bad as it should seem
That there were no more options for you?
I can't explain how I feel
I've been there many times before
I've tasted the cold steel of my life crashing down before me

But these words, they can't replace
The life you, the life you waste

Did Daddy not love you?
Or did he love you just too much?
Did he control you?
Did he live through you at your cost?
Did he leave no questions
For you to answer on your own?
Well, fuck that, and fuck her, and fuck him, and fuck you
For not having the strength in your heart to pull through
I've had doubts, I have failed, I've fucked up, I've had plans
Doesn't mean I should take my life with my own hands

But these words, they can't replace
The life you, the life you waste

But these words, they don't replace
The life you, the life you waste2Embed
