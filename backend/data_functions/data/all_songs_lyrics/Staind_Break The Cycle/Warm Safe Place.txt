Warm Safe Place Lyrics
Another day inside my world
I'm married to you and this road
A road that never lets me sleep
There's no way to escape, these demons I am forced to keep

And then I find, you here
Through your eyes, everything's clear
And I'm home, inside your arms
But I'm alone, for now

I mean the best with what I say
It doesn't always sound that way
I never learned to work things out
'Cause in my family all we ever seemed to do is shout

And then I find, you here
Through your eyes, everything's clear
And I'm home, inside your arms
But I'm alone, for now, alone for now

And I try to sleep
The drugs I take are killing me
I think of you to ease my pain
But you're so far
And now it's time to say goodbye
I love you baby, please don't cry
And then I find, you here
Through your eyes, everything's clear
And I'm home, inside your arms
But I'm alone, for now, alone for nowEmbed
