Suffer Lyrics
Suffer
Suffer
Suffer

The more you see the more you do
The television's feeding you
With what you want to hear
Anger and fear, because you suffer

The hate you feel won't go away
You're all programmed to feel this way
To live another day
Within a world that longs to suffer
(Suffer)

And then I come to find
And everything's ok
Seen this all before
But that was yesterday
Try to walk right through
The messes that I've made
Just let me enjoy
The life here that I live
I try to give this all to you
Can't take anymore to deal
With this, it hurts inside
I know why i hide, 'cause I suffer
(Suffer)

I tried to keep it all inside
It didn't leave me too much pride
I forced it all down inside
Forced myself to make me suffer
(Suffer)

And then I come to find
And everything's ok
Seen this all before
But that was yesterday
Try to make it through
The messes that I've made
So I can enjoy
The life here that I live
And then I come to find...

And then I come to find
And everything's ok
Seen this all before
But that was yesterday
Try to walk right through
These messes that I've made
Just try to enjoy
This life here that I have2Embed
