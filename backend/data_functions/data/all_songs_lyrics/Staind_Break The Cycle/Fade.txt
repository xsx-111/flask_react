Fade Lyrics
I try to breathe
Memories overtaking me
I try to face them but
The thought is too much to conceive

I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
That my life became 'cause

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt, I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

So where were you?
When all this I was going through
You never took the time
To ask me just what you could do
I only know that I can change
Everything else just stays the same
So now I step out of the darkness
That my life became cause

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt, I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made

Oh, I never meant to fade
Away
I never meant to fade

I just needed someone to talk to
You were just too busy with yourself
You were never there for me to
Express how I felt, I just stuffed it down
Now I'm older and I feel like
I could let some of this anger fade
But it seems the surface I am scratching
Is the bed that I have made
I try to breathe...5Embed
