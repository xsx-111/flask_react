Pressure Lyrics
I just need this, to be alright
I can't feel this, another night
I can't take this, I come unglued
I might breakdown, in front of you
Necessary, to medicate
I'm not sleeping, can't stay awake

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressure

If you need me, I'll be here
Half unconscious, escape my fear
I can't take this, I come unglued
I might breakdown, in front of you
Necessary, to medicate
I'm not sleeping, can't stay awake

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressure
My head hurts this shit isn't getting me high
My chest is so tight am I going to die
My stomach's in knots and the room starts to spin
As I wait for this Valium to slowly kick in

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressure

Can't see through this
Too much pressure
Drowning in this
Too much pressureEmbed
