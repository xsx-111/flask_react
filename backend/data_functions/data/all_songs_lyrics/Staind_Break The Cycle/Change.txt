Change Lyrics
If ever you had said to me before that I would lead this life
That I am living now I guess it's all so strange to feel the way I do inside
And have so much that I could feel some pride for in my life
So why is it that I feel like this

How do I feel? I've been here before, I've felt this
Retreat to a place, a place within me, I need this
Keep it all down, bottled inside, it breaks me
To torment again and torture me like it used to

I try and try to break away from all the hate I'm feeling
For everyone of you that's ever done me wrong
I need to justify the reasons for the way I'm living
I guess I can't 'cause I don't feel like I deserve

How do I feel? I've been here before, I've felt this
Retreat to a place, a place within me, I need this
Keep it all down, bottled inside, it breaks me
To torment again and torture me like it used to
My life is the 23rd hour of day
Once said that everything goes, by yesterday
So now the waves they have subsided and my soul is bleeding
I can't take away all the shame I feel, forgive me

How do I feel? I've been here before, I've felt this
Retreat to a place, a place within me, I need this
Keep it all down, bottled inside, it breaks me
To torment again and torture me like it used to

Again
