Twenty Flight Rock LyricsOh well, I've got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rockin' she's the queen
We love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone, I can hold her tight
But she lives on the twentieth floor up town
The elevator's broken down
So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I’m startin’ to drag
Fifteenth floor I'm a-ready to sag
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock
When she called me up on the telephone
Said c'mon over honey, I'm all alone
I said baby, you're mighty sweet
But I'm in bed with a-achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
But I couldn't stay away
So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm a-ready to drag
Fifteenth floor I’m startin’ to sag
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock
Well, they sent to Chicago for repairs
'Till it's a-fixed I'm a-using the stairs
Hope they hurry up before it's too late
Want my baby too much to wait
All this climbin' is a-gettin' me down
They'll find my corpse draped over a rail
But I climbed one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight more
Up on the twelfth I'm a-ready to drag
Fifteenth floor I’m startin’ to sag
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock3Embed
