Am I Blue LyricsWell am I blue, am I blue
Ain't these tears in my eyes tellin' you
Well am I blue, you'd be too
If your pal says your gal's done with you
There was a time, I was the only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, oh dear
Well was I gay, I should say
Now she's gone and we're through, am I blueEmbed
