Undying Love LyricsYou're the world to me, until eternity
It will always be, undying love
As long as stars will shine, I will call you mine
Till the end of time, undying love
Please don't ever leave me, grieve me, deceive me
Never let me go (never let me go)
Try to understand me, commend me, demand me
I'll always love you so
You're the world to me, until eternity
It will always be, undying loveEmbed
