Have I Told You Lately That I Love You LyricsHave I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you once again somehow
Have I told you with all my heart and soul, how I adore you
Well darling, I'm telling you now
This heart would break in two if you'd refuse me
I'm no good without you anyhow
Have I told you lately that I love you
Well darling, I'm telling you nowEmbed
