Face to Face / Short Circuit LyricsWhat's going on? (Work it harder, make it better)
Could this be my understanding? (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
It's not your fault (More than ever, hour after hour)
I was being too demanding (Work is never over)
I must admit (Work it harder, make it better)
It's my pride that made me distant (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
All because (More than ever, hour after hour)
I hoped that you'd be someone different (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
There's not much I know about you (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
Fear will always make you blind (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
But the answer is in clear view (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
It's amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work it harder, make it better)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (More than ever, hour after hour)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work it harder, make it better)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (More than ever, hour after hour)
Amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)
What's going on? (Work it harder, make it better)
Could this be my understanding (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
It's not your fault (More than ever, hour after hour)
I was being too demanding (Work is never over)
I must admit (Work it harder, make it better)
It's my pride that made me distant (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
All because (More than ever, hour after hour)
I hoped that you'd be someone different (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
There's not much I know about you (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
Fear will always make you blind (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
But the answer is in clear view (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
It's amazing what you'll find face to face (Work is never over)
Work it harder
Make it better
Do it faster
Makes us stronger
More than ever
Hour after hour
Work is never over
Work it harder
Make it better
Do it faster
Makes us stronger
More than ever
Hour after hour
Work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
I turned away (Work it harder, make it better)
'Cause I thought you were the problem (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Tried to forget (More than ever, hour after hour)
Until I hit the bottom (Work is never over)
But when I faced you (Work it harder, make it better)
In my blank confusion (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
I realized you weren't wrong (More than ever, hour after hour)
It was a mere illusion (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
It really didn't make sense (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
Just to leave this unresolved (Work is never over)
(Work it harder, make it better)
It's not hard to go the distance (Do it faster, makes us stronger)
(More than ever, hour after hour)
When you finally get involved face to face(Work is never over)
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never over
Our work is never overEmbed
