32nd Floor LyricsDon't believe his heart, I beg you please it lies
There's murder in the eyes of men and treason in the sky
She crossed the room in honour and took his words in vain
He smiled the smile of murder and in his head, shook his hand
Take me to your sister, in you and her is love
It's beautiful and soothing, it's logic and it's sane
Take me through the evening, on my 32nd floor
And I'll never ask for more
Money is the heartache, moral is the shame
Duty comes to those who love the numbers and the name
So find the State of Israel, find the State of Rome
Crush the fools in huts of clay, there's danger in the garden
Take me to your Station, take me through your mind
Drop that code you give me, just let me feel your mind
Take me through the evening, on my 32nd floor
And I'll never ask for more
Hit me in the darkroom, I've never loved before
I've shook and screamed in lonely times
But I've never loved before
Take me to your sister, in you and her is love
It's beautiful and soothing, it's logic and it's sane
Help me through the evening, on my 32nd floor
And I'll never ask for moreEmbed
