Hedonist Lyrics
With no father, and no son
He's a Christian, but not the one
And with a guidance, like a lemming
He fell so deep into the sea
There's a glory in the brain
It's so crass, it's so vain
Mother Nature and tunnel vision
Back to back, oh sing to me

Take my heart, take my soul
Take my Jesus, take my gold
Kill my children, steal my home
But I'm the one, I'm the one

Pray to stone and spit on love
Do the exile, and spit on love
Mother bore me in a nightmare
I'm the one, I'm the one

Take my heart, take my soul
Take my Jesus, take my gold
Kill the children, steal my home
I came a cropper when I trusted you
I'm the one

I had to steal, I had to beg
I never worried, I never bled
Well Mother Mary, Hell that's a story
'Cause I'm the one, yeah I'm the one

Take my heart, take my soul
Take my Jesus, take my gold
Kill my children, steal my home
But I'm the one, the oneEmbed
