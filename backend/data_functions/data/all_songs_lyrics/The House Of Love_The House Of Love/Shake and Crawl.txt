Shake and Crawl LyricsDon't you frown
Just go sweetly
Let your senses suck the world
And your fingers through my hair
Shake and crawl
Through the willow
There's a baby in your eyes
And a second when we cry
And I know no love will be here again
Here again
So wash my lies
Fill the hollow
With a legend out inside
There's a system to divide
And I know no love will be here again
I know something's wrong
I've got words and I've got song
And you're the call in an ice cold wind
So don't you cry
Just go sweetly
Take an ideal to the storm
Let your head and heart be one
And I know no love will be here again
I know no love will be here again
Here againEmbed
