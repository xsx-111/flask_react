Never Lyrics
ABC, stick to me
Soul to soul, stay on eye to eye
Maybe God will be good to me
I've never sinned, maybe I should try

Never, never gonna let you down
Never, never gonna let you down
Never gonna beg, I'm never gonna steal
Your heart is perfect, my love is real

Go to war, what a drag
A love of hate is really not the way
Light a flame or go to sleep
The time is right to celebrate or die

Never, never gonna let you down
Never, never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna beg, I'm never gonna steal
Your heart is perfect, my love is real

It's because your heart
Will never lie, never cry, never sigh, never die
It's because your heart
It digs deep, holds tight, oh yeah
I see the lie
ABC, stick to me
Soul to soul, stay on eye to eye
Well maybe God will be good to me
I've never sinned, maybe I should try

Never, never gonna let you down
Never, never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna beg, I'm never gonna steal
Your heart is perfect, my love is real
Your heart is perfect, my love is real

My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is real
My love is realEmbed
