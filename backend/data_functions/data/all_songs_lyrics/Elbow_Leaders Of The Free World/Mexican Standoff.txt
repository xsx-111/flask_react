Mexican Standoff LyricsShifting my weight now from foot to foot
What did she see in this man
I'm not superstitious but if I can get
This ball in the basket, then he'll wake up dead
Your sweet reassurances don't change the fact
That he's better looking than me
Yet he'd look ideal 'neath the wheels of a car
Oh, Mexican standoff, I wish I was hard, yeah
Yeah
Your sweet reassurances don't change the fact
That he's better looking than me
Yet he'd look ideal 'neath the wheels of a car
Oh, Mexican standoff, I wish I was hardEmbed
