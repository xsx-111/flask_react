Puncture Repair LyricsI leaned on you today
I regularly hurt but never say
I nearly wore the window through
Where was air sea rescue?
The cavalry with tea and sympathy
You were there
Puncture repair
I leaned on you today
I regularly hurt but never say
You patched me up and sent me on my way
I leaned on you todayEmbed
