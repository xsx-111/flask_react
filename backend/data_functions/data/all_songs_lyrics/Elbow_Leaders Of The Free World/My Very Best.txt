My Very Best LyricsWell, give that girl my very best
Though it never made the grade
If it seems that it's just not enough to love
Then love lie down
And would you tell her
Not to talk as if I died
Though a tiny part just did
And would you tell her
I'm from a long line of survivors
And I'll be swinging with the kids
Keep your sympathy
Don't need the healing to start
You've gone
Gone and made a beautiful hole in my heart
In the corner of the room
In the room we used to love
Of the love we should say this
There were switches never flicked
Long away and far apart
That's how forest fires start
Start again it felt like this
Fresh and simple as a kiss
I bounce these feelings off the moon
The echoes don't come back
Keep your sympathy
Don't need the healing to start
You've gone
Gone and made a beautiful hole in my heart
Of the love, we should say this
There were, there were switches never flicked
Keep your sympathy
Don't need the healing to start
You've gone
Gone and made a beautiful hole in my heart
Keep your sympathy
Don't need the healing to start
You've gone
Gone and made a beautiful hole in my heartEmbed
