The Stops LyricsI can't undo the day
It won't go, won't go under the rug
I pull out the stops
And you, you pull the plug
These are sober days and I know it can't be
But I'll miss you the way you miss the sea
Just (Don't look down) Keep staring like you've never seen the stars
(Don't look down) If you need me to remind you who you are
(Don't look down) Little blossom there's the shiniest soul
(Oh) Just behind those eyes
No longer my affair
Well I can't go there just yet
So I've come to love and trust those friends
That are holding your net
Falling off used to mean
Maybe grazing a knee
And I'll miss you the way you miss the sea
Just (don't look down) Keep staring like you've never seen the stars
(Don't look down) If you need me to remind you who you are
(Don't look down) Little blossom there's the shiniest soul
(Oh) Just behind those eyes
While I won't second guess
What you're thinking of me
I will miss you the way you miss the sea
Just (don't look down) Keep staring like you've never seen the stars
(Don't look down) If you need me to remind you who you are
(Don't look down) Little blossom there's the shiniest soul
(Oh) Just behind those eyesEmbed
