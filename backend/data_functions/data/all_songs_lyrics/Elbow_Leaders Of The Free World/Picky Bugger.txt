Picky Bugger LyricsDrinking in order to feel
Thinking, reinventing the wheel
Kicking up mischief and feeding the fire
Kicking up mischief and walking the wire
Little fish, you count for nothing
Do your thing until you die
Keep your powder dry
In order and line
Thinking and sinking the wine
Kicking up mischief and feeding the fire
Kicking up mischief and walking the wire
Little fish, just keep on flapping
Do your thing until you die
Keep your powder dry
Kicking up mischief and walking the wire
Kicking up mischief and feeding the fire
Feeding the fireEmbed
