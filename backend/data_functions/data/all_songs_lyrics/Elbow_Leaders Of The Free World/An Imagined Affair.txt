An Imagined Affair LyricsA sky as black as regret
Is rolling aside for the blue
Impossible face to forget
These feelings belong in a zoo
She brings the morning
She, she brings the morning sun
So lost in the sound of her voice
I don't even hear the words
When she says, "Come on get out
The past will find us out
Come on get out please
And don't breathe a word."
She brings the morning
She, she brings the morning sun
But all this an imagined affair
While sitting in a bar spilling in a bar
I drink until the doorman is a Christmas tree
And my speech is just a gas leak
She brings the morning
She, she brings the morning sunEmbed
