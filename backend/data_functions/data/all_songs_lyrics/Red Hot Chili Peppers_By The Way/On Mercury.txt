On Mercury Lyrics
I've got myself in a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go?
Shake it off just to redirect my flow
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due

Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

Looking up into a reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up, another stubborn Scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really, really you

Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through

Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middleweight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block

Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through
Memories of everything of lemon trees on Mercury and
Come to me with remedies from five or six of seven seas and
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything that blew through4Embed
