This Is the Place Lyrics
This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline? Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid

"This is my (Ooh) calling," (Ooh, ooh) I said, darling
Shocking, appalling (Ooh, ooh) all (Ooh) I can do to you
"Hammers are (Ooh) falling," (Ooh, ooh) I said, darling
Shocking, appalling (Ooh, ooh) all (Ooh) I can do to you

This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene? Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it, but I've gotta know

"This is my (Ooh) calling," (Ooh, ooh) I said, darling
Shocking, appalling (Ooh, ooh) all (Ooh) I can do to you
"Hammers are (Ooh) falling," (Ooh, ooh) I said, darling
Shocking, appalling (Ooh, ooh) all (Ooh) I can do to you
(Aah) Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-woah-woah
(Aah) Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-woah-woah

I saw you out there yesterday. What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray
(Aah) I caught you out there in the fray. What did you wanna say?
(Aah) A master piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died, I could not get my copper clean

I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake, it but I've gotta know

(Aah) "This is my calling," (Aah) I said, darling
(Aah) Shocking, appalling (Aah) all I can do to you
(Aah) "Hammers are falling," (Aah) I said, darling
(Aah) Shocking, appalling (Aah) all I can do to you

I (Hoo) am a misfit, (Hoo, hoo, hoo) I'm born with all of it
(Hoo) The fucking ultimate (Hoo, hoo) of love inside the atom split
I'm in (Hoo) a flash (Hoo) ray, (Hoo) a mash of DNA
Another (Hoo) popinjay (Hoo) who (Hoo) thinks he's got something to say
(Aah) Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-woah-woah
(Aah-aah)
(Aah) Oh-oh, oh-oh, woah-woah-woah
(Aah-aah)7Embed
