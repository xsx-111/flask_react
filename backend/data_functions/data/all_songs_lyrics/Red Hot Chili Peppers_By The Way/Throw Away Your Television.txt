Throw Away Your Television Lyrics
Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for its collision now

It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old

Throw away your television
Make a break, big intermission
Re-create your supervision now

It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old

Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now

Oy, oy, oy
Throw away your television
Take the noose off your ambition
Re-invent your intuition now

It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old

Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now


Throw away your television
Salivate to repetition
Alleviate this ill condition now

It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeatEmbed
