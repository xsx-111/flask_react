Warm Tape Lyrics
Shiver for me, girl
Deliver for me, my darling
Ah, pushing up to you
A river that runs right through you
Swim for your smile in a Blue Rock Quarry
Make it for me, baby, you won't be sorry
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling

Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love you never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel's dust
I've been around, but not around enough

Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me, girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love I'm never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the water of love
Two of us were made of angel's dust
I've been around, but not around enough

Let's go
I know I make it for two
Intuition's only what you take from it
I know I make it for two
You were there and I was fortunate
I know I make it for two
Messy bed a part of cheating I won't fall for you
I know I make it for two, I make it for two, I make it for two and

Shiver for me now
Deliver for me, my darling
A living that I could
Be giving to you, my sweet love
Swim for your smile in a Blue Rock Quarry
Make it for me, baby, you won't be sorry
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your dreams
Settle for love
Settle for love
Settle for love1Embed
