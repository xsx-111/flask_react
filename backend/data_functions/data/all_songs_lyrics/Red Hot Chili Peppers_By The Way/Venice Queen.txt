Venice Queen Lyrics
Does it go from east to west, y'all
Body free and a body less, y'all
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in coming through the mesh, y'all
Checking in just to get it blessed, y'all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam

Where you come from, where you're going?
Where you come from, where you're going?

Do it all then it all again, y'all
Make it up and you make a friend, y'all
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend, y'all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, y'all
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
Where you come from, where you're going?
Where you come from, where you're going?

We all want to tell her, tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her, tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen, best I've ever

I know you said you don't believe in God
We used to disagree
Now that it's time for you to leave

G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air

G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of all I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?

G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend

I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave

G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend3Embed
