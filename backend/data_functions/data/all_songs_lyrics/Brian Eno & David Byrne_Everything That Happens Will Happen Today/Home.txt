Home Lyrics
The dimming of the light makes the picture clearer
It's just an old photograph
There's nothing to hide
When the world was just beginning

I memorized a face so it's not forgotten
I hear the wind whistlin'
Come back anytime
And we'll mix our lives together

Heaven knows what keeps mankind alive
Ev'ry hand goes searching for its partner
In crime under chairs and behind tables
Connecting to places we have known
(I'm looking for a)

Home: where the wheels are turning
Home: why I keep returning
Home: where my world is breaking in two
Home: with the neighbors fighting
Home: always so exciting
Home: were my parents telling the truth?
Home: such a funny feeling
Home: no-one ever speaking
Home: with our bodies touching
Home: and the cam'ras watching
Home will infect what ever you do
We're home, comes to life from outta the blue
Tiny little boats on a beach at sunset
I took a drink from a jar
And into my head
Familiar smells and flavors

Vehicles are stuck on the plains of heaven
I see their wheels spinning 'round
And ev'rywhere
I can hear those people saying

That the eye is the measure of the man
You can fly from the stuff that still surrounds you
We're home and the band keeps marchin' on
Connecting to ev'ry living soul
Compassion for things I'll never knowEmbed
