Everything That Happens LyricsI ride on a perfect freeway
Many people on that road
I heard the sound of someone laughing
I saw my neighbor's car explode
Just up ahead
Against the sky
Quicker than you blink your eye
Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
And among the living, we are giving, all through the night
From the milk of human kindness
From the breast we all partake
Hungry for a social contract
She welcomes you with dark embrace
(puts) socks and shoes
Upon our feet
Little fishes swim upstream
Oh my brother, I still wonder, are you alright?
In the deepest silence, gold and diamonds, all through the night
Everything that happens will happen today
And nothing has changed, but nothing's the same
And every tomorrow could be yesterday
And everything that happens will happen today
Everything that happens will happen today
And nothing has changed, but nothing's the same
And every tomorrow could be yesterday
Everything that happens could happen todayEmbed
