One Fine Day LyricsSaw the wanderin' eye inside my heart
Shouts and battle cries from every part
I can see those tears, every one is true
When the door appears, I'll go right through
I stand in liquid light, like everyone
I built my life with rhymes to carry on
And it gives me hope to see you there
The things I used to know, that one fine-
One fine day
One fine day
In a small dark room, where I will wait
Face to face I find, I contemplate
Even though a man, is made of clay
Everything can change, that one fine
One fine day
One fine day
One fine day
Then before my eyes is standing still
I beheld it there, a city on a hill
I complete my tasks one by one
I remove my masks when I am done
Then a peace of mind fell over me
In these troubled times, I still can see
We can use the stars to guide the way
It is not that far, one fine
One fine day
One fine day
One fine day
Hope
I have hopeEmbed
