Wanted for Life LyricsFill the suitcase up - did he stiff somebody?
Will he testify? - if you say you're sorry
Grown men laugh when they heard that lie
10 to 12 - gonna hang them high
Wanted for life
Hu hu- I'm wanted for life
Ran outside
The buildings dropped
Now he stole the crown
Do the buggers never stop?
Said - wait a minute pop
Hoo Hey - Wait a minute pop
Now upon this earth
We stand on dirt
Got tore down
But I'm still standing up
Ev'ry little drop
(I'm thankful for) ev'ry little drop
Torn and Frayed
Even though it's full of holes
Getcha where ya wanna go
Getcha where ya wanna go
Even though you're smarter than me
I'll write your autobiography
I'm using all the words up
I got my grammar in the 5 and dime
I'm givin' all the words up
And now I know the words are mine
If ya close your eyes - do ya picture money?
Did he change his mind? Will it keep you runnin'?
The blind men sing
The girl's gone wild
The statute's clear
And they emphasized
Wanted for life
Hoo hoo I'm wanted for life
So, swing that stick
Throw that rock
Inch by inch
Goin' step by step
Well - wait a minute pop
Hu-hu-hu Wait a minute pop
Now upon this earth
We stand on dirt
We got torn down
But I'm still standing up, filled with
Every little drop
(I'm thankful for) ev'ry little drop
Torn and frayed
My testimony's full of holes
Get me where I wanna go
Which-a-way ya wanna go
Pardon me sir
I don't live here no more
But see that's the way it goes
I'm moving on a gravel road
Pardon me sir
I don't live here no more
Maybe that's the way it goes
I guess that that's the way it goes
Pardon me sir
I don't live here no more
I'm moving on a gravel road
Maybe that's the way it goes1Embed
