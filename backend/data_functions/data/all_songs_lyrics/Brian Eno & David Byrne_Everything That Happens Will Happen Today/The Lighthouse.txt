The Lighthouse LyricsI'll build a house - of water
I'm searching high - and low
Underneath the waves
Where they hit the rocky shore
Out by the lighthouse
Heard nature say
"I'm sorry -
For stones and trees down below
For those who tumble in God's name
To an early grave
Into the sea and foam
Like ships tossed in a storm"
And I'm standing all alone
Out by the lighthouse
I'll build a house - of paper
Covered with words I could read
She had to teach me what to say
But every year we stayed
Out by the lighthouse
I'll build a house - so level
With seven walls - long and true
The day we raised that roof up high
Unto the fading light
We sang the whole night through
No one needed proof
And I could see the moon
Out by the lighthouseEmbed
