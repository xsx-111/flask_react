The River LyricsI'm standing on the stage
I'm working in a restaurant
I make a decent wage- and I-
Will sing into the microphone
The river rises up
And flows above the interstate
Beyond the schools and shops - how far
There's no way to communicate
Oh
And the water's moving on
Beyond the lies and hypocrites
I'm thinking of a song
I need you to remember it
The forest is alive
It asks us to participate
We lifted up our eyes
To promise and reciprocate
When we fell down on our knees
For ev'ry human being——
One sad day I will fly away
And one sad day I will tip-toe away
Oooh
But a change is gonna come
Like Sam Cooke sang in '63
The river sings a song - to me
On ev'ry St. Cecillia's day
So when I was reborn
I went back to the restaurant
The river's moving on - from here
To sing its crazy symphony
And I'll go home - where you are right in front of meEmbed
