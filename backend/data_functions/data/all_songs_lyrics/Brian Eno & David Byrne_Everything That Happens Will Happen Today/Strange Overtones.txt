Strange Overtones Lyrics
I wake up every morning
I hear your feet on the stairs
You're in the next apartment
I hear you singing over there

This groove is out of fashion
These beats are 20 years old
I saw you lend a hand to
The ones out standing in the cold

Strange overtones in the music you are playing
I'll harmonize
It is strong and you are tough
But a heart is not enough

Put on your socks and mittens
It's getting colder tonight
A snowball in my kitchen
I watched it melt before my eyes

Your song still needs a chorus
I know you'll figure it out
The rising of the verses
A change of key will let you out
Strange overtones though they're slightly out of fashion
I'll harmonize
I see the music in your face
That your words cannot explain

Strange overtones in the music you are playing
We're not alone
It is strong and you are tough
But a heart is not enough

Strange overtones in the music you are playing
I'll harmonize
It is strong and you are tough
But a heart is not enough3Embed
