Poor Boy LyricsA truck parked this morning, outside the grocery store
Friends face the future, they're wearin' summer clothes
Great cosmic forces, like fallin' dominoes
I love talking funny, it's the only song I know
Sweet smart and sexy, the day my life began
Burnt out and damaged, I dragged my body home
This slice is runny, it's dripping down my clothes
And flies stick to honey, it's the only game they know
Poor Boy - I walk into the river in my hat and shoes
Poor Boy - I'm sittin' at the table with a knife and spoon
Live fast die happy - don't let your panties show
They trust market forces - it's the only song they know
So come and rock my soul - where sin and sorry lie
White horses carry me - on to the other side
Poor Boy I'm livin' in a country where my thoughts are cold
Poor Boy I'm waitin' for the harvest of the seeds I sow
A flower in the night - with thoughts of days gone
I've got to ring that bell - and I'll be satisfied
Poor Boy I'm wearin' silver slippers and a long white gown
Poor boy I picture in my mind the day the walls come down
Poor Boy I'm livin' in a country where I'm never free
Poor Boy I'm writing down the names of all the things I seeEmbed
