Life Is Long LyricsEverybody says that the living is easy
I can barely see 'cause my head's in the way
Tigers walk behind me, they are to remind me that
I'm lost, but I'm not afraid, oh
Soul to soul, a kiss and a sigh
Sawed in half by the passage of time, oh
Halfway home from a window you see
Chains and bars, but I am still free, oh
People on the outside, I remember sweet times
This old rose is always in bloom
Everybody's happy to be a baby daddy
Stone love with nothing to lose, oh
Life is long if you give it way
So stay, don't go, 'cause I'm fading away, oh
Soul to soul, between you and me
Chain me down, but I am still free, oh
Now I can say those three little words
And every day, I'm dreaming a world, oh
Soul to soul, a kiss and a sigh
Holding back the waters outside, oh
Life is long if you give it way
So stay, don't go, 'cause I'm fading away, oh
Soul to soul, between you and me
Chain me down, but I am still free, ohEmbed
