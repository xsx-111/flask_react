Magic Lantern Lyrics
When you look inside
My magic lantern
All the world is yet unseen
Try to gaze into
The yellow glowing
To get a reflection of me

In a land of make believe and magic
You can be just anything you feel
You think that what you're in is a dream
But know that the lantern is near

With the magic lantern
Take a trip around the world
With the magic lantern
There's a thousand
Mysteries unfurled
And I know one of them
Oh

I remember your face
Can't remember the place
Here on our own
Living alone, oh
Chu-chu-du-du
Chu-chu-chu-du
Chu-chu-du-du
Chu-chu-chu-du

You can dream that
You're a man of power
Ready to be happy with your gold
Without love your mind is going sour
Money's no good when you're old

With the magic lantern
You can have the sky above
Yeah, the magic lantern
You'll buy everything but love
Everything but loveEmbed
