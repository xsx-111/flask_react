Real Turned On Lyrics
Girl, before you go now
There's one thing I wanted to do
I said I'd take you back
'Cause I wanna make love to you

You got me real turned on
Yes, you have

But there's something in your eyes
Telling me you have to go, oh yeah
Something in your eyes
But you're trying not to let it show, oh yeah

You got me real turned on

Next time you come over
I'll buy you a bottle of wine, oh
Just take a little drink
And everything will turn out fine, yes, it will

Whoa, baby, do you know
What I've got in mind?
Can you guess what it is?
Or do you want it underlined?
Ooh, yeah, yeah
You got me real turned
Got me real turned
Got me real turned
Got me real turned
On!Embed
