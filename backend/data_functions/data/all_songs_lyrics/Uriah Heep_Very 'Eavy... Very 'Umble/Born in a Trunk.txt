Born in a Trunk Lyrics
Woah-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh
Ha

You were born in a trunk
Everyone talkin' about you
You were born in a trunk
Where would they be without you?

You better move off the rails
People begin to look sideways
You better move off the rails
You won't even listen to my way, yeah

I'm livin' in shame
People say I don't matter
I'm livin' in shame
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
You were born in a trunk
Everyone talkin' about you
You were born in a trunk
Where would they be without you?

You better move off the rails
People begin to look sideways
You better move off the rails
You won't even listen to my wayEmbed
