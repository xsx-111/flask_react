Lucy Blues Lyrics
Well, the very first time
I saw you, darling
Not one single word
Would come to my lips
Yes, the very first time
I saw you, darling
Not one single word
Would come to my lips

You see, I was so afraid
You wouldn't love me
I wanna tell you right now, yeah
I was frightened
Right down to my fingertips

So baby, when you went away
That unlucky day last September
I was like a little lost boy
In the wilderness
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
When you went away
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
I was like a little lost boy
In the wilderness
And I've just been sitting here
Thinking of everybody
I've ever known, yeah
Well, you know
I still love you the best
Yeah, the best1Embed
