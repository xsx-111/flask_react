Wake Up (Set Your Sights) Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh yeah

Wake up, set your sights
For never shall we fail
Stand up for your rights
And justice will prevail
You're listening through endless nights
And decision is your goal
So wake up, set your sights
For the time is right for your role
Yeah, for your role, yeah, yeah

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, set your sights
Never, never, never shall we fail
Stand up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Justice, justice, justice will prevail

There in the morning
Flying over the hills
While men are yawning
They are crushed by our wheels
Never have I witnessed people in fear
Not like today, not in many a year
Go kill another
There are more close behind
No screams of mother
Are you out of your mind?
Though they are shattered
They just don't seem to yield
Bodies are scattered
In all parts of the field
Oh, no! Did I tell you
What would happen if you tried?
"Oh, God, stop this killing!"
Said a young man before he died

Wake up, set your sights
For never shall we fail
Stand up for your rights
And justice will prevailEmbed
