Walking in Your Shadow Lyrics
I'm walking in your shadow
Ever since you went away, yeah
And the clock on the wall
Really hasn't very much to say

Oh, you left me bleeding
And left me needing you

In so very many ways
I was trying to attract your mind
But I'm the lonely one
'Cause I've had to leave it all behind, yeah

Lied and deceiving
Why should I be grieving you?
Oh yeah

Ride on a golden wave
Set sail for the sun
Make every cloud your slave
Don't be alone, oh
When I get back from my trip
Of the ocean wide
Still walking in your shadow
And still looking for somewhere to hide, yeah

If I am worse off
It's all because of you
It's all because of you

Ride on a golden wave
Set sail for the sun
Make every cloud your slave
Don't be alone, oh

When I get back from my trip
Of the ocean wide
Still walking in your shadow
And still looking for somewhere to hide

If I am worse off
It's all because of you
It's all because of you, yeah, yeahEmbed
