I Need You (Bonus Track) LyricsI need you
I need you more than birds need the sky
I need you
It's true, little girl
That you can lift these tears from my eyes
But if you ever tell me goodbye
I'll break down and you'll hear me cry
I need you
More than anybody else has needed anyone before
I need you
There's no one else to stand in your place
I need you
You know, little girl
That you can keep a smile on my face
But if you ever tell me goodbye
I'll break down and you'll hear me cry
I need you
More than anybody else has needed anyone before
I need you
There's no one else to stand in your place
I need you
You know, little girl
That you can keep a smile on my face
But if you ever tell me goodbye
I'll break down and you'll hear me cry
I need you
More than anybody else has needed anyone before
More than anybody else has needed anyone before
I need you
I need you
I need youEmbed
