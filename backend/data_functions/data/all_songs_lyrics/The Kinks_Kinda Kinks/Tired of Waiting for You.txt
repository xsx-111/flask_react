Tired of Waiting for You Lyrics
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

I was a lonely soul
I had nobody 'til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time, what can I do?

It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting

'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

I was a lonely soul
I had nobody 'til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time, what can I do?
It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting

'Cause I'm so tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

For you
For youEmbed
