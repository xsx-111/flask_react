Wait Till the Summer Comes Along (Bonus Track) LyricsI've been cryin' all the Winter
I've been waitin' for some good to come my way
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along
Dear Lord, have I done so much wrong
How can I go on
Wonderin' what I did wrong
Can it be too much to ask?
Please, oh please, let it be
If the Summer comes my way
Will I find someone to take the place of (?)
But I'll wait till the Summer comes along
Dear Lord, tell me what could I done wrong
Can it be that she
Never wanted to
Break some poor mother's heart?
Please, oh please, let it be
I know my Summer'll never come
I know I'll cry until my dyin' day has come
Let the Winter roll along
I've got nothin' left but song
Oh, oh, what's happened?
Oh, oh, what's happened?Embed
