Look for Me Baby Lyrics
(Look for me, baby)
Well, you can search
High and low if you want
But you won't find me
(Look for me, baby)
Well, you search the mountains
Look in the sea
Look all around the world
But you won't find a love

A love like mine
You'll be low and cry misery
'Cause you got no love
(Look for me, baby)
In your d-desperation, honey
You're gonna look for someone else
Well, now

Search the mountains
Search the sea
Look around the world
But you won't find me
(Look for me, baby)
You'll be lookin' for me
(Look for me, baby)
Well, now
I've never felt so sad
I've never had it so bad
You'll search the oceans
But you won't find me no more
You'll be lookin' for me

(Look for me, baby)
Well, you can search
High and low if you want
But you won't find me
(Look for me, baby)
Well, you can a-climb the mountains
And swim in the sea
Look all around the world
But you won't find a love

A love like mine
You'll be low and cry misery
'Cause you got no love
(Look for me, baby)
Well, in your desperation, honey
You're gonna look for love
In someone else
Well, now
Search the mountains
Search the sea
Look around the world
But you won't find me

(Look for me, baby)
You'll be lookin' for me
(Look for me, baby)
You'll be lookin' for me
(Look for me, baby)
You'll be lookin' for me
(Look for me, baby)...Embed
