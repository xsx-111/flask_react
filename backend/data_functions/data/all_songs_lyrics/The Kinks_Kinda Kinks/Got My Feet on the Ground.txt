Got My Feet on the Ground LyricsI want a lot out of life
But I know my limitations
Guess I want a lot of things
And got my inclinations
Got my feet on the ground
And I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I've learned a lot out of life
Watchin' other folks' mistakes
I wanted things that they can't get
For finding out too late
I got my feet on the ground
And I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Well, I don't need nobody else
All I need's a single ticket
When I travel on my own
Not afraid to be alone
I got my feet upon the ground
And I'm standing on my own
Well, I've travel far and wide
And I'm looking for a four-leaf clover
Don't mind if I can't find it
Got no chip upon my shoulder
Got my feet on the ground
And I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Well, I don't need nobody else
All I need's a single ticket
When I travel on my own
Not afraid to be alone
I got my feet upon the ground
And I'm standing on my own
Well, I've travel far and wide
And I'm looking for a four-leaf clover
Don't mind if I can't find it
Got no chip upon my shoulder
Got my feet on the ground
And I'm standing on my own
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one...Embed
