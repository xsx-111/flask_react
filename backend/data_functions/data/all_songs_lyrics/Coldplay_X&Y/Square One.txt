Square One Lyrics
You're in control, is there anywhere you wanna go?
You're in control, is there anything you wanna know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want...
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top I can't get back
Woah, woah

First line of the first page
To the end of the last day
You were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want...
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are
Oooh
You just want somebody listening to what you say
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too?
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone as if you'd been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Well, if you're stuck in square one13Embed
