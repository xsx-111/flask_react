X&Y Lyrics
Trying hard to speak
And fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Anyway you can

I dive in at the deep end
You become my best friend
I wanna love you
But I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Anyway I can
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh10Embed
