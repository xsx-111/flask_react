Love Child LyricsEveryone is telling me
That he was born as a love child
By looking in his eyes
Something turned me loose in this hot night
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane - don't know why
I can feel your sex
Winding up the girl in the red dress
And my brain is gone
What is going on? I'm burning inside
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane - don't know why
A love child, running wild
A love child
A love child, running wild
A love child, love child
I gotta tell myself
That he was born as a love child
And the story of his way
Should not make me stay in this hot night
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane - don't know why
A love child, running wild
A love child
A love child, running wild
A love child, love child
Don't know what I am, a woman or a man
Many troubles behind me
I'm doing all I can but I'm what I am
Leave me alone, don't mistreat me
Feeling the power of lust when the guy's passing by
Wrecking one's brain and I'm going insane - don't know why
A love child, running wild
A love child
A love child, running wild
A love child, love childEmbed
