Head Over Heels LyricsLate at night in the park
I saw them slipping in the dark
For heaven sake, what's going on?
It's like someone is here
Gotta follow now
Like being in a trance for me
There's silence here
More than all the noise
Spurting in the dark, head over heels
Overheated heart, head over heels
Treating it so hard, the spurting feels
Every day, every night
Spurting in the dark, head over heels
Overheated heart, head over heels
Treating it so hard, the spurting feels
Oh yeah
Down on my knees, God help me please
Gotta know who's out in the dark
I've stopped my breath, can't feel the hands
Could hear the sound of people making love
I surrender right now
I've to be touched
I feel so much
Spurting in the dark, head over heels
Overheated heart, head over heels
Treating it so hard, the spurting feels
Every day, every night
Spurting in the dark, head over heels
Overheated heart, head over heels
Treating it so hard, the spurting feels
Yeah
Spurting in the dark, head over heels
Overheated heart, head over heels
Treating it so hard, the spurting feels
Every day, every night
Spurting in the dark, head over heels
Overheated heart, head over heels
Treating it so hard, the spurting feels
Every day, every night
Spurting in the dark, head over heelsEmbed
