Turn Me On LyricsI can't wait to get you
Down on the dirty floor
I know it ain't a place
But come on and close the door
I'm coming down for pleasure
For head games all night long
Yes indeed, I wanna have it now
All what you've gotta give
I'm coming to the point
Where I can't hold myself
You shouldn't hold it back
It has to be done
Please turn me on, turn me on, I can't hold it
Please turn me on, turn me on, I explode
Please turn me on, turn me on, I can't hold it
Please turn me on, turn me on, I explode
It would be good to do it in the nice way
But sorry, I ain't got no time
I know you would like some light
But sorry, here is no lamp
So please don't stop the feeling
Please come close to me
I've gotta feel your hand
To bring it to an end
I'm coming to the point
Where I can't hold myself
You shouldn't hold it back
It has to be done
Please turn me on, turn me on, I can't hold it
Please turn me on, turn me on, I explode
Please turn me on, turn me on, I can't hold it
Please turn me on, turn me on, I explode
Baby, that was a hot lick, but someone's banging the door
Believe me, I'm sorry to stop you, but I'm coming back for more
It was more than I could ask for, sorry, babe, I've gotta go
Guess there's more than two now, who wants to break the door
Please babe, I've gotta go, you have been really good
I know you want some more, but what can I do - let's go ahead
Please turn me on, turn me on, I can't hold it
Please turn me on, turn me on, I explode
Please turn me on, turn me on, I can't hold it
Please turn me on, turn me on, I explodeEmbed
