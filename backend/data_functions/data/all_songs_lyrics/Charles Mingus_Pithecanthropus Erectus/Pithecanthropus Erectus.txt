Pithecanthropus Erectus Lyrics
There's a cold wind blowing
Downtown tonight
Oh, I'm all done
Walking around, I don't feel right
I'm so used to feeling warm
Having you hanging on my arm
I can't believe you just cut me loose
You're gonna look good in blues
They still got a cool band
In the little club where we used to go
But I don't feel the dance
Tonight I'm just too low
I gave it all I had
You say "Baby, well that's too bad"
But you'll have to pay the dues
And you're gonna look good in blues
Back in the real world
No dreams no plans
Keeping a low profile
Just getting by the best I can
But you can't kick a heart around
And leave it in pieces on the ground
Baby, it's gonna catch up with you
And you'll look good in blues
You're gonna look good in bluesEmbed
