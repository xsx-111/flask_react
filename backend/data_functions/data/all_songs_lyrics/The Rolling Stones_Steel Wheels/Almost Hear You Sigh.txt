Almost Hear You Sigh Lyrics
I can almost hear you sigh
I can almost hear you cry
On every crowded street
All the places we would meet
What'll I do without you?
They say that life goes on
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I can't believe you're gone

And you acted much too calm
You turned on all the charm
You had a cold look in your eyes

I can feel your tongue on mine
Silky smooth like wine
I'm living with these memories
That's all that's left of you and me

I can almost hear you sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you made sweet love to me
And you turned on all the charm
Acted much too calm
You had a cold look in your eyes
Did it mean nothing
Was it all in vain?
Or was I just your fool?
Or was the pleasure pain?
Have you set me free?
Or will I wake up in the morning
And find out it's been a bad dream?
Come on, I beg you
I want to be your main man


I can almost hear you sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you made sweet love to me
I can almost see your smile
It stretched half a mile
You had a stone cold look in your eyes

Yeah
Oh
Come on
Almost see you laugh
I don't need no photograph
Come on, come on, girl
Nothing left to say now
I can't believe, can't believe you're gone
I just can't believe, can't believe you're gone
No, no
Come on, baby, yeahEmbed
