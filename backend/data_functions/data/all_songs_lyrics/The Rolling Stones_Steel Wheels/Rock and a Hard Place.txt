Rock and a Hard Place Lyrics
The fields of Eden are full of trash
And if we beg and we borrow and steal
We'll never get it back
People are hungry, they crowd around
And the city gets bigger as the country comes begging to town

We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place

This talk of freedom and human rights
Means bullying and private wars
And chucking all the dust into our eyes
And peasant people, poorer than dirt
Who are caught in the crossfire
End up nothing to lose but their shirts, yeah

We're stuck between a rock
And a hard place
Between a rock
And a hard place
You'd better stop
Put on a kind face
Between a rock
And a hard place
We're in the same boat on the same sea
And we're sailing south on the same breeze
Building dream churches with silver spires
And our rogue children are playing loaded dice

You'd better stop, yeah, give it all you got
Give me the truth now, don't want no shame
I'd be hung, drawn and quartered for a sheep
Just as well as a lamb

Stuck between a rock and a hard place
A rock and a hard place
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
Can't you see what you've done to me?
Between a rock and a hard place (That's what I said)
Between a rock and a hard place (Yeah)
You'd better stop (Stop, yeah, you'd better stop)
Put on a kind face (Just a little smile)
Yeah, come on now, yeah
Between a rock and a hard place
Between a rock and a hard place
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
You'd better stop, put on a kind face
Between a rock and a hard place
Between a rock and a hard placeEmbed
