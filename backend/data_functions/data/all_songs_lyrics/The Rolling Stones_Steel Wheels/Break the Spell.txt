Break the Spell Lyrics
In the winter when the cold comes
And the wind blows with a scornful spite
And the hard ground feels barren
And the forest seems deathly quiet
And the whole world lies sleeping
There's a gypsy all dressed in white

Put my hand out, ask the question
Here's the silver, do you have the gift of sight?
Can you break the spell? Can you ring the bell?
Can you break the spell? It's cold, black as night
I've got a hard heart since we've been apart
Can you break the spell? Break it all down tonight

In the springtime when the floods come
And the earth bursts with the terrible light
And the sun splash on the window
There's a gypsy and he's all dressed in white
My heart burns with the question
Can you break the spell? Still hot as fire
Can you break the spell? Can you ring the bell?
Can you break the spell? It's cold, black as night
Cold, black as nightEmbed
