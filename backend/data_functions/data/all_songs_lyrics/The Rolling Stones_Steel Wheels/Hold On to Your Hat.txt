Hold On to Your Hat Lyrics
Hold on to your head
Hold on to your hat
You're screaming down the alley
And never coming back
Back
Get out of my bed
Get out of the sack
Don't give me no lip
Don't you give me no crap
No way

Get out the madhouse
Tear it all down
Get out the madhouse
Burn it to the ground
Got to, got to get out
Yeah

Get out of my face
Get out of my shack
Now you've had a fair share
You had a fair whack
Yeah
Hold on to your butt
Hold on to your hat
You're heading out of here
And never coming back
Get out the madhouse
Tear it all down
Get out the madhouse
Burn it to the ground
We got to make it
Don't you fake it
You getting loaded
I'm getting goaded
Got to, got to get out
Come on baby


Hold on to your heart
Hold on to your hat
Don't give me no shit
Don't you give me no crap
Woo
Hold on to your head
Don't give me no rap
I've had it up to here
With your yackety-yak

You're getting loaded
I'm getting goaded
We'll never make it
Don't fake it
Get out the madhouse
Tear it all down
Get out the madhouse
Burn it to the ground
Got to, got to get out
Got to get out
Come on baby
Come on baby
Burn it all down, ah yeah
I'm over with you baby
I'm over with you baby
Get up, get out
Get up, get out
Get upEmbed
