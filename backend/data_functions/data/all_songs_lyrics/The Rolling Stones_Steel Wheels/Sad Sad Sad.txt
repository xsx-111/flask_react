Sad Sad Sad Lyrics
Fling you out into orbit
No one's going to hear you shout
And fools ain't going to follow
You don't need to sleaze about

Now you're sad, sad, sad
Sad, sad, sad
Sad, sad, sad
But you're going to be fine

The elephant's in the bedroom
Throwing all his weight about
And I'm locked in the bathroom
Your screams are going to drown me out

Now you're sad, sad, sad
Sad, sad, sad
Sad, sad, sad
But you're going to be fine
Oh yeah

I got a cold chill
I get a cool thrill
Are you ready for the gilded cage?
Are you ready for the tears of rage?
Come on baby, don't let them drown you out
Oh yeah

Now you're sad, sad, sad
Bad, bad, bad
Sad, sad, sad
But you're going to be fine
Now you're sad, sad, sad
Sad, sad, sad
Sad, sad, sad
But you're going to be fine

You're going to be fine
You're going to be fine
You're going to be fine, fine, fine
You're going to be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Going to be fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine, fineEmbed
