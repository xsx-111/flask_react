Hearts for Sale Lyrics
My spirit is winging, my soul is free
I'm doing my drinking in good company
The music's screaming, my feet are flying
Everybody's laughing and nobody's crying
A sneak suspicion, it drags me down
A nagging feeling going 'round

Hearts for sale
Going cheap
Hearts for sale
Lovers' leap

My belly's full, my glass is brimming
The women look so beautiful and I feel like singing
The voice of conscience, the voice of reason
Is yacking in my plans, I call that treason

Hearts for sale
They're going cheap
Hearts for sale
Lovers' leap
I'm losing my willpower, my blood's running cold
My body's on pause and my mind's stuck on hold
What am I going to do about it?


A sneak suspicion, it drags me down
Nagging feeling a-going 'round

Hearts for sale
They're going cheap
A heart for sale
Blood runs deep
Hearts for sale

I don't need no doctor (Hearts for sale)
I need a deputation
I tell you if you don't want my loving
You can just take my resignation (Hearts for sale)
(Hearts for sale)
(Hearts for sale)
(Hearts for sale)
I'm under the hammer
I'm a full time worker (Hearts for sale)
I'm a real body slammerEmbed
