Slipping Away Lyrics
Guess it's just another dream that's slipping away
Each time that I fall asleep it seems I'm drifting away

Just as you have touched my heart
Babe I wake and we're apart
Yeah and it's slipping away

Here comes just another day that's drifting away
Every time I draw a breath it's dying away

First the sun and then the moon
One of them will be 'round soon
Slipping away
Slipping away
Ooh yeah

Drifting away
You see me slipping away

Just as you have touched my heart
I wake up babe and we're apart
It seems we're slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
All I want is ecstasy
But I ain't getting much
Just getting off on misery
It seems I've lost my touch

Well it's just another song but it's slipping away
Well we didn't sing it long 'cause it's fading away

First the sun and then the moon
One of them will be 'round soon
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away

Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
I just can't keep on hold on, baby
Slipping away
Drifting
Slipping away
Slipping away
Just slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping away
Slipping awayEmbed
