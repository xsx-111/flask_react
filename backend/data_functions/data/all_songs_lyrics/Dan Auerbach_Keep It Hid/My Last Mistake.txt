My Last Mistake Lyrics
Tell me now, tell me true
Of all the things I did to you
Was this the one that made you break
Did I make my last mistake

Only you can play the game
Rope-a-dope and lay the blame
Can't you see my body shake
'Cause I made my last mistake

I was out of line before
But this is so much more I know, I know
I don't want to be the king
Of every single living thing, just you
And you can be my queen, mama
Oh yeah, yeah

Separate towns, separate hearts
Distant love from distant parts
Every man plays the snake
Bound to make his last mistake
Oh yeah
My my my my my

My last mistake
Last mistake
Oh my last mistake
My last mistakeEmbed
