Keep It Hid Lyrics
Lock the door and close the blinds
They're coming for me girl and I ain't got time
If they ask you, darlin', oh about what I did
Baby, you gotta keep it hid
Oh keep it hid

I'm heading south and I can't say where
But I'll phone you baby soon as I get there
They're not gonna, not gonna, not gonna seal my coffin lid
'Cause you gonna keep it hid
Yeah keep it hid

Well Big Sue knew but she don't no more
If you know what I mean, yeah
They'll never find what they're looking for
'Cause you're my tight-lipped queen


I'll buy you a dress, a nice handmade piece
And send your Mom on a vacation to Greece
If you're an auction, oh I'm the highest bid
Yeah baby, 'cause you gonna keep it hid
Yeah keep it hid
You gonna tell nobody
Oh yeah yeah keep it hid
You gonna tell nobody
Yeah yeah tell nobody
Tell nobody, oh yeah
Tell nobody, keep it hid
Keep it hid, baby, keep it hidEmbed
