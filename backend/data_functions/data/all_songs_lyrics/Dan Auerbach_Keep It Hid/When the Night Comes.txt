When the Night Comes Lyrics
When the night comes
And you lay your weary head to rest
No more trials, no tests
When the night comes
When the night comes
You don't have to have to be afraid
Of any choice you made
When the night comes

Don't be afraid
You're only dreaming
Don't be afraid
You're only dreaming

When the night comes
The headlines read
Whatever's in your dreams
When the night comes, oh
When the night comes
And you lay by the one you love
The one who knows you, the things you do
When the night comes
Don't be afraid
You're only dreaming
Don't be afraid
You're only dreaming

When the night comes
When the night comes
When the night comes
When the night comesEmbed
