Heartbroken, In Disrepair Lyrics
There is no light, there is no charm (charm)
All my belongings, I hold in one arm (arm)
Under the bridge, asleep in the shade (shade)
All of the terrible choices that I made

Searching for light, gasping for air
Heartbroken, in disrepair

God may forgive me, but that's not enough (enough)
'Cause I gotta live with myself, 'till I'm dust (dust)
Just walk on by, if we pass on the street (street)
Sometimes in battle, it's best to retreat

Searching for light, gasping for air
Heartbroken, in disrepair1Embed
