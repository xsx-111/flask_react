Real Desire Lyrics
I know that you're wanted
By every little man in town
Take your pick and baby they'll serve you, yeah
Oh but you, you will put them down

Talk but never listen
Is how you want to play your game
Try that stuff on me baby
Oh and I will, I will do the same

'Cause you wanna set the world on fire
A little man will never do
The things you think are real desire
Oh darlin', oh I, I see right through

Clouded skies have lifted
And voices ring out from the choir
If you say you never meant to hurt me, darlin'
Oh, you would be a liar

'Cause you wanna set the world on fire
And a little man will never do
The things you think are real desire
Oh darlin', you know I, I see right through, yeahEmbed
