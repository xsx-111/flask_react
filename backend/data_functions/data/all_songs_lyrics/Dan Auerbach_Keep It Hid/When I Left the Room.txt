When I Left the Room Lyrics
She used to make me feel
Like I could do no wrong
I sang a happy tune
Her name was in my song
But now her eyes foretell
Only impending doom
And I just want to know
What she said when I left the room

We had a plan
That if we sacked away
Go and buy that place
Down in Santa Fe
Then some kids
Oh, they would follow soon
But I just got to know
What she said when I left the room

Paranoia, heart destroyer
I feel like I could die
My mind is gone 'cause you moved on
Still I don't know why
Voices in my head
Ring like a sonic boom
Oh I got to know
What she said when I left the room


She left a year ago
With my record collection
Now all I have
Is my own reflection
I reckon, if she moved
Away to the moon, the moon
I'd still want to know
What she said when I left the room

I'd still want to know
What she said when I left the room
Yeah
Oh I'd still want to know
What she said when I left the roomEmbed
