Mean Monsoon Lyrics
The summer sun has got me crazy
Playing tricks with my poor mind
You said you had another man
And I said I guess I didn't mind
What's he got that I ain't got
Besides stability
Can he drive all night and never stop
Well I guess you have to wait and see

I heard a voice call to me
Saying some day you're gonna be free

Put a dollar in the jukebox
Don't you play our favorite tune
'Cause seeing you dance to that
Is only gonna bring me to ruin
Someday sunny sounds will soothe me
But it won't happen soon
'Cause the cloud you left hanging over
Is raining like a mean monsoon
I heard a voice call to me
Saying some day you're gonna be freeEmbed
