Whispered Words (Pretty Lies) Lyrics
I hear words, pretty lies
Like the ones they tell you before you die
Whispered words, soft and low
Push me anywhere she want to go

I hear words in my head
Each and every thing she ever said
Every sign, every line
Tricked me into falling one more time

If you need me, you're here
If you don't, you're nowhere near
I should have quit a long time ago

I hear words, in my sleep
Promises you made but never keep
Even in my dreams
I try to fight but I don't ever win

If you need me, you're here
If you don't, you're nowhere near
I should have quit a long time ago, oh3Embed
