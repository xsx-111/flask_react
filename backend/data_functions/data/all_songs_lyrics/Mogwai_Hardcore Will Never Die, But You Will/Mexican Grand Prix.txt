Mexican Grand Prix LyricsFast love
Heart breaker
Wrong taken in a day, or less
Is this what you meant
By fire?
My passion
A mistake?
(Run and see
Keep runnin' now...
Keep runnin' now
I run and see)
I run and see
(Keep runnin' now)
Keep runnin' now
(Run and see.)
I run and see
(Run and see)
Keep runnin' now
(Runnin' now.)
All because I wouldn’t say you’re mine
All because I wouldn’t say
All because I let you live your li(f)e
Let you be in your own way
(I run and see)
You said
(Keep runnin' now)
I will take her
(Run and see)
'Cause you're lost in...??
(Keep runnin' now)
Keep runnin' now
(I run and see.)
I can't let you
(Keep runnin' now)
Forget me
Can't get you
(Run and see)
Out my head, yeah
(Runnin' now.)
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now
Keep' runnin' now, keep' runnin' now...
Come close
At your window
Drawn curtains on weekdays
Head ringer
Think bigger
Say bye to the child you became
{I run and see
Keep runnin' now
I run and see...
Keep runnin' now
I run and see
Keep runnin' now
Run and see
Runnin' now
Run and see
Runnin' now...
High pressure
Long letter
Feel better
O, You’ll be fine
High pressure
Long letter
Feel better
O, You’ll be fineEmbed
