George Square Thatcher Death Party LyricsGive up your town, this side of yard
A stupid mom that took my house
Too much of reform but 
But we were sure we were in your heart
I am still moved by some new doubt:
Am I too much work, so I need a break?
Am I so livid, false-spirit?
Am I  so I can say anything?
In different years, between each line
You took our town, we took your side
I am de-progress decided
I take your time; I make my time
Terror, I need to be honest:
I canâ€™t believe you would make up a speech like that
Say shit much bigger to scare us
Untie me right now, so I can hit the deck1Embed
