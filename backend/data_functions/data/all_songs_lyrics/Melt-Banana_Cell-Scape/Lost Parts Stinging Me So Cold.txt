Lost Parts Stinging Me So Cold LyricsMaybe just a dead sign
Speaking to my eyes shaking, I can think of
A piece of broken fifth hand
Reaching to my head falling, I can think of
Closing my eyes tight
I can hear the sounds of my fellows
They are sounding so cold...
They are sounding so cold...
"Maybe just a ghost"
You say and forget about it
I stopped talking
Then a piece of cracked tooth
Talking to my nail stinging
I can snatch out
So cold, lost parts
They are stinging me so cold
I know where they live in the past
Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to kill the dead ghost, shoot!
But I got a miss shot
Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to shoot them down
They stay in my footsteps...
Maybe just a red dot
Attacking to my toe tender I can think of
Some forgotten small seeds
Singing to my ear, scratchy
They are sounding so cold
Lost parts
They are stinging me so cold
I know they live in the past
Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to kill the dead ghost, shoot!
But I got a miss shot
Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to shoot them down
They stay in my footsteps
I gave up and then put the gun down...
It's maybe just a piece of lost dead past
Fallen from the trash can, forgettable
Creeping, trying to find a space to be
Kind of a piece of puzzle, never been solved
Fifty thousands foot steps still going on
No place to be, I can think of
Closing my eyes tight
I can feel them
Cause they are my fellows
Lived in the past
Loved in the past
Used in the past
Lost in the past
Where will they go
Instead of my pride?
They are sounding so cold
So cold, lost parts
They are stinging me so cold
I know where they live in the past
Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to kill the dead ghost, shoot!
But I got a miss shot
Don't stick it, kick it out, shut down!
Don't stick it, pick it out, shut down!
Don't take it, get it back
I tried to shoot them down
They stay in my footsteps
I gave up and then put the gun down...Embed
