A Dreamer Who is Too Weak to Face Up To LyricsHe can do whatever he wants
He can see whatever he wants
He can do whatever he needs
Whatever he hates, whatever he dreams
Actually, he's been in a dream
He can hide in the halo
He can run into the terror
He can fly into the Jello
"I can do what I want, I can die when I wish!"
He can fit into the pocket
He can set a bomb in a coffin
He can live down in the sea
"I can fly when I want, I can die when I wish to!
Get my foot prints back to
See the place where I'm standing still
Where I hate, it's so sad
Dying world, so I'm fine in here!"
He can hide in the halo
He can run into the terror
He can fly into the Jello
"I can do what I want, I can die when I wish!"
He can jump into the pillow
He can break into the PD
He can gulp the DU
"I can play when I want, I can die when I wish!"
So he cries to the white moon
To the inside, to see the Cell-Scape
To the inside, to see the Cell-Scape
Now he's floating in blood
He can hide in the halo
He can run into the terror
He can fly into the Jello
"I can do what I want, I can die when I wish!"
He can set a bug on line
He can make a pig fly
He can shoot the spy dog
"I can lie when I feel, I can cry when I feel!"
Dream in vain, he's hiding in the halo
Dream in vain, he's hiding in the terror
Dream in vain, he's hiding in the shelter
What else he got?
But now it's time out!
To the inside, to see the Cell-Scape
To the inside, to see the Cell-Scape
To the inside, to see the Cell-Scape
What your name? Wake up!
What your fate? Wake up!
What your name? Wake up!
What your aim? Wake up!
But he's too greedy to face up to
He can hide in the halo
He can run into the terror
He can fly into the Jello
"I can do what I want, I can die when I wish!"
He can fit into the pocket
He can set a bomb in a coffin
He can live down in the sea
"I can fly when I want, I can die when I wish to!
Dream in vain, he's hiding in the halo
Dream in vain, he's hiding in the terror
Dream in vain, he's hiding in the shelter
"I can die when I wish!"
And he gets a pin to stab his eyes
Again and again, and he smiles, now
He's back!Embed
