A Shield for Your Eyes, a Beast in the Well on Your Hand LyricsCatch the mean beast
In the well, in the hell, on the back
Watch out, you've got no shield!
Break up, he's got no peace!
Breathe deep
In the shade in the fade of the luck
Watch out, you've got no light!
No pure cell can live
Shoot the first head
Shoot the first hand
Press the "Greed"
Get the pale shield for your eyes
Shoot the third eye
Shoot the third line
Press the "Blood"
Watch out, watch out, watch out for the beam
Shoot the first head
Shoot the last tail
Press the "Risk"
Get the hale shield for your eyes
I just need to hit to kick the dead eye
Press the next eye
I can get so...
Liquid eye, sticky eye, tricky eye
How to fake to steal?
Your heart's got cracked!
Get the new toy, it's falling in 50 parts
Break up, you've got no paste!
Throw out, it's biting your fate like a bait, like a sweet dust!
You've got no hand
And no pure cell can cross
Shoot the first head
Shoot the first hand
Press the "Greed"
Get the pale shield for your eyes
Shoot the third eye
Shoot the third line
Press the "Blood"
Watch out for the beam
Shoot the first head
Shoot the last tail
Press the "Risk"
Get the hale shield for your eyes
I just hate to say to pay the dead eye
Press the next light
I can get so...
Liquid eye, Sticky eye
Tricky eye, Flashy eye
How to fake?
How to make 50 times
More eyes to get cracked?
Your heart's got plastic
Catch the mean beast
In the well on your hand on your left
Wake up, you've got no fist!
Look up, no peace will be seen!
In your hand in the shade of your mind
Watch out, you've got no right!
Your pure cell can't spark
Shoot the first head
Shoot the first hand
Press the "Greed"
Get the pale shield for your eyes
Shoot the third eye
Shoot the third line
Press the "Blood"
Watch out, watch out, watch out for the beam
Shoot the first head
Shoot the last tail
Press the "Risk"
Get the hale shield for your eyes
I just need to hit to kick the dead eye
Press the next eye
I can get so...
Liquid eye, sticky eye
Tricky eye, flashy eye
Where to fake?
Where to make?
One step more to get my shotEmbed
