Key is a Fact That a Cat Brings LyricsLet me see what you need
Make your brain breath
Like a screen seen in your wheeze
Let it go, Let it shine
A Key in a Bean
Cats can bring you the facts, cheap
So you buy some tired weeds to get dreams
And your cat escapes
You say
"Here's a pill, get fine!"
I don't want that 'cause I don't trust you at all
Can you see what I see
I doubt it, the sight's so mean
What that mean?
At least like a key, Let it be, Let it die
Sheep in a Peace
You can lead to beat to heel
Meat?
You can't get that no way!
Let me see what you keep
In your secret cheese rotten!
A Screen seen in your dream
Let it down, let it fade
Key in a Bead
There's no factor you can keep to use
Make some poison tea to get free
Your cat says. "Leave!!"
Catch me like a little toy, neat like a wheel
Catch me like a little bug, Be like a Pea
Catch me like a little toy, Neat like so Mean
Catch a bee like a geek
Catch a thief like a leap
You say, "Here's a key, Get it right"
I don't want that 'cause I know
It's not a key neededEmbed
