A Hunter in the Rain to Cut the Neck Up in the Present Stage LyricsCut your neck up!
Last one hail, in the shock
Last one snail, in the shock
Last one tail, in the shock
Just like a nasty rat. rusty shred
I can see no pulsy but easy shriek
I don't need it
What you wanna play?
Don't you steal my ray!
To cut your neck up!
Last one hail, in the shock
Last one snail, in the shock
Last one tail, in the shock
At last no set left now
Biting like a shifty bat
I can get the sound wave
Facing to a risky cat, choky trap
I can see no shiny pulse twisted in the cage
Heading like a lousy gut, fancy jet
I can catch no slung tongue for my key
Let it shout!
Don't you wanna say what you wanna see?
Don't you slay what
You wanna play to get your neck shout?
Last one hail, in the shock
Last one snail, in the shock
Last one tail, in the shock
At last no set left now
Cleave, Scatter the wave
Plead, Shatter the rave
Brave kid to believe...
I can see no luck
I can point no risk
Dead like a pet like a pain-head in the chapter
I can see no pain
I can see no sane
Fled to a shaft to a bed in a shelter
A hunter in the rain
A creeper in the rain
Swim like a sweeper
Twist like a duster
Sing like a cheater
Smile like a...?Embed
