If It is the Deep Sea, I Can See You There LyricsMe, Sleep like a shell to the future
A quite slight sigh, Be a bubble
You, Sleep like a shell from the past
A quite slight tone. no end
You head to the end
Since you were born
Seeing and showing
So many beautiful facts and lies
What is left in your hand?
A piece of fossil
Spinning around and squeaking
But still even that is taken by the wind
A cat is dying on your left
But you just left it there
A bird is flying out from you
But you just left it there
So many people passed by talking and smiling
You didn't say a word squeezing
So they now melted in the dark
Flies you spat out
Now become sweet maggots
You put them and save them in a can
But you suddenly smashed it down
You hear a far voice calling your name
You tried to go home to rest but
You know even now you don't have a home
You bleed and your flesh fell off
And a red line shows us your way
Me, Sleep like a shell to the future
A quite slight sign, Be a bubble
You, Sleep like a shell from the past
A quite slight tone. no end
You step on the stones
You throw cells out
Creating and showing
So many shinny knives to rust
Is it your sin?
Is it your pain?
You try to ignore and leave the place
But with them
You got deep signs on your face
A cat is scratching biting your shoes
You just left it there
A bird is shouting out sad songs loud
You just left it there
So many things passed by
With sneaking and laughing
You don't chase and tame them
So they are now blown off in the air
You head to the end
You are still on the way
Seeing and showing
So many beautiful facts and fakes
Where are you heading to?
Where is your end to settle?
You will find out
If it is the deep sea, I can see you there
Your head spoiled and fell
Your feet split and melt
Your eyes shine, about to sink
I can kiss you good-byeEmbed
