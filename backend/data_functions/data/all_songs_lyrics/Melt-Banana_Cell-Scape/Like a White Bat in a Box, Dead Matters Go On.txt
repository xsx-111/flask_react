Like a White Bat in a Box, Dead Matters Go On LyricsCheck out if you see one just in case
Dead matters go on and on and on
Check if you see one
Check just in case
It's dead
See, a white bat in a box
It's skinny like a bone
His name is "pain"
What a name he got! it's pity like alone
"Where did my eyes go?" he goes
"Where's my cave?" he goes
So I go, "You don't have one"
So I go, "You don't have one"
He just stays
Hide in a pain
Hide in a pain
Hide in a jail, like a lofty shack
Dead matters go on
See, a white frog on a shelf
It's stinky like a cheese
His name is "shame"
What a name he lost! it's waste like blame
"When is my meal?" he goes
"When can I swim?" he goes
So I go, "You won't get one"
So I go, "You won't get one"
Hide in a pain
Hide in a pain
Hide in a jail, like a lofty shack
Hide in a pain
Hide in a pain
Hide in a wail
But I don't wanna burn it down
Dead matters go on
First one was dead
Next one was a crap
Third one was killed
No one wants the next one
Fourth one was a pig
Fifth one was damned
Next one was a freak
Who the hell wants the next one?
Just it goes on...
Just it goes on...
Just it goes on...
Who the hell wants the next one?
See, a white skull on the wall
It's shinny like a god
His name is "greed"
What a good name he got!
It's just like how he used to be
"Where's my soul?" he weeps like
"Where's my gold?" he rages
So I go, "You just sold one"
So I go, "You don't need one"
'cause you're deadEmbed
