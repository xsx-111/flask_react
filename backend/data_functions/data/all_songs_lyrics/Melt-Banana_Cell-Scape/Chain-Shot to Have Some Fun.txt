Chain-Shot to Have Some Fun LyricsI can see it
I can feel it
I can point it
It's heading straight to the brain
I don't stop it
I don't reject it
I don't shoot it down
What I see
What I have
What I feel
See, now it's so shining in my eyes
See, now it's so shining in your head
When it fills up the land
So sweet scape we get called chaos
It's knocking you
It's cracking
It's shouting out
Here's my chain-shot
I can laugh out
I can cry out
I can ask my head
Stinging, cutting beating smashing cells
But you don't see
But you don't care
I just need to set the seed
To blow and then shoot out
Next warhead could be my hatred
Next warhead could be your sorrow
Bet what your head will squeak out
Choose the next one or you'll be dead
It's knocking you
It's cracking
It's shouting out
Here's my chain-shot
It's knocking you
It's cracking
It's shouting out
Here's my chain-shot
Next chain-shot
My chain-shot
Hate to the one
Bait to the next shot
Sad to the one
Laugh to the next shot
Joy to the one
Craze to the next shot
Pick it, dig it, kick it
Keen kids say, "I got a headache bad!"
See, now it's so shining in my eyes
See, now it's so shining in your head
When it fills up the land
So sweet scape we get called chaos
It's knocking you
It's cracking
It's shouting out
Here's my chain-shot
Next warhead could be my hatred
Next warhead could be your sorrow
Bet what your head will squeak out
Choose the next one or you'll be dead
It's knocking you
It's cracking
It's shouting out
Here's my chain-shot
It's knocking you
It's cracking
It's shouting out
Here's my chain-shot
Next chain-shot
