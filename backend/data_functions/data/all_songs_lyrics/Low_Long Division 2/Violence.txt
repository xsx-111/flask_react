Violence LyricsLent you my favorite dictionary
Came back with ripped out pages
Stopped by so uninvited
Wasted good silverware on you
You can't trust violence
You can't trust violence
No, you can't trust violence
You can't trust violence
You can't trust violence
You can't trust violence
No, you can't trust violence
You can't trust violenceEmbed
