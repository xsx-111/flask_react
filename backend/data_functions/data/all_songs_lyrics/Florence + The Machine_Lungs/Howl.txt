Howl Lyrics
If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
Screaming in the dark, I howl when we're apart
Drag my teeth across your chest to taste your beating heart
My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to howl
My fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
You are the moon that breaks the night for which I have to

Howl, howl
Howl, howl

Now there's no holding back, I'm ready to attack
My blood is singing with your voice, I want to pour it out
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground
Like some child, possessed, the beast howls in my veins
I want to find you, tear out all your tenderness and

Howl, howl
Howl, howl
Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet, and turns them to hunters

(Hunters, hunters)
(Hunters, hunters)
(Hunters, hunters)
(Hunters, hunters)

The fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress
Until I wrap myself inside your arms, I cannot rest
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground
And howl, howl

Be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
Starts so soft and sweet, and turns them to hunters
A man who's pure of heart and says his prayers by night
May still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright

If you could only see the beast you've made of me
I held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
The saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
I hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground14Embed
