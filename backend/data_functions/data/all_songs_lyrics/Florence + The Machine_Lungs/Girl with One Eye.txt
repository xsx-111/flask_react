Girl with One Eye Lyrics
She told me not to step on the cracks
I told her not to fuss and relax
Well, her pretty little face stopped me in my tracks

But now she sleeps with one eye open
That's the price she'll pay

I took a knife and cut out her eye
I took it home and watched it wither and die
Well, she's lucky that I didn't slip her a smile

That’s why she sleeps with one eye open, oh
But that's the price she'll pay

I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out ‘cause you made me cry

I slipped my hand under her skirt
I said don't worry, it's not gonna hurt
Oh, my reputation's kind of clouded with dirt
That’s why you sleep with one eye open
But that's the price you'll pay

I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out ‘cause you made me cry

You made me cry
You made me cry
You made me cry

I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
And I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
And I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out ‘cause you made me cry9Embed
