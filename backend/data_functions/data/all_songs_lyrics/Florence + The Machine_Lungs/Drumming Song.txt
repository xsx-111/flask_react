Drumming Song Lyrics
There's a drumming noise inside my head
That starts when you're around
I swear that you could hear it
It makes such an almighty sound
There's a drumming noise inside my head
That throws me to the ground
I swear that you should hear it
It makes such an almighty sound

Louder than sirens, louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell

I ran to the tower where the church bells chime
I hoped that they would clear my mind
They left a ringing in my ear
But that drum's still beating loud and clear

Louder than sirens, louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
Louder than sirens, louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
Louder than sirens, louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
As I move my feet towards your body
I can hear this beat, it fills my head up
And gets louder and louder
It fills my head up and gets louder and louder

I run to the river and dive straight in
I pray that the water will drown out the din
But as the water fills my mouth
It couldn't wash the echoes out
But as the water fills my mouth
It couldn't wash the echoes out
I swallow the sound and it swallows me whole
Until there's nothing left inside my soul
As empty as that beating drum
But the song has just begun

As I move my feet towards your body
I can hear this beat, it fills my head up
And gets louder and louder
It fills my head up and gets louder and louder

There's a drumming noise inside my head
That starts when you're around
I swear that you could hear it
It makes such an almighty sound
There's a drumming noise inside my head
That starts when you're around
I swear that you could hear it
It makes such an almighty sound
Louder than sirens, louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
Louder than sirens, louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell

As I move my feet towards your body
I can hear this beat, it fills my head up
And gets louder and louder
It fills my head up and gets louder and louder12Embed
