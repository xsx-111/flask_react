Busy Bee LyricsEverybody's alright with me
Possibly you'll disagree
Busy bee watch the world go by
Everybody's alright with me
'Cause that's the way I choose to be, yeah
Everybody's on my mind
Can't sit aside and watch this world go by
That ain't me
Busy bee watch the world go by
Busy bee watch the world go by
Now everybody does their time
Those people walk in crooked lines, yeah
Everybody's got their choice
But often we don't use our voice
Busy bee watch the world go by
Busy bee watch the world go by
Busy bee watch the world go byyyyy
Yeah, busy bee watch the world go by
(The world goes by)
How could you be so blind?
(The world goes by)
Some people they just ain't satisfied
(Watch the world go by)
Uuuaaaah, yeah
(Watch the world go by)
Watch the world go by
Uuuuah, busy bee watch the world go by
Yeah, uuaaah
I always hear the school bell ring
But let the children dance and sing, yeah
Just let us find what's been lost
So many people get torn and tossed away
Busy bee watch the world go by
Uuu, busy bee watch the world go by
Busy bee watch the world go by
Yeah, yeah, yeah, c'mon
Uuuuuu, yeah
(World goes by)
World going by
(World goes by)
Sometimes we need some play
(World goes by)
And time to time some fight
(Watch the world go by)
Uuuuu, I don't need the ????? comin'
(Watch the world go by)
Watch the world! Watch the world!
(Watch the world go by)
Uuuuu, byeeeeee
Everybody's alright with meEmbed
