Come Tomorrow LyricsAbout the time I'm eight years old
I met the devil, kept my soul
Walkin' out on lakes of fire and I'm gone
Walkin' in a wonderland
And I don't really understand
The place I'm comin' to right now today
Chorus:
Come tomorrow, you could see the light
Come tomorrow. Break it right down to the place you were before
Fifteen years on down the line
I guess you'd say I'm doin' fine
Wandering down that same old road again
Walkin' in her wonderland
But Alice doesn't understand
The place she's comin' to right now today
Chorus:
Come tomorrow, you could see the light
Come tomorrow. I think you're breaking right down to the place that you were before
Move a little slower
Come a little faster, honey
On your knees, you'll be beggin' me please
As you feel the disease
You're goin' down again tonight
See me runnin', watch me fall
I guess you'd say I've finally found my own
See me cryin' and wonder why
I guess you'd say it's time to die today
Chorus:
Come tomorrow, you could see the light
Come tomorrow. I think you're breaking right down to the place that you were beforeEmbed
