Neighbor LyricsSittin' in your front yard drinkin' lemonade
Suburban life, a pretty wife, you think you've got it made
But you don't know what's in store, for you and your family
Ha, ha, I'm movin in right next door, won't you welcome me?
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
And I hope I didn't ruin your day!
Won't you be my neighbor?
Yeah, I brought my life, my ugly wife, my dirty dogs with fleas
My kid's a punk, and I'm a drunk, but this I'm sure you'll see
And you don't know, what it's like, to live in misery
C'mon and welcome to, home sweet hell, dissastifaction guaranteed
It's beautiful day in the neighborhood
And if I could I surely would
Invite you in and say...
Won't you be my neighbor?
Won't you be my neighbor?
Won't you be my neighbor?
Could you be my nieghbor?
Won't you be my neighbor?
Oh c'mon I don't think you'll find
A place to live in peace of mind
You're gonna live in misery
When you're livin' next to me!
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood...
Raaah! Won't you be now, won't you be my funky neighbor?
Well I drink, I stink, I smoke, I'm a joke
I try all night and day to get a piece of the action, a-haa
And you should know by now you're never
Gonna forget it, a-haa
Now I know just what you're thinkin'
It could be you out 'n' you're drinkin'
Don't you knock it till you try it
It could be you in a little while
I hope I didn't ruin you day!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
And I dig your wife, she sure is good
A beautiful day in the neighborhood
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ha ha ha!Embed
