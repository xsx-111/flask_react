So Damn Cool LyricsI wanna know, why the people are everywhere... and...
I wanna know, where to go if I get scared... and...
I wanna be, in a place where no one cares, and...
I, I, I wanna know you!
Because you're so damn cool!
Yeah, you're so damn cool!
I wanna feel like Im floatin in the air... and...
I wanna know if the suns gonna bleach my hair... and
I wanna know why life's just so unfair and...
I wanna know you!
Because you're so damn cool!
Yeah, you're so damn cool!
You're just so damn cool
Yeah, you're so damn cool
Who knows what I'm feelin inside of me!
And who knows if I'm feelin all right!
Who knows what I'm feelin inside of me
Who knows what is runnin around in my brain
Who knows
Who knows
Now that I'm done and I seen it
And don't think that I'm tryin to complain
Don't think I'm lyin cause I mean it
N all you people out there don't look at me to lay
All of your blame cause you need me
And you want me to go down
In flames with the rest
But I'm so sick of denyin
What is runnin around in my brainEmbed
