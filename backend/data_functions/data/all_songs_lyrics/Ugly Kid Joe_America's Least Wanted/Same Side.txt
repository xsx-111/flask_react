Same Side LyricsIt doesn't matter who you are
Or what you're gonna be
People from all walks of life
You gotta have diversity
We're all in this together
And together we shall be
You gotta be a friendly neighbor
If you're gonna live next to me
We're all livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin' down the same streets
The streets that are all around
You could be my brother
Or you could be my friend
But don't you turn your back on me
'Cause well be here 'til the end
Yeah, we're all in this together
And we all have that dream
To live in perfect harmony
Like a family that's the scene
Cause we're all...
Livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin' down the same streets
The streets that are all around
Livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Shufflin' to the same beat
The beat that is all around
Stumblin' down on D.P., keggers all around
Laughin' at the police as they try to bring us down
Hangin' with each other, yeah hangin' with our bro's
We all love one another, from our heads down to our toes
Cause we're all livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin' down the same streets
The streets that are all around
Livin' on the same side
Same side of town
Shufflin' to the same beat
The beat that is all aroundEmbed
