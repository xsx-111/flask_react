Mr. Recordman LyricsMr. Recordman, do you know who I am?
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?
I've takin' a likin' to your game
I think we all, we feel the same
Is this a dream or is it real
You say you want to cut a deal
Mr. Recordman, do you know who I am?
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?
Don't need much time to think about
I'm sure that you have got the clout
I only hope that you're my friend
And stand by me until the end
Mr. Recordman, do you know who I am?
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?
Sell a lotta records 'n' tour 'round the world
Make a lotta money 'n' meet lotsa' girls
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?
It sounds like music to my ears
I've dreamed of this for many years
To sell a lotta records 'n' tour round the world
Make a lotta money 'n' meet lotsa girls
Have a lot of fun and hang with my bro's
'Cause these boys 'n' this band is all I know
Mr. Recordman, do you know who I am?
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?
If not for the money and not for the show
Are you here for me or here for the dough
Mr. Recordman, do you really give a damn?
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can?
