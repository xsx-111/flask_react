Vultures Lyrics
Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from goin' under?

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, now

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do 'bout it?
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't you give up
Don't give up, give up, give up11Embed
