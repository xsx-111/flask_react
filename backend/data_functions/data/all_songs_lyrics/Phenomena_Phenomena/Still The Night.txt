Still The Night LyricsYou didn't have to run from me
Coz I am the one, you know if/
You should have took the time you see
You know i am the one, don't blow it
You know you've got the combination
You've got the moves that could change a nation
All you need is some understanding
You know it's right, don't you know it's
Still the night
What are you running for
Still the night
All the love I have shown you
Still the night
What are you running for
Still the night
All the love I have shown you
I said I'd give it all to you
But you gave a look right through me
I've never told you what to do
I trust in your love, can't you see
You know you've got the combination
You've got the moves that could change the nation
Ail you need is some understanding
You know it's right, don't you know it's
All alone in your city
In this world without pity
Don't you know its still the night
Don't you know it'sEmbed
