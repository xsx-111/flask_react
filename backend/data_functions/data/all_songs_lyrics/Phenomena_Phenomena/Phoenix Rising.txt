Phoenix Rising LyricsAn island now in time
The secrets of your mind
The stories you could tell
This world you know so well
The wonders you have seen
A life time in a dream
History books recall your fame
So many times, so many names
Phoenix rising
The flames are calling
To the unborn
From the setting sun
Phoenix rising
The flames are calling
To the newborn
It's time has come
The taste of love fades too soon
Like the seasons of the moon
A heart that's turned to stone
From an endless life alone
Shaping fate and destiny
Of a future world to be
Damned into the flames
Eternity reborn againEmbed
