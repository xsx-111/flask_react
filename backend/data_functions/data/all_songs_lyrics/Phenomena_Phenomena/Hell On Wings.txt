Hell On Wings LyricsBehold the King
Of Darkness now
The keeper of
Eternal flame
The reaper's out
Collecting souls
The damned forever
Cry in vain
Hell on wings
Heaven afire
Scream the battle cry
Voices in the sky
Hell on wings
Heavens afire
Scream the battle cry
Riders in the sky
The knights of shadows
Demon cries
As thunder echoes
In the night
Now face the angels
Of the sword
The prize the kingdom
Now of lifeEmbed
