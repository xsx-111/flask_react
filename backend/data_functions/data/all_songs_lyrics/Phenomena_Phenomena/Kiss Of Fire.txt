Kiss Of Fire LyricsThe dawn of darkness
Mist surrounds you
Echoes screaming
Shadows fall
The last light
Of holy madness
The hound of hell
It's master calls
Rising now from
Deep damnation
Sanctuary
From the Sight
Eyes burning
With the Wood lust
Unfulfilled
In endless flight
Burning, burning
With desire
Steals your soul
The kiss of fire
Burning, burning
With desire
The touch of death
The kiss of fire
In passions rage
Intoxicated
With ecstasy
The chosen wait
Forsaking ail
Deny salvation
For eternity's
Embrace
Now as one
As life blood passes
Endless nightmares
Now unfold
The craze and hunger
Now forever
The Prince of Darkness
Now beholdEmbed
