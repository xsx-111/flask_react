Dance With The Devil LyricsForm a circle
Join the line
The spirits of the night
Beat time
Satan's fiddle
Strikes the bow
Start the dance
Around they go
Face to face with destiny
Let their wildest dreams
Run free
Ecstasy fills their minds
They're damned until
The end of time
Dance
You're losing control
Dance
He's stealing your soul
Dance
With the Devil
Dance
You're losing control
Dance
He's stealing your soul
Dance
With the Devil
Sold their souls
Satan's slaves
Now the Devil
Must be paid
The music holds them
In it's spell
They'll soon be dancing
Now in HellEmbed
