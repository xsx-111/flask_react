Twilight Zone LyricsA crack in the glass
Of time without warning
Trying to hold on
Slipping away
Into the realms of
Fantasy nightmares
A world of illusion
Between night and day
Will I open my eyes
And it all be a bad dream
Ml a survivor
Lost somewhere in time
Hiding from shadows
Nowhere to run to
Lost in confusion
Going out of my mind
Twilight zone
Lost between the last
Stroke of midnight
Twilight zone
The hands of madness
Strike fast as light
Twilight zone
Screams of silence
Echoes like thunder
Survival
You've gotta fight
A land filled with wonder
Strange fascination
A world without pity
Drowning in fate
One thousand eyes watching
Reaching to touch you
Pulling you under
Into the nightEmbed
