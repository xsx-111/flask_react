The Ballad of Laverne and Captain Flint Lyrics
Here comes Martha running down the pier
Lord, looks like Captain Flint is here
You get the bow, I get the stern
Lord, would you look at that Laverne?
Flint's got shrimp from the deep blue sea
And buckets of fish for you and me

Old Flint's boat is fine and she's called the Miss-Inclined
And there's no home port painted on the stern
They say she's like a ghost up and down that Texas coast
But you saw him, aw didn't you, Laverne?

Daddy says Flint is a weird old bird
And what's more I have heard
That his nets are charmed by a woman who knew
How to work that Louisiana voodoo
Laverne, get away from that boat, you hear
Your mama don't want you hanging round here
Laverne told her, she said

That Old Flint's boat is fine and she's called the Miss-Inclined
And there's no home port painted on the stern, yes ma'am
They say she's like a ghost up and down that Texas coast
But you saw him, aw didn't you, Laverne?

Martha, Martha, won't you tell me please
That it is not Laverne that I see?
There on the deck of the Miss-Inclined
With Captain Flint, I must be blind
Laverne, girl, what's got the matter with you?
Old Captain Flint he put a spell on you

Old Flint's boat is fine, but she's called the Miss-Inclined
There's no home port painted on her stern
They say she's like a ghost up and down that Texas coast
But you saw him, aw didn't you, Laverne?
Old Flint's boat is fine, but she's called the Miss-Inclined
And there's no home port painted on her stern
They say she's like a ghost up and down that Texas coast
But you saw him, aw didn't you, Laverne?
Yeah, here we go
And old Flint's boat is fine, she's called the Miss-Inclined
There's no home port painted on the stern, that's right
They say she's like a ghost up and down that Texas coast
But you saw him, aw didn't you, Laverne?Embed
