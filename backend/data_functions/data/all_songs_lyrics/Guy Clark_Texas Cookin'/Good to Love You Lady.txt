Good to Love You Lady Lyrics
Now here comes Texas rolling through my mind
There ain't nothing to it, mama, don't be crying
It's just one of those things that everyone goes through
Just an old time feeling, don't mean no harm
So roll me in your loving arms
Everybody needs a little help from time to time
If I could change anything, then I wouldn't be me
And I wouldn't have you and it's plain to see
I need all of the help that I can get
Everybody's got 'em some kind of past now
And here comes that old snake in the grass now
Lord, it's good to be in Tennessee with you

It's good to have you, lady, on my side through it all
It's good to see you lady, when that rain starts to fall
It's good to love you lady, Lord, that's the best of all


Now here come Texas rolling through my mind
There ain't nothing to it, mama, don't be crying
It's just one of those things that everyone goes through
And everybody's got 'em some kind of past now
And here comes that old snake in the grass now
Lord, it's good to be in Tennessee with you, oh yes

It's good to have you, lady, on my side through it all
It's good to see you lady, when that rain starts to fall
It's good to love you lady, Lord, that's the best of all
Everybody shuffle
Ah, it's good to have you, lady, on my side through it all
It's good to see you lady, when that rain starts to fall
It's good to love you lady, Lord, that's the best of all
One more
Ah, it's good to have you, lady, on my side through it all
It's good to see you lady, when that rain starts to fall
It's good to love you lady, Lord, that's the best of all
Play it
