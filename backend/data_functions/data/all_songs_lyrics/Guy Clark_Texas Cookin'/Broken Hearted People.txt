Broken Hearted People Lyrics
Broken-hearted people always seem to drink
Trying to drown those sorrows, it ain't as easy as you think
Living with a liar is a hard old way to go
Laughin' just to keep from crying ain't no way to grow old

So take me to a barroom, driver
Set me on a stool
If I can't be her man
I'm damned if I'll be her fool

They say that whiskey ain't the best way, but then I ain't too smart
To think I just found out she was lying from the start
So if this is nothing but a bad joke looking for a laugh
Well, hold on to your lampshade, darling, 'cause I'm looking for a hat

And you take me to a barroom, driver
Set me on a stool
If I can't be her man
I'm damned if I'll be her fool

So get this taxi moving because I have got no time to lose
And there's no time to be choosy, you know that any old bar will do
And I'm looking to get silly and I'm looking to get loose
And if that don't get it done, darling, I'll come looking for you

Now take me to a barroom, driver
Set me on a stool
If I can't be her man
I'm damned if I'll be her fool
Take me to a barroom, driver
Set me on a stool
If I can't be her man
I'm damned if I'll be her foolEmbed
