Anyhow, I Love You Lyrics
I wish I had a dime for every bad time
But the bad times always seem to keep the change
You've been all alone so you know what I'm saying
And when all you can recall is the pain

Just you wait till tomorrow
When you wake up with me at your side
And find I haven't lied about nothing
And I wouldn't trade a tree
For the way I feel about you in the morning
Anyhow, I love you

And everyday it gets just a little bit better
And half the getting there is knowing where I been before
Well I'm sure you understand 'cause I ain't your first man
And when you feel like running for the back door, don't

Just you wait till tomorrow
When you wake up with me at your side
And find I haven't lied about nothing
And I wouldn't trade a tree
For the way I feel about you in the morning
Anyhow, I love you

Just you wait till tomorrow
When you wake up with me at your side
And find I haven't lied about nothing
And I wouldn't trade a tree
For the way I feel about you in the morning
Anyhow, I love you
Ah, just you wait till tomorrow
When you wake up with me at your side
And find I haven't lied about nothing
And I wouldn't trade a tree
For the way I feel about you in the morning
Anyhow, I love youEmbed
