Shy Lyrics
Staring at the ceiling
Hearts and records spinning, round (Mmm)
I've been, loving with no meaning
Running from a feeling now
You know that I want you

Mmm, don't get me started at this time of night
Hard to keep my guard up and the feeling's right
I don't need nobody but for you I might
And all that want is you

I just want to see you, you could come over
I know your shy, you can be shy with me
You know I need you and I’m not quite sober
I know your shy baby, you can be shy, it’s alright
I just want to see you, you can come over
I know your shy, you can be shy with me
You know I need you and I’m not quite sober
I know your shy baby, you can be shy, you can be shy with me

Met you back in August
Thought you were standoffish, coy (Mmm)
But you don't have to try
I'll read between your lines (Ohh)
‘Cause all that I want is you
Oh oh oh why (you ain’t gotta hide who you are tonight)
No take your time (you can move slow with your hips on mine)
Hey you’re so shy (won’t you come ‘round here and waste my time)
‘Cause all that I want is you

I just want to see you, you could come over
I know your shy, you can be shy with me
You know I need you and I’m not quite sober
I know your shy baby, you can be shy, shy it’s alright
I just want to see you, you can come over
I know your shy, you can be shy with me
‘Cause baby I need you, and I’m kinda shy too
Maybe tonight baby, you can be shy, you can be shy with me1Embed
