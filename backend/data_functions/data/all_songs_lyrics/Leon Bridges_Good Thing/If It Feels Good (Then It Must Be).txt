If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be) Lyrics
Hhhhhh

Live from the funk
It's hotter than Texas
Right from the jump, yeah
You got my attention
You give me that stuff
And it’s such a blessin'
You and I in the light
Alone in this heaven

Aww baby, aww, aww baby
Say you will, say you might
If this is wrong, then nothing’s right
Aww baby, aww, aww baby
See yourself like I do
Oh, tonight looks good on you

Hey, mys-terious
We don’t have to act so serious-ly
Like nobody’s watching, only us
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
More than I choose to, I’m falling in love, huh
And love I ain’t used to
You give me that stuff
No, I can’t refuse you
You and I in the light, it’s alright

Aww baby, aww, aww baby
Say you will, say you might
If this is wrong, then nothing’s right
Aww baby, aww, aww baby (you know it's alright)
See yourself like I do
Oh, tonight looks good on you

Hey, mys-terious
We don’t have to act so serious-ly
Like nobody’s watching, only us
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
Wooo hooo

Want you bad
More than bad
Want you bad
(Badly, me girl)
Woo hoo
Want you bad
More than bad, yeah
C'mon, rock with me, girl
Hooo yeah
C'mon, rock with me, girl
Hey, mys-terious
We don’t have to act so serious-ly
Like nobody’s watching, only us
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you

Baby, if it feels good, (then it must be)
(Bad how much I want you)
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
