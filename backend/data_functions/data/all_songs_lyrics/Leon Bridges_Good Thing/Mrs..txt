Mrs. Lyrics
I tried to let go we end up on the floor
And you try to leave when I need you the most
Sometimes I wonder what we holding on for
Then you climb on top of me and I remember

You know that I think you the love of my life
But lovin’ and hatin’ is such a fine line
Sometimes I wonder why I went knockin’ on ya door
Then you climb on top of me and I remember

I remember how it felt the first few times
Skin-to-skin before you knew how to get under mine
If we get it, get it right we'll be together for life
'Cause it only feels good after a good, good fight

Mrs., Mrs., when we talk like
Mrs., Mrs., when we love
Mrs., Mrs., when we’re touching
Mrs., Mrs., and that sound when ya ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Fussing and fighting and eye for an eye
Your shoulders get colder and colder all the time
Sometimes I wonder why I went knockin’ on ya door
Then you come knock, knock, knockin' on mine and I remember
I remember how it felt the first few times
Skin-to-skin before you knew how to get under mine
If we get it, get it right we'd be together for life
'Cause it only feels good after a good, good fight

Mrs., Mrs., when we talk like
Mrs., Mrs., when we love, love
Mrs., Mrs., when we’re touchin’
Mrs., Mrs., a lil bit of everything
Mrs., Mrs., when we talk like
Mrs., Mrs., a lil bit of that love
Mrs., Mrs., when we’re touchin’
Mrs., Mrs., a lil bit of everything
Oh, oh, whoa, yeah

When you say them things I like, I know it’s all worth the fightEmbed
