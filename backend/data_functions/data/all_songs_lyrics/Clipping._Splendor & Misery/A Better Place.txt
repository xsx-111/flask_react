A Better Place Lyrics
If ever you find yourself beaten and broke
And can't feel the whip for the weight of the yoke
And fear that the night will not turn into day
Remember, the darkness will show you the way
It's a long way away
It's a long way away
And I’m all alone along a long, long, long, long, long long, long way

Inside the mind of a man is a massacre
Made up of many a miniature message
He misses the most of it
So convoluted, designed for disaster
It's making the best of a universe far too expansive to cope with
And he never chose nor was chosen by metrics that make any sense
And the senses are numbed by emotional stresses

There must be a better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

Who got time on a string? On a finger?
Nothing to remember but the passage of it
Who got time to let anything linger?
Where it hovers, surely, you will learn to love it
Who got time for this love shit anyway?
Gotta survive—isn't that mess enough for him?
There must be a better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

Set a course; it's a bet upon an endless Roulette wheel
Odds are ungodly
As are the odds of the body making it through and surviving the gravity shift
The gravitas of which is lost on the lost thoughts of a being
Ch-ch-chopped to a bite size in the light
Eyes begging, "Don't eat the messenger"
The message is an SOS and other S's in the language where it goes

There must be a better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

And somebody gotta keep watch where the watch stops
He talks about his pops in polarity
Fingers fantasize of rocks there will never be
"Land ho!" likely, lest a hole in the mantle of Heaven
He's demanding the evidence for something that maybe never was for anyone
He's missing something pretty
He's missing where the air tastes gritty
He's missing the splendor and misery
Of bodies, of cities, of being missed
There must be a better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

Flesh is weaker than the metal—it is true
But the metal's being moved into a thing it doesn't do
Circuitry is only serviceable as much as it is used
So why don't you use it?
'Til you use it up, abuse it
It is strong, it can take it if you can't
Your sinews are more intuitively designed for dance
So let's set up a random course safely away from suns
Four-hundred and twenty-three by a hundred and twelve by fifty-one

There must be a better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

Inside the mind of a man is a mystery
Made up of these centuries of mistakes he believes are important
To be part of his DNA, calls it "history"
Species with memories longer
Don't bother with sweating the old shit
Maybe it's this time-bound conscience that keeps him out pushing through nothing
With only the hope brought on by this belief that
There must be a better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

Are you ready to go? (Go, go, go)
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go (Go, go, go)
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go (Go, go, go, go)
Are you ready to go? (Go, go, go)
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go (Go, go, go)
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go (Go, go, go, go)
Are you ready to go? (Go, go, go)
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go (Go, go, go)
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go (Go, go, go, go)

There must be a, better place to (Go, go, go, go)
Be somebody, be somebody else (Go, go, go, go, go, go)

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go5Embed
