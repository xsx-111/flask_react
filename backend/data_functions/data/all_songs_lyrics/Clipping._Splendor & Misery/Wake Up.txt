Wake Up Lyrics
The chance that he ever reaches any place suitable to support life in his lifetime's pretty low (Get low)
Pretty low (Get low), pretty low (Get low), pretty low (Get low)
And the chances of him of ever seeing anybody that he knows are even lower
So he's making up his mind to just go (Let go)
Just go (Let go), just go (Let go), just go (Let go)
So it's one shot in the arm (One shot in the arm)
Hazy in the head (Hazy in the head)
Set the timer once (Set the timer once)
Lay down in the bed (Lay down and)
Close the hatch, trying to clear your mind
Cause nightmares and alarms blowing, kill the time
If you have a God, say something sublime
Deep breath and leave it behind; you ready to—
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up

Slow blood
Slow blood
Slow blood
Somewhere, in sleep is a brainstorm and the EKG spikes
And the nerves fire like flies lightly, then die slightly each night
Alright, alright, alright
It's an artifact apparently, similar to a muscle memory
And he grabs her ropes and chokes back songs
Like tears, like stars, like gears
And moving pictures, picture-perfect, paint a perfect picture
Perforate it, rip it up into a thousand jagged edges
He's embarrassed of the love he has for things you never knew—didn't you know?
Happiness is waiting at your door
In a sleek, black dress and a kiss that says, "Hello"
And a thick, black mess and a mom that says, "Don't go"
And a cul-de-sac so cold, it'll hold you close
When the stores all close and the clothes so thin to begin with
When the wind rips, they blow

Pretty low (Get low), pretty low (Get low)
Pretty low (Get low), pretty low (Get low)
Just go (Let go), just go, (Let go)
Just go (Let go), just go (Let go)

Slow blood
I follow the stars when the sun goes to bed
Slow blood
Everything I've ever known is long dead
Slow blood
I can't go back home 'cause I wanna be free
Slow blood
Someone tell the others what's become of me3Embed
