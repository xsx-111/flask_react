Over Her Head LyricsShe sees flames in the kitchen it's a vision of hell
A sign that madam is not feeling well
Like the pigeons in the yard she's getting fat on starch
She's cooking for sailors and combing her hair in the dark
She loves everybody she'll even love me
When I'm born in the traffic on the rolling seas
She's in over her head
It's either the pairing of the woman on the floor above
Or long static shots of half naked men in the desert
She loves everybody she'll even love me
When I'm born in the traffic on the rolling seas
She's in over her headEmbed
