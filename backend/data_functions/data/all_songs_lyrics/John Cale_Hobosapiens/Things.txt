Things Lyrics
Elsewhere in the Temple the llamas are gearing up
To assault Tiger Mountain when the sun comes up
We sat around whispering in the candlelight
Trying to get a game plan for the night
Talked about the difference between North and South
Keep your gun in your pocket and your tongue in your mouth

And you'll be doing it
Doing the things
Doing it
Doing the things
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead

A month is a Saturday – Wednesday's a week
I saw the way you looked at her Charlie Brown – good grief
She pulled you into the shadows and taught you how to love
Patted you on the head and gave you a shove

And you were doing it
Doing the things
Doing it
Doing the things
Doing it
Doing the things
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead
The sexual exuberance of a concubine
Checks my carburettor one more time
With the passion of a thoroughbred
And the sensitivity of a moose
I rarely make a move unless I've got some proof

That we'll be doing it
Doing the things
Doing it
Doing the things
Doing it
Doing the things
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead

You live in Paris I live in France
Things are expensive when you live first class
You learn Latin I'll learn Greek
And when you've got a minute we'll meet in Crete

And we'll be doing it
Doing the things
Doing it
Doing the things
Doing it
Doing the things
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead
The thing you do in Denver when you're dead
Doing it in Denver when you're dead
Doing it in Denver when you're dead
Doing it in Denver when you're deadEmbed
