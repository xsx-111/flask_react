Things X LyricsElsewhere in the Temple the llamas are gearing up
To assault Tiger Mountain when the sun comes up
We sat around whispering in the candlelight
Trying to get a game plan for the night
Talked about the difference between North and South
Keep your gun in your pocket and your tongue in your mouth
And you'll be doing it
– the thing you do in Denver when you're dead
A month is a Saturday – Wednesday's a week
I saw the way you looked at her Charlie Brown – good grief
She pulled you into the shadows and taught you how to love
Patted you on the head and gave you a shove
And you were doing it – the thing…
The sexual exuberance of a concubine
Checks my carburettor one more time
With the passion of a thoroughbred and the
Sensitivity of a moose I rarely make a move
Unless I've got some proof that we'll be doing it
– the thing you do in Denver when you're dead
You live in Paris I live in France things are expensive
When you live first class – you learn Latin I'll learn Greek
And when you've got a minute we'll meet in Crete
And we'll be doing it – the thing…Embed
