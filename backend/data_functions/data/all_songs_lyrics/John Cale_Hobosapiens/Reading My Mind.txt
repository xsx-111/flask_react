Reading My Mind LyricsI was careful and cautiously optimistic
Saving enough for the Cobra on sale downtown
Test driving my motor and she was reading my mind
Four on the floor hugs the road designated driver tonight
Driving my motor – she was reading my mind
Driving my motor – couldn't even see the signs
The blondes downtown passing the Fontani di Trevi
I wish I had a dollar for everyone
The suns bears down on the chrome and leather interior
Four on the floor hugs the road good driving tonight1Embed
