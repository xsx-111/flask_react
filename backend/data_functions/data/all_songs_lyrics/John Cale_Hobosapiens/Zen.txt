Zen LyricsIt's midnight
And our silver tongued obsessions come at us out of the dark
Scrambling to be recognised before tearing themselves apart
It's zen and the art of Bollywood
Heroes turning on a spit
The lovers unable to resolve a pre-historic bitch
We don't know the half of it
Clever is as clever does
His drawn lights sparkling on a merry-go-round
Hypnotising everyone on it
In zen and the art of forgery we're losing control of light
DeLorian, Picasso, Mondre and El Greco some one's gonna pay the price
If I didn't know you better than that
I'd never let you outta my sight
Where is the art of sorcery
We wanna be fooled again
Staggered by deception charmed into submission
Helpless as a deck of cards
It's now the art of reality
Calling a spade a spade
Facing the obvious
A monkey and his grinder
But on a different plain
I see you clearly from day to day
As clearly as I see tonite
Keep talking said the slow-eyed Mandarin
"I've got nothing to say"
Meet me on the staircase on your way down
We'll see if there's been a mistake
In zen and the art of algebra
There is no value for time
Whatever thrives inside the dark
Decays on the outsideEmbed
