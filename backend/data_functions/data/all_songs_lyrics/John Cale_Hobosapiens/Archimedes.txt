Archimedes LyricsKeep me away from a naked flame
I am made of vapour and I will explode
There's been something rattling in the closet trying to get out
The car antenna's gone missing – it's out there somewhere
Cruising the streets
Archimedes and me go back a ways
Archimedes and me both married in our own way
To old ideas in new clothes
The good will goddess passed us by we were satisfied with that
And when your drive down
Pacific Palisades you can see he made the desert bloom
Archimedes and me…
(the noise of the first Archimedes Screw)
There's been something rattling in the closet trying to get out
– the car antenna's missing – (the rest of it will be gone soon)Embed
