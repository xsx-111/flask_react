I Was Married LyricsI married in the sun
(Tell me where tell me where)
Against the stone of buildings built before
You and I were born
(Start again start again)
And to my heart confusion rose against
The muscles fought so long
(Fought so long)
To control against the pull of
One magnet to another magnet
To another magnet
Now we look up in
(Tell me who tell me who)
Into the eyes of bullies breaking backs
They seem so very tough
(It's a lie it's a lie)
They seem so very scared of us
I look into the mirror
(Look into)
For evil that just does not exist
I don't see what they see
(Tell them that tell them that)
Try to control the pull of one magnet
To another magnet
To another magnet
To another magnet
To another1Embed
