Are You Ten Years Ago LyricsTaken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I collapse
I might stay out longer then
I left a light on for you then
If you show, you show
If you show, you show
When I feel like this
When I get so into myself
I lose track of where I'm going then
Lose track of how to get going again
I feel myself slowing down
Feel myself turning round
Is this taken?
When I feel like this
When I get so sick of myself
Where are you going then
Without me and not knowing then
That we're slowing down
You've got to turn right around
And tell me that I'm taken then
Tell me if I'm yours
You collapse
The pressure of this life is so
You can't be held accountable
If you go, you go
If you go, you go
When you act like this
When you get so sick of yourself
The whole world falls away and since
I feel like I have only missed
The feeling that I'm here again
The feeling that I'm clear again
I'm not taken
When you act like this
When you get so into yourself
I lose sight of common goals
And letting go, so I can be all alone
Feel myself going slow
Feel myself letting go
Not taken
Not feeling like I'm yours
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles
I collapse
This life looks like a sentence
Though a constant game of falling short
If you know, you know
If you know, you know
When I feel like this
When I'm just so sick of feeling less than perfect
Isn't right for me
I never fight to see
If coming clean would get to me
I feel myself holding back
I feel the pressure, it's finally back
I'm taken
When you felt like this
When you saw it all come crashing down
Subtle but not underground
I was there, I saw the signs
I saw unfair and so
I write to you through other means
I let myself finally feel taken
Like I was yours
I am taken, I am yours
(I feel sick)
I'm up and doing circles
(I feel)
(x10)
I collapse
I collapse
I collapseEmbed
