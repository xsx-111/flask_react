Back in Your Head Lyrics
Build a wall of books between us in our bed
Repeat, repeat the words that I know we both have said
Relax into the need, we get so comfortable
Remember when I was so strange and likable?

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little

When I jerk away from holding hands with you
I know these habits hurt important parts of you
Remember when I was sweet and unexplainable?
Nothing like this person, unlovable

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little scared
When I get a little
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

I just want back in your head
I just want back in your head
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll stray
I'm not unfaithful but I'll strayEmbed
