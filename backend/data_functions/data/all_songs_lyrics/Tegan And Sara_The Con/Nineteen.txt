Nineteen Lyrics
I felt you in my legs before I ever met you
And when I laid beside you for the first time, I told you
I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you

Now we're saying bye
Bye, bye
Now we're saying bye
Bye, bye

I was nineteen
Call me

I felt you in my life before I ever thought to
Feel the need to lay down beside you and tell you
I feel you in my heart and I don't even know you

And now we're saying bye
Bye, bye
Now we're saying bye
Bye, bye
I was nineteen
Call me
I was nineteen
Call me

Flew home, back to where we met
Stayed inside, I was so upset
Cooked up a plan so good except I was all alone
You were all I had
Love you
You were all mine
Love me
I was yours right?
I was yours right?

I was nineteen
Call me (bye, bye)
I was nineteen
Call me (bye, bye)2Embed
