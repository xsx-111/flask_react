Dark Come Soon Lyrics
Dark, you can't come soon enough for me
Saved from one more day of misery
Everything I love, get back from me now
Everyone I love, I need you now
Don't forget a million miles from me
Safe and another day can pass by me
Everything I love, get back from me now
Everyone I love, I'd need you now

(So what?)
So I conned, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)
So I conned, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)

Hold out for the ones you know will love you
Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too

Right to the edge I'm barely there
Slow to make my move, I'm almost there
Everything I say, I say to me first
Everything I do, I do to me first
(So what?)
So what, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)
So what, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)

Hold out for the ones you know will love you
Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too

Dark, you can't come soon enough for me2Embed
