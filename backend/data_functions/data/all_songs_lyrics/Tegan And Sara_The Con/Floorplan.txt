Floorplan Lyrics
I want to draw you a floorplan of my head and heart
I want to give directions, helpful hints
What you'll be looking for
What you'll be looking for

(I know) I hold this loss in my heart forever
(I know) I hold, I hold
(I know) I hold this loss in my heart forever
(I know) I hold, I'll hold

All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now

I want your lungs to stop working without me
I think about writing you, I thought about calling you
What was I looking for?
What am I looking for?

(I know) I hold this pain in my heart forever
(I know) I hold, I hold
(I know) I hold this pain in my heart forever
(I know) I hold, I hold
All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now

I shouldn't go but I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure
I shouldn't go but I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure

All eyes are on me now
All eyes are on me now

I shouldn't go but I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure
I shouldn't go but I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure

I shouldn't go when I feel this building
I shouldn't go when I feel this building
I shouldn't go but I can't really help it
When I feel this pressure1Embed
