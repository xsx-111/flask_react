Knife Going In Lyrics
If I don't recover
Sell this house and find something lost outside your window
Not forever
But on the night I die, I swear I'll sleep outside your window

I feel the knife going in
I'm feeling anxious
Not enough to kill me
I thought it'd happen fast
But I'm feeling it now and I feel anxious
Sleeping inches from me
I let it pass

Emy, should I stop?
Do you think I'll make it to the morning if it's written?
Stitch it up
The kind of song I know causes mother, sister, lover worry

I feel the knife going in
I'm feeling anxious
Not enough to kill me
I thought it'd happen fast
But I'm feeling it now
And I feel anxious
Sleeping inches from me
I let it passEmbed
