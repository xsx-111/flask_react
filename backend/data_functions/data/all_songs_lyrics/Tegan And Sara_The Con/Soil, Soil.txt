Soil, Soil Lyrics
Oh and I'm feeling directionless
Yes, but that's to be expected and I know that best
In creeps the morning and another day's lost
You've just written wondering and I reply fast

All you need to save me
All you need to save me: call
And I'll be curled on the floor hiding out from it all
And I won't take any other call

I feel like a fool so I'm going to stop troubling you
Buried in my yard, a letter to send to you
And if I forget or God forbid die too soon
Hope that you'll hear me, know that I wrote to you

All you need to say to me
All you need to say to me is, "Call."
And I'll be curled on the floor hiding out from it all
And I won't take any other callEmbed
