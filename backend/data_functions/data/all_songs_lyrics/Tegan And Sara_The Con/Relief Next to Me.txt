Relief Next to Me Lyrics
I miss you now
I guess like I should have missed you then
My body moves
Like curtains waving in and out of wind
In and out of windows
I can't untangle (I can't untangle)
What I feel and what would matter most
I can't close an eye (I can't close an eye)-lid
Now there's just no point
In reaching out for me

In the dark (I'm in the dark)
I'm just no good at giving relief
In the dark (I'm in the dark)
It won't be easy to find relief
And I'm not proud (and I'm not proud)
That nothing will seem easy about me
But I promise this
I won't go my whole life
Telling you I don't need

I'll tell you now
I guess like I should have told you then
The thunder moves
Like damn drawers slamming in my frame
Slamming in my framework
I can't untangle (I can't untangle)
What I know and what should matter most
I can't close an eye (I can't close an eye)-lid
Now there's just no point
In reaching out for you
In the dark (I'm in the dark)
I'm just no good at giving relief
In the dark (I'm in the dark)
It won't be easy to find relief
And I'm not proud (and I'm not proud)
That nothing will seem easy about me
But I promise this
(I promise this)
I won't go my whole life
(I promise this)
Telling you I don't need
(I promise this)1Embed
