Hop a Plane Lyrics
I took the train back
Back to where I came from
I took it all alone, it's been so long, I know
Imagine me there, my heart asleep with no air
Begging, "Ocean please, help me drown these memories."

All I need to hear is that you're not mine
You're not mine

I'm moving east then
Somewhere far away from the sight of my hands
The sight of me not moving
You can't just hop a plane and come and visit me again
I claim it's in my head and I regret offering

All I need to hear is that you're not mine
You're not mine
All I want to hear is that you're not mine
You're not mine

You take a second, take a second
Take a year, take a year
You took me out and took me in
And told me all of this and then
You take a moment, take a moment
Take a year, take a year
You help me out, I listen in
You told me all of this and then
All I want to hear is that you're not mine
You're not mine
All I want to hear is that you're not mine
You're not mine
All I need to hear is that you're not mine
You're not mine
All I want to hear is that you're not mine
You're not mineEmbed
