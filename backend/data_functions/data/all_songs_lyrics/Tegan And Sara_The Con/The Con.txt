The Con Lyrics
I listened in
Yes I'm guilty of this, you should know this
I broke down and wrote you back before you had a chance to
Forget forgotten
I am moving past this, giving notice
I have to go
Yes I know the feeling, know you're leaving

Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, erring on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now
I'm coming around, I'm coming around

Nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

Spelled out your name
And list the reasons, faint of heart, don't call me back
I imagine you when I was distant, not insistent
I follow suit and laid out on my back
Imagine that
A million hours left to think of you and think of that
Calm down, I'm calling you to say
I'm capsized, airing on the edge of safe
Calm down, I'm calling back to say
I'm home now
I'm coming around, I'm coming around

Nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down

Nobody likes to but I really like to cry
Nobody likes me, maybe if I cry

Nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody
Nobody nobody nobody nobody
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down
Encircle me, I need to be taken down3Embed
