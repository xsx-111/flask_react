Burn Your Life Down Lyrics
Tell me that you know another way to get it done
It's not me or how I would be but it's a different situation
A different situation

You lay awake in the night, just staring at the ceiling above
Pulling pieces of it out is such a waste of time
Keep on fighting to remember that nothing is lost in the end
When you burn, burn, burn your life down

Get me to the door
Out of bed, on the track
I'm not sure starting over
It's a different situation
A different situation

You wake up in the night and refuse to be afraid of it now
Unfolding pieces of it faster, don't you waste your time
You've been planning to remember this
So nothing will be lost in the end
And you burn, burn, burn your life down
And you burn, burn, burn your life down
I drive around the block and I'm not looking to my right
I feel the glass against my cheek and I can't see you in the light
I break my heart around this, break my heart around this
I drive around the block and I'm not looking to my right
I feel the glass against my cheek and I can't see you in the light
I break my heart around this, break my heart around this poleEmbed
