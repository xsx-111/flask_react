Like O, Like H Lyrics
When I was 8
I was sure I was growing nerves
Like steel in my palm
Make a map of what you see
Direct pain effectively
I was 8
I was sure I was growing pains
Like lead in my feet
S.O.S. to my mother
Take the hinges off the door
S.O.S. to my mother
Take the hinges off the door

Oh, oh, sugar spell it out
Like oh, oh, sugar spell it out
Like oh, oh, sugar spell it out
Like oh
Like O, like H in your gut
Like O, like H in your gut
Like O, like H in your gut
Like O, like H in your gut
In your gut
S.O.S
S.O.S
When I was four plus a ten, I was swinging fists
Like nails in a board
Pull your hands inside of you
Six years 'til I'll be through
I was four plus a ten, I was swinging back
Like a race to be sure
S.O.S. to my mother
Take the hinges off the door
S.O.S. to my mother
Take the hinges off the door

Oh, oh, sugar spell it out
Like oh, oh, sugar spell it out
Like oh, oh, sugar spell it out
Like oh
Like O, like H in your gut
Like O, like H in your gut
Like O, like H in your gut
Like O, like H in your gut
In your gut
S.O.S
