Lil Boy Lyrics
Burn through it, burn through it
I'm not takin' turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin' turns to it, turns to it

Coughin' up sirens, I'm firin'
Krokodil lips off your smile
Quit that fidget looks suspicious
Who that screw that ain't got my digits?

Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)
Face of a woman (Lil boy)
Tears of a child (Lil boy)

I'm rising sign of sulfur
Skeletal bell toller
Handle in each of my tentacles
I'm moonshining juice, don't try me
Live to feel life beat me, nothing hurts
I'm seething, your smoke signals proceed me
I'm inside my TV where everyone but I can see me
(Why are you here?)
Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)
Face of a woman (Lil boy)
Tears of a child (Lil boy)

Burn through it, burn through it
I'm not takin' turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin' turns to it, turns to it (ay, ay)

You know we-
You know we burn through it, burn through it
I'm not takin' turns to it, turns to it
You know we-

See myself come spin through top of you
My flint lit slit that attitude
Lil brain got confused
Choo choo train of thought in my logic loop

Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)
Face of a woman (Lil boy)
Tears of a child (Lil boy)
Broken hands on all my fingers
Buckle down my knuckles like screamers
Stitch up my blown out trench with leather streamers
I'm chain-linked fence that splits dream and dreamer
I keep 'em hangin' from my balcony, shrivel in my sun
Warm piss showin' through his cheap slacks, this bitch is done
Open my front, ragin' like I've never slept
Make him cry like a baby formula on the breath

Needle of your eye (Lil boy)
River Nile wide (Lil boy)
Fear over pride (Lil boy)
Flood you can't hide (Lil boy)
Face of a woman (Lil boy)
Tears of a child (Lil boy)
In a foreign land (Lil boy)

You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it
Burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it
You know we burn through it, burn through it
We ain't takin turns to it, turns to it21Embed
