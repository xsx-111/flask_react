Come Up and Get Me Lyrics
My stone wall, it's on, dog gaze duct-taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay, okay, feel me
I'm in an eight-high abandoned building
No daylight, one midnight lamp lit twenty-four seven
Murdered out windows, two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it, not goin' out, shit's 'bout to get kamikaze
Fuck a nazi

When the world comes knocking
Fuck the world, fuck this body
Know it won't be long now
Feel my nerves wet my brow
Mood in my tomb, red moon heavy
Sling jaw shot, out the window and yell, "Come up and get me"
I'm epiphanic amnesia
I'm in Jimmy Page's castle
I'm off the planet, echo astral
Vinyl lasso, the Sacto asshole
I'm not down for anything
Fuck around and say anything
My stone wall, it's on, dog gaze duct-taped to the ceiling
Stucco cave make me illi, okay, okay, feel me
I'm in an eight-high abandoned building
No daylight, one midnight lamp lit twenty-four seven
Murdered out windows, two exits
Street or nosedive to the next life in seconds
And suicide ain't my stallion
So I'm surrounded
Geiger count it, not goin' out, shit's 'bout to get kamikaze
Ahh, fuck a nazi

(Come up and get me)
My life as a fuck, ain't one thing I don't hate
Tell me my time's almost up, I will say, "I can't wait"
Put your gun to my head, I'll blow smoke in your face
Think you got what it takes? Come up and get me

Can't tell, hell in my head, thirteenth bell
Am I dead or in asylum? Pill force-fed
Lyin' to myself, all by myself, strapped down to my bed
Tongue cut out the mouth of reason and chucked off the river's edge
Think fast, is it tear gas or fear masked by figments of my fragmented mind?
Who's my enemy, them or me?
Step to me and you'll die, grand delusions magnified
Fuck the truth, wastes my time
It's all good, bet
What's that? Footsteps on the stairs?
Never could rest, they're always there
Who are they? I don't care
I just know they're tryin' to ex' me
Give a fuck, come up and get me
