Guns In The Sky Lyrics
See the sound
It crashes in
All around
It gets in
Now take your hands
And raise them up
Into to the air
That's all around ya
Now bring them down
Like a clock at two
Shake your head
You know what to do
They want to put
Guns in the sky
Someone out there
Ain't gonna like it
But it could be good
Make us love each other
Have to realise
I own the future

Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Guns in the sky
Child grows up to see
Guns in the sky
Used to be on TV

Want to change
Forgot the joke
It's great to see you
I'm running late
Da da da, love your hair
Da da da, lend me a ten
Da da da, I love your big house
Da da da, could you spare a dime
Well I'm sick of it
It's a load of shit
We could stop the world
And let off all the fools
And let them go live
With their guns in the sky
