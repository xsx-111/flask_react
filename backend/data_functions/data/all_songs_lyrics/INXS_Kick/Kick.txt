Kick Lyrics
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Come on come on come on come
I look around unsatisfied
At what they're giving me
Then I think to myself
Is there someone else
Who feels the same as me
Do you feel the same baby
When my back is broken
When the mountain moves away
All the dreams and promises
That we give
We give away
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Look ahead
But don't mix it up
Baby look ahead
To better days and better ways
Make peace with flesh and blood
Make peace with your love
Nothing more I could ask of you
But In the end this is the truth
When my back is broken
When the mountain moves away
All the dreams and promises
That we give
We give away
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick, oh
Sometimes you get kicked
Sometimes you kick
Sometimes you get kicked, ohEmbed
