The Trap (Demo) LyricsDon't you worry, don't you worry
Everything's gonna be all right
Well life is the trap, but it sure tastes good
Afar from junk, it ain't a fool
It's dark, dark and lonely
And there's no one, no one there
All these days are better than of its fair
Don't you worry, don't you worry
Life is the trap, it's cold to the touch
You got diamond dreams, it's cold to the touch
It's dark, dark and lonely
And there's no one, no one there
Days of abandon, nothing is there
Loosing reason, loosing reason
Loosing reason, loosing reason to care
Well life is the trap, but sure tastes good
Afar from junk than of its fair
It's dark, dark and lonely
And there's no one, no one there
Don't you worry
Everything's all rightEmbed
