The Loved One LyricsYonder she's walking
She comes my way
Her red dress on, her long black hair
Walking like, talking like
Wanting like, she comes to me
Oh baby I love you so
I need you now
I want you back
I can't go on
Helpless baby, evil child
I've known you well and if you wanna stay that's alright
You want me again and then you come a running to me, well
That's alright
That's alright
That's alright
And now she's gone
She's walking away
Her red dress on, her long black hair
Well I love her so
And now she'll come running
Anytime I say now
Anytime I sayEmbed
