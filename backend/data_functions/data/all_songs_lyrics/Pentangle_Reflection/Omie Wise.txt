Omie Wise LyricsOh, listen to my story, I'll tell you no lies
How John Lewis did murder poor Little Omie Wise
He told her to meet him at Adams' Springs
He promised her money and other fine things
And fool-like she met him at Adams' Springs
But no money he brought her nor other fine things
"Go with me, Little Omie, and away we will go
We'll go and get married and no one will know"
She jumped up behind him and away they did go
But down to the river where deep waters flow
"John Lewis, John Lewis, won't you tell to me your mind?
Do you intend to marry me or leave me behind?"
"Little Omie, Little Omie, I'll tell to you my mind
My mind is to drown you and leave you behind"
"Have mercy on my baby and spare me my life
I'll go home as a beggar and never be your wife"
He hugged her and kissed her, then turned her around
And pushed her in deep waters where he knew that she would drown
Then he got upon his pony and away he did ride
As the screams of Little Omie went down by his side
'Twas on a Thursday mornin', and the rain was a-pourin' down
When the people searched for Omie but she could not be found
Then two boys went a-fishin' one fine sunny day
They saw Little Omie's body go floatin' away
They threw their nets around her and drew her to the bank
Her clothes all wet and muddy, they laid her on a plank
And they called for John Lewis to come to that place
Sat Little Omie before him that he might see her face
He made no confession but they carried him to jail
But no friends nor relations would come and go his bailEmbed
