When I Get Home Lyrics
I don't know what my baby's gonna say when I get home
I know I should have gone, but the booze keeps a-flowin' on
But by now, feel like standing on head
Let the booze flow out of my ears
But I really, really, really should go
'Cause I know that my baby's back home

My sweet woman of the dreams, stop a-teasin' me with your smile
I gotta keep sober, keep my mind straight for a while
I once did climb a mountain side
Did swim the silver-red seas
And once did caught the moonbeams
But now I have flipped to my whim

My dear old Uncle Adam had it right, baby, from the start
He never did get married, nor did he break any poor girl's heart
All his life worked his fingers to the bones
Then he jumped and he came home stoned
But you couldn't really call it his home
And I wish that I could be like himEmbed
