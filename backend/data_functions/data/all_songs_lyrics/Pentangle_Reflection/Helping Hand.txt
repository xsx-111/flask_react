Helping Hand LyricsOnce the days seemed so endless
But that was very long ago
So much time has been wasted
And as daytime turns into evening
Darts and fizz will roll
Better forget it, soon the wine will flow
Many chances were given
Some were taken, some were not
Blaming misunderstanding
For the opportunities lost
But they are soon forgot
Light up a candle, blood is flowin' hot
Try to reason
Why the fear of failin'
Learn the lesson
Losing every gain
You people who understand
Please hold out a helping hand
To people who can't find their way
Well, won't you treat them like a brother?
Maybe some day
There'll be some solution
Though it may well
Need a revolution
Then there won't be no one to blame
Or look that they ever came
It's easy to see that we may
Learn to love one another
Spend some time with your loved ones
Let your troubles melt away
There's a time and a place for everything
So try to relax
And let your mind run free
Live every moment, I'll be there 'til MayEmbed
