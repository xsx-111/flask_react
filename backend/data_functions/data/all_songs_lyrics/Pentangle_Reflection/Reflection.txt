Reflection LyricsLast night the sky
Was filled with light
I saw the sun's reflection
Saw the whole world take flight
Saw the whole world take flight
I heard the guns of Heaven
Thundering in my ears
I opened wide my eyes
And watched the whole world disappear
And watched the world disappear
I reached out my hand
There was no one there
Just this empty room
So cold and bare
So cold and bare
I'm gonna climb my tower
And survey the earth
Gonna cross the ocean
Gonna ride the surf
Gonna ride the surf
People told your mother
What I've been through
She signed away your soul
Onto Satan's crew
Onto Satan's crew
And as you sail away
On that flaming tide
You see your own reflection
On the other side
On the other side
I've seen the Devil's face
I've looked in his eyes
I've searched for satisfaction
Disillusion is his guise
Disillusion is his guise
I've got a notion
And I'm sure I'm right
My sun will rise again
And put evil out of sight
Put evil out of sightEmbed
