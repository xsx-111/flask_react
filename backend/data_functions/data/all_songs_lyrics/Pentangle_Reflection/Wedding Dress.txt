Wedding Dress LyricsHey, my little doney girl
Don't you guess, better be making your wedding dress
Wedding dress, wedding dress
Better be making your wedding dress
Well, it's already made
Trimmed in brown, stitched around with a golden crown
Golden crown, a golden crown
Stitched around with a golden crown
Well, it's already made
Trimmed in red, stitched around with a golden thread
Golden thread, a golden thread
Stitched around with a golden thread
Well, it's already made
Trimmed in green, prettiest thing you've ever seen
Ever seen, ever seen
Prettiest thing you've ever seen
Well, it's already made
Trimmed in white, gonna be married on Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
Gonna be married on Saturday night
Well, she wouldn't say yes
She wouldn't say no, all she do is just sit and sew
Sit and sew, sit and sew
All she do is just sit and sew
Hey, my little doney girl
Don't you guess, better be making your wedding dress
Wedding dress, wedding dress
Better be making your wedding dressEmbed
