Will the Circle Be Unbroken? LyricsWill the circle be unbroken?
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I was standing by the window
On a cold and rainy day
When I see that hearse come rollin'
Comin' to carry my woman away
Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Well, I told the undertaker
"Undertaker, please drive slow
For that body you're a-carryin'
I just hate to see it go"
Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky, Lord, in the skyEmbed
