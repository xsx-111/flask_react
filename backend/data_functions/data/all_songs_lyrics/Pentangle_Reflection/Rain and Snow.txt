Rain and Snow LyricsRan me out in the cold rain and snow
Well, I married me a wife
She gave me trouble all my life
Ran me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow, rain and snow
Ran me out in the cold rain and snow
She came runnin' on down the stair
Combin' back her long ,yellow hair
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
As a rose, as a rose
And her cheeks were as red as a rose
She came more into the room
Where she met her fate a-doom
Sayin', "I can't get along with you
With you, with you"
Sayin', "I can't get along with you"
Well, I ain't got no use
For your red apple juice
And I'm not gonna be treated this a-way
This a-way, this a-way
Sayin', "I'm not gonna be treated this a-way"
I see you sittin' in a shade
Countin' every dime I made
I'm so broke and I'm hungry, too
Hungry too, hungry too
I'm so broke and I'm hungry, too
Well, I married me a wife
She gave me trouble all my life
Ran me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow, rain and snow
Ran me out in the cold rain and snow
Ran me out in the cold rain and snowEmbed
