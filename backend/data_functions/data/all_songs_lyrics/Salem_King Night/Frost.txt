Frost LyricsI need you
I love you
Just need you
I only love you
You know that's true
And you left me
But you're here by me baby
You know I miss you
You're here by me
You don't care about me
But you're here by me
You know I miss you
You're here by me
You don't care about me
But you're here by me1Embed
