Traxx LyricsYou say you're
Beyond the earth
But come down
No sabbath
I'm a sinner
Cast me out
Take my manna
They will learn
I'm not there
They have my woman
I'm not where
They have my woman
You'll save me
When its over
So save me
Pay my murderer
I'm a sinner
Cast me out
Take my manna
They will learn
I'm not there
They have my woman
I'm not where
They have my womanEmbed
