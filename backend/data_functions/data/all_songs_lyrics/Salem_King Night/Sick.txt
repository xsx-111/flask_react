Sick Lyrics
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick

Arms on me, drugs on me, y'all waiting tables
While I am so able that shit don't sound stable
My label; I call this shit, I'm gon' take over this
In fact, I warned you bitch, I'll make your tummy sick
I'm on some evil shit, own this shit, scheme this shit
Demons speak to me so that's who I'm leaving with
If you can't feed a bitch then you don't need a bitch
I will slit your wrist, I will slit your wrist
Oh babe, little lamb I need you for tonight
Why not take a ride with me? Naw, that's the wrong seat
First I tie your hands and feet, shh, don't make a peep
From the trunk they ain't see, then we bounce and hit the beach

6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
Cars in a circle, little lamb in the middle
All the head lights, so bright, he ain't cast a shadow off
Cars in a circle, little lamb in the middle
All the head lights, so bright, he ain't cast a shadow off

I can go freeze on some other for kisses
I broke in and lick it and this is so vicious
I gave it a home and no, you don't leave it
But when I need them some more you could get them from me
Iâ€™m gon' beckon the gate then no hands, sis, some feathers
I mean this, you know we coming for like subpoena
And when I go home, this shit; ya'll all can't notice it
Even when evil assisting the co-witness
I'm on some coke, bring some dope with the Cobra shit
In it some cold mint, that's all bro,  this shit
People 'round, close around, meet in the doors and shit
Movie got cold as shit, I am so over it

6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick
6 car pile up just a mile up, up
Sick sick sick sick3Embed
