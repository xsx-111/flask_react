Trapdoor LyricsNah, I ain't trying to look back
My expectation has my mouth run dry
I see a bitch run but I doubt she know why
I doubt she know fire
But I could introduce
All it takes is matches and just a little juice
All your flow patches your brains fucked up
Ya looked like you been baked too much
You could bake too much
I think too much
It's why I take it off and be the dog when we fuck
Bitch watch me take a shower, put powder on your butt
That lines for me do not touch
You could wear them heels but just don't touch the clothes
Another fifteen minutes put more powder up your nose
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning shit around, maybe I should leave ya
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning things around, baby I should leave ya
Ok, maybe I should go
But where's there to go
I walk for half an hour
Bitch I don't know
I go anywhere, I'm not going home
And the headlights in the night look bright
I'm done I'm bored I'm sick of this night
Heather get the knife
I can't feel it, no
I can't feel shit
And when the sun rises we be watching
Top of the mountain, John boy smoking
Long way from the ground sure ain't bad
Gimme a hit of that, lemme hit the crack
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning shit around, maybe I should leave ya
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning things around, baby I should leave ya
Really nice son, fuck you talking about
I'm trying to numb the pain til my brain falls out
I'm a city nigga I was born in the streets
And I grew up and I knew I could perform in the streets
Now in the wood, still can't sleep
Me and my dog lay and wait for weeks
My eyes don't close, he don't bark, I don't speak
Try to disappear so the nigga don't ease
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning shit around, maybe I should leave ya
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning things around, baby I should leave ya
Aye, yeah hey John boy, I know you feel what I'm slaying out there
I know you see motherfuckers and be like
What you suicidal about? I bring it
It's like people say we all gonna die
But me is different I'm not trying to be alive
I's try to get high
Baby that's just my desire
Now I'm pulling a sheet over my face before I die
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning shit around, maybe I should leave ya
It's all blurred out aye bitch I can't see ya
Turning things around, baby I should leave ya7Embed
