Music Makes Me High Lyrics
Days are dark and sometimes weary
And we need a place to go
Disappointment and confusion
You put your hands in God's and you hold on
Don't you be dismayed and don't be hurt
For only the strong survive
If you show that you are trying
You put your hands in God's and you hold on
Days are dark and sometimes weary
And we need a place to go
Disappointment and confusion
You put your hands in God's and you hold on

Music makes me high
This music makes me so high
Music makes me high
This music makes me so high
Music makes me high
This music makes me so high
Music makes me high
This music makes me so high

Don't you be dismayed and don't be hurt (Keep on holdin' on)
For only the strong survive (Holdin' on)
If you show that you are trying (Keep on holdin' on)
You put your hands in God's and you hold on
Days are dark and sometimes weary
And we need a place to go
Disappointment and confusion
You put your hands in God's and you hold on
Music makes me high
This music makes me so high
Music makes me high
This music makes me so high
Music makes me high
This music makes me so high
Music makes me high
This music makes me so high

We've got to tell the people
Though it feels like love is going
That with our heavenly father
You truly can hold on
We've got to tell the people
Though it feels like love is going
That with our heavenly father
You truly can hold on
We've got to tell the people
Though it feels like love is going
That with our heavenly father
You truly can hold on
We've got to tell the people
Though it feels like love is goingEmbed
