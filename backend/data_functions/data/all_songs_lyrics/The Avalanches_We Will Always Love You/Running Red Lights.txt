Running Red Lights Lyrics
Running, running red lights
Red lights, red lights
I been running red lights
To get to you
Running, running red lights
Where you been running all night?
I been running the red lights
Boom, boom, boom

I'm a thundercloud
Ready to burst, like Schrödinger
I'm crying in the car
An invalid, I'm off the grid

Hans is looking for Liesel
Living in Union Square
Shoot this rabid canine
Something's gone horribly wrong

Running, running red lights
Red lights, red lights
I been running red lights
To get to you
Running, running red lights
Where you been running all night?
I been running the red lights
Boom, boom, boom
(Lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights, lights)
I'm a thundercloud
Ready to burst, like Schrödinger
I'm crying in the car
An invalid, I'm off the grid

Hans is looking for Liesel
Living in Union Square
Shoot this rabid canine
Something's gone horribly wrong

Running, running red lights
Red lights, red lights
I been running red lights
To get to you
Running, running red lights
Where you been running all night?
I been running the red lights
Boom, boom, boom

The light of my life is going out tonight
In a pink champagne Corvette
The light in my life is going out tonight
Without a flicker of regret (Without a flicker of regret, dude)
I sleep three feet above the street
In a pink champagne Corvette
Fly out into space
Listen to the music
The stars are making
Without a flicker of regret
California life is alright with me
California life is alright with me
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are all we have
California life is alright with me
California life is alright with me
California life is alright with me
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are all we have
California life is alright with me

Running, running red lights
Red lights, red lights
I been running the red lights
To get to you
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are all we have
I been running the red lights
Boom, boom, boomEmbed
