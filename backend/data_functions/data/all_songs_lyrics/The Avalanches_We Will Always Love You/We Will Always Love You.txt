We Will Always Love You Lyrics
Since I saw you last, there's been many a sunset
And every day we're apart seems like a week
Oh, but I knew you belonged to him when we first met
But every day we're apart seems like a week

Since I saw you last, there's been many a sunset
You don't need to break it
And every day we're apart seems like a week
Gold is all you see
Oh, but I knew you belonged to him when we first met
I don't even understand
Every day we're apart seems like a week (Seems like a week)

Draped in monotony
What's my life gotten me?
Hard to be glorious when two minds meet in the corner
And a story is being told
By me to you
Take another hit, what else to do?
Think about leaving the house
But my fears aren't letting up

We'll always love you but
That's not my fault
We'll always love you (We'll always love you) but
That's not the point
It's all our fault every time you hear me pay
We always loved you
(We'll always love you but that's not the point)
Night time, on fire, dreaming of another life
Night time, on fire, dreaming of another life
Night time, on fire, dreaming of another life
(We'll always love you but that's not the point)
Night time, on fire, dreaming of another life
Night time, on fire, dreaming of another life
Night time, on fire, dreaming of another life
Night time, on fire, dreaming of another life5Embed
