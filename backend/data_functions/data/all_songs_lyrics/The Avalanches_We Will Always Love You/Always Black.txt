Always Black Lyrics
Uh, I feel like I feel, I feel like you see
Your energy still through me, it's all of me, all of me
A part of me guarded, still in my garden
Wake me up in the morning, I'm tired of mourning
There in that black, blessed be the gods
Stay where you stay, when you're there, hit me back
Out here the rain, tears can't explain
The years long
Black be the day, the light for me
We bend up right out the picture, my nigga
Flat foot with it, the style dripping
I'm mile sprinting, on and on
The life for me, running with me
Ride for me, ride

It's head over hills, my head to the hills
Head high, feel like yeah, get my people up there
Stay, ride, ride, ride
The lane switching, ride with me
Ride, ride, ride
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

There and back
It's always black
There and back
It's always black
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

There and back
It's always black
There and back
It's always black

Flying along on a rhythm track
Flying along on a rhythm trackEmbed
