Gold Sky Lyrics
Yeah, come on
Yeah, come on
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, come on
Yeah
Yeah

I got to tell ya, I'm feeling just the right
Minimal to maximal amount of shattered by life
My brain reads like an open book
I shack up from the walking plank
I travel down that mighty, rocky road
A heavy weight upon my broken bones
And if I die before my time
My last request: a trusty croaker
An ample handful of painkillers
Billy Burroughs above my vision
I have been reborn
Yeah, I have been reborn
I have made a very big dеcision

Alright
Like DJ Zerotonin
Just outside thе gates of heaven
Jesus, won't you let me in?
Jesus, won't you let me in?
I jumped so high
I jumped so low
S'alright with me
Smoking flowers
I'm afraid to fly and afraid to die
And somewhere miscellaneous
I let my soul slip away
I jump so high
I jump so low
Burning candles from all angles
Again

And again
And again
And again
And again
And again
And again
And again
And again
S'alright with me
S'alright with me
On golden sky
Away up high
I'm just up here
In the golden sky
On golden sky
Away up high
It's where soldiers go
When they have diedEmbed
