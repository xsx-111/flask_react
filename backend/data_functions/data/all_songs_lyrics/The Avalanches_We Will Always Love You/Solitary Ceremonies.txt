Solitary Ceremonies Lyrics
I still remember you

I remember when Liszt first began to communicate music to me
He used to do so by guiding my hands over the pianoforte keyboard
I can usually see this quite clearly whilst he's communicating
Although there are times when I hear his voice but cannot see him at all

To late Eastern skies
Oh, oh-oh
Jumped out fairly and left
Began to floatEmbed
