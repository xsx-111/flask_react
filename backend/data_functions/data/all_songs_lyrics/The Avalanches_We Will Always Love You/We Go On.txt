We Go On Lyrics
Yo, what's up?
This is Cola Boyy
I'm here with Mick Jones
We send our love to you, Karen

We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
Hurting each other, hurting each other
(Power to the people)
We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on
We go on

Walking up the hill, singing back a song
Moments before thе smoke leaves my barrеl
Why am I fighting to stay on this payroll?
I'm hurt, but the wound feels so sterile

We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on
We go on
(Now we're coming, now we running
No more game show)
Walking up the hill, singing back a song
Moments before the world breaks into DayGlo
Dancehall's rockin' for the people 'cause we say so
Overcoming, now we running, no more game show
Dancehall's rockin' for the people 'cause we say so
Overcoming, now we running, no more game show

We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on
(Dancehall's rockin' for the people 'cause we say so)
We go on, fighting with each other
We go on, fighting with each other
We go on
We go on
We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on

Dancehall's rockin' for the people 'cause we say so
Why am I fighting to stay on this payroll?
Overcoming, now we running, no more game show
Why am I fighting to stay on this payroll?
Overcoming, now we running, no more game show
We go on, fighting with each other (This is Cola Boyy)
We go on, fighting with each other (I'm here with Mick Jones)
We go on, fighting with each other
We go on, fighting with each other
We go on (We send our love to you, Karen)
We go on

We go on, hurting each other
We go on, hurting each other
We go on
(Dancehall's rockin' for the people 'cause we say so)Embed
