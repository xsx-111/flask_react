Reflecting Light Lyrics
If I struggle with affliction
It's because I cuddle with my contradiction
Life herself is habit forming
All of my nights were made for morning

Reflecting light
Reflecting light
From reflecting light
Reflecting light
From reflecting light
In all my nights
From reflecting light
Bathing in reflecting light

From negligence or spite
In my midnight hour, yeah
I stand in this reflecting light
While I fight, bathing in reflecting light

Dreamers moving slowly through reflecting light
Reflecting light, reflecting light
(—ing light)
You see, life's a bitch
And habit-forming, too
And if I can't have it
Then why the hell should you?
In that space where the lies go
When you try to explain

I stand in reflecting light (Reflecting light)
Reflecting light (Reflecting light)
Reflecting light
Yeah, reflecting (Reflecting)

Dreamers moving slowly through reflecting light (Reflecting light)
Reflecting light (I lose my second sight)
Dreamers, we should be asleep in
Moving slowly through reflecting light (Reflecting)

Glow, move to
Dreamers, we should be asleep in
Moving slowly through
Reflecting light
And I happen to think I should be alright1Embed
