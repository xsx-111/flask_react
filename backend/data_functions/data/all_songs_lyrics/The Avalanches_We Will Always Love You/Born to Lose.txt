Born to Lose Lyrics
One, two

Me I was to lose
Me I was to lose

One, two

Me I was to lose
Me I was to lose
Me I was to lose

One, two

Actually, he died of a broken heart
Me I was to lose
Actually, he died of a broken heart
Me I was to lose
Me I was to lose
Bunch of fucking assholes
Me I was to lose
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Me I was to lose
Me I was to lose
Me I was to lose
Me I was to lose1Embed
