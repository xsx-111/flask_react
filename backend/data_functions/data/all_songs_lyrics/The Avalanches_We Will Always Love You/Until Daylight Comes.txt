Until Daylight Comes Lyrics
I was the light
The light
I was the light
Light
I was the light

Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine
Sunshine

Jesus, come
Was this the song?
Just in reach
Feel you come
Were you young? (I was the light)
And when you pray
Yeah, was it grey?
Night and day
Night and day

Was it rain? Was it grey?
Do you kneel when you pray?
Was it night? Was it day?
Was it pain, anyway?
Were you old? Were you young?
Were your songs to be sung?
Will you walk just ahead?
And remember what I said?
That I'll be done until Jesus comes
Until Jesus comes
And when there's rain, there's floods
Make sure you runEmbed
