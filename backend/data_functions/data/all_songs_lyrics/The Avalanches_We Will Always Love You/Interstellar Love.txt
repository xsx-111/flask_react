Interstellar Love Lyrics
The sun in your eyes while all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes while all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes madе all of the lies worth
The sun in your еyes

Follow the light
Hold it in your hand
Our love belongs among the stars
Expanding from within
See them collide
Feel it all begin
Our souls belong among the stars
Our bodies can't hold it in

Spirit guide
Love provides
Spirit guide, spirit need
Love provides all that we need
]
Gave
You gave me love
Glory and love so easily
Glory and love

God created space and time with no end
If he did it once, he can do it again
Like interstellar love, shining light from above

The sun in your eyes while all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes while all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyesEmbed
