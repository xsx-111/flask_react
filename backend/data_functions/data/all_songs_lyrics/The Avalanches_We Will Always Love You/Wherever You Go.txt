Wherever You Go Lyrics
We step out of our solar system into the universe
Seeking only peace and friendship
To teach if we are called upon
To be taught if we are fortunate
We know full well that our planet and all its inhabitants–

I should like to extend the greetings
Of the government and people
To the extra-terrestrial inhabitants
 & Jimmy Osmond]
(Wherever you go, Hugo, we go too)
Yes, Maureen has circled him

(Wherever you go, Hugo, we're with you)
Hello from the children of planet Earth

(Wherever you go, Hugo, we go too)
Tanti auguri e saluti

(Wherever you go, Hugo, we're with you)
Siya nibingelela ma–
Wherever you go, Hugo, we go too
Wherever you go, Hugo, we're with you
Wherever you go, Hugo, we go too
Wherever you go, Hugo, we're with you
Wherever you go, Hugo, we go too
Wherever you go, Hugo, we're with–

We go, we go wherever you may go
We go, we go wherever you may go
(Wherever you go)
We go, we go wherever you may go
We go, we go wherever you may go
(We'll save your soul
We'll save your soul)

Vem Magalenha rojão (We'll save your soul)
Traz a lenha pro fogão
Traz a lenha pro fogão
Vem fazer armação
Vem Magalenha rojão
Traz a lenha pro fogão
Vem fazer armação
We go, we go
We go, we go wherever you may go

Wherever you go (Wherever you go)
You go, we are with you
Wherever you go (Wherever you go)
You go, we go, too


We go, we go
We go, we go wherever you may go
(Wherever you go)

So much time and so much conflict
So much stress and so much fighting
So much hate and so much change
Too much war is all so frightening
On the radio, we can love
(On the radio, we can love)
Hugo, we go, too
Wherever you go, Hugo, we're with you
(Wherever you go)
Wherever you go, Hugo, we go too
(You go, we're with you)
Wherever you go, Hugo, we're with–

We go, we go (Wherever you go)
Wherever you may go
We go, we go wherever you may go
(We'll save your–
We'll save your–)

Vem fazer armação
Vem fazer armação
(You go, we're with you)
(We go)
(We go)

We, we-we-we-we
Don't want to fall
Or build the wall
Under the fall
Like clouds of rain
We chase the rain
Don't fly away
We'll make our way

Words of love, too constipated
Everyone's so agitated
Thoughts of violence, celebrated
Media hype, calibrated
All the proof, fabricated
Politicians, calculated
In the towers, insulated
Drug consumption, regulated
They got the power, pay by the hour
Make the folks cower, they can devour
Hit you with the bass, right in the place
Smack in the face that you can embrace
One, two, three, four, open up those doors
On the dance floor, that's where you get yours

The whole damn world's incinerated1Embed
