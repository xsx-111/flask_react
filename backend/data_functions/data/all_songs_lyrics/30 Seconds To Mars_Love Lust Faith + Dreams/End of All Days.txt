End of All Days Lyrics
I'm tired of waiting
For the end of all days
The prophets are preaching
That the gods are needing praise
The headlights are coming
Showing me the way
The serpents are singing
A song that's meant to save

All we need is faith
All we need is faith
Faith is all we need

The desert is calling
The emptiness of space
The hunger of a lion
Is written on your face
A maniac's new love song
Destruction is his game
I need a new direction
Cause I have lost my way

All we need is faith
All we need is faith
Faith is all we need
A maniac messiah
Destruction is his game
A beautiful liar
Love for him is pain
The temples are now burning
Our faith caught up in flames
I need a new direction
Cause I have lost my way

All we need is faith
All we need is faith
Faith is all we need
Lord

A lifetime of consumption
They've all become the same
I punish them for pleasure
And pleasure some with pain
I punish you with pleasure
And pleasure you with pain
I punish you with pleasure
And pleasure you with pain8Embed
