Do or Die Lyrics
Xing dong hai shi si wang

In the middle of the night
When the angels scream
I don't want to live a lie, that I believe
Time to do or die

I will never forget the moment, the moment
I will never forget the moment

And the story goes on, oh oh oh
That's how the story goes
That's how the story goes

You and I will never die
It's a dark embrace
In the beginning was a light of a dawning age
Time to be alive

I will never forget the moment, the moment
I will never forget this night we sing, we sing
Oh oh oh
That's how the story goes

Fate is coming, that I know
Time is running, got to go
Fate is coming, that I know
Let it go
Here and now
Under the banner of heaven
We dream out loud
Do or die and the story goes (oh oh oh)
And the story goes, oh oh oh
(This is the story)
Fate is coming that I know
(This is the story)
Time is running got to go
(This is the story)
Fate is coming that I know
(This is the story)
Let it go
Hear me now
Under the banner of heaven
We dream out loud
Dream out loud
(Time to do or die)
Fate is coming, that I know
(Time to do or die)
Time is running out
(Time to do or die)
Fate is coming, that I know
(Time to do or die)
Let it go11Embed
