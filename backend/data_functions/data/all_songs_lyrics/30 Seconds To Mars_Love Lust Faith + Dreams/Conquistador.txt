Conquistador Lyrics
(1, 2, 3 Go!)

This is a fight to the death, our holy war
A new romance, a Trojan whore
(We will, we will, we will rise again)
This is a fight for the day, night, black and white
A victory dance, a burning riot
(We will, we will, we will rise again)
Yeah!

Hey, hey, say a prayer
Hey, hey, say a prayer

I am the I am the best she claimed and more
A battle scarred conquistador
(We will, we will, we will rise again)
This is a fight for our love, lust, hate, desire
We are the children of the great empire
(We will, we will, we will rise again)
Yeah!

Hey, hey, say a prayer
Hey, hey, say a prayer
Hey, hey, say a prayer
Hey, hey, say a prayer
This is a fight to the death
This is a fight to the death
This is a fight to the death
This is a fight to the death
This is a fight to the death

(We will, we will, we will rise again)
(We will, we will, we will rise again)

Hey, hey, say a prayer
Hey, hey, say a prayer

This is a fight to the death
