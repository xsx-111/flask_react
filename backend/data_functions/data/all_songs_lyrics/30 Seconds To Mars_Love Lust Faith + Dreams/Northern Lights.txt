Northern Lights Lyrics
Don't ever take a single second to breathe
They're gonna send me on a murdering spree
I cannot wait to dance upon your grave
They don't even have a soul left to be saved

But you would eat your young

We swam among the northern lights
And hid behind the edge of night
And waited for the dawn to come
And sang a song, to save us all

Hey, oh
You want a holy war?
Hey, oh
You want a holy war?

I am alive I'm just playing dead
I'm gonna say what should have never been said
The giants of the world are crashing down
The end is near hear the trumpets sound
But you would eat your young

We swam among the northern lights
And hid behind the edge of night
And waited for the dawn to come
And sang a song, to save us all

You would eat your young
You would eat your young
You would eat your young
You would eat your young
I am alive I'm just playing dead
I am alive I'm just playing dead

We swam among the northern lights
And hid behind the edge of night
And waited for the dawn to come
And sang a song, to save us all
We swam among the northern lights
And hid behind the edge of night
And waited for the dawn to come
And sang a song, to save us all7Embed
