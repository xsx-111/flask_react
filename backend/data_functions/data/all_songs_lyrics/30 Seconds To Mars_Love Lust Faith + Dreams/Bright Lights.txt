Bright Lights Lyrics
I’ve been dreaming of things yet to come
Living, learning, watching, burning
Eyes on the sun
I’m leaving, gone yesterday
Brutal, laughing, fighting, fucking
A price I had to pay

Bright lights, big city
She dreams of love
Bright lights, big city
He lives to run

Demon, where did my angel go?
Vacant, vapid, stupid, perfect
You are the one
A new day, a new age, a new face, a new lay
A new love, a new drug, a new me, a new you

Bright lights, big city
She dreams of love
Bright lights, big city
He lives to run
I forgive
Had enough
Time to live
Time to love
Time to live
Time to love
Time to live
Time to love5Embed
