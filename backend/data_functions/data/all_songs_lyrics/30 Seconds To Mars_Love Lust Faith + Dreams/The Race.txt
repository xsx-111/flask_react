The Race Lyrics

You saved my life
With blood and through sacrifice
The lessons that I've learned
I promise you I said
Never again, never again!
No never!

(Hey-hey!) It began with an ending
(Hey-hey!) We were fighting for the world
(Hey-hey!) My desire never ending
(Hey-hey!) The-the-the race, race

Love is a dangerous game to play
Hearts are made for breaking and for pain
I'm selfish and I'm cold
I promise you I said
Never again, never again!
No never!

(Hey-hey!) It began with an ending
(Hey-hey!) We were fighting for the world
(Hey-hey!) My desire never ending
(Hey-hey!) The-the-the race, race
I'm not running, no not running
I'm not running, no not running
I'm not running, no not running
I'm not running, no not running no

You saved my life
You saved my life, oh whoa
(Hey-hey! Hey-hey! Hey-hey!)
The-the-the race, race
(Hey-hey! Hey-hey! Hey-hey!)
The-the-the race, race

I'm not running, no not running
I'm not running, no not running
I'm not running, no not running
I'm not running, no not running no3Embed
