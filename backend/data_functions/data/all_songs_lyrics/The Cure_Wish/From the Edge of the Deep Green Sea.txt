From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea Lyrics
Every time we do this, I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave, it's all for her
"I know this can't be wrong", I say
(And I'll lie to keep her happy)
As long as I know that you know
That today I belong right here with you
Right here with you
And so we watch the sun come up
From the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
Like she wants to believe in me
So I try put your hands in the sky
Surrender, remember
We'll be here forever
And we'll never say goodbye
I've never been so colorfully
See through head before
(I've never been) I've never been so
Wonderfully me you want some more
And all I want is to keep it like this
You and me alone, a secret kiss
And don't go home, don't go away
Don't let this end, please stay
Not just for today
"Never, never, never, never, never let me go", she says
"Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days"
But suddenly she slows and looks down at my breaking face
"Why do you cry? What did I say?"
"But it's just rain", I smile brushing my tears away

I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried over you

How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry? Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want
"Why, why, why are you letting me go?" she says
"I feel you pulling back, I feel you changing shape"
And just as I'm breaking free, she hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky, surrenders it all
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried for you

It's always the same, wake up in the rain
Head in pain, hung in shame
A different name, same old game, love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Away from home again7Embed
