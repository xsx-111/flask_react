Take It In Lyrics
The wheel of fortune stops at six o'clock
So what am I to do until midnight?
An hourglass may grab my attention
But I am in no need of affection

And oh, oh, my heart has flown to you just like a dove
It can fly, it can fly
And oh, oh, please take my heart and keep it close to you
Take it in, take it in

My heart attack took place after midnight
But I was in no need of attention
Surgery took place in the half-light
By then, I was no more than a phantom

And oh, oh, my heart has flown to you just like a dove
It can fly, it can fly
And oh, oh, please take my heart and keep it close to you
Take it in, take it in
And oh, oh, my heart has flown to you just like a dove
It can fly, it can fly
And oh, oh, please take my heart and keep it close to you
Take it in, take it in
Oh, oh, my heart has flown to you just like a dove
It can fly, it can fly
And oh, oh, please take my heart and keep it close to you
Take it in, take it inEmbed
