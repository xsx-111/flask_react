Alley Cats Lyrics
Two people are alley cats
We have an unhappy cat
He is restless, needs attention
Loses patience, seeks affection
Monkey grooms, blossom blooms
Do you dig germs? The germs?

Well, we wear each other's heads like hats
Speak in tongues like alley cats
Cradle them in both our laps
When we lie alone
Wear each other's heads like hats
Speak in tongues like alley cats
Cradle them in both our laps
And we die alone

Well, we sleep inside a blankety bed
Planted like the crocuses
In the song, my mother said
She wanted us to sing
We sleep inside a blankety bed
Planted like the crocuses
And I wish my mother could
See the ring I got
Ooh-oh, there is no pain I know
Ooh-oh, there is no pain I know
(There's no pain that I know)
Ooh-oh, there is no pain I know
There's no pain that I know
There's no pain that I know
There's no pain that I know

The other night, you said you might
Try to kill that thing I love
It is too strong for you
It is encased in glass and stone
The other night, you said you might
Try to kill that thing I love
It is invincible
It is encased in glass and stone

You painted a song, you painted a song
(The other night, you said you might)
It started when I was young and now it is in my lung
(Try to kill that thing I love)
You painted a song, you painted a song
(It is too strong for you)
It started when I was young and now it is in my lung
(It is encased in glass and stone)
Two people are alley cats
I get to thinking 'bout our cat
He is restless, needs attention
Loses patience, seeks affection
Monkey grooms, blossom blooms
Do you dig worms? The worms?1Embed
