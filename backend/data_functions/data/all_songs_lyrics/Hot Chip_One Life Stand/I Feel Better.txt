I Feel Better Lyrics
She said, "How did we
Get ourselves so lost?"
And I said, "I don't know
But we will not be leaving tonight, tonight"
When you hold me, I
I feel better

I only want one night
Together in our arms
This is the longest night
We're meeting arms to arms

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
(I only want one night)
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
(This is the longest night)
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
Our–, our–
And maybe if we'd never come this way
Then we would live and prosper
But I doubt it
We are a violent race
And we deserve what we get
When you hold me, when you hold me
I feel better
I feel better

I only want one night
Together in our arms (I feel better)
This is the longest night
We're meeting arms to arms (I feel better)
I only want one night
Together in our arms (I feel better)
This is the longest night
We're meeting arms to arms

Nothing is wasted, a life is worth living
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
Nothing is wasted, a life is worth living
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
Nothing is wasted, a life is worth living
(I only want one night)
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
(Together in our arms)
There is a day that is yours for embracing
(This is the longest night)
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
(We're meeting arms to arms)
Nothing is wasted, a life is worth living
(I only want one night)
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
(Together in our arms)
There is a day that is yours for embracing
(This is the longest night)
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
(We're meeting arms to arms)2Embed
