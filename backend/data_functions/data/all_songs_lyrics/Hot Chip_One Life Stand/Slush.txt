What is the answer?
Oh, you know we'd all like to know
What is your reason?
Oh, I know we'd all long to know
Though there is nothing else left in our hearts
And what was your question?
Though I know, we'd all love to hear
What were you thinking?
I know that I'm with the people of the earth
Though there is nothing else left in our hearts

Now that we're older
There's more that we must do
With songs we remember
Remember, my love is with you

What is the question?
Oh, I know we'd all long to hear
The more I see things
I have to wonder, are we all but queer?
Now there is nothing else left in our hearts

Now that we're older
There's more that we must do
With songs to remember
Remember, my love is with you
Now that we're older
There's more that we must do
With songs to remember
Remember, my love is with you
Don't I know there is a god?
Don't I know there is a god?
Now I know there is a god
In your heart
Don't I know there is a god?
Don't I know there is a god?
Now I know there is a god
In your heart
Don't I know there is a god?
Don't I know there is a god?
Now I know there is a god
In your heartEmbed
