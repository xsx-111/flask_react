Brothers Lyrics
Brothers
I can take it if I know I'll see my brother
And just step back when I'm dancing with my brother
Is dancing with me
Brothers
I would give my life for my brothers
When we're driving and it's late with my brother
Sat next to me

It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have
It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have for my brothers
For my brother

Brothers
I can play Xbox with my brother
It's not about who won or lost with my brother
We play to be free
Brothers
I will drink my fill with my brothers
And if one of us is ill, then my brothers
Will watch over me
It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have
It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have for my brothers
For my brother

Brothers
When will we be free again, my brothers?
The way we used to be again, my brothers?
Now I bounce you on my knee again, my brother
We should be together now, my brothers
There's four of us and what is more, my brothers?
My brothers, my brothers

It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have
It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have for my brothers
For my brother
It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have
It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have for my brothers
For my brotherEmbed
