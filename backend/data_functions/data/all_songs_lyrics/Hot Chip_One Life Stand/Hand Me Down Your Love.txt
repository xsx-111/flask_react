Hand Me Down Your Love Lyrics
Hand me down your love
Hand me down your love
Hand me down your love
Hand me down your love
Hand me down your love (When I'm feeling sick)
Hand me down your love
Hand me down your love (When I'm losing it)
Hand me down your love

Open up my love
Open up my love
Open up my love
Open up my love
Open up my love (When I'm feeling sick)
Open up my love
Open up my love (When I'm losing it)
Open up my love

I've known for a long time
You are my love life
Why can't I be bright like my lover's light?

Write me down my love
Write me down my love
Write me down my love
Write me down my love
Write me down your love (When I'm feeling sick)
Write me down your love
Write me down your love (When I'm losing it)
Write me down your love
I've known for a long time
You are my love life
So why can't I be bright like my lover's light?
I've known for a long time
You are my love life
So why can't I be bright like my lover's light?
I've known for a long time
You are my love life
So why can't I be bright like my lover's light?Embed
