One Life Stand Lyrics
Tell me where you've been to
Nowhere that you shouldn't do
Tell me what you're good for
I can tell you something too
Where have you been staying?
Tell me what you're playing
Hope it's not my conscience
But it keeps complaining

Didn't meet you in an alley
The cats, they weren't complaining
I met you in the daylight
Our visions misbehaving
I offer you my temper
With the hope that you would tame me
We built ourselves a shelter
You will always be my baby

Feeling
Keep on feeling
Keep on feeling

I only wanna be your one life stand
(Keep on feeling)
Tell me, do you stand by your man?
(Keep on feeling)
I only wanna be your one life stand
(Keep on feeling)
Tell me, do you stand by your man?
(Keep on feeling)
Wishes keep remaining
Nothing worth containing
A balloon with air is escaping
Is nothing but a plaything
Moments keep us guessing
And lead us from temptation
But better to embrace them
And measure our relation

I only wanna be your one life stand
(Keep on feeling)
Tell me, do you stand by your man?
(Keep on feeling)
I only wanna be your one life stand
(Keep on feeling)
Tell me, do you stand by your man?
(Keep on feeling)
(Could this be, could this be?)
I only wanna be your one life stand
(Keep on feeling)
(Could this be, could this be?)
Tell me, do you stand by your man?
(Keep on feeling)
(Could this be, could this be?)
I only wanna be your one life stand
(Keep on feeling)
(Could this be, could this be?)
Tell me, do you stand by your man?
(Keep on feeling)Embed
