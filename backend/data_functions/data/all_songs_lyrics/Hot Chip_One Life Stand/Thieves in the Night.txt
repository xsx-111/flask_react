Thieves in the Night Lyrics
My friend once told me something so right
He said to be careful of thieves in the night
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Baby, I've lost you here in the crowd
Open your arms, I want to be found
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Maybe I'm calling your name in the night
Open our eyes, we'll feel with our sight
Oh-oh-oh, oh

A want is a lack, but also desire
A need can be nothing, but should be held higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh
A need is a want wearing disguise
It can be confused if fuelled by desire
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Baby, I'm calling your name in the night
No reason with need, look into my eyes
Oh-oh-oh, oh

Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't all want
My friend once told me something so right
He said to be careful of bugs that don't bite
Oh-oh-oh, oh
My friend once told me something so right
He said to be careful of thieves in the night
Oh-oh-oh, oh

Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't all want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always want
Happiness is what we all want
May it be that we don't always wantEmbed
