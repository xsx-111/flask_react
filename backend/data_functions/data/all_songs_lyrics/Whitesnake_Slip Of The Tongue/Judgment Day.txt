Judgment Day LyricsThe night is gone, the time has come
To find a new day has begun and it promises to stay
To soothe the pain of wasted years
And kiss away the bitter tears, a love to light the way
And from the darkness comes a smile
That reaches out for many miles, touching everyone
No more shadows of the past
Your spirit free to fly at last, shining in the sun
Like rolling thunder, I feel the power of love
It's a gift from Heaven and the Lord above
We walk toward desire
Hand in hand, through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day
Take it easy, take it slow
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go, places never seen before
'Cause I love ya and I need ya
I'll do my best to please ya, my love can open any door
When you hear the thunder in your darkest night
I'll be there to hold you when the lightning strikes
So, don't you worry, you can ease your mind
'Cause we'll still be dancing at the end of time
Who loves ya, who needs ya, who'll do his best to please ya
I love ya and I need ya, I'll get down on my knees
We walk toward desire
Hand in hand, through fields of fire
With only love to light the way
On the road to Judgment Day
So, don't you worry, baby, on the road to Judgment Day, ooh ooh
Who loves ya, who needs ya on the road to Judgment Day
Said I love ya and I need ya, my love can open any door
My love can open any door2Embed
