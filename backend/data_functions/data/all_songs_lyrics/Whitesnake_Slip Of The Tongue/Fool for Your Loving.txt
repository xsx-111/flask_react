Fool for Your Loving LyricsI was born under a bad sign
Left out in the cold
I'm a lonely man who knows
Just what it means to lose control
But, I took all the heartache
And turned it to shame
Now I'm moving moving on
And I ain't taking the blame
Don't come running to me
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man
So, I can say it to you, babe
I'll be a fool for your loving, no more
A fool for your loving, no more
I'm so tired of trying I always end up crying
Fool for your loving, no more
I'll be a fool for your loving, no more
I'm tired of hiding my feelings
You left me lonely too long
I gave my heart and you tore it apart
Oh baby, you done me wrong
Don't come running to me
I know I've done all I can
A hard loving woman like you
Just makes a hard loving man
So, I can say it to you, babe
I'll be a fool for your loving, no more
A fool for your loving, no more
I'm so tired of trying I always end up crying
Fool for your loving, no more
I'll be a fool for your loving, no more
I'll be a fool for your loving no more
No more, no more
So, I can say it to you, babe
I'll be a fool for your loving, no more
A fool for your loving, no more
I'm so tired of trying I always end up crying
Fool for your loving, no more
A fool for your loving, no more
No more, no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more
Fool for your loving no more1Embed
