Wings of the Storm LyricsOn and on, the road goes on
And it'll go on forever
Time will show if you and I
Will walk that road together
Through fire and water, ice and snow
Heaven above us, and Hell below
Holding on, trying to walk the line
With sweet temptation running close behind
I'm talking 'bout love, ooh, love
Like a fire forever burning
A flaming heart that's yearning, more and more
A love to keep us warm
On the wings of the storm
Everyday and every night
I keep hoping it'll be all right
Trying to leave the past behind
Still looking for some peace of mind
But, destiny brought us together
And promised us a time that would last forever
Though it's all been said before
It's the kind of love worth fighting for
I'm talking about love, ooh, love
Like a fire forever burning
A flaming heart that's yearning, more and more
A love to keep you warm
On the wings of the storm
On and on, the road goes on
And it'll go on forever
Time will show if you and I
Will walk that road together
I'm talking about love, ooh, love
Like a fire forever burning
A flaming heart that's yearning more and more
A love to keep us warm
On the wings of the storm
My love will keep you warm
On the wings of the stormEmbed
