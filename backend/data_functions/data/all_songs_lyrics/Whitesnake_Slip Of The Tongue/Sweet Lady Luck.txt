Sweet Lady Luck LyricsYou hold all the aces
I never get the chance to deal
Flick of the wrist and you cut me down
I'm spinning like a roulette wheel
You say that love's a gamble
But you play with loaded dice
You hide behind a good girl smile
With a heart stone cold as ice
But I want it, I need it
If you don't give it I'll steal it
I'll take it all and walk away
Lady Luck
You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you
Sweet Lady Luck
You can't stop your dealing
'Cause it's a crying shame
When the winner takes it all
And never ever takes the blame
But I want it, I need it
If you don't give it I'll steal it
I'll take it all and walk away
Lady Luck
You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
Who you gonna call when it all falls down on you
Ooh, what you gonna do?
What's that baby, Lady Luck
I need your love, I need it now
I've got to have it anyhow
Sweet Lady Luck
I can't win for losing
It's tearing me apart
So I'll play the joker to your queen
Of broken hearts
But I want it, I need it
If you don't give it I'll steal it
I'll take it all and walk away
Lady Luck
You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
Spinning like a roulette wheel, Sweet Lady Luck
You're a loser in the game of love, Sweet Lady Luck
I need your love, I need it now
I've got to have it anyhow
Sweet Lady Luck
Sweet Lady Luck
Sweet Lady Luck
Sweet Lady Luck
