The Deeper the Love LyricsWhen I look back on everything I've done
I know you must have cried a river of tears
But you were there when I was feeling low
To walk me through my darkest fears
So when the sun goes down
An' those nights grow colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder
And the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion
There were times I almost let you go
When I thought I needed to break free
But you were there to whisper in my ear
Why don't you share your dreams with me?
So when the sun goes down
And those nights are growing colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder
And the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion
I don't mind what you're doing to me
I don't mind 'cause you're all I can see
I don't mind, baby you mean the world to me
When the sun goes down
And those nights are growing colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder
Baby, baby, baby
So when the sun goes down
And those nights are growing colder
I will be there
Looking over your shoulder
'Cause the deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper the devotion
The deeper the love
The stronger the emotion
And the stronger the love
The deeper, the deeper
The deeper the devotion
I never gonna let you go
In my heart, I know
I really love you, I love you
Ooh babe, I really love you
Ooh, huh huhEmbed
