Slip of the Tongue LyricsSometime after midnight
The heat begins to rise
Girl, you'd shame the Devil
With the look that's in your eyes
I know what's on your mind
I can't run away
I don't give you what you want
There's gonna be some hell to pay
Creepin' up behind me
Knockin' at my door
Never be too blind to see
Just what you're lookin' for
You roll me over
Make me moan, ooh
Such a velvet touch
You'd melt a heart of stone
Anytime, anyplace
I'm just the fool
Who puts a smile on your face
A slave to love
And keep you young
All it takes and no mistakes
Is just a slip of the tongue
Ooh oh
Just a slip of the tongue
An' I want a little love
I gotta take a little pain
Make me think a thousand times
Before I kiss again
I'm waiting on you
Every day and every night
I don't try to satisfy
There's gonna be a fist fight
Anytime, anyplace
I'm just the fool
Who puts a smile on your face
A slave to love
And keep you young
All it takes and no mistakes
Is just a slip of the tongue
Ooh, just a slip of the tongue
The sun is slowly rising
And I'm sinkin' to my knees
Dying just to close my eyes
I'm begging, "Darlin' please"
I hear you calling
I'm crawling cross the floor
I give you everything I got
And still you ask for more
Oooh
Anytime, anyplace
I'm just the fool
Who puts a smile on your face
A slave to love
And keep you young
All it takes and no mistakes
Is just a slip of the tongue
A slip of the tongue
Just a slip of the tongue
A slip of the tongue
Just a slip of the tongue
A slip of the tongue
A slip of the tongue
Owww owww
