When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up on the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love

Oh baby
Oh yeah baby
Oh yeah baby
Ooh baby

Dreams about you all the time
Feels so good when we're together love
Just can't wait until tomorrow night
Oh, baby, let's shake it

When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up on the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you1Embed
