Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, ooh (Ooh), ooh

All alone
It's all in the things that you drag along
It's all in the things that I call my own
The part of the picture

All alone
It's all in the things that you drag along
It's all in the things that I call my own
It's part of the picture
Part of the pictureEmbed
