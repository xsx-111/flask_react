11 Lyrics
Hey, boy
You're about to hit the ground after so long
When my mind went up and down after so long
While you're riding solo

Your crazy ways got the best of me
I search your face and everything I see
Is not enough for me

Hey, boy
You're about to hit the ground after so long
When my mind went up and down after so long
While you're riding solo

Hey, boy
You're about to hit the ground after so long
When my mind went up and down after so long
While you're riding soloEmbed
