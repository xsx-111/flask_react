10 LyricsIt's the consequence
See the aftermath
We see the future
Of the present
It's the consequence
Of our aftermath
Of the future
Of the future

We are children of this life 
Enjoy
And if the future holds a story
We believe
And if the story holds 
We believe
 future beholds

Where the future 
Or the future holds the path to glory
We believe
In the future
We believe
We believe

Enjoy
We are children of this life 
Enjoy
And if the future holds a story
We believe
And if the story holds 
We believe
We believe
Enjoy
We are children of this life 
Enjoy
And if the story holds 
We believe
We believeEmbed
