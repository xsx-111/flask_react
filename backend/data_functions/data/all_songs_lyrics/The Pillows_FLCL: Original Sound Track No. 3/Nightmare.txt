Nightmare Lyrics
Good night
Sleep tight, baby
I cling to your side
I will kiss your cheek
So you have nothing
To worry about
Good night
Sweet dreams, baby
Come closer to me
I will hold you tight
So you have nothing
To worry about
However
She spit as who should say
'Oh, silly! Don't bother me'
'I'm all right by myself
Don't you know that much?'
'Nightmare is great fun!'Embed
