RUNNERS HIGH Lyrics
Escape from the sinking!
Do you see what I mean?
Freedom beats the kingdom!
And I saw you in my dream
息をとめてずっと走り続けた
鼓動が聞こえるか
Just Runners High!
Escape from the sinking!
Do you see what I mean?
Freedom beats the kingdom!
And I saw you in my dream
目を閉じていたって全てが見えた
風をかき分けて
Just Runners High!
Runners High!
Just Runners High!
Runners High!
Dizzy my future
Silly my wayEmbed
