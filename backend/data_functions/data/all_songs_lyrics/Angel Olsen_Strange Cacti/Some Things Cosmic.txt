Some Things Cosmic Lyrics
Before we draw, my dear dear friend
I promise you my word
If we should part, my dear dear love
You know you’re in my heart

And though I may be getting older
Know that I'm going with you
Know that I'm hanging on to the things that you said
The things that you said

I felt my soul rise up from my body
When I look into your blue eyes
If cosmic force is real at all
It’s come between you and I

I want to be naked
I don’t mean my body
I don’t need my body

I’m floating away
I’m floating away
I’m floating away4Embed
