So That We Can Be Still Lyrics
Must all of my memories drown into infinity?
Try to grasp them, but I always miss
Time goes by so fast as if it hardly wants to exist
Let's make a mask of our face, of our hands
So that we can be still for a while
For a while, for a while

All the many ways that you can choose to be alive
All the countless steps you take before you have arrived
All the passing faces going quickly on their way
Where are they going so quickly?
And where you're going, is it the same?
One moment, you're awake and making a sound
Another asleep in your ground
In your ground, in your ground

Well, shall we wrap it all up in bows?
Thank you, I have all my thoughts to go
Wrapped up in a box with the rest of my soul
To hide away
To hide away
To hide away
Yeah, hoping somebody might find it
Yeah, hoping somebody might find it
Yeah, hoping somebody might find it
Yeah, hoping somebody might find itEmbed
