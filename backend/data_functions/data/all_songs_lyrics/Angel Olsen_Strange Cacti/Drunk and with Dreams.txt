Drunk and with Dreams LyricsSomeone has got to go on believing
Someone has got to speak of a feeling
Someone has got to let down their guard
For someone
And I’ll be the one, be the one, I do not mind
And if you should touch me, know that I'm made
That I’m made of fire
Drunk and with dreams I am lost out at sea
With my only map, I have memories
And how else do you suggest I get back to that place?
With only one memory, I've never seen his face
Though I keep it alive like a bell underwater
Rings in my head and as long as it’s ringing
It was once said
It was once said
I’ll be the one, be the one, I do not mind
And if you should touch me know that I'm made
That I’m made of fire
Oh lift me up
Oh lift me up
Oh lift me up just to bury me under
Lift me up
Oh lift me up
Oh lift me up just to bury me under2Embed
