Creator, Destroyer LyricsI watch from a tower in the back of my mind
I watch from a window as the living walk by
Down below, walking with quiet dreams
Walking out, quiet day and in my head
I might be sorry, it makes no difference now
I might be wishing I had some place to go
Hit the streets, out in search for the self
That has left me lying
And I never seem to notice, it's too late before I know
That all the love inside has been empty
The world we made has been ending
And like a ghost that hangs around
And won't forgive its earthly sins
I've carried on this love for you
It's how my body lives
My darling, how are you?
How have you been lately?
I only seem to speak to you of superficial things
Creator, you destroy me
You know my hunger well
And yet you starve me until I'm begging on my knees
And these are a few of very many things I can't begin to say out loud
If only this song could carry us on, but I know I'm only entertaining myself
I felt that even after I've been stripped of all my pride
There still remains a place for you
To crawl up inside
To crawl up inside
To crawl up inside
And I'm out of my mind, out of my mind
Murderous bitch, I'm out of my mind
I'm out of my mind to be in love with you
The way that I'm in love with you
The way that I'm in love with you
Doot do do do doot doo do do do
Doot do do do doot doo do do do
Doot do do do doot doo do do do
Fuck this and everything we've done
Fuck you
Fuck you and your lies3Embed
