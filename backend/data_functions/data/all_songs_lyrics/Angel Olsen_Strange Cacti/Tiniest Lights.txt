Tiniest Lights LyricsAnother winter, another spring
Another old and restless thing
Another tremble, another shake
Another sleeps while the other waits
Bear your burden, the winded balm
Bury it down and down
Who had to put his trust in one so lonesome and so proud
And don't forget to say a word of fire-headed prayer
And if it's not within you, well, ask someone who is there
To turn you out toward the sun
Now that the season's begun
To lift these shadows from your heart
To shine a lightness in your dark
I'm looking out for the tiniest life
I'll be looking out for the tiniest sign
I'll be looking out for the tiniest light
To shine, shine on down
Won't you shine, shine on down?1Embed
