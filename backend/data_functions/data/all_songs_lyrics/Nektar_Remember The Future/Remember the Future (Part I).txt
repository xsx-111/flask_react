Remember the Future (Part I) LyricsTake a trip back in time
Life evolving growing higher
Not just space that bluebird sees
In the sea a new domain
E-vo-lu-tion
E-vo-lu-tion
Swimming forth came on land
Beast to ape grasping hands
Thinking kill never ran
Lived in caves enter man
E-vo-lu-tion
E-vo-lu-tion
Tamed the fire prophesied
Length of day and height of sky
Made his tools chased his meal
Then progressed he built the wheel
Falling down from heaven
Twisted leaves - so twisted
Still so strong after all those
L-I-E-S
I can see the meaning
Twisted trees - so twisted
Spin the wheel of never ending
T-I-M-E
Blessed were the ways of the creatures in their caves
Who hold the last clue in the life of me and you
They had to fight to make good their rights
And Bluebird could not stir
Who
Who made you and who made me
Whose are the eyes of the world that looked at me
Falling from their saddles
Victories lost battles
Spin the wheel of never ending
L-I-F-E
Blessed were the ways of the sinners in their graves
Who saved the last place in the shade for me and you
Forty Thousand teeth were beared
As if to rip the flesh already torn
Who
Who made you and me
Whose were the eyes of the world that looked at me
I was the first to see it all
When rainbow crossed the bridge at dawn
Forty billion miles I came to tell this tale
Already told
Who
Who made you and who made me
Whose are the eyes of the world we're looking through
Remember the future
Remember the future
Remember the future
Remember the first time
I came here the last time
Remember the future will always be there
But now that it's over
I'll see you the next time
Remember the future is yours
Remember the future
Remember the future
And now that you've seen me
I see it's behind you
Remember the future will always be there
And so I have told you
You see what's before you
Remember the future is yours
Remember the future
Remember the future
Remember the future
Remember the futureEmbed
