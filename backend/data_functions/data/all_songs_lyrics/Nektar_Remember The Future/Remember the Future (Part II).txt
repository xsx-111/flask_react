Remember the Future (Part II) LyricsI can see you
I can hear you
I can see you
I can hear you
I can see you
I can hear you
I can see you
I can hear you
I can see it all when I look into your eyes
I can sense it all when I look into your skies
I can see, oh I can feel
You are me and that's the way
It has to be, you are me
I can feel it all when I look behind your smile
I can hear it all when I look behind your mind
I can sense, oh I can feel
You are me and that's the way
It's always been, you are me
Bluebird what do you see
Bluebird what do you feel
I feel everything, I see life, I see the stars
And I can't care for anything
Bluebird where have you been
Bluebird what have you seen
I've been everywhere
I've seen all around
And I can't warn against anything
Smile if you want to
Not when you can
Break down if you want to
Not when you can
Follow me home 'cos tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
You stand before me
Fate in your hand
You say tomorrow
Will never begin
Follow me home 'cos today
Is tomorrow yesterday
Walking down lonely roads
What do I see
Won't be long 'til they come again free
Name that place, name mine too
Where will we be
Won't be long 'til they crucify me
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
See them run
See them run
See them run
See them run
Watch them go now
I can see you
Through the morning mist and the evening too
I can hear you
Getting closer now to the living truth
You say that life has no end
But believe me you've go to pretend because
I can see you
Coming closer now to the living truth
Gonna let it grow, someday
You're gonna let it show
I can see you
Come close to me and I'll tell you true
I can feel you
Listen carefully to what I say to you
I tell you life has no end
There's no need for you to pretend
'Cos you see you
Believe yourself that's all you have to do
Gonna let it grow, someday
You gotta let it show
You know that I can't stop it
You know that I can't stop it
You know that I can't stop it
You know, you know that I
You know that I can't stop it
You know that I can't stop it
You know, you know that I
You know that I can't stop it
Let it grow, you don't need no sympathy
You don't realize how much you needed me
You will realize it's better when you give
'Cos your life is longer than you live
The laws of nature are to heal the wounds of man
Use them right and they will help you if they can
Wrongly used and you'll only harm yourself
Then it's too late to come to me for help
Don't walk away
Give it a chance
Let it grow
Let it grow
Let it grow
Let it growEmbed
