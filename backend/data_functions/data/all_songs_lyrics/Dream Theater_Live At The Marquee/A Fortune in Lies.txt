A Fortune in Lies Lyrics
For the first time in a long time
Everything was right in my world
And then I woke up

I can remember when in the unity of our five-day sessions
Not even once did we hear the siren song
What kind of imagination, asleep in some lyrical coma
Who's vain futile memory could have been so wrong?

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles

A trifling euphoria was such an untimely religion
Maybe your life can explain the reason for my indecision
Here is a poor man, the heart of this monster creation
He said we both will be heroes and I was led into temptation

You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
You can ride the red
Until everybody smiles
Can you show me your gold and your silver?
A hero in frozen water

Now you've made a fortune in lies
And you kept a giant alive
You rode the red, you rode the red!Embed
