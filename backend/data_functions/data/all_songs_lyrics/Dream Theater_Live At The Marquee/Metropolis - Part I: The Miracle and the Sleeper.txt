Metropolis - Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper Lyrics
The smile of dawn arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain, she'll never outgrow

Death is the first dance, eternal

There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined
To this mind

I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

As a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow
As a man, I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep, yet I'm so afraid
Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares the faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again

Deceit is the second without end

The city's cold blood teaches us to survive
Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive
The third arrives...

Before the leaves have fallen
Before we lock the doors
There must be the third and last dance
This one will last forever
Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taken you to your home

It can only take place
When the struggle between our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know
That the third is love
Love is the Dance of Eternity!4Embed
