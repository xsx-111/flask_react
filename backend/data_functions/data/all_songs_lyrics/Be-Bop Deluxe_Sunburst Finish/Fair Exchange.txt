Fair Exchange LyricsHere we come on a cloud, stars in our eyes
Standing up proud, it's a perfect disguise
We've got so much to give, so much to gain
Just give me your money and I'll give you my pain
It's a fair exchange . . . (fair exchange)
Now Tia Maria, she leans on the wall
Looks in the mirror and pukes on the floor
Tries to remember the cause of it all
He just gave her a drink and she gave him a ball
It's a fair exchange
But I expect you expect a lot from me
I can feel your burning need
Your greedy, seedy
Fantasies are guaranteed to make my young heart bleed
For you and your pubescent blues, yes
You . . . and your dancin shoes
You . . . and your sad glad news
About your boyfriend Stan
He's a dirty flirty man
And he'll get you if he can
Here I stand in a daze, axe in my hand
Another fool on the stage with a traveling band
There's a space in my heart . . . permanent flame
Just give me your body and I'll give you my brain
It's a fair exchange
Now Venus de Milo, a statue of note
She lays in the gutter
With a knife in her throat . . . naked as sin
No, not even a coat
She gave you a thrill so you gave her a grope
It's a fair exchange
Still, I expect you expect a lot from me
I know you all
The show goes on despite the wrong
The strong still rise
And the weak still fall
This song is up to you, all along
You never knew
This song is coming on through to take you for a ride
It's tested, true and tried
Even though it almost liedEmbed
