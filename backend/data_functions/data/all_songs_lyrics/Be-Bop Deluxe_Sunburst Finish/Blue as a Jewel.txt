Blue as a Jewel LyricsThere's a crystal at the heart of every tear
On reflection making love affection clear
And she is blue as jewel
Clear as ice, kind and cruel
There's a silence at the edge of every sigh
There's a light that haunts the corners of her eyes
And she's blue as a jewel
Clear as ice, kind and cruel
There's a moon deep within her girlish breast
There's a rose that blooms with every warm caress
And she's blue as a jewel
Clear as ice, kind and cruel
She takes her time, oh she takes her time
She makes her moves and they suit me fine
Blue as a jewel
She's nobody's fool but word gets out
Oh she lies so well
I can't dispel the glimpse of hell
In her eyes
There are stories that she tells when she's asleep
There are secrets that she shares but stills he keeps
And she's blue as a jewel
Clear as ice, kind and cruel
There's a picture that she paints without a brush
There are times when all her silver turns to rust
And she's blue as a jewel
Clear as ice, kind and cruel
And she's blue as a jewel
Clear as ice, kind and cruelEmbed
