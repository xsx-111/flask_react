Crying to the Sky LyricsCrying to the sky
Searching for a silver lining
Hoping that the clouds I'm climbing aren't hiding rain
Nowhere left to go
For every show now disappoints me
Still the ghost of love lost haunts me till my dying day
I could fly away
Over the river of tears
But I think I'll stay
To face all my troubles and fight like a man
I won't fear
Love is near
Crying to the sky
Weeping like a silver fountain
Praying on the holy mountain that it won't rain
I could say goodbye
Follow the Sun and the Moon
But that would be a lie
My heart's in your hand
And I'm leading a band full of blues
Just for you
Crying to the sky
Searching for a silver lining
Hoping that the clouds I'm climbing aren't hiding rainEmbed
