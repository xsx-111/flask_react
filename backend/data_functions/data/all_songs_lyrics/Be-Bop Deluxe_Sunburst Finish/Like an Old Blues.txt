Like an Old Blues LyricsNelson
Laughing at me
Those pictures you said were strange . . 
Out of tune, out of key
It's such a shame but you never quite see
You always put the blame on me . . 
I'm like an old blues that you never use
Going out of style and it's not worthwhile anymore . . 
Looking at you and the way you shine
Like a sharp knife . . 
Well, I've found a new switchblade
It's time I took a stab at a new life . . 
There's nothing left for me to lose . . 
You're just an old blues that I never use
Going out of style and it's not worthwhile anymore . . 
You send your dirty words to me
You're having a ball with the men of the law . . 
But the poet and his pen are free
And there's nothing you can do
That will ever bring me to my knees . . 
Calling me names . . . You make me feel like I'm crazy . . 
Something has changed, I don't care for you lately . . 
Nothing left for me to do . . 
I'm just an old blues that you never use
Going out of style and it's not worthwhile anymore . . Embed
