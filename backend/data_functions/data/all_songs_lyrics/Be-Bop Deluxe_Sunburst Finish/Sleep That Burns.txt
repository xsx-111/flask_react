Sleep That Burns LyricsA brass band is playing, rehearsing it's thrills
All half-moon and cloudy, all golden and shrill . 
I've got a sleep that burns . . . a sleep that burns . 
Got a sleep that burns all night
I'm locked in your dark world
Where hearts hold the keys
Half-opened, enchanted, half-truth and half dreams . 
I've got a sleep that burns . . . a sleep that burns . 
Got a sleep that burns all night
I'm sitting in a cafe in paradise . 
Naked as a razor, I'm as loaded as a dice . 
The waitresses all ask me for my price
I laugh and say I'm leaving and this is only dreaming
So hold me while I'm screaming . 
Now . . . ! Is the moment of truth . 
Your youth is a mask but it's not made to last
For we all have a past to out run
When the mask comes undone
And we race on and on
Through the fiery portals of hell . . . !
Go and tell all your friends
That you've witnessed the end
Of the world in a dream . 
The night winds are howling . . . seducing the trees
I wake in a cold sweat
With the sheets 'round my knees . 
I've got a sleep that burns . . . a sleep that burns . 
Got a sleep that burns all night
I lay in the darkness with visionless eyes . 
Exhausted and reeling . . . all heartbeats and sighs . 
But the sleep still burns, yes, the sleep still burns
Got a sleep that burns all night . 
(sleep is coming, don't you worry . . .)Embed
