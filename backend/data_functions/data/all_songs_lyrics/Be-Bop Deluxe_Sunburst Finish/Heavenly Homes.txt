Heavenly Homes LyricsThe stars are burning
And the moon is shining bright
The world is turning underneath
This canopy of night . 
Somewhere tomorrow warms the distance
With the light of dawn
You yawn, my love
Your eyes are growing tired
The dawn must come although we will deny it . 
I'd like to hold you here
Beneath these clouds of darkest blue . 
It could be a million years
Before the day comes creepin through
But in the meantime
Let the moonshine shine
I'm fine, my love, but tell me
How are you . . . ?
You know that in the end it all comes true . 
Heavenly homes are hard to find
Heavenly thoughts in heavenly minds
Are not the worlds' designEmbed
