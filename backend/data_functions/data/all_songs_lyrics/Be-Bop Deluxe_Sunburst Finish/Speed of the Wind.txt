Speed of the Wind LyricsNelson
If you see me
If you see me smiling
It's no sin
It's just the speed of the wind
If you want me
If you want me laughing
Let me sing
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
If you hear
If you hear the ringing bells
It chimes within
It's just the speed of the wind
If you fear
If you fear your secret
Just walk right in
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
Hey, don't put out your light
There's too much shadow in your room tonight
This time before time begins
We'll touch the sky with our tragic wings
Your world's a sinking place
We'll sink the night on maiden names
See what a fortnight brings
Ascending, ascending, ascending, ascending
Ascending, ascending, ascending, ascending
Ascending, ascending, with the speed of the wind
With the speed of the wind
With the speed of the wind
If you see me
If you see me smiling
It's no sin
It's just the speed of the wind
If you want me
If you want me laughing
Let me sing
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
If you hear
If you hear the ringing bells
It chimes within
It's just the speed of the wind
And If you fear
If you fear your private
Just walk right in
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the wind
It's just the speed of the windEmbed
