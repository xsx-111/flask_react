Beauty Secrets LyricsHand me my costume
Please won't you pass me mask . . . ?
I have appointments that I must keep with my past . 
Bring on the cabaret, we can all have a laught . 
I've made the theatre of the absurd at last . 
Drink up and let's go home
The demon is on the phone . 
He's playing a dialing tone
So, drink up and let's go home . 
Orchestrations of a different nature . 
Arrangements that I made to end it all . 
Yeras and years of love all turned to paper
Dancing at the old musician's ball
And these beauty secrets that I've kept so long
Have slightly faded like my old blue jeans
But read them now because before too long
They could fall apart at every seam . 
Play me my music
Please won't you warm up the band . . . ?
Turn on the spotlight
We can pretend there's a stage . 
I'll be your hero only as long as I'm paid
Drink up and let's go home . 
(You're such a naughty boy . . .)
The demon is on the phone . 
(He's got a special toy . . .)
He's playing a dialing tone . 
(A thing to bring you joy . . .)
So, drink up and let's go home . 
Let's go home . Embed
