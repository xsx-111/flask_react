Ships in the Night LyricsLike a square peg in a round hole 
Like a harp without it's strings 
Like a sailor who sails no oceans 
Like a bird that has no wings 
Without love, I am a desert
Without love, My light is dim 
Without love, I have no treasures 
Without love, I cannot win 
(without love) . . . We are like ships in the night 
(without love) . . . Selling our souls down the river 
Sailing away and forever our pleasure is blue 
Like a dream that has no dreamer
Like a cloud without a sky 
Like a truth with no believer
Like a mother without a child 
Without love, I am a desert
Without love, My light is dim 
Without love, I have no treasures 
Without love, My chance is slim 
(without love) . . . We are like ships in the night 
(without love) . . . Selling our souls down the river 
Sailing away and forever our pleasure is blue Embed
