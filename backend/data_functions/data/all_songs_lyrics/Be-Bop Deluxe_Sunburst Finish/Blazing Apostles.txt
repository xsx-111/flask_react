Blazing Apostles LyricsGod drives a dreamless highway in a black sedan
Picking up survivors, preaching to the motel man
Blazing apostles
Thieves in the night
Messengers of the fall
If you are needing an angel of light
Why don't you give us a call?
Death drives an airflow Chrysler on the streets of man
A hit-and-run driver, cruising since the world began
Blazing apostles
Guardians of light
The phone number's on the wall
If you are needing a devil to fight
Why don't you give us a call?
Salvation brings a badge to wear
On the glad rags of your soul
Just keep up with the payments
And we'll make your misery whole
We've got albums of redemption
And confessions on cassettes
All on easy hire
From the following address
All on easy hire
From the following address
Blazing apostles
Flat Ninety-Nine
South Revelation Row
City of Lost Souls
Land of the Blind
It's a wonderful place to go
It's a wonderful place to go
Saints on the highway, martyrs on the road to Hell
Posters make a prophet if you've got a soul to sell
Chance of a lifetime, join the legions of the damned
Secrets of Egypt, substances from old Japan
Blazing apostles
Guardians of light
The phone number's on the wall
If you are needing a devil to fight
Why don't you give us a call?
Why don't you give us a call?
Why don't you give us a call?
Why don't you give us a call?
Why don't you give us a call?Embed
