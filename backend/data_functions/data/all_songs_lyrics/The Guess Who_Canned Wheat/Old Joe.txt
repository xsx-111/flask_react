Old Joe Lyrics
He comes home after working for so many many years
Lays down weary on his bed
So many worries, broken dreams and fears
Hurting things that people said

Is there something you could do for him right now if you were there?
Is there some kind word that you would say to him if you were there?

He don't remember mama
His mama never saw his face
The wounds he suffered from an angry, bitter world
Are something time cannot erase
