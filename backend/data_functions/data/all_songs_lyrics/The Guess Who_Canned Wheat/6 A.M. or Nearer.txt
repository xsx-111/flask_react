6 A.M. or Nearer Lyrics
There ain't no reason to talk
About the things I could have done
My living don't come easy
And I've hardly just begun
I'm not getting back the heartaches like before
Anymore, anymore
They say seeing is believing
So I lent myself to travel
Soon became experienced
And my soul turned into gravel
Turned every stone and opened every door
Like before, like before

Sun was hardly shining
It was 6 A.M. or nearer
My mind was sick of trying
As the sky became a mirror
I really felt like dying
It was 6 A.M. or nearer
I was drowning
I was drowning

I soon got sick of falling
So I took a try in praying
I heard somebody calling
Might have been a baby playing
And I fell down from the ceiling to the floor
Like before
Like before
