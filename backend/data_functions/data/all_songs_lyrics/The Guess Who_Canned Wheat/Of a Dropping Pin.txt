Of a Dropping Pin Lyrics
Can I be somewhere when I'm nowhere?
Gaze through a diabetic eye
Can I put down the right to be put down?
And never known the right to try

I'd leave and take my pride with me
And find something I could carry it in
But all that breaks the stillness here
Is the sound of a dropping pin

From the silence
Deep within
Comes the sound
The sound of a dropping pin
From the silence
Deep within
Yeah, deep, deep within
Comes the sound
The sound of a dropping pin

Can I be something when I'm nothing?
Build my hopes and dreams too high
I've searched too long for all the answers
Let alone the right to try
To think that you can take it with you
Is the one unforgivable sin
But all that breaks the stillness now
Is the sound of a dropping pin
