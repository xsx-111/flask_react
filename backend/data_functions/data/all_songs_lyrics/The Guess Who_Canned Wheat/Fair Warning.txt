Fair Warning Lyrics
Well I've been trying for ages
And it looks like it's all in vain
And if things don't start looking up pretty soon
I'm going home
Well the folks back home
They wonder where I've been
And they're looking pretty good to me now
So if you're thinking of bright lights and fame
Stay at home
For there's managers and booking agents
Out for what they can get
And each one says he's your friend
But there's not one of them there
But for what he can get out of it
In the end
So if you're thinking of going on the stage
Put down your guitar, stay in school
Take advantage of your age
Take it from me
I've been there and I've come back
Don't be a starEmbed
