Key Lyrics
Johnnie's nineteen and he doesn't see the matter
Of Judas's dream reaching for the piece of silver
Peter hears the call of the mockingbird from heaven
Crying in the morning, having given up the key

And I still call him my friend
And I still call him my friend

Joshua puts on his mask and walks the road to Jericho
Matthew wears the head piece of chrome and speed and fire
Noah guides the ark through the sea of stolen moments
Searching through his mind for a place to put the key


Joseph tends the sheep in his coat of many colors
Shadrach and the two held their faith against the fire
Barabbas on the cross found that Jesus was the answer
The doors were open wide to all those who found the key

And we still call Him our friend
And we still call Him our friendEmbed
