I Was a Stranger LyricsI was a stranger
When I came to town
Just yesterday
I was a stranger
They don't come much stranger
So why
Why did you believe
All every word I said
Why did you believe
Believe a stranger
A stranger
And why do you women in this town
Let me look at you so bold
When you have seen what I was
In the last town
In the last town
You should have seen what I was
If I was a stranger
I was worse than a stranger
I was well-known2Embed
