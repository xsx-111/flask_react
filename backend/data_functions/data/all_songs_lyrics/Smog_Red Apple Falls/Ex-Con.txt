Ex-Con Lyrics
Whenever I get dressed up
I feel like an ex-con
Trying to make good
Whenever I get dressed up
I feel like an ex-con
Trying to make good

Jean jacket and tie
Feel like such a lie
Then I go to your house
I feel like I'm
Casing the joint

In the grocery store
In line behind a mother and a child
I'm going to take that child
I'm going to take that child
I'm going to take that child

See because alone in my room
I feel like such a part of the community
But out on the streets
I feel like a robot by the river
Alone in my room
I feel such a warmth for the community
Oh, but out on the streets
Out on the streets
I feel like a robot by the river
Looking for a drinkEmbed
