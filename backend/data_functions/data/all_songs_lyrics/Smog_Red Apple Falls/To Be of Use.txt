To Be of Use LyricsMost of my fantasies are of
Making someone else come
Most of my fantasies are of
To be of use
To be of use
To be of some hard
Simple
Undeniable use
Oh, like a spindle
Or oh, like a candle
Oh, like a horse shoe
Or oh, like a corkscrew
To be of use
To be of use
To be of use
Most of my fantasies are of
Making someone else come
On a horse
Over palms laid
On the threshold
Of the coming day
Coming day
Coming day
Come
On a horse
Over palms laid
On the threshold
Of the coming day
Coming day
Coming day
Come
Coming day
Coming day
ComeEmbed
