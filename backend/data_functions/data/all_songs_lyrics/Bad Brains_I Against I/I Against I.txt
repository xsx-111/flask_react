I Against I Lyrics
(indecipherable radio noise)
...demonstrates while we wait to conflate the economy. Inflation is high, will it stay under control as the economy revives because of a steep drop in oil prices...

In the quest for the test to fulfill an achievement
Everybody's always going to pursue themselves
When the fact of the matter is they just don't care
To extend a helping hand to anyone else
So tell me uh-why, did you have to lie?
And try to make me all confused about the U.S.A
When the fact of the matter is you just don't hear
To comprehend or understand a single word I say

I don't wanna have I go against I
I don't wanna have I go against I
Well let me tell ya

The same old story, no fact or glory
I against I against I against I against (Ooh)
I say I don't like it, and I know I don't want it
I against I against I against I against I a⁠—(Ooh)
Almighty watching, Almighty watching
I against I against I against I against I a⁠—(Ooh)
You say I don't like it
And I know I don't want it
I against I against I against I against
(Oh-oh, oh-oh ooh, oh-oh, oh ooh)
Yea-yeah, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, ay, ahh
(Oh-oh, oh-oh ooh, oh-oh, oh ooh)
Oh-oh, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yay-ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ahh


I said who's gonna tell the youth about the drugs
About the drugs, mugs, bugs, and the police thugs
About the rotten, stinkin' rackets and the fantasy
Around the nation, around the nation
Oh what you gonna do?
I tell you the truth is lookin' straight at you
Oh baby, baby, baby what you gonna do?
I tell you the truth is lookin' straight at you


Come on
I know I got a brass continental with a 300 Z
I got a color TV with a video too
I got a rest home in Jamaica with my fantasy
For all my family, around the nation
Uh-what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
Uh-what you gonna do? Ah!2Embed
