Hired Gun Lyrics
Hired gun
Hired gun
Hired gun for sale
Hired gun, on the run
He won't fail

Requesting quick, they asked the people
Where's the hired gunman's trail?
He turned into a dark, cold corner
His is the face that is so pale

A hired gun, uh
He's on the run, yeah
He has no fun, no

Please sit down, services rendered
Now we must decide the pay
Bargains to bribes, broken agreement
So much more had but to pray
Next a scam to execute, but a bit too cute
So if you're looking for adventure
Go check the hired gun for sale
A hired gun, uh
He's on the run, yeah
Say he has no fun, no

A hired gun, yeah
And he's on the run
Better watch out boy, 'cause he don't know fun

Hired gun for sale
Hired gun for sale
Yeah (Yeah), No (No)

A hired gun
And he's on the run
Better watch out boy, 'cause he don't know funEmbed
