Secret 77 Lyrics
Secret
Secret 77, another lesson in life
Secret 77

To their surprise with time to thrive
Mr. Rhythm cut the jive, oh
And to their belief under your wheel
Brother vibe dare not steal, oh no

Oh, he that oppress, reproach his maker
He that honor him, have mercy on the poor

Secret 77, another blessing to share
Secret 77

Invisible to you and me
No you just cannot see
For now it's time you've got to nab it
One-hundred in one, like inspector gadget
You will always find at sunrise on the way to meet your boss
He that oppress, reproach his maker
He that honor him, have mercy on the poor

Secret 77, secret 77, secret 77
Secret 77, another blessing to share
Secret 77

Doesn't have but one true friend
To share his life unto the end
And now a big surprise we can thrive
And stay alive, alive

He that oppress, reproach his maker
He that honor him, have mercy on the poor

Secret 77, secret 77, secret 77
Secret 77Embed
