Re-Ignition Lyrics
Re-ignition, translation begin
Cosmopolitan reflection well thin
When our action cause reaction what starts
A transmission of a love in one heart

Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion

I came down to make you overstand
That this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside, who can escape
Our destiny, confirmed in fate

Re-ignition, cancellation can't win
No celesty ever resting begin
When grace melts inside your hand and my heart
Is the glory that much closer or apart

Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion
We hope to make you overstand
That this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside who can escape
Our destiny confirmed in fate

Always and forever, near or far
Safe in your bosom here we are
Pain does not mean feel no joy
Re-ignition for girl and for boy

Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion

We love to make you overstand
That this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside who can escape
Millennium confirmed in fate1Embed
