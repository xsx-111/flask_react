Return To Heaven Lyrics
Return, return unto heaven
Return, return unto heaven

Packed and racked like rats they were down in hell
A detestable smell like a poison well, no heaven
Chose a divine light they laughed that that was a drag
Instead they lived in a bag, just caught a snag
Pure craven

It's the final call great and small
Our time not theirs
We're all aware

Return, return to heaven
Return, return to heaven

Grown up in the shitty with a gift to survive
And yes the time has arrived
To know that love is alive, this season
But still they can't achieve to hope an alternative deny
What faith has to give a place where we want to live
No reason
You all aware, don't you dare
Everyone will be there

Return, return unto heaven
Return, return unto heaven
Return, return unto heaven
Return, return unto heaven
Return, return unto heaven
Return, return unto heavenEmbed
