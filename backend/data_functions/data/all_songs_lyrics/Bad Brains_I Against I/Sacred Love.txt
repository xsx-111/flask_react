Sacred Love Lyrics
Sacred love
Sacred love
Sacred love
Sacred love

Baby, baby, baby
I don't want you come to me as a whore
Don't lust off my body, baby
That's a bore
I see our love as being sacred
Just you and me
We don't need our business in the streets
Reality

I'm in here, you're out there
We know what's right
No crying, no lying
Our hearts declared

Sacred love
Sacred love
Sacred love
Sacred love
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Jah will bless us to be one tomorrow
Visits from you every Tuesday
Right on time
A picture of you came through in the mail
No, you're not far
You've got me hanging on a miracle
Spiritually

I'm in here, you're out there
We know a prayer
No crying, no lying
Our hearts declare

Sacred love
Sacred love
Sacred love
Sacred love

It's not a physical communication
Be brave persevere through it all
I and I get sicked on sacred love
I and I get tickled
Sacred loveEmbed
