Boom Lyrics
Oh my god, she's so hot
She's so flipping hot, she's like a curry
I wanna tell her how hot she is but she'll think I'm being sexist
She's so hot, she's making me sexist...bitch
I need my 1987 DG-20 Casio Electric Guitar, set to...mandolin
Yeah...drop the drums!
Hear me now!

I see you give the sign I wanna Boom like it's never been done
Bust a move it's like the click-Boom of a gun
In the Marquee in the bass is Booming
Someone's smoking Boom at da back of da room
And it's the first day of Boom, and the flowers are blooming
Drum Boom bass and the party is Booming
Boom ba Boom like a rocket taking off to da moon
Boom Boom like a bride and Boom ahh

See ya shaking that Boom Boom ahh
See ya looking at my Boom Boom ahh
See ya want some Boom Boom
It's clear it's Boomtime Boom Boom ahh
Let me buy you a Boom Boom ahh
You order a fancy Boom ahh
You like Boom, and I like Boom
Enough small Boom lets Boom the Boom ahh
(Fast-forward selecta!)
Now we're rollin' in a Boom Boom ahh
Ridin' to my private room
And we know what's happening, we both assume
We gonna Boom Boom Boom â€˜til the break of Boom
Who's the Boom King? (Who?)
I'm the Boom King! (What?)
Who's the Boom King? (Tell me now!)
I'm the Boom King! (He's the Boom King!)

Chaka chaka chaka hahaha
Chaka chaka chaka hahaha
Chaka chaka chaka hahaha
Chaka chaka chaka hahaha

My phone is beepin' it's Big-Booms-Boom
Is back from ten years doom and gloom
And they said he had his Boom chopped off in the Boom
But the crazy Boom still loves the Boom, ahh
Unzip the Boom, and my legs go zoom
My Bee-Boom jumps, ba-roomba-Boom-Boom
We both get freaky then the Boom gets squeaky
And we Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom! aah
Who's the Boom King? (Who?)
I'm the Boom King! (What?)
Who's the Boom King? (Ha!)
I'm the Boom King! (Bret's the Boom King!)Embed
