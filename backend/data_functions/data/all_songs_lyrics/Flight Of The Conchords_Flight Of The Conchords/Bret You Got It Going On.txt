Bret You Got It Going On LyricsHey there Bret I see you lookin' down, don't wanna see my little buddy down with a frown
Just because I get more women than you, well that's only because they don't know you like I do
Sure you're weedy, and kinda shy but some girly out there must be needy for a weedy shy guy
They want you as their needle when they're rolling in the hay
Just hear me out when I say
Bret you got it going ohh-n, the ladies'll get to know your sexuality
When they get to know your personality
I said Bret you got it going ohh-n
Not in a gay way, just in a 'hey man I wanted to say that you're looking okay man'
Why can't a heterosexual guy tell a heterosexual guy that he thinks his booty is fly
Not all the time obviously just when hes got a problem with his self-esteem
Don't let anybody tell you you're not humpable, because you're bumpable
Well I hope this doesnt make you feel uncomfortable
If I say 'you got a boom, ow-ow come on Bret' help me out now
Bret you got it going ohh-n (i got it going ohh-n)
That's the conclusion that I've come to, but that doesn't mean that I want to bum you
Bret you got it going ohh-n (i got it going on)
No doubt about it we'd be getting crazy if one of us was lucky enough to be born a lady
OH if one of us was a lady, and I was your man, if I was your man
Well sometimes it gets lonely
And I nee-eed a woman
And then I imagine you with some bosoms
In fact, one time when we were touring and I was really lonely
And we were sharing that twin room in the hotel, I put a wig on you while you were sleeping
I put a wig on you, oooh ooh ooh and I just lay there and spooned you
Oh Bret you got it going onEmbed
