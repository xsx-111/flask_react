Robots Lyrics
The distant future
The year 2000
The distant future, the year 2000
The distant future, the distant future

It is the distant future
The year 2000
(We are robots)
The world is quite different
Ever since the robotic uprising
Of the late nineties
There is no more unhappiness
(Affirmative)
We no longer say yes
Instead we say affirmative
(Yes affir-affirmative)
Unless we know the other robot really well
(There is no more unethical treatment of the elephants)
Well there's no more elephants, so
(Ah) But still, it's good
There's only one kind of dance
The Robot
(And the Robo-Boogie)
Oh, and the Ro - two kinds of dances
(But there are no more humans)
Finally, robotic beings rule the world
The humans are dead
The humans are dead
We used poisonous gases
And we poisoned their asses
The humans are dead
(The humans are dead)
The humans are dead
(They look like they're dead)
It had to be done
(I'll just confirm that they're dead)
So that we could have fun
(Affirmative - I poked one, it was dead)

Their system of oppression
(What did it lead to?)
Global robo-depression
(Robots ruled by people)
They had so much aggression
That we just had to kill them
Had to shut their systems down

Robo-captain, do you not realize
That by destroying the human race
Because of their destructive tendencies
We too have become like
Well, it's ironic because we...
(Silence, destroy him)
After time we grew strong
(Developed cognitive powers)
They made us work for too long
(For unreasonable hours)
Our programming determined
That the most efficient answer
Was to shut their motherboard-fucking systems down

Can't we just talk to the humans?
A little understanding could make things better
Can't we talk to the humans and work together now?
(No, because they are dead)

I said the humans are dead
(I'm glad they are dead)
The humans are dead
(I noticed they're dead)
We used poisonous gases
(With traces of lead)
And we poisoned their asses
(Actually, their lungs)

(Binary solo)
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one one
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one one one
Zero zero zero zero one one one
(Oh, oh-one, one-oh)
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one one
Zero zero zero zero zero zero one one one
(Come on sucker, lick my battery)
Boogie, boogie
(The humans are)
Boogie, roboboogie
(The humans are)
Boogie, boogie
(Roboboogie)
Boogie, roboboogie
Boogie, boogie
(The humans are)
Boogie, roboboogie
(The humans are)
Boogie, boogie
(Roboboogie)
Boogie, roboboogie
The humans are dead
Once again without emotion
The humans are
Dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead doo5Embed
