The Prince of Parties Lyrics
I'm the pretty prince of parties
You're a tasty piece of pastry
You're so lighty flighty flakey
I go where the party takes me

I'm the funky monkey junky
You're a flunky bunky donkey
You're a picture of the devil's daughter
I'm a pitcher of holy water

Oh pretty prince of parties, where's the party now? (I don't know)
Oh pretty prince of parties, where does water go? (I let it flow)
Oh pretty prince of parties, can I come to your party? (No)
Oh pretty prince of parties, where do you get your clothes? (They're made of snow - pretty party clothes crocheted of snow)

I'm the mickey MƒÅori minstrel
You're the high priestess of tinsel
I'm the guru god of ganja
Ramashalanka lanka Ravi Shankar
