Hiphopopotamus vs. Rhymenoceros Lyrics
I'm the motherflippin' Rhymenoceros
My beats are phat
And the birds are on my back
And I'm horny, I'm horny
If you choose to proceed
You will indeed concede
Cause I hit you with my flow
The wild rhino stampede
I'm not just wild
I'm trained, domesticated
I was raised by a rapper and rhino that dated
And subsequently procreated
That's how it goes
Here's the Hiphopopotamus
The hip-hop hippo

They call me the Hiphopopotamus
My lyrics are bottomless...

Sometimes our rhymes are polite
Like thank you for the dinner Ms. Wright
That was very delicious, goodnight
Sometimes they are obscene
Like a pornographic dream
NC-17
With ladies in a stream of margarine
Haha yeah
Some margarine
They call me the Hiphopopotamus
Flows that glow like phosphorous
Popping off the top of this esophagus
Rocking this metropolis
I'm not a large water-dwelling mammal
Where did you get that preposterous hypothesis
Did Steve tell you that perchance?
Steve

My rhymes and records they don't get played
Because my records and rhymes they don't get made
And if you rap like me you don't get paid
And if you roll like me you don't get laid

My rhymes are so potent
That in this small segment
I made all of the ladies in the area pregnant
Yes, sometimes my lyrics are sexist
But you lovely bitches and hoes
Should know I'm trying to correct this

Other rappers diss me
Say my rhymes are sissy
Why, why, why?
What
Why exactly
What, why
Be more constructive with your feedback, please
Why, why
Why, because I rap about reality
Like me and my grandma drinking a cup of tea
There ain't no party like my nana's tea party
Hey, ho

I'm the motherflippin'
I'm the motherflippin'
I'm the motherflippin'
Who's the motherflippin'
I'm the motherflippin'
I'm the motherflippin'
I'm the motherflippin'
