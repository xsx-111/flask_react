When will the governments realize it's got to be funky sexy ladies?

Is all of you with ‘a all of me
In a world of peace and harmony
Where every lady gets a little piece of Bret-y
J: I've been to Paris, Wellington and Amsterdam
And a wham-bam, Merci, Danke, thank ‘a you ma'm
I don't care if you're ugly or you're skanky or you're small
Just wanna do a little something special for you all

J: Ahh...all the old ladies...all the cleaning ladies
B: Just wanna do something special for all the ladies in the world
J: All the crazy ladies

B: And don't forget them girls
