Think About It Lyrics
There's children on the street using guns and knives
They're taking drugs and each other's lives
Killing each other with knives and forks
And calling each other names like 'dork'

There's people on the street getting diseases from monkeys
Yeah, that's what I said - they're getting diseases from monkeys
Now there's junkies with monkey disease
Who's touching these monkeys, please
Leave these poor sick monkeys alone
They've got problems enough as it is

Man's lying on the street
Some punk's chopped off his head
I'm the only one who stops
To see if he's dead
Mmm, turns out he's dead

And that's why I'm singing
What…what is wrong with the world today?
What is wrong with the world today?
(Jemaine mumbles)
What…what is wrong with the world today?
You gotta think about it
Think think about it
Good cops been framed and put into a can
All the money that we're making is going to the man
(What man?
Which man?
Who's the man?
When's a man a man?
What makes a man a man?
Am I a man?
Yes, technically I am)

They're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers
But what's the real cost?
Cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper
Why are we still paying so much for sneakers
When you got them made by little slave kids
What are your overheads?

Well, at the end of your life, you're lucky if you die
Sometimes I wonder why we even try
I saw a man lying on the street half dead
With knives and forks sticking out of his leg
And he said
"Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Can somebody get that knife and fork out of my leg, please?
(Can somebody please remove these cutleries from my knees?)"
And then we break it down
Yeah...ooh-ohh...This is the acapella jams
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah-yeah-yaah-aah-ahh-ahh-ahh
Whoah-whoah-oooooooo...
Breakin' it down
Break it down
(Lots of whoahs and weird mouth sounds...)Embed
