Bowie Lyrics
Bowie's in space, Bowie's in space
Whatcha doin' out there, man?
That's pretty freaky Bowie
Is it cold out in space, Bowie?
Do you want to borrow my jumper, Bowie?
Does the space cold
Make your nipples go pointy, Bowie?
Do you use your pointy nipples as telescopic antennae
To transmit data back to Earth?
I betcha do, you freaky old bastard you
Hey Bowie, do you have one really funky sequined space suit
Or do you have several ch-changes?
Do they smoke grass out in space, Bowie
Or do they smoke Astroturf, ooh?
Receiving transmission
From David Bowie's nipple antennae
Do you read me, Lieutenant Bowie?
I said do you read me, Lieutenant Bowie?
This is Bowie to Bowie
Do you hear me out there, man?
This is Bowie back to Bowie
I read you loud and clear, man, ooh yeah man
Your signal's weak on my radar screen
How far out are you, man?
I'm pretty far out
That's pretty far out, man
Ooh ah ooh, I'm orbiting Pluto, ooh ah ooh
Drawn in by its groovitational
(Groovitational pull)
I'm jamming out with the Mick Jaggernauts
And they think it's pretty cool, man

Are you okay Bowie?
What was that sound?
I don't know man
I'll have to turn my ship around
Ooh, it's the craziest thing
Yeah, I'm picking it up on my LSD screen
But can you see the stratosphere, ringing?
To the choir of Afronauts singing
Bowie's in space

Bowie's in space
Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie
Bowie's in space
Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie
Eeniee ma ma meenie miny moey
Phasers on funky
Eenie, ma ma meenie miny Bowie
B-B-Bowie's in spaceEmbed
