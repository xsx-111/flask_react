Leggy Blonde Lyrics
Goodbye
Goodbye-ee-eye
Leggy Blonde

Everyday I look across the office floor, there you were
Your hair down to your legs and your legs down to the floor
Leggy Blonde, goodbye
Goodbye
Now that you are gone, I'll never see here for tech repair
Wish you knew how much I loved your legs and your hair
Leggy Blonde, goodbye
Goodbye

Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie
Leggy Blonde, goodbye, goodbye
I had a budgie but it died
Whoa-oh whoa
I like pie

Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy
Leggy, Leggy, Leggy, Leggy (Whoa-oh whoa)
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie, Blondie, Blondie
Blondie, Blondie
Leggy Blonde


I'll never get, I'll never get to be with you
I'll never get to share another cup of tea with you
Never get to let you know how much I think of you
I'll never get to tear your clothes off on the photo copier
He'll never get
He'll never get
He'll never get
He'll never get to say
Hoop, Leggy Blonde, you got it goin' on
Wanna see you wearin' that thong, thong, thong
See you gettin' down till the break of dawn
Doesn't really count with your panties on

GoodbyeEmbed
