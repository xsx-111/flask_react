A Kiss is Not a Contract Lyrics
A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
Mmm, it's very nice

Just because you've been
Exploring my mouth
Doesn't mean you get to take
An expedition further south, no

A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
(It's very, very nice)

Just because we've been
Playing tonsil hockey
Doesn't mean you get to score the goal
That's in my jockeys

Just because I'm in a two-man novelty band
Doesn't mean it's all about poontang
I can't go around loving everyone
I just wouldn't get anything done
You can take me out to dinner
That might be quite nice
You could buy me a burrito
And some beans and rice
But that won't get you into pant's paradise
They call it a fly because it takes you up to heaven
Oh-whoa

A kiss is not a contract
But it's very nice
It's very, very nice

I'm only one man, baby, pretty baby
We're only two men, ladies
Oh babies, oh, pretty babiesEmbed
