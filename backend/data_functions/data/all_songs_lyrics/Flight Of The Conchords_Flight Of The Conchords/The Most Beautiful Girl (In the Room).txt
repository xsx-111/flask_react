The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room) Lyrics
Looking 'round the room
I can tell that you
Are the most beautiful girl in the... room
(In the whole wide room)
And when you're on the street
Depending on the street
I bet you are definitely in the top three
Good looking girls on the street
Depending on the street
And when I saw you at my mate's place
I thought, "What. is. she. doin'
At my mate's place?"
How did Dave get a hottie like that to a party like this?
Good one Dave
(You're a legend Dave)
I ask Dave if he's gonna make a move on you
He's not sure
I said "Dave do you mind if I do?"
He says he doesn't mind
But I can tell he kinda minds
But I'm gonna do it anyway
I see you standing by the stereo
I dim the lights down to very low here we go

You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be a waitress
You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be an air hostess in the 60s
You're so beautiful
You could be a part time model
And then I seal the deal
I do my moves
I do my dance moves
Both of my dance moves

It's twelve-oh-two
Just me and you
And seven other dudes
Around you on the dance-floor
I draw you near
Let's get out of here
Let's get in a cab
I'll buy you a kebab

And I can't believe
That I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen... with a kebab
Why don't we leave?
Let's go to my house and we can feel each other up on the couch
Oh no, I don't mind taking it slow

Because you're so beautiful
Like a, tree
Or a high class prostitute
You're so beautiful
You could be a part time model
But you'd probably still have to keep your normal job
A part time model
Spending part of your time modelling
And part of your time next to me
And the rest of your time doing your normal job
My place is usually tidier than this2Embed
