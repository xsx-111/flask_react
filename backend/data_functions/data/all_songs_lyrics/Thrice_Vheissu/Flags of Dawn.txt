Flags of Dawn Lyrics
This darkness would eclipse our will
A cold wind blows across these hills
A swinging gaze from a hangman's tree
A crow's-nest view of what's left to see

The lifeless forms of saints
Return the silence to the snow
And still beneath the grain is waiting
For its time to grow

So hold on, hold tight
Hope in daylight
We will overcome

So put away your fear
The morning star will soon appear
And bring an end to this dark night
But we must run forward to meet the light

Watered by the blood of martyrs
Blessed and blind our sons and daughters
Sleep with one eye open
And live with both eyes shut
So lets find the place where sight begins
And see the things that we saw when our
Eyes were bright and wet against the light
And hold on, hold tight
Hope in daylight
We will overcome
Open your eyes
O'er the hillside
Fly the flags of dawnEmbed
