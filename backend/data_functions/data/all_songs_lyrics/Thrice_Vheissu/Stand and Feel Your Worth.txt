Stand and Feel Your Worth LyricsWake, stand and feel your worth, O my soul
Kneel and know the Word that can save us all
We are fuel and fire both, we are water
Wed with wine and ghost
We are wrought with breath and dirt, washed in second sight
Woven through the earth, wreathed in rings of light
Stand and feel your worth, O my soul
Kneel and know the Word come to die
We will wield a second birth, whet our wits and knives
Wrap our knees in earth, wrap ourselves in light
Wake, we will weigh and drink this cup, we will burn
But we will not burn up
Wake, feel your worth, O my soul
Speak the word, the word that can save us all
Awed by grace, I fall on my face
And scream the word that can save us allEmbed
