Atlantic Lyrics
It's been so long
And tin cans and string for years
Is all that we've known
Could it be you're really here?

'Cause my eyes are open
And everything still moves in slow motion
Breathless and blue, and behind your eyes, the sea
Oceans of light envelop me

But things can't be as they seem
I'm so far from home
This must be another dream

But my eyes are open
And everything still moves in slow motion
Breathless and blue and behind your eyes, the sea
Oceans of light envelop me
My eyes are open
And everything still moves in slow motion
Breathless and blue and behind your eyes, the sea
Oceans of light envelop me2Embed
