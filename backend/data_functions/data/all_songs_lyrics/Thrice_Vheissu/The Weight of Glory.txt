The Weight of Glory Lyrics
A ring of Pharisees and one of them was me
We loved the letter but not the spirit
An infidelity, a woman on her knees
She begged for mercy, we couldn’t hear it
The teacher looked from us, his finger in the dust
We felt the chill and it shook us to our bones
Then he raised his head and this is what he said:
“The one who has not sin should throw a stone”

I walked away in silence
And threw myself upon the ground
These words they burned inside me:
"Take up your cross before your crown"
Go and judge not, lest ye be judged when the curtain comes down

I walked away in silence
And threw myself upon the ground
These words they burned inside me:
"Take up your cross before your crown"
Take up your cross before your crown
Judge not, lest ye be judged when the curtain comes down
Take up your cross before your crown
Your cross before your crownEmbed
