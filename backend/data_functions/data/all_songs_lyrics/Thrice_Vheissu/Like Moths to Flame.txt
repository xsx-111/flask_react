Like Moths to Flame Lyrics
Once again these bitter herbs
The perfect compliment to all your cryptic words
I nod but don't know what to say
But I know you and I believe you're who you say you are, so

I, I will follow you, lay down my life
I would die for you, this very night

Once again the bread and wine
But it seems the meanings may be deeper still this time
And you surprised me when you said I'd fall away
Don't you know me?  I could never be ashamed of you, no

I, I will follow you, lay down my life
I would die for you, this very night

I've never been this cold, the fire's gravity compels!
Like planets cling to sol, I feel my orbit start to fail!
Like moths to flame I come, too close and all my oaths are burned!
As stars begin to run, all my accusers take their turn!
And calling curses down, from my lips lies like poison spill!
And then that awful sound, the sound of prophesy fulfilled!
And then I met your eyes, and I remember everything!
And something in me dies, the night that I betrayed my king!2Embed
