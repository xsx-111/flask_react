Hold Fast Hope LyricsHow can you be sleeping? Waves like weapons crash
O'er us, cry for mercy and hold fast hope
Who of us is cursed, or do we have to ask
Search your souls and hold fast
If no one speaks a word, then let the lots be cast
Truth be told and hold fast
White death wakes in black skies, mark your maker's wrath
Fear and flames of azure climb the crooked mast
You will yet be baptized, steeped in shattered glass
Sink and sing your answer and hold fast
As strong arms grip your shoulders
Like dead hands of the past
Pray as you're tossed over
This breath could be your last
Quiet and cold
Silent and slow
Night black as coal
Miles here below
Find your faith and dive deep, through living gateways pass
Lined with death and ivory, and hold fast, hold fast
Deep beneath the black dawn, leagues from lightning's flash
(Ribs will raise cathedrals)
Ribs will raise cathedrals for the morning mass
(For the morning mass)
Steel yourself in sackcloth, roll your heart in ash
(Scrape your skin with steel wool)
Scrape your skin with steel wool and hold fast hope
(Roll your heart in ash)

Ribs will raise cathedrals for the morning mass
Scrape your skin with steel wool
Cross your heart and hold fast hope
Hold fast hope, hold fast hope1Embed
