Between the End and Where We Lie Lyrics
Is this everything, I've dreamed of so much more, between the end and where we lie
Here all our hopes and dreams are scavenged from the floor and fed into machines that feed on vacant eyes
All of my dreams, always find me far beyond these fake fluorescent skies
I know there must be something more, if I could only find the door, then I could free myself and see the world outside

Where Daylight breaks on you and shines into the grey that sleeps beneath your skull
Daylight breaks on you and burns away the grey that suffocates your soul

For now I hold a key, and though I may be lost, I know that I will find my way
I search endlessly but every time I've thought that I was near, the smoke and mirrors lead me astray
See the pit boss, steal each tick tock, time it seems will suffer at our hands
I look for exits in the haze, the dense electric twilit maze, I've heard that there is one that leads to sunlit lands where

Where Daylight breaks on you and shines into the grey that sleeps beneath your skull
Daylight breaks on you and burns away the grey that suffocates your soul
Daylight
Daylight
Daylight
Daylight
Daylight, they tell me that it's just a myth
They try to betray me with a kiss
Daylight, they tell me that it can't exist
They might never know just what they've missed as
Daylight pours fire into my gray eyes
Pour grace into my gray life
Breaks in and lights the way
I can't live without the dayEmbed
