Bed of Lies Lyrics
No, I would not sleep in this bed of lies
So toss me out, and turn in
And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
I'm marking it down to learnin', I am

I don't think that I could take another empty moment
I don't think that I could fake another hollow smile
Well, it's not enough just to be lonely
I don't think that I could take another talk about it

And just like me, you've got needs
And they're only a whisper away
And we've softly surrendered
To these lives that we have tendered away

But I would not sleep in this bed of lies
So toss me out, and turn in
And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
I'm marking it down to learnin'
I'm marking it down to learnin', 'cause I can

I don't want to be the one who turns the whole thing over
I don't want to be somewhere where I just don't belong
Where it's not enough just to be sorry
Don't you know I feel the darkness closing in?
I tried to be more than me
And I gave until it all went away
And we've only surrendered
To the worst part left of these winters that we've made

But I would not sleep in this bed of lies
So toss me out, and turn in
And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
I'm marking it down to learnin'
I'm marking it down to learnin'

I am all that I'll ever be
When you lay your hands over me
And don't go weak on me, please...
I know that it's weak
But God, help me, I need this

I would not sleep in this bed of lies
So toss me out, and turn in
And there'll be no rest for these tired eyes
I'm marking it down to learnin'
I'm marking it down to learnin', 'cause I can1Embed
