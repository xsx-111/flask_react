Never Going Back Again Lyrics
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been

Been down one time
Been down two times
Never going back again

You don't know what it means to win
Come down and see me again

I been down one time
Been down two times
Oh, I'm never going back again
Mm, never going back again
Never going back again
Never going back again
Never going back
I'm never going back
Again

Been down, been down
Been down two timesEmbed
