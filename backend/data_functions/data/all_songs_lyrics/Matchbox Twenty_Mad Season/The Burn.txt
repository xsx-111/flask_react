The Burn Lyrics
I thought about
Leaving - but I couldn't even get outta bed
I'm hanging 'cause I couldn't get a ride outta town
Now anyone who really wanted me to be down
Come 'round

I thought about
Singin' but I couldn't remember all of the words
Breakin' but I couldn't get the pieces apart
Laughin' never knowing what the joke was about
Now I'm down

And I wonder how I never got the burn
And if I'm ever gonna learn
How lonely people make a life
One strain at a time

Forgot about
Everything and everyone I needed before
Tryin' to get a handle on a reason to shine
Pickin' up the pieces that are falling behind
Takes time
So I wonder how I never got the Burn
And if I'm ever gonna learn
How lonely people make a life
One strain at a time
And still shine

And I wonder how I never got the Burn
And if I'm ever gonna learn
How lonely people make a life
All this time I wonder how I never got the Burn
And if I'm ever gonna learn
How lonely people make their life
One strain at a time and still shine2Embed
