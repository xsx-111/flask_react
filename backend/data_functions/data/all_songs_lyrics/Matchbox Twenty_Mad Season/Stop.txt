Stop Lyrics
Yes it's true that I believe
I'm weaker than I used to be
I wear my heart out on my sleeve
And I forget the rest of me

Yes there's times I've been afraid
And there's no harm in that I pray
Cuz I'm more frightened everyday
Someone will take the hope I have away

But you gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get get off sometimes I know
But you gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get get off sometimes I know
All the times I've given in
(One by one by)
You fit me like a second skin
(One by one by)
And one by one I will begin
To wear you on the days I'm feeling thin

But you gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get get off sometimes I know
But you gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get off sometimes
You gotta give up
To get get off sometimes I know

You'd better stop, stop, stop
Using me up
You'd better stop
Cuz I've had enough
And I'm ready to forget the reasons
That keep me here
Oooooo walk
In the rain
You will even if you're never gonna change
Good God, need a little love while
You find what you think you're gonna be, child

Yeah you'd better stop, stop, stop
Using me up
You'd better stop
Cuz I've had enough
And I'm ready to forget the reasons
(Oh the reasons)
That keep me hereEmbed
