Last Beautiful Girl Lyrics
This will all fall down
Like everything else that was
This too shall pass
And all of the words we said
We can't take back

Now every fool in town
Would've left by now
I can't replace
All of the wasted days
The memory of your face
I can't help thinkin'

Maybe if we ever coulda kept it all together
Where would we be?
A thousand lost forevers
And the promises you never were givin' me
Here's what I'm thinkin':

It won't be the first heart that you break
It won't be the last, beautiful girl
The one that you wrecked won't take you back
If you were the last beautiful girl in the world
(Last beautiful girl)
So, tell me one more time
How you're sorry about
The way this all went down
You needed to find your space
You needed to still be friends
You needed me to-

Call you if I ever couldn't keep it all together
You'd comfort me
You'd tell me 'bout forever
And the promises I never should have believed
Here's what I'm thinkin':

It won't be the first heart that you break
It won't be the last, beautiful girl
The one that you wrecked won't take you back
If you were the last beautiful girl in the world
(Last beautiful girl)
Last beautiful girl in the world
(Last beautiful girl)

It's over now and I've gone without
'Cause you're everyone else's girl
It seems to me you'll always be
Everyone else's girl
Everyone else's girl
This will all fall down
Like everything in the world
This too must end
And all of the words we said
We can't take back

It won't be the first heart that you break
It won't be the last, beautiful girl
The one that you wrecked, won't take you back
If you were the last beautiful girl
It won't be the first heart that you break
It won't be the last, beautiful girl
The one that you wrecked, won't take you back
If you were the last beautiful girl in the world
(Last beautiful girl)
The last beautiful girl in the world
(Last beautiful girl)

You are the last beautiful girl
(Last beautiful girl)
