Black & White People Lyrics
One more day down
Everybody has those days
Where one soft sweet song's
Just enough to clear my head

Fall on real life
Is anybody left there sane?
And we slide on over and accept fate
Then it's bound to be a powerful thing

And if it's just that you're weak, can we talk about it?
It's gettin' so damn creepy just nursin' this
Ghost of a chance, the fiction, the romance
And the technicolor dreams of black and white people

One boy, headstrong
He thinks that livin' here's just plain
He's pushed down so hard
You can hear him start to sink

And it's one last round of petty conversation
You hold on boy, 'cause you won't go down like this
You just roll on over and lay down
'Til it's more than you can take
And if it's just that you're weak, can we talk about it
It's gettin' so damn creepy just nursin' this
Ghost of a chance, the fiction, the romance
And the technicolor dreams of black and white people


So one more day down
And everybody's changin'
One soft sweet song's
Just enough to clear my, my head

And if it's just that you're weak, can we talk about it
It's gettin' so damn creepy just nursin' this
Ghost of a chance, the fiction, the romance
And the technicolor dreams of black and white people

Yeah, if you're weak, can we talk about it
It's gettin' so damn creepy just nursin' this
Ghost of a chance, the fiction, the romance
And the technicolor dreams of black and white people
We are black and white people
Yeah, we are black and white people
Yeah, we are black and white peopleEmbed
