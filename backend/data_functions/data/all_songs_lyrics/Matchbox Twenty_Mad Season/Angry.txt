Angry Lyrics
So scream you
Out from behind the bitter ache
You're hangin' on the memory
You need most

You still want love
Love's ugly, smooth and delicate
But not without affection
No, not alone

And instead of wishin' that it would get better
Man, you're seein' that you just get angrier

And it's good that I'm not angry
Well, I need to get over, well, I
I'm not angry
Anymore

Cry when you cry
Run when you run
Love when you love
Well, now, represent the ashes
That you leave behind
So instead of wishin' that the road had shoulder
Man, you're seein' that you're sinkin' over time
And you're blind

And it's good that I'm not angry
Well, I need to get over, well, I
I'm not angry
Oh, well, it's draggin' me under
Well, I, I'm not angry
Angry, yeah

I'm not angry and it's never been enough
It gets inside and it tears you up
Yeah, I'm not angry and I've never been above it
You see through me, don't you?


And it's good that I'm not angry
Well, I need to get over and I
I'm not angry
Oh, well, it's draggin' me under, well, I
I'm not angry
Well, it's good I'm not angry
Oh, anymoreEmbed
