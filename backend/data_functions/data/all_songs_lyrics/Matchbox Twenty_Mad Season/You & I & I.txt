You & I & I LyricsWell it's for sure
Well things came down hard
But you couldn't wait here
All I ever think about is myself
And anyone else
Well they get strung out
But I get high, high, high
But it's something you better get straight
I don't got no room in my life
Pick up the anchor set it straight
Well stop, well I, I don't wanna thank you
Honey I don't think so
You'd better well stop and try
Cause if there's a distance here between us
Well it's you and I & I, I, I, I
Yeah well it's a shame you pander to me
Come on and stroke on my ego
Like it's never been broke before
Hell by anyone else
And what doesn't kill you
It makes you linger and it makes you wonder
Hell, for goodness sake
Do you ever get sleep?
If there's one thing I believe
If it doesn't kill you, doesn't stay here
Well stop well I don't wanna thank you
Honey I don't think so
You'd better stop and try
Cause if there's a distance here between us
Well it's you & I & I, I, I, I
But it's something you better get straight
I don't got no room in my life
Pick up the anchor and set it straight
Well stop, well I, I don't wanna thank you
Honey I don't think so
You'd better well stop and try
Cause if there's a distance here between us
Well it's you and I & I, I, I, I
I will stop
Well I, I don't wanna thank you
Honey I don't think so
You'd better stop and yeah well try
And if there's a distance here between us
Then it's you and I & I, I, I, IEmbed
