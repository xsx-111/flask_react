Little Hitler LyricsLittle Hitler, don't come 'round here again
With your renegade politics, redder-than-thou-disdain
Thought we were on the same side
But with a fistful of nails and your knives from the Clyde
You're a little Hitler now
And you'll grow up heaven knows how
Little Hitlers, little Hitlers
Grow up into big Hitlers
Look what they do
Behind ever big man there's a small boy
Drink to Stalin and Hitler and Jimmy Boyle
Hard men get all the catches
Every woman loves a fascist
Come the big day, you'll be OK
You're a little Hitler now
And you'll grow up heaven knows how
Little Hitlers, little Hitlers
Grow up into big Hitlers
And look what they do
You try to scare me with stories of knives
Backstreets and razors and alley-cat's cries
And if you're heartless and hard
Well this made you what you areEmbed
