Come Hell or High Water Lyrics
Come hell or high water
You just do as you please
Waste your time when you oughta
Be charming the birds from the trees
A voice straight from heaven
So you like to believe
Who cares if it's only
Your poor self you deceive?

You look in the mirror
And what do you see?
Too much care and scheming
Too little beauty

Come hell or high water
You never will be
Goddess or a genius
A drunkard at twenty-three
And all that you yearn for
Is attention I guess
Come hell or high water
You deserve nothing less
Come hell or high water
You will stay off the rails
I won't try to change you
For God knows I would fail (I would fail)
And it's to the angels
That each day you pray
Come hell or high water
I know you will meet them somedayEmbed
