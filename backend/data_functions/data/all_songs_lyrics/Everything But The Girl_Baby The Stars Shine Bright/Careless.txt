Careless Lyrics
It takes two to make a home
But only one to break it down
Restless as the ocean roar
You've finally left town
Open up the bedroom door
There's a prince without a crown

You could not care less
And that was the first sign
But now you guess
That you've been too careless this time

You left him sleeping like a child
In the arms of someone else
Found it hard to criticise
Because you've done the same yourself
Pleasure is a pretty thing
Oh but love they say is wealth

You could not care less
And that was the first sign
But now you guess
That you've been too careless this time

You could not care less
And that was the first sign
But now you guess
That you've been too careless this time
You could not care less
And that was the first sign
But now you guess
That you've been too careless this time
This time
That you've been too careless this time
Too careless this time
Too careless this timeEmbed
