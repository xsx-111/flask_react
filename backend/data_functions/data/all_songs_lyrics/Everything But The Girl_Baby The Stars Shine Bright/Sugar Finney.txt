Sugar Finney Lyrics
Married in black, divorced in white
Though daddy tried to teach her wrong from right
It's hard to resist on a wintry night
When you're out of mind, when you're out of sight
This you shouldn't
And this you should
Oh, but Sugar Finney never could be good
Never could be good

I've grown a little weary of this old town
A conscience sure can bring you down
I'd like to hang around Chicago bars
With murderers and movie stars
And presidents who'd rather be
Alone with would-be sinners like me

America is free
Cheap and easy
America is free
Cheap and easy

They say Sugar Finney went off her head
Lay once a month in a blood stained bed
But me, I'm careful where I tread
No handsome boy will ever leave me dead
For beauty is no guarantee
I'll take the looks and the rest you can keep
America is free
Cheap and easy
America is free
Cheap and easy, yeah

For beauty is no guarantee
I'll take the looks and the rest you can keep
The rest you can keep
I hope it makes you happy
Sugar Finney

America is free
Cheap and easy
America is free
Cheap and easy

Children pray for me
Such is the price of infamy
Tell them I was never happy
Goodbye Bobby Kennedy
In the White House still asleep
Goodnight Jackie Kennedy
America is free
Cheap and easy
America is free
Cheap and easy
America is free
Cheap and easy
America is free
Cheap and easy
America is free
Cheap and easyEmbed
