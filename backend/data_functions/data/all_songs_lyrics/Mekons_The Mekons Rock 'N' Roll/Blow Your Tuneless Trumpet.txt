Blow Your Tuneless Trumpet LyricsBlow
Blow your tuneless trumpet the choice is yours
I'm going to see the horse doctor
He's waiting where the rain comes in
The fancy shirt I wore is just lying in the drawer
The girl I used to sleep with I don't see her anymore
Blow
Blow your tuneless trumpet the choice is yours
Death belongs to everyone it's the only thing we have
Yeah, death belongs to everyone it's the only thing we have
I don't owe nobody I don't even owe the rent
I've even got some money left I still haven't spent
So blow
Blow your tuneless trumpet the choice is yours
We don't want the glamour the pomp and the drums
The dublin messiah scattering crumbs
Just blowEmbed
