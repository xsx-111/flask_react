Learning To Live On Your Own LyricsThe night's drawing in on the city
The manager picks up his phone
Everything seems such a pity
Learning to live on your own
News travels fast down the wire
Breaks up before it hits home
Throw a rock n' roll song on the fire
Learning to live on your own
In the half light of dawn
You'll wave (leave) this world of ours goodbye (behind)
Please accept this message of my tears
Things that take minutes last for hours
A plane crashes on its way home
The company still feeds on our (your) power
Learning to live on your own
In the half light of dawn
You'll wave (leave) this world of ours goodbye (behind)
I can't see a new star in the heavens
I won't (don't) hear the tributes that they own
Throw a rock n' roll song on the fire
Learning to live on your ownEmbed
