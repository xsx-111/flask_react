Heaven And Back LyricsShe had been misplaced by the government
Our old friends are under attack
They crossed over the border
(But) I have been to heaven and back
I've been to heaven and back
Right in front of my eyes
Things have a habit of happening to me
It's no suprise
Some of the people they stayed behind
Now they're all in prison or dead
I'm looking up at the mountain
I have been to heaven and back
Ooo animal radar
Like a thread around the world
Loving and laughing my head's going 'round
I am a curious boy...
Some people write little verses
Others go on looking for cracks
Uh handcuffed to history
I have been to heaven and backEmbed
