Someone LyricsWe never have to stretch our imagination
It is our own lives we can't believe
Years of waiting for the rendezvous
Between the law and reality
Someone talks to themselves by the t.v
Someone is selling flags and gum
Someone is buying a horoscope
Because the stars are concerned about them
You mustn't do what we did to you
Says the big blonde teacher from oversea
But all his good works and philanthropy
Still can't make the stupid sound clever
Someone is at the top of the building
Someone is having a vision
Someone is biting the hand of the people he chooses to deliver
The studio's empty beat goes on (tape rolls on)
C major chord hanging in (floating through) the air
Half finished vocals that no one will hear
It's in there somewhere between bleepy weang...(death and slavery)Embed
