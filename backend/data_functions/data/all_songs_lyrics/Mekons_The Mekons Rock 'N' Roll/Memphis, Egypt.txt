Memphis, Egypt Lyrics(Rock 'n Roll!)
Destroy your safe and happy lives before it is too late
The battles we fought were long and hard
Just not to be consumed by rock n' roll
Rock n' roll
Capitalismos, favorite boy child, we must apologize
Up in the rafters a rope is danglin'
Spots before the eyes of rock n' roll
Rock n' roll
We know the devil and we have shaken him by the hand
Embraced him and thought his stinking breath was fine perfume
Just like rock n' roll
Rock n' roll
East berlin can't buy a thing, there's nothing they can sell me
Walk through the wall no pain at all
I'm born inside the belly of rock n' roll
Rock 'n' roll
It's something to sell your labor for when hair sprouts out below
I'm a microscope on that secret place where
We all want to go, it's rock n' roll
Rock 'n' rollEmbed
