Only Darkness Has the Power LyricsSpent the night in Sophie's bed it was (became) impossible for me to leave
I had been born to be with her she made me better than I was before
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the power
"And darkness is what surrounds me as (so) I can open my heart to the world
"The young genius is dead but his work will live on and on, "His childhood friend rescued the beautiful young widow,"
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the power
"I was so nervous I shook my head, "It was a struggle but there was pleasure at the end, "I'm not going to explain myself it's not that important to me, "Do you trust me to tell the truth, do you trust me?
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the power
And darkness is what surrounds me as (so) I can open my heart to the world
"Nothing left but a final curtain call, "This is how the story must (should) end, "The two of us living happily but I doubt that this will happen
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the power
Only darkness has the powerEmbed
