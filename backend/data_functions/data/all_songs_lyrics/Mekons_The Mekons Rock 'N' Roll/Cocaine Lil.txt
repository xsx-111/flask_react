Cocaine Lil LyricsDid you ever hear about cocaine lil
She lived in cocainetown on a cocaine hill
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat
And they fought all night with a cocaine rat
She had cocaine hair on her cocaine head
A cocaine dress that was poppy red
She wore a snowbird hat and sleighride clothes
On her coat sh wore crimson cocaine rose
Big red chariots on the milky way
Snakes and elephants, silver and grey
Oh the cocaine blues they make me sad
Oh the cocaine blues make me feel so bad
She went to a party one cold night
The way she sniffed was sure a fright
There was morphine sue and the poppyfaced kid
Climbing up snow ladders and down they slid
Along in the morning about half past three
They were all lit up like a christmas tree
When she got home and started for bed
She took another sniff and it knocked her dead
They laid her out in her cocaine clothes
She wore a snowbird hat with a crimson rose
On her headstone you'll find this refrain
"She died as she lived sniffing cocaine"Embed
