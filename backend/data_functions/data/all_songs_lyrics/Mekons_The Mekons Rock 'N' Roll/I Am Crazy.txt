I Am Crazy LyricsI thought I'd like to die where I was born
But I've been kicked out with no money
You said my voice sends shivers down (put splinters in) your spine
The sound of failure and cold water running
I tried to sleep but couldn't in the storm
I called for you but knew you wouldn't come
Send me a remedy for this thing I'm feeling
I just can't sleep
Dreams black and blue I am crazy
Someday I know I'll fly away just like a sparrow
At night I go and walk out in the fields
My singing even makes the stones cry
I know you'll come back when you've had enough to eat
(you'll) hold me close like you might kill me
With a gun or a knife or a whip or a stone
Bury me with five hundred others
But in the evening I'll still stand at your gate
You'll (just) see me and turn awayEmbed
