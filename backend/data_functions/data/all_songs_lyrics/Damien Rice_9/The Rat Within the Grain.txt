The Rat Within the Grain Lyrics
This would not have happened
If I hadn't missed my plane
I would've been there when they told you
I'm the rat within the grain
Within this big misunderstanding now
I'm being misunderstood
I'm thinking someone's trying to fuck with me
And set fire to my wood

I wouldn't want you to want to be wanted by me
I wouldn't want you to worry you'd be drowned within my sea
I only wanted to be wonderful, and wonderful is true
In truth, I only really wanted to be wanted by you

It's a stupid situation now
Where everything goes wrong
If you can't tell if I am lying
Then you do not belong
In my bed, go rest your head upon
The bones of a bigger man
And he can cover you with rockwool
And you can close up like a clam
'Cause I wouldn't want you to want to be wanted by me
I wouldn't want you to worry you'd be drowned within my sea
I only wanted to be wonderful, and wonderful is true
In truth, I only really wanted to be wanted by you

So go play with your piano
Write a mediocre song
About this shell of mediocrity
And pretend there's nothing wrong
I never thought you were a chicken shit
I never thought of you at all
Until you asked me to be part of it
And now you're showing me a wall

La la la...

In truth, I only really wanted to be wanted by you1Embed
