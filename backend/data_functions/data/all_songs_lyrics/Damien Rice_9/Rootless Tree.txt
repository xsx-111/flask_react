Rootless Tree Lyrics
What I want from you is empty your head
But they say be true, don't stay in your bed
And we do what we need to be free
And it leans on me like a rootless tree
What I want from us is empty our minds
But we fake, we fuss and fracture the times
We go blind when we've needed to see
And this leans on me like a rootless

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me
Hate me and hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out?
Of this hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
Hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out
What I want from this is learn to let go
No, not of you, of all that's been told
Killers re-invent and believe
And this leans on me like a rootless
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it
Leave it, it's nothing to you
And you hate me, hate me
Hate me and hate me so good
That you just let me out
Let me out, let me out?
Of this hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out, let me out

Fuck you, fuck you, love you
And all you've been through
I said leave it, leave it
Leave it, it's nothing to you
