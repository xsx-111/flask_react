Grey Room LyricsWell, I've been here before
Sat on the floor
In a grey, grey room
Where I stay in all day
I don't eat, but I play
With this grey, grey food
Désolé
If someone is praying
Then I might break out
Désolé
Even if I scream
I can't scream that loud
I'm all alone again
Crawling back home again
Stuck by the phone again
Well, I've been here before
Sat on a floor
In a grey, grey mood
Where I stay up all night
And all that I write
Is a grey, grey tune
So pray for me, child
Just for a while
That I might break out
Pray for me, child
Even a smile
Would do for now
I'm all alone again
Crawling back home again
Stuck by the phone again
Have I still got you to be my open door?
Have I still got you to be my sandy shore?
Have I still got you to cross my bridge in this storm?
Have I still got you to keep me warm?
If I squeeze my grape
Then I drink my wine
If I squeeze my grape
And I drink my wine
Cause nothing is lost
It's just frozen in frost
And it's opening time
There's no one in line
But I've still got me to be your open door
I've still got me to be your sandy shore
I've still got me to cross your bridge in this storm
And I've still got me to keep you warm
Warmer than warm, yeah
Warmer than warm, yeah
Warmer than warm, yeah
Warmer than warm, yeah3Embed
