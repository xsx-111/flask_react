Whenever Lyrics
Focus baby don't look at me
See right through me
Understand my heartbeat
Murmurs to mock your rhythm
Yeah, my nuts, the other girls want 'em
But they can't have
At least for the moment
I'm with you there could be people around
I'm just focused on you
You can sip chardonnay
And I'mma have myself a brew
I'm a country ass nigga baby
You know how I roll
Your face, never seen something more perfect
You dance in my mind like Justice
I know you listening back like
"Damn, bro!"
Laid back so gentle like the violins
Lay on the beat
And we don't have to be discreet
Can I have a taste?
"Absolutely!"
You're my sweet tangerine
Let's make a smoothie
But baby
All jokes aside
My heart beats faster when you open your thighs
I'm just ready to slide, ride, and glide
Whenever, baby
Whenever, baby
Whenever, baby
However
Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (wooh hoo hoo, wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe
Me and you
Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (wooh hoo hoo, wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe
Me and you
Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (wooh hoo hoo, wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe
Me and you
Whenever, however, you want me, girl
You got me (wooh hoo hoo, wooh hoo hoo)
Whenever, however, you want me, boo
It's me and you, babe
Me and you5Embed
