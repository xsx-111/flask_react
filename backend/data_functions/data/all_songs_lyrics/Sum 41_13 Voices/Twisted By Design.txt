Twisted By Design Lyrics
I've got my scars to bear
Stitches just can't repair, oh, whoa
There's no one to blame this time
Absolution's waiting on a prayer
I'm breaking down the walls
Unveiling my share of faults, oh, whoa
This blood on my hands is a blessing
In a lifetime twisted by design, and I'm so alive!

Is it a threat, or the cure?
'Cause it's a brave new world I don't know if I'm ready for
Just a test
'Cause I'm miles up above you, flying with no safety net
I don't believe in fate, although this time, I think I've met my match
Why are the dreams so hard to catch?

'Cause you forget in time what it feels inside
When you live right on the line, but I'm so alive!

They say, believing is the hardest part
But I say, with every beat of my heart
I alone, will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say, the fire in your heart is gone
Well, I say, it's really only just begun
All along, you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design, I'm twisted by design
Taking the days as they come
But now, I'm seeing the world as if it had a thousand sounds
Oh, I admit, oh, that they're somewhere along the lines
I guess I lost my grip

But luck has turned the page, and time is up, I need to get things
Right, one more chance to catch the light
Cause you forget in time what it feels inside
When you live right on the line, but I'm so alive!

They say, believing is the hardest part
But I say, with every beat of my heart
I alone, will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say, the fire in your heart is gone
Well, I say, it's really only just begun
All along, you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design, I'm twisted by design

Starting over again, but the further I get
I can't stop these walls from closing in
Going out of my head, all the tears that I bled
They're not enough to take my pain away!
They say, believing is the hardest part
But I say, with every beat of my heart
I alone, will find my way
And get right back to the start
They say, the fire in your heart is gone
Well, I say, it's really only just begun
All along, you know that I'm
I'm twisted by design

In some ways I've changed
And I've left it all behind
But I can't change the way
That I'm twisted by design3Embed
