There Will Be Blood Lyrics

The little ones
We've gotta control all the little ones
All the little ones
We'll take the souls of the little ones, and that might be you

Confess your sins of sorrow
Get on your knees and pray
Don't sell your souls on the open market
'Cause there will be hell to pay
We're gonna burn
We're gonna burn this down
There's no return (La la la la, la la la la)
In other words, we vow

If I am the king, then you might be my fancy

The little ones
We've gotta control all the little ones
All the little ones
We'll take the souls of the little ones, and that might be you
We don't believe it's over
The seasons of the dead
Just sell your souls for the lowest bargain
The price will be on your head
We're not alone
We're gonna bring you down
We'll take the throne (La la la la, la la la la)
The new king is crowned

If I am the king, then you might be my fancy

The little ones
We've gotta control all the little ones
All the little ones
We'll take the souls of the little ones, and that might be you

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la


The little ones
We've gotta control all the little ones
All the little ones
We'll take the souls of the little ones, and that might be you
The little ones  (La la la la, la la la la, la, la, la...)
We've gotta control all the little ones
All the little ones  (La la la la, la la la la, la, la, la...)
We'll take the souls of the little ones, and that might be you...Embed
