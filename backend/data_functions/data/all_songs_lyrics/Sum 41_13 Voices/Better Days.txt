Better Days LyricsIt's something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time
It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine
You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing alright
I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonight
You know that you had to know that I'd be on my way
It happened long ago there's nothing more to say
And I don't wanna be the one to tell you blood is on your hands
And I don't think you realise or even understand so I say
Days go by some good and some are bad
Soon you'll realise it all goes by so fast and its over
Its something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time
It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine
You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing alright
I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonight
Its something that you can't get right or maybe you just have no time
It seems like everybody's gone cause that's none of mine
You say that I'm just wasting time but I would say that I'm doing alright
I'm on to better days, and I'll be leaving you, tonightEmbed
