Breaking the Chain Lyrics

Here as I stand, all the signs become so clear
To get back home again, sometimes I lose my way, hey

Because I'm bound to fall, and just lose it all
Am I running out of time?

I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew
Beaten black and blue, it's time
To be face to face with the lies I choose
Throw the truth into the light
Make no mistake, I've paid my price
I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain

Days pass me by like I'm saving wasted time
I'm not all right, I think I've fallen for the lie, aye

And as it fades to black, I'm not looking back
I'm so blinded by the light
I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew
Beaten black and blue, it's time
To be face to face with the lies I choose
Throw the truth into the light
Make no mistake, I've paid my price
I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain


'Cause I'm tired of chasing, chasing yesterday, I've lost the feeling!
Scars don't fade, they never go away, and I'm still bleeding!
Every step I take, all the chains that I break
It brings me one step closer
I'm breaking the chain...

I'm breaking the chain from the life I knew
Beaten black and blue, it's time
To be face to face with the lies I choose
Throw the truth into the light
Make no mistake, I've paid my price
I've done my time with the devil in disguise
'Cause the life I knew has a different view
Tonight, I'm breaking the chain
I'm breaking the chain
I'm breaking the chainEmbed
