Fake My Own Death Lyrics

All bets are off, but you still think that you've got a right, well
Your lucky days are numbered now, and you're to blame
You built a castle of sand, shaking the devil's hand well
At least I've still got my soul to sell

You've got to take me away, 'cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)
Something that's real (thing that’s real)
Help me escape, 'cause I wanna be (I’ll take my last breath)
Left to be free, I just wanna fake my own death

You played your part of the whore, you've got some kinda nerve
Or have you forgot I don't forget? And you're too late
You walk beside the dead where the angels never tread well
At least I've still got a soul to sell

You've got to take me away, 'cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)
Something that's real (thing that’s real)
Help me escape 'cause I wanna be (I’ll take my last breath)
Left to be free, I just wanna fake my own death
There's nowhere to run from Hell and above
I swear to God that someday there will be blood, shuh!


It all comes down in the end, in spite of me, you do it again
It all comes down in the end, in spite of you, I’ll do it again

You've got to take me away, 'cause I wanna feel (wanna feel)
Something that's real (thing that’s real)
Help me escape, 'cause I wanna be (I’ll take my last breath)
Left to be free, I just wanna fake my own death
