War Lyrics
So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score

Get ready, 'cause this is war

There are days that I think I’m crazy
Other days, nothing seems to faze me
There’s nothing more, and nothing less, just
All the fears that I must confess, well
I’m afraid I believe in nothing
No hopes or dreams, you could’ve left me dead
Naive and not to mention
I’m losing count of all my blessings (with all I've done...)

With all that I’ve done, it’s too late
I can’t take back all that I have become

So, all that I’m trying to say, I’m looking for a better way
Some days, it just gets so hard, and I don’t wanna slip away
So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready, 'cause this is war

Another day in the right direction
I’m okay, but I’m left to question
How did I get so far behind the rest?
Why am I so inclined to forget?
All the days that you made me crazy
Nowadays, you don’t even faze me
It’s all the same, and I don’t stress none
Sick and tired of all this tension (with all I've done...)

With all that I’ve done, it’s too late
I can’t take back all that I have become

So, all that I’m trying to say, I’m looking for a better way
Some days, it just gets so hard, and I don’t wanna slip away
So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score

Get ready, 'cause this is war

Get ready, 'cause this is war
Get ready, 'cause this is war

All that I’m trying to say, I’m looking for a better way
Some days, it just gets so hard, and I don’t wanna slip away
So, what am I fighting for? Everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score

Get ready, 'cause this is war, I’m looking for a better way
Some days, it just gets so hard, and I don’t wanna slip away
Get ready, 'cause this is war, everything back and more
And I’m not gonna let this go, I’m ready to settle the score
Get ready, 'cause this is war...3Embed
