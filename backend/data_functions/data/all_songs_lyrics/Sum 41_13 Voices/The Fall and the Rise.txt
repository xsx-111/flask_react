The Fall and the Rise Lyrics
Hanging by a thread now, my head's down, not feeling like myself
Now, the voices inside my head are getting too loud
Screaming louder than a thousand drums
I keep counting the days, and I can't stop now
And I won't break down, I'm too proud, let's give them shit to talk
About, the pressure, the weight of the world won't keep me down
This time, I'm taking back what's mine
It's been a long time coming, and I just won't stop

Won't stop, won't stop, won't stop, won't stop, won't stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, go!

Go ahead, then, try to break me
Like a rat in a race until the dawn
Go ahead, then, make 'em pay, it's time
To take back the place where I belong

So, I'm done with all the chasing, I'm giving up on wasting
All my time with you now, I'm looking for salvation
I'm done with all the fake shit, getting hard to fake it
'Cause I can't take it anymore, so give me something sacred
I played the part of the villain, but no apologies given
I came right back to the start, now, it's about time for livin'
I've been to Hell and back still, I've paid the devil his bills
And now I'm coming back stronger, and I'm shooting just to kill
Just to kill, just to kill, just to kill, just to kill, just to kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, go!

Go ahead, then, try to break me
Like a rat in a race until the dawn
Go ahead, then, make 'em pay, it's time
To take back the place where I belong

The place where I belong
The place where I belong

The place where I belong and fade into the stars
A race until the dawn, and I just wanna take my place
The place where I belong, and fade into the stars
A race until the dawn, and I just wanna take my place
The place where I belong...

Won't stop, won't stop, won't stop, won't stop, won't stop
Won't stop, won't stop, stop, stop, go!

Go ahead, then, try to break me
Like a rat in a race until the dawn
Go ahead, then, make 'em pay, it's time
To take back the place where I belong
Go ahead, then, try to break me
Like a rat in a race until the dawn
Go ahead, then, make 'em pay, it's time
To take back the place where I belong
The place where I belong
The place where I belongEmbed
