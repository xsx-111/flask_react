God Save Us All (Death to POP) Lyrics
We have the passion of the unbroken
And our souls we will not sell
You can beat us down, but when we come around
We'll damn you all to hell

Waiting for a sign, I guess I missed it on the way
I tried to walk the line, but it’s more than I could take
I get so tired of waiting, your signal’s fading out
You're on the outside before you even know you're out of place
I've had enough, and your time is up
So, give me something, that one thing real
And I'll say yeah, 'cause I've been going out of my
Head again, just waiting for a lifeline

Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die

Give it to me, give 'til you ain't got anymore
'Cause I need it to believe it, that you got any soul
Give it to me, give 'til you ain’t got anymore
Pick your heart off the floor, and scream it out, God save us all!
I've given up the grudge, and saying all I have to say
Show me how to judge, and I’ll find another way
I don't know how to fake it, I think I'm breaking down
Under the pressure, before you know it something's gotta give
I've had enough, and your time is up
So, give me something, that one thing real
And I'll say yeah, cause I've been going out of my
Head again, just waiting for a lifeline

Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die

Give it to me, give 'til you ain't got anymore
'Cause I need it to believe it, that you got any soul
Give it to me, give 'til you ain’t got anymore
Pick your heart off the floor and scream it out, God save us all!

God save us all!


We have the passion of the unbroken
And our souls we will not sell
You can beat us down, but when we come around
We'll damn you all to hell
Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die

Give it to me, give 'til you ain't got anymore
'Cause I need it to believe it, that you got any soul
Give it to me, give 'til you ain’t got anymore
Pick your heart off the floor, and scream it out, God save us all!

Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die
God save us all! Let me see you hold up your salute to the sky
While you sing it out, bleeding out your lungs 'til you die
God save us all!
