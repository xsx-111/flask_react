Be At Peace With Yourself LyricsAt the end of the day
Ain't nobody else
And the walk in the shoes
Quite the way you do
So be at peace with yourself
And keep a spring in the hill
And keep climbing that hill
And be at peace with yourself
In the cold winter chill
When the wind blows like hell
There's a way where there's a will
Don't cry over milk that spilt
At the end of the day
Ain't nobody else
And the walk in your shoes
Quite the way that you do
So be at peace with yourself
And keep a spring in the hill
And keep climbing that hill
And be at peace with yourself
At the end of the day
Ain't nobody else
And the walk in your shoes
Quite the way that you do
So be at peace with yourself
Keep a spring in your hill
Keep climbing that hill
And be at peace with yourselfEmbed
