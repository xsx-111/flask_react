Big Painter LyricsLight the candle, please don't speak
Open the window, let some air in
I'm on the run, from the news on the tv
No lessons learned, all over the centuries
Over and over, over and over
Over and over, again
I pour a drink, I need one
I fall asleep, and dream
Pretty little girl in a purple dress
With you healing eyes
Painting a picture, of the world
Purple pink, the big board smile
I said pretty little girl
In a purple dress
Where you get them giggle in the eyes
She said the big painter in the sky
Had paint all their eyes
All our lives, all our lives
All our lives, over and over
All our lives, all our lives
All our lives, all our lives
All our lives, all our lives
All our lives, all our livesEmbed
