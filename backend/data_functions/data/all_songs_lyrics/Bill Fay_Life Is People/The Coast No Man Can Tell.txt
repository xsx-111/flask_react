The Coast No Man Can Tell LyricsIt's time to leave and say goodbye
At least for now
You fought the battle most of your life
And you still fight it now
Soon you will be leaving for the coast
But it's a coast no man can tell
It's the end of life on this earth
And my brother I deeply fare you well
You will always stay in my heart
As I hope a willing wish
Until that day we walk through the fields
When all of God's promises are fulfilled
Soon you'll be leaving for the coast
But it's a coast no man can tell
It's the end of life on this earth
And my brother I deeply fare you wellEmbed
