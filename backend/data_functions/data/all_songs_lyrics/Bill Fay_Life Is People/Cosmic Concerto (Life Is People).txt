Cosmic Concerto (Life Is People) LyricsThere are miracles
In the strangest of places
There are miracles
Everywhere you go
I see fathers
Hold a little child's hand
I see mothers
Holding a little child's hand
I see trees, trees
Blowing in the wind
I see seeds
Being sown by the wind
It's a cosmic concerto, and it stirs my soul
I see grandmas
Blowing kisses into a pram
I see grandpas
Scratching their head in amazement
It's a cosmic concerto, and it stirs my soul
It's a cosmic concerto, and it stirs my soul
Like my old dad said
Life is people, life is people
In the space of a human face
There's infinite variation
It's a cosmic concerto, and it stirs my soul
It's a cosmic concerto, and it stirs my soul
Like my old dad said
Life is people, life is people
In the space of a human face
There's infinite variation
Life is people, life is people, life is people
Life is people, life is people, life is people
Life is peopleEmbed
