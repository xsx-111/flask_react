This World LyricsThis world is got me in its grip
Ain't no way I can wriggle out
Sometime such a crazy lady
Makes wanna scream and shout

This world is holding all the keys
Gotta break it before it breaks me
Something gotta happen soon
Something set us free from this world, this world, this world!
This world is got me on my knees
There was a time when I used to stand tall
Too many years in factories, scrubbing floors and walls
Dealers on the corner of every street
Driving so many easy way out
I ain't buying none of it
What it's all about
For this world, this world, this world, this world
