Empires LyricsListen now, listen now
To the high wind blowing
Through the tree
Listen now, listen now
All in between
They got to fold
To make way
For the little baby shoes
As the wind blows beneath
Hear the, hear the...
Hear the wind
Blow through the trees
Where it blows
Oh where it blows
No one knows
Howling wind
Hear the, hear the
Heart the wind
Blow through the treesEmbed
