Never Ending Happening LyricsThe never ending happening
Of what's to be and what has been
Just to be a part of it Is astonishing to me
The never ending happening
Of waves crashing against the cliffs
The falling seed the wind carries
The never ending happening
Souls arriving constantly
From the shores of eternity
Birds and bees and butterflies
Parade before my eyes
The never ending happening
Of the four winds changing direction
Nightfall stars sun rise again
Birdsong before the day begins
For some it's like tight-rope walkin'
Blind-folded and shaking
On either side fear and pain
For some it's like tight-rope walking
The never ending happening
Of war evermore and sore famine
Yearning for the day to be
When God will roll his stone away
The never ending happening
Of what 's to be and what has been
Just to be a part of it
Is astonishing to meEmbed
