There Is A Valley LyricsThere is a valley where the tree stand tall and an icy wind blows
Trees don't speak, but they speak to each other
Of the people long ago
When the soldiers came and took away the villages one by one
And the fury of that moment they felt
But could only silently look above
There is a mountainside where sheep are grazing with their young
Sheep don't speak, but they speak to each other
Of a killing long ago
When the people came and sacrificed their children to the sun
And the fury of the moment they felt
But could only silently look above
There is a hill near Jerusalem that wild flowers grow upon
Flowers don't speak, but they speak to each other of a crucifixion
Just because he said he was the son of God
And the fury of the moment they felt they could only silently look upon
Every city bar brawl, every fist-fight, every bullet from a gun
It's written upon the palms of the Holy One
Every city bar brawl, every fist-fight, every bullet from a gun
It's written in the palms, in the palms of the Holy OneEmbed
