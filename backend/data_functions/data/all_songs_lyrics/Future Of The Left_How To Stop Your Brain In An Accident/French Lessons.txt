French Lessons LyricsThey say the price of love is a black hole
Where your friends were
Where your social life sits
Pulled into a chasm of family engagements
And trips to the garden centre
That is true enough if you choose it
Or it chooses you
I forget which
You could marry yourself to an orphan girl
And overcompensate on her birthday
Well I don't need koi carp swimming round my feet
And auburn-haired children blocking my path
As I run to the disabled bathroom
Topping off a 12-hour drinking spree
Well I don't need koi carp swimming round my feet
And auburn-haired children blocking my path
As I run to the disabled bathroom
Topping off a 12-hour drinking spree
Well they say the price of love is a lot of things
They say a lot
If you give them a chance
They will say it all
And loudly
Sometimes they will say it more than once
I'm reading you
Like a pamphlet
That I picked up
From an idiot
On a unicycle
In a town square
He is sad now
He was sadder there
I am reading you
Like a pamphlet
That I picked up
From an idiot
On a unicycle
In a town square
He is sad now
He was sadder there
Now I'm leading you by a candlesight
And it breaks my heart in two
You can kid yourself
That your dreams amount
To more than counting backwards from four
It's a dangerous thing
Ambrosia
Just buy the cream
Apply it to the scar
And wait for emptiness
W-w-w-way down in the plastics
W-w-w-way down in the plugs
W-w-w-w-way down in the carpet
A metaphor needs a better hold
W-w-w-way down in the plastics
W-w-w-way down in the plugs
W-w-w-w-way down in the carpet
A metaphor needs a better hold
A rich kid stole the ball
The rich kids stole the ball
The rich kids stole the ball
The rich kids stole the ballEmbed
