Something Happened LyricsAlien hostess
Be honest
No one is happy in space
Things are awkward
Things are awkward
Things are disappearing
Father of brothers
Be honest
No one can tell them apart
Things are awkward
Things are awkward
Things are making sense
And then suddenly the sun stirs itself from it's slow sleep to push through the clouds
And a single ray of gilded light falls down upon a spot of earth just beyond the clearing
And all of our mistakes become places we've left behind
And all of our worries, times since tamed
Yeah, I'm down on my knees begging for scraps
Or the skin from your lips
I am using my tongue to chase off the flies
From the balls of your feet
(Flies from the balls of your feet)
Yeah, I'm down on my knees begging for scraps
Or the skin from your lips
I am using my tongue to chase off the flies
From the balls of your feet
(Flies from the balls of your feet)
It's the same thing over and over and over and over
The classic tale of love
Boy meets girl, ignores girl, kills girl in tragic accident
Is haunted by girl in woodland vista nightmares
Or perhaps... it's just the blood talkingEmbed
