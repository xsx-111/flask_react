Future Child Embarrassment Matrix LyricsHer cock is so hard
Her aim is true
I hear that when she comes
She comes enough for two
Her kiss is so sweet
It could distract the mind
From what she really needs
From what she leaves behind
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But I couldn't get the car to start
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But my plans always fall apart
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But I couldn't get the car to start
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But my plans always fall apart
Her cock is so hard
Her heart is pure
If she was beaten back
That was her choice
Her skin is so thick
She never feels a thing
Her cock is so fucking hard
Her aim is super
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But I couldn't get the car to start
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But my plans always fall apart
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But I couldn't get the car to start
Daddy daddy daddy I had time on my side
But my plans always fall apart
She was looking for her kneecaps
Upon a foreign field
And caught a glimpse of sanity
That she'd never really need
(Her cock is so good)
(Her cock is so good)
(Her cock is so good)
(Her cock is so good)
Her mind is alive
Her mind... is aliveEmbed
