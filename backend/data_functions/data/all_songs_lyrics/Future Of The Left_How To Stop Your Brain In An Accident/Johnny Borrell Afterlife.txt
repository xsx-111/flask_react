Johnny Borrell Afterlife LyricsUnder the milk float, gravity objects
Positive breakthrough and now where's my hovercraft?
Nikola Tesla, father of the brain
A terrible dresser that man
Paused at the shop to restock on virgins' blood
Black and white, it's all hemoglobin
Roy, just a boy just a boy
With the biggest head in school
Just a boy just boy
With the brightest future
Over the weekend everybody died
Something infectious but yet so damn wonderful
Bobby Zamora, I saw him on the bus
Making his eyelids aggrieve
Fuzz on the beans with the label clear as mud
Got a friend and a new placenta
Roy, just a boy just a boy
With the biggest head in school
Just a boy just a boy
With the brightest future
Suit yourself, there's nothing like a military coup
The clothes are great and everybody loves a curfew
Roy, just a boy just a boy
With the biggest head in school
Just a boy just a boy
With the brightest future
Roy, just a boy just a boy
With the biggest head in school
Just a boy just a boy
With the brightest future
Scarred for life
My chisel's on the cherry chopping chest
It let me down it made me up
And left me compressed
I flew business class
I drank too much I can't remember
But if her heart won't start
I won't get home until September
Roy, just a boy just a boy
With the biggest head in school
Just a boy just a boy
With the widest wingspan
Just a boy just a boy
With a Cancun boarding pass
Just a boy just a piece of workEmbed
