The Male Gaze LyricsForcing myself
Through a telescope lens
To a sea of bad moods
Shrink in my seat
As the currents compete
And my body turns blue
I couldn't look
And my eyes got sore
In the wild, wild, wild
I've got the male gaze
I'm thinking that someday
I'll be thrown up
On a sea of bad moods
Maybe they'll write
That I couldn't be turned
From my bookstore view
I couldn't look
And my eyes got sore
In the wild, wild, wild
I've got the male gaze
(But so what?)
I've got my father's eyes and milkman's soul
There's still a lot a lot a lot of things that you don't know
I've got my father's eyes and milkman's soul
There's still a lot a lot a lot of things that you don't know
I've got my father's eyes and milkman's soul
There's still a lot a lot a lot of things that you don't know
I've got my father's eyes and milkman's soul
There's still a lot a lot a lot of things that you don't know
I got satsumas
As payment in kind
But the passing trade
Has left me behind
If you turn into an object on the second night
Will my eyes get used to it
Will your heart compete with it
After failure?Embed
