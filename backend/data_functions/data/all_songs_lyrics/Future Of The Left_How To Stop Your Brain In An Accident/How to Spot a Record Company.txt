How to Spot a Record Company LyricsHey kids!
Greed
In itself
Will not save you!
Got to obey, got to obey, got to obey
Got to obey, got to obey the medium
Now, guys in bands are disappointed
Morning has been decommissioned
Guys in bands are disappointed
In the fucked up record buying public
Teenage me is disappointed
Everyone is just pretending
Teenage me is disappointed
In the fucked up record buying public
Hey kids!
Break
Everything
Just be grateful!
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch, son of a bitch
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch, you're going down
Now, guys in bands are disappointed
Morning has been decommissioned
Guys in bands are disappointed
In the fucked up record buying public
Teenage me is disappointed
Everyone is just pretending
Teenage me is disappointed
In the fucked up record buying public
How you gonna pay us for your prophylactics?
How you gonna barter for your fingernails?
All these worries are placed in context
Now we have a prison for our ponytails
Amateur bikini models wither in the stares
Of sailors lost - returned to the shore
All these debts descend to lifetimes
Now they have perspective on the ocean floor
How to spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
How to spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
How to spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot, a record company
To spot, to spot
Thanks for staying till the finish
Everybody needs a sense of closure
Thanks for understanding that
While never letting on that
The madness excites youEmbed
