Bread, Cheese, Bow and Arrow LyricsThe curtain falls instead of stones
I'm just a man, a simple thing
Made by meals that only serve to eat themselves
Such simple things
Once I dreamt of owning my own home and renting six bedrooms
To call center veterans, good tenants and better communicators
But ambition encountered and economy dominated
By forces so deep they could foul themselves
I'm just a man, a simple thing
The chorus ends
I'm just a man, a simple thing
The volume works especially between my legs
So fuck you all
The lonely nest of my ancestors
There end the lions
They died in the millions
Big spenders and adequate firemen
We served them fateful ketchup
Baked in temporary prison cells
I'm just a man, a simple thing
A simple thing
Bread, cheese, bow and arrow
The staple diet of rodents
Bread, cheese, bow and arrow
The staple diet of rodents
Four kids equals
Carnage at the petting zoo
Make a friend of discipline
They're sewn tight on the stylus
Break it out
They're held up as examples
To your banks
They're sewn tight on the stylus
Break it out
They're held up as examples
To your banksEmbed
