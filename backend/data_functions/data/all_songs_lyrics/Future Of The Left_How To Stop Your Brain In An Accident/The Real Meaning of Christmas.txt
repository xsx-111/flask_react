The Real Meaning of Christmas LyricsShe put her lips together as the temperature dropped
And the winter made another friend
She found a whole new world of pretending
If only it would never end
Curled up in the corner her concussion commenced
And took her oxygen so happily
She found a whole new world of pretending
It came with hidden guarantees
Hallelujah
She walked into the distance with her laces undone
On the pretext of avoiding work
She found a new world of achievement
Or something that would kill her first
Made her made her made her made her parents so proud
Until they understood the dossier
She found a whole new world of achievement
But nothing she could give away
Liberate your children from presents, Sabrina
We could burn the gift wrap and that will keep them warm
Liberate your children from presents, Sabrina
We could burn the gift wrap and that will keep them warm
Liberate your children from presents, Sabrina
We could burn the gift wrap and that will keep them warm
Liberate your children from presents, Sabrina
We could burn the gift wrap and that will keep them warmEmbed
