Dinner Lady Arms Lyrics
We had a good thing, it was a blast
That was a long time in the past
You went through changes and I walked away
And I have regretted that, to this day

I may not always have quite so much hair
But what you saw in me will, hopefully, always be there
I'll never hurt you again, I swear

So, put your arms around me, your dinner lady arms
Put your arms around me, your dinner lady arms
I couldn't figure out where your figure had gone
I thought that I could live without you, honey, I was so wrong
Put your arms around me, your dinner lady arms
Your dinner lady arms

Forgive and forget I caused you pain
And find it in your heart to start again, ooh

I know I'll never be your "Mr. Right"
But I'm happy to be your "Mr. That'll Do For Tonight"
An I'll never let you out of my sight


I may be light-years past all my sell-by dates
But there's life in the old dog yet, honey, it's not too late
Put your arms around me
Your dinner lady arms1Embed
