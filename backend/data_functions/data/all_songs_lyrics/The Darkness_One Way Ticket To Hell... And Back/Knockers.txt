Knockers Lyrics
Oh lord, I'm so bored
Living on my own
You're devilish and dirty
They say your pushing thirty
Well, pushing thirty stone
Oh Christ, I'm enticed
I want you in my sack
You're potty-mouthed and brassy
You're anything but classy
I've just got to get you back

It's been a while
Since I've seen that smile
But the old magic's still there

And I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I just love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah

Oh crumbs, I'm all thumbs
Lying here with you
You're beautiful and busty
But I'm a little rusty
I've forgotten what to do
It's been a while
Since I've made you smile
But the old magic's still there

And I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I just love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah


I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I really love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I love what you've done with your hair, oh yeah
I really love what you've done with your hair, oh yeahEmbed
