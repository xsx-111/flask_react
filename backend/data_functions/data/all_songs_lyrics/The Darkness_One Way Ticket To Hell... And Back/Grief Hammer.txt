Grief Hammer Lyrics
(Grief!)
Yes, it's grief hammer time (Hammer)
(Grief!)
Yeah, it's grief hammer time

DIY not, commission my erection
Tool for hire, manual love
Rigger boots and dungarees
And a grimace

(Grief!)
Yes, it's grief hammer time (Hammer)
(Grief!)
Yeah, it's grief hammer time

It's an odd job, but someone's gotta do it
Jack of all trades, master of love
I'm a handy man to have around
In a fight

(Grief!)
Yes, it's grief hammer time (Hammer)
(Grief!)
Yeah, it's grief hammer time
Rrrr... hammer time!
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
Oh, it's hammer time!

Yeah, it's grief hammer time
(Grief!)Embed
