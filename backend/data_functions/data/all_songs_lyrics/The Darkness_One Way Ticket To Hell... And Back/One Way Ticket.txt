One Way Ticket Lyrics*snorting*

It was a dusty old night and I'm the first to admit it
I've surely upset someone, but my memory has chosen to omit it
A tiny voice telling me I really should cool it
Chewing my face off, talking absolute rubbish

The first line hit me like a kick in the face
I thought, "I'd better have another one, just in case"
Next thing I knew, my heart was under attack
I bought a one way ticket to hell ...and back

One way ticket to hell and back
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
One way ticket to hell and back
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back

I've always tried to keep my vices under wraps
But a coach-load of mutes would have been talkative chaps
If they had seen fit to join me for a couple of hits
And now, my septum is in tatters
And I've still got the runs
It burned for a moment then it kicked like a mule
The strangers I recruited thought it was rocket fuel
Several massive chocking lines of glorious gack
I bought a one way ticket to hell ...and back

One way ticket to hell and back
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
One way ticket to hell and back
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back

Stick it up your fucking nose!

Holding court, repeating myself, each repetition slightly louder
Pausing just long enough to snort the white powder
Wheels came off, but I'm still on track
I bought a one way ticket to hell...
(And back!)

One way ticket to hell and back (yeah)
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back (ooh yeah)
One way ticket to hell and back
Bought a one way ticket to hell (ooh yeah)
One way ticket to hell and back (woo!)
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
One way ticket to hell and back
Bought a one way ticket to hell...Embed
