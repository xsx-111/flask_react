Wanker Lyrics
It was a hot day (wa-oh!)
And there were boobies ahoy
I am a bastard (wa-oh!)
I've been a very naughty boy

Hell hath no fury like a woman that is scorned
I ain't been this miserable since the day I was born

I cocked the whole thing up, up, up
Overfloweth my cup (woo!)
I cocked the whole thing up, up, up

Well, I am spineless (wa-oh!)
I ain't got not no balls
I am a wanker (wa-oh!)
I won't return your calls

We shared the same dream, but you wouldn't let me live it
You took the same brush as the other guys and tarred me with it

I cocked the whole thing up, up, up
Overfloweth my cup (woo!)
I cocked the whole thing up, up, up
Look into my eyeballs!


We shared the same dream, but you wouldn't let me live it
You took the same brush as the other guys and tarred me with it

I cocked the whole thing up, up, up
Overfloweth my cup (woo!)
I cocked the whole thing up, up, up
I cocked the whole thing up, up, up
Overfloweth my cup (woo!)
I cocked the whole thing up
Look into my eyeballsEmbed
