Shake (Like a Lettuce Leaf) Lyrics
Prawn cocktail, black forest gateau
Eggs and gammon with a bottle of Lambrusco
This is opulent luxury, I'm as happy as a pig in shit could be
You could keep your cordon bleu, and your seedless grapes
D'you know where you can stick your caveats?

I just want what every man wants
A nibble on your vol-au-vents
And a pint

So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)
Shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)

I like simple things; meaty pies
I like potato chips and I like my sushi deep fried
Never could pronounce "hors dâ€™oeuvres"
Cannot speak the language of love

I just want what every man wants
A nibble on your vol-au-vents... and a pint
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)
Shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake


So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)
Shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)
So just shake, shake, shake like a lettuce leaf
(Shake it 'til the slugs fall off)Embed
