Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time Lyrics
We may not get back what we had, what I threw away
But you know I would do anything, anything you say
I'd cross a thousand miles of broken glass, on my hands and knees
I would crawl if, for a moment, we could cease hostilities

But it seemed like such a good idea, at the time
Such a very, very good idea, at the time
I don't know where I am, I don't know where I went wrong
I don't know where to start again
I don't know where I am, I don't know where I went wrong
I don't know where to start again

Now the dream is over, and lately, I have found
You only seem to come alive when I am not around

But it seemed like such a good idea, at the time
Such a very, very good idea, at the time
I don't know where I am, I don't know where I went wrong
I don't know where to start again
I don't know where I am, I don't know where I went wrong
I don't know where to start again

But it seemed like such a good idea, at the time
Such a very, very good idea, at the time
I don't know where I am, I don't know where I went wrong
I don't know where to start again
I don't know where I am, I don't know where I went wrong
I don't know where to startEmbed
