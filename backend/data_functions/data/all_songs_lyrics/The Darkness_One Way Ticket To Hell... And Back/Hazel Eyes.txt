Hazel Eyes Lyrics
I hail from the flatlands of East Anglia
From a town that, once, could boast prosperity
She had trekked for many moons, from a land afar
But the cruel nets had emptied the northern sea

And she said
"Hoots, I cannae get back tae me hoos in bonny Scotland"

Girl with the hazel eyes, aah
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah

The elements had taken their toll on her
Her face was weather beaten and her hair greasy
I had never seen a set of eyes more hazeler-er
And a tear did fall, as she looked up at me

And she said
"Hoots, I cannae get back tae me hoos in bonny Scotland"

Girl with the hazel eyes, aah
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah

I shall travel with thee
For to see your folks in Scotland
With their blessing, on one knee
I shall ask for your left hand
 (x2)
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah
Girl with the hazel eyes, aah

I shall travel with thee
For to see your folks in Scotland
With their blessing, on one knee
I shall ask for your left handEmbed
