Shit Ghost Lyrics
Take a sheet from the bed
Cut two eye-holes and put it on my head
I just can't get you to admit
That I'm always by your side
In spirit

Like a shit ghost
Rattle my chains
Go woo (Woo!)
I wanna haunt this place

But you take me for a fool
To now take me as a ghoul
You're a broken hearts collector
With an omnipresent specter
Specter

Like a shit ghost
Rattle my chains
Go woo (Woo!)
I wanna haunt this place
If it wasn't for you


A shit ghost
Rattle my chains
Go woo (Woo!)
I wanna haunt this place
But I never had the guts
Come and interact
I only wanna scare you
Provoke you to reactEmbed
