Is It Just Me? Lyrics
I know that absence might make the heart grow fonder
Or is it "out of sight, out of mind", I wonder?
And do you yearn for me when the nights grow cold?

Till' death us do part
To have and to hold
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But, is it just me, or am I all on my own, again?
You're up at John O Groats, I'm down in Land's End
On you, I depend

I see your face when I close my eyes
And there ain't no place like between your thighs
Don't want a life alone, all by myself

To honor and trust
In sickness and health
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But, is it just me, or am I all on my own, again?
You're in the Taj Mahal, I'm outside Big Ben
It's driving me round the bend

For ever and ever
And ever, amen
I wanna give you my love, my love, my love

But, is it just me, or am I all on my own, again?
But, is it just me, or am I all on my own, again?
You're in the Vatican, I'm in the Yemen
And it feels like the end
The end!Embed
