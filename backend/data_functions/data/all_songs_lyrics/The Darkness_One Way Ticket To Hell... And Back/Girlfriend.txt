Girlfriend Lyrics
Girl, I know I've got a funny way
Of showing it
Yes, I thought our love was here to stay
And blowing it

Was never on my agenda
She meant nothing to me, I meant nothing to her
And now I realize it's over
I've just got to tell her

Girlfriend, I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much, so much

Girl, I know I ripped your heart right out
So, why pretend
That there is even a shadow of doubt that it's the end?

Why the hell are we breaking our necks
Where there's absolutely no affection, hardly any sex? (Sex)
To simplify something that extremely complex
You were my girlfriend, and now you're my ex
Girlfriend, I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much so much
Listen to my synthesizer


Girlfriend, I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much, so much
Girlfriend, I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much
I love you, I love you, I love you so much, so muchEmbed
