English Country Garden Lyrics
It was a cigarette break
And I was desperate
I saw her pushing the wheelbarrow
She said, "You got a match?"
And I said, "Yes:
My cock and Farmer Giles's prizewinning marrow!"

Frolicking in the summer fields, were we
I fell for you, and you grew to like me

I carved "You 4 Me" in the bark of a tree
In an English country garden
We rolled around, kissing on the ground
In an English country garden
You succumbed to my charms, fell asleep in my arms
In an English country garden
Beneath the stars above, we fell in love
In a English country garden
Jardin, jardin, jardin, jardin

They did a quiz at the village fete
And we came last
Everybody laughed at the two of us
But I've never seen a bale of hay
Move so fast
She was a bona-fide forking genius
Frolicking in the autumn fields, were we
I cherished you, and you tolerated me

We mucked about while we were mucking out
In an English country garden
You took me under your wing when we had our fling
In an English country garden
You gave my heart a boost, you ruled the roost
In an English country garden
Just as I got broody, you got moody
In an English country garden

English country garden
English country garden

I pulled out all the stops, harvested the crops
In an English country garden
The yield was meager, you were far less eager
In an English country garden
The seeds we scattered never really mattered
In a English country garden
I saw you leave the farm on another guy's arm
In an English country garden
Jardin, jardin, jardin, jardin, woo!Embed
