The Crab Song Lyrics
"Stay away from light"
You look beautiful today, where are you going?
Oh really?
Don't come back, stay out bitch
Dear Esther, goodbye, bitch
Come back, I didn't mean it
Just was kidding, said I was only kidding
Wait a minute, come back, I didn't mean it
Oh well...

"And after all the feelings go, I see I still love you so
I just thought I'd let you know now that everything's okay
And you are on your way back, back to where you came"
She said with pain in her heart, it was there from the start
Now I know why everything turns grey, but it's our own world we paint
And I want the brightest, I want flourescence every day and night
For the rest of my life, open your eyes, won't you?
Can't you see you're so beautiful to me?
We will no longer or came back, babe
No more
Don't look back as a matter of fact there's
A ten foot Jack wants to break your back
You stole his girl, you wrecked his world
Now it's your your head that he's gonna twirl
He won't think once, he won't think twice
Cause he knows just what he's gonna do tonight
He will commit a crime, a crime of love
And he won't be happy till he sees your blood
Looking back on when you left me standing in the rain

Don't look back as a matter of fact there's
A son of a bitch and he's digging a ditch
For you my friend, my lucky one
So grab your things it's time to run to the other side
Where love takes pride, and your souls
The only thing that stays alive
Hey! Quit talkin that terminal jive!
Looking back on when you left me crying in pain

Don't look back as a matter of fact there's
A ten foot Jack wants to break your back
You stole his girl, you wrecked his world
Now it's your your head that he's gonna twirl
He won't think once, he won't think twice
Cause he knows just what he's gonna do tonight
He will commit a crime, a crime of love
And he won't be happy till he sees your blood
Looking back on when you left me standing in the rain, incredible pain
I understand, you have to be your own person
Well, that's ok with me
Hurts, hurts, hurts, like a motherfucker!
Love, it kills, oh man, like a sonofabitch
That feeling, it gets me deep down there inside me
Where nothing, inside me, but only bad things growEmbed
