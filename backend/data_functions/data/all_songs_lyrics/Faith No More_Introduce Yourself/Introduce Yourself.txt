Introduce Yourself LyricsFrom the day I was born
I took the bull by the horns
And gave you plenty to scorn
Well, right on
Then you said in a song
That life was getting real tough
But hey, I think that you're bluffing
What of it?
Huh?
Introduce yourself (right on!) 
Introduce yourself (right on!)—Billy!
Introduce yourself (right on!)—Roddy!
Introduce yourself (right on!)—Mikey!
Introduce yourself (right on!)—Jim!
Now two decades gone by
And I know that's a long time
Para tiempo means nada, nunca
'Cause I'm still the same asshole
And I still wet my pants
Every time that I see your face
Who are you?
Introduce yourself (right on!) 
Hey, Mr. Biggs, hey, Mr. Bestall
Hey, Mr. Warner, what's up?
Hey, Mr. Enigma, hey, Mr. Big Time
Hey, Mr. Epic, what's going on?
Introduce yourself (right on!) Embed
