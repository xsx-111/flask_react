Faster Disco Lyrics
Styling, you know you are styling
So turn to the mirror there and blow yourself a kiss
It goes just like this
You've done it a thousand times
It's as easy as drinking wine, only now it's blood

Here it comes again
(Treating you so kind)
Here it comes again
(Leaving you no mind)
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
(Chasing away the night)

Your feelings, they flow without reason
So look to the stars above and
Blow it all away
I come without warning, yeah
Some call me morning
I wipe all your tears away, the evil ones I kill

Here it comes again
(Treating you so kind)
Till it comes again
(Leaving you no mind)
Take it all away
(Treating you so kind)
To take the night away
(Leaving you no mind)
Here it comes again
(Treating you so kind)
Here it comes again
(Leaving you no mind)
Chasing the night away
(Treating you so kind)
Chasing the night away
(Leaving you no mind)
Chasing the night away
Chasing the night away
Chasing the night away
Chasing the night awayEmbed
