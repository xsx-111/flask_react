We Care a Lot Lyrics(We care a lot)
(We care a lot)
(We care a lot) about disasters, fires, floods and killer bees
(We care a lot) about the NASA shuttle falling in the sea
(We care a lot) about starvation and the food that Live Aid bought
(We care a lot) about disease, baby Rock, Hudson, rock, yeah!
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
(We care a lot)
(We care a lot)
(We care a lot) about the gamblers and the pushers and the freaks
(We care a lot) about the smack and crack and whack that hits the streets
(We care a lot) about the welfare of all you boys and girls
(We care a lot) about you people cause we're out to save the world
Yeah!
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
(We care a lot) about the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines
(We care a lot) about the NY, SF and LAPD
(We care a lot) about you people
(We care a lot) about your guns
(We care a lot) about the wars you're fighting gee that looks like fun
(We care a lot) about the Garbage Pail Kids, they never lie
(We care a lot) about Transformers because there's more than meets the eye
(We care a lot) about the little things, the bigger things we top
(We care a lot) about you people, yeah you bet we care a lot
Yeah!
Said it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Well it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Said it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Well it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Well it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Said it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Said it's a dirty song but someone's gotta sing it
