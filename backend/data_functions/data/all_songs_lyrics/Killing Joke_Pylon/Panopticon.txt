Panopticon Lyrics
Self censorship, self policing
Shaping human behaviour
Computer games, low attention span
Distractions for the servile brain
Inside the, Panopticon
You donâ€™t have to have your phone on
All behaviour calibrated,from bulk metadata

Weishaupt comes alive
The all seeing eye

All your habits, all your movements
All your sexual preferences
All your colleagues, all your friendships
How often you take a shit
All your debts, all your bets
All your hopes and fears are known
Consolidation in every nation
The great work is nearly done


Retaining bulk metadata to be held against you
The elitist leanings of man appealed to by corporations
Diminishing expectations can be seen in every nation
Many tongues, one voice
The great work of age has come

Everything is known, health and your loans
All privacy gone, in the Panopticon
Everything is known, health and your loans
All privacy gone, in the PanopticonEmbed
