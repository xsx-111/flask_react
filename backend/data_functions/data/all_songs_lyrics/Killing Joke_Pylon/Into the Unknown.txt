Into the Unknown Lyrics
Is freedom so great to fight for food
Compete for shelter, who is the top dog
Is the winter of humankind
What has become of us, what made us blind

After disclosure comes, man takes his rightful place
Amongst the stars, the celestial barge awaits
One by one, we embark, to the sun behind the sun
Cast off, steer straight, into the unknown

I stride in fury and forgetfulness
Towards a house of hate, and death
Oh, how lonely, is the earth
As greed and blood  and weapons curse
To every man a hope above
To every child a table of love
Between our lips are, cities unbuilt
One law to follow, do what you will
