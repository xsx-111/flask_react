I Am the Virus LyricsDeath misery and tears
Calculated waves of fear
Drawn up by think tanks
There's a darkness in the west
Oil swilling guzzling corporate
Central banking mind fucking omnipotence
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus
False flags and black ops
Tavistock manufactured shocks
Something´s gone horribly wrong
Hot flushes for the NeoCon
A population in deep denial
Contagion released from a vial
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus
I am the Hydra-headed beast
I am the worm you can never delete
I am the dangers that never sleeps
I am the virus I am the virus
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
No one believes in nine eleven
Steel frame buildings don´t fall in seconds
Murderers in black robes decapitate innocents
The public's blank stare
Did you sleep okay last night, Mister Blair?
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus
I am the Hydra headed beast
I am the worm you can never delete
I am the dangers that never sleeps
I am the virus I am the virus
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the fury the spirit of outrage
I am the fire I am the virus I am the virus
I am the furnace where resentment glows
I am the bias I am the virus I am the virus1Embed
