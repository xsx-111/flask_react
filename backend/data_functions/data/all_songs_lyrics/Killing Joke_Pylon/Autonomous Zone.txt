Autonomous Zone LyricsLiving outside of the grid is the goal
Misery lies at the heart of control…
Dancing and playing to be with my kind
Smoke, fuck and joke, I’m just passing the time
Celebrations, demonstrations, debate
Distorted music, my war surrogate
No Wi-Fi soup
Off the grid
No more phones
No drones
Autonomous Zone
Autonomous Zone
Where lovers of freedom gather to laugh
No heroes or icons, such values have passed
Squat, grow a plot, pursue beauty instead
Under the flag of the black and the red
Speakers at breaking point, dance on the decks
Letters go feral, options of wildness
Dancing and laughing, high as a kite
Anointed and animated all the night
Cacophony, lovely ear-splitting noise
With wild abandon, give freedom a voice
Living outside of the grid is the goal
Misery lies at the heart of controlEmbed
