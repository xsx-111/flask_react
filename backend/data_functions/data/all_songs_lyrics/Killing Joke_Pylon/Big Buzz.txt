Big Buzz LyricsWalkin´ on familiar ground reduced to tears
Remember friends and faces passing of the years
All those who shared with us the ordeals and the pain
Hearts of gold walk down golden lane
Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and I´m alive
Smiling faces of those who always care
All the good people they´re always there
Follow your dream and you´ll go far
Every man and woman is a star
Still laughing after all these years
Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and I´m alive
A time for gratitude a time to thrill
Another chapter a fresh breeze blowing in
Voices of ancestors cheering us on
Never stopping until the race is won
Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and I´m alive
Still laughing after all these years
Tears of laughter tears of pride
Big buzz big buzz on a high
Big buzz big buzz and I´m alive1Embed
