Euphoria LyricsOvercast, the branches bare
The autumn leaves have fallen
I can hear the magpies laugh
I can’t shake this melancholy
And then the clouds break
A ray of sunlight
Gloria!
As if a promise
Some strange kind of euphoria
Dark phantoms of the past
Some things are best forgotten
Like Orpheus, don’t look back
Best years are waiting for you
And then the clouds break
A ray of sunlight
Gloria!
As if a promise
Some strange kind of euphoria
And then the clouds break
A ray of sunlight
Gloria!
As if a promise
Some strange kind of euphoria
And in the darkness
A ray of sunlight
Gloria!
As if a promise
Some strange kind of euphoria
Euphoria
Euphoria
