Star Spangled Lyrics
This is paradise, the endless sprawl
Broken windows and empty malls
Society crumbles and stomachs rumble
Incarcerated, on these shores thy kingdom come

Star spangled banner of bloodlust
Imperial agenda bleeding us
The lies of security
Veneer of democracy
Liberty strangled
Star spangle

Defiler of Gaia, leecher of oil
Devourer of mud in, ritual blood
Fed by nuclear fission, inherently wrong
Blinded by greed, thy kingdom come
Thy Kingdom come
