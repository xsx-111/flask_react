War On Freedom Lyrics
Ban heritage seeds and seed banks
Vagrancy is a criminal offence
Firing tear gas on reporters
Cyber tracking cyberspace
Compulsory vaccinations
Guilty till proved innocent
DNA database expansion
Maintained without consent

War on freedom
War on freedom
War on freedom
War on freedom

Iris scanners biometrics
Facial recognition software
RFID chip surveillance
From the cradle to the grave

War on freedom
War on freedom
War on freedom
War on freedom
No more peaceful demonstrations
Militarise the police force
Illegal trade agreements
Conducted behind closed doors
Bilderberg and private forums
Media monopolies, shaping conventional wisdom
Bye bye sweet liberty

War on freedom
War on freedom
War on freedom
War on freedomEmbed
