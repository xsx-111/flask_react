Delete LyricsEighty five people own half the world
It´s raining barium and no one´s concerned
Constructive chaos doctrines of shock
Circumventing constitutions they´ll never stop
We must delete we must delete
Perpetual conflict the only law
Desirability of peace shall be no more
The great motivator of man is always war
The all father of progress
God of the west cabals self elected elite
Delete delete we must delete
When getting to work costs more than you earn
And water tastes like waste and is ready to burn
While you pay their taxes you pay their debt
You buy their bombs and you buy into death
Cabals central banks self elected elite delete
We must delete we must deleteEmbed
