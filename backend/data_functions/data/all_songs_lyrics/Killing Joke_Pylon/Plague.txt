Plague Lyrics
Understand it has taken over
Understand the extent of the problem
Understand you are part of the sickness
Comfort lovers of the good life acquiesce
Like a virus the dispossessed concurred
Where they claimed their descent their identity
Like a plaque, the diaspora spread
Extolling greed as a virtue

Plague, on every house on earth
Plague, accidental curse
Plague, across continent and coast
Plague, they pretty on the host

A history of shit and aspirations
As Gaia dies of asphyxiation
Crawling over each other for wealth and power
Culminating in certain extinction
