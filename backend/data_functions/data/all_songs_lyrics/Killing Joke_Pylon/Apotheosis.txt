Apotheosis Lyrics
In this dimension everything is possible
As we travel the multiverse and timelines
One vision becoming more than mankind
Prometheus is rising
Though the portal faster than the speed of light
Night vision eyes, fibre- optic skeleton
Metamorphose to man into an alien

Prometheus is rising
Suddenly, I can see for eternity
Suddenly, time just melts away
And I feel like a God Tonight
As I reach  for the stars

Realisation creating our reality
Visualising, infecting other galaxies
Creators and architects of distant worlds
Prometheus is rising
Splice genes together
Saturate the universe
Trans- human dreams, deities of distant stars
Rebuild the colonies and temples of Cydonia

In this dimension everything is possible
As we travel the multiverse and timelines
One vision becoming more than humankind
