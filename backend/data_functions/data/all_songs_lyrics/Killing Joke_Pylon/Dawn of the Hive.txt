Dawn of the Hive LyricsPylons of death pulsing wave after wave through us
Human transmitters restructure reality
Smart dust and barium sprayed at high altitude
Ingesting nano-worms, humans can resonate
On the skyline the pylons of death
Modulating our reality
Dawn Of The Hive
Angels, holograms, visions and voices come
Signals inducing inter-cerebral hearing
Modulating realities background frequency
Connect the hive mind by pylons and tower masts
Micro-wave tower satellite masts
On the skyline the pylons of death
Pulse low frequencies to all terrestrial life
Modulating our reality
Dawn Of The Hive
The all-seeing eye that never sleeps
Connects the hive mind by pylons and tower masts
The blasted tower, a place of dread
Pulsing the waves of the new normalization
Micro-wave tower satellite masts
On the skyline the pylons of death
Pulse low frequencies to all terrestrial life
Modulating our reality
