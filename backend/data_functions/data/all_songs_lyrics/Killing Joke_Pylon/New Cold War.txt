New Cold War LyricsClosing in on the eastern border
It´s a unicentric one world order
With sinorussian capitulation
It´s an orchestrated end of nations
Food prices soaring as the sanctions kicked in
And all the hawks cried more
Oil prices falling and the propaganda talks war
Minerva has decreed a state of attrition
Hostilities new cold war
New cold war new cold war
In the arctic wastes under sheets of ice
Mineral resources corporate forces´ eye
Occupation ensures supply
Colour coded revolutions sustain the lie
Food prices soaring as the sanctions kicked in
And all the hawks cried more
Oil prices falling and the propaganda talks war
Minerva has decreed a state of attrition
Hostilities new cold war
New cold war new cold war
Breakin´ in a cold sweat just like the good old days
The drum beat of hostilities has started to play
A perverted thrill reminiscent of the big chill
Hair trigger giving everyone a shiver
Food prices soaring as the sanctions kicked in
And all the hawks cried more
Oil prices falling and the propaganda talks war
Minerva has decreed a state of attrition
Hostilities new cold war
New cold war new cold warEmbed
