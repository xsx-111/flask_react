The National Front Disco Lyrics
David, the wind blows
The wind blows
Bits of your life away
Your friends all say
"Where is our boy? Oh, we've lost our boy"
But they should know
Where you've gone
Because again and again you've explained that
You're going to
Oh, you're going to
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
England for the English
England for the English!

David, the winds blow
The winds blow
All of my dreams away
And I still say:
"Where is our boy? Ah, we've lost our boy"
But I should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the
National, ah
To the National
There's a country, you don't live there
But one day you would like to
And if you show them what you're made of
Oh, then you might do

But David, we wonder
We wonder if the thunder
Is ever really gonna begin
Begin, begin
Your mom says:
"I've lost my boy"
But she should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the

National
To the National
To the National Front Disco
Because you want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
When you've settled the score
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National6Embed
