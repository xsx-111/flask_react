We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful Lyrics
We hate it when our friends become successful
We hate it when our friends become successful
Oh, look at those clothes
Now look at that face, it's so old
And such a video
Well, it's really laughable
Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha

We hate it when our friends become successful
And if they're northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them
You bet your life we will destroy them
If we can hurt them
Well, we may as well, it's really laughable
Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
You see, it should've been me
It could've been me
Everybody knows
Everybody says so
They say, "Ah, you have loads of songs
So many songs, oh, songs and they can stand
Verse, chorus and middle eighth
Break a fade, just listen"
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la1Embed
