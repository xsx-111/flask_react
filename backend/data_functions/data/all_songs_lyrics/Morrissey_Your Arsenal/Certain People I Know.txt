Certain People I Know Lyrics
I take the cue from certain people I know
I use the cue and then I hand it on to you
And when I swing it so it catches his eye
Weren't you there, you'd have died
I trust the views of certain people I know
They look at danger and they laugh their heads off

Their clothes are an imitation George XXIII
Don't you find this absurd?

I'd hate to be like certain people I know
They break their necks and can't afford to get them fixed
They'd sacrifice all of their principles for
Anything cashable
I do believe it's terrible
Oh-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woahEmbed
