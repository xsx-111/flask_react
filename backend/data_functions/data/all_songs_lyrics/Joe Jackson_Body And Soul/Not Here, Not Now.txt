Not Here, Not Now LyricsThese words of love so hard for me to find
How can I change my mind if you can only lie?
These shattered dreams I try to build again
But looks could kill again and I'm too young to die
Smiling faces all around us
You don't wanna make a scene
Not here, not now
And I don't wanna cry
We drink the wine like we were really friends
But can our sadness end and work turn into play?
We dress so fine and step out on the town
And friends may gather round but soon will turn away
Smiling faces all around us
You don't wanna make a scene
Not here, not now
And I don't wanna cry
Smiling faces all around us
You don't wanna make a scene
Not here, not now
And I don't wanna cryEmbed
