The Verdict LyricsDid you do me right?
Did I do right by you?
When I bare my soul it seems you do not hear
Can this be true?
Am I a fool to fight?
I could do just what you say
But I'm following my heart and that takes me another way
It's not easy when there's no one giving prizes at the end
Waiting in the wings
Wishing that the band would start to play
As the show begins
Wonder what the critics have to say
Waiting
Waiting
For the verdict
Some people live so fast
They're so scared of getting old
Some people keep on working
All they do is line their graves with gold
We don't know what happens when we die
We only know we die too soon
But we have to try or else our world becomes a waiting room
Would you testify for me?
I think I'd do the same for you
Waiting in the dark
Waiting for the phone to ring all day
My witness disappears
Wonder what the jury has to say
Waiting
Waiting
For the verdict
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
