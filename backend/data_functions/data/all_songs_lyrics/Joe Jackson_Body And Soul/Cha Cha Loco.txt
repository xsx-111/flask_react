Cha Cha Loco LyricsYou've tied the knot –
Don't bite the hand or it won't feed
What she ain't got
Is sure to make sure you don't need
You can't go back
You've booked the band
So take your partner by the hand
Baile
Enjoy the food – so many courses
Baile
Enjoy the dance – they don't shoot horses
Baile
Cha cha loco
You like the dress –
It's out of mothballs once a year
The good champagne –
Tomorrow night it's back to beer
But now you're here
You'll dance all night
But never get the steps quite right
Baile
Enjoy the food – so many courses
Baile
Enjoy the dance – they don't shoot horses
Baile
Cha cha loco
Cha cha cha loco
Cha cha cha loco
Cha cha cha loco
(Cha cha loco, cha cha cha loco)
Cha cha cha loco
(Cha cha loco, cha cha cha loco)
(repeat)
Baile
Enjoy the food – so many courses
Baile
Enjoy the dance – they don't shoot horses
Baile
Cha cha locoEmbed
