Go for It LyricsEverybody's wasting time
Everybody stands in line
Think of Babe Ruth and you think of hot dogs and beer
But if he could hit a home run so can you
And your weight is just nowhere near
Am I making myself quite clear?
Is that the best you can do?
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it
If that's the best you can do
Get out of my place
Take anyone's face
Come last in the race, but
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it, ooh
The clock is ticking on the wall
Everybody has to take a fall
Think of Ray Charles and you think of sunglasses at night
But if he can play piano so can you
And you can tell black from white
Can you tell me that I'm not right?
Is that the best you can do?
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it
If that's the best you can do
Get out of my life
Be anyone's wife
And do what you like, but
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it, ooh
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it
Think of Babe Ruth and you think of hot dogs and beer
But if he could hit a home run so can you
And your weight is just nowhere near
Am I making myself quite clear?
Is that the best you can do?
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it, ooh
If that's the best you can do
Get out of your shell
Be anyone's pal
Do bad or do well, but
Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it, oohEmbed
