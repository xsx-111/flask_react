Drunkard LyricsHis coat was torn and tattered, his face was full of red
And nothing seemed to matter, as he put himself to bed
And he didn't know the meaning of it all
He wasn’t home that evening when his daughter came to call
And he didn't see the message that she left upon the wall
And he didn't know the meaning of it all
He looked into the streetlamps, all shinning in the rain
And he thought of all the faces that he’d never see again
And he didn't know the meaning of it allEmbed
