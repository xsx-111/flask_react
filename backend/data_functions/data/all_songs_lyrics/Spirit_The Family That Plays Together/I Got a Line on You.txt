I Got a Line on You Lyrics
Let me take you, baby, down to the riverbed
Got to tell you something, go right to your head

(I, I got a line) I got a line on you, babe
(I got a line on you, babe)
(I, I got a line) I got a line on you
(I got a line on you, babe)
Ow

Gotta put your arms around me with every bit of your love
If you know what to do, I'll make love to you
'Cause we got the right line to make it through these times

(I, I got a line) I got a line
(I got a line on you, babe)
(I, I got a line) 'Cause I got a line on you, babe
(I got a line on you, babe)

Ow, yeah
Yeah
(I, I got a line) On you
(I got a line on you, babe)
(I, I got a line) I got a line on you, babe
(I got a line on you, babe)

Now listen
My winter's almost over, the summer, she's comin' on strong
I can love you, love you, love you, love you all year long
Hey, hey

(I, I got a line) I got a line on you, babe
(I got a line on you, babe)
(I, I got a line) I got a line on you
(I got a line on you, babe) I got a, I got a
(I, I got a line)
(I got a line on you, babe) I got a line
(I, I got a line) I got a line on you, babe
(I got a line on you, babe)
(I, I got a line) I got a line on you, babe
(I got a line on you, babe)
(I, I got a line)
(I got a line on you, babe)Embed
