Silky Sam LyricsSilky Sam was a gambling man
And the cards all would dance in his hand
The stars would shine just to make a lucky sign
So you'd understand
Silky Sam was a traveling man
And he went from town to town
He'd pass you by with the world all in his eye
And his ear close to the ground
Silky Sam was a joke telling man
And you'd laugh just to be at his side
He'd please the crowd and he always smiled out loud
But alone and all inside
Do you know that Silky cried
(Bridge)
Silky Sam was a gambling man
And the cards all would dance in his hand
The stars would shine just to make a lucky sign
So you'd understand
Silky
Silky Sam
Oh Silky
Silky Sam
Oh Silky
Silky Sam
Silky Sam
Silk Silk Silk Silk Silky Sam
Silky Sam
Oh Silky SamEmbed
