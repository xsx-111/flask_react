She Smiles LyricsLook at her there
She's sitting in her comfortable chair
The flowers slipping down through her hair
She smiles
Well watch her pass by
Sheâ€™s careful just to keep her spirits high
And though there's no more apple in her eye
She smiles
Well what would you do if the clock ran backwards
And over the wall was a magic mirror
To see
But she understands
And lets the music run from her hands
And makes a friend so feel so very grand
She smilesEmbed
