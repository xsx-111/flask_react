Glass in the park Lyrics
If there's glass in the park, darling, I can't help but keep
Making appointments to sweep beneath the climbing frame
If the sun's in your eyes, I'll tighten your blindfold, baby
Don't worry, your foot won't get cut, strut carelessly

And when you say that you need me tonight
I can't keep my feelings in disguise
The white parts of my eyeballs illuminate
And I'll wait for you as if I'm waiting for a storm to stop
I've heard them talking 'bout how I'm gonna put you off

There's glass in the park and now that I'm up off my knees
I've picked up the speed to jump your palisades
And I shoot through the night and suddenly all those once lost
Concoctions froth and chase the day away

And when you say that you need me tonight
I can't keep my feelings in disguise
The white part of my eyeballs illuminate
And I'll wait for you as if I'm waiting for a storm to stop
I've heard them talking 'bout how I'm gonna put you off
Tell me, how can I put you off when you're a matter of urgency
I've got a million things that I need to do but they're all secondary
Make sure you're not followed and meet me by the death balloon
Paraselene woman, I'm your man in the moon
And like a grain of diamond dust you float
And my devotion's outer crust cracks9Embed
