Remember Me Lyrics
See her walking down the street
She reads the signs that no-one sees
I ask myself if she'll remember me?
From Edge Lane to London Road
I'd catch the bus there every Friday
Hoping that I'd see her once again

Heavy sighs and border lines
I'm a prisoner when she's so fancy free
Will she remember me?
Will she remember me?

It seemed like a month of Sundays
Since I saw her cross the road
The summer sun it never seemed so cold
Then one day to my surprise
I spied her on the other side
I tried to speak but my tongue it was tied

Heavy sighs and border lines
I'm a prisoner when she's so fancy free
Will she remember me?
Will she remember me?

Heavy sighs and border lines
I'm a prisoner when she's so fancy free
Will she remember me?
Will she remember me?

I met a friend who knew her mother
He said he saw her yesterday
He said she said that she went away
Now she wears a diamond ring
And glides across the crystal floor
She doesn't walk down my street anymore

Heavy sighs and border lines
I'm a prisoner when she's so fancy free
Will she remember me?
Will she remember me?
Will she remember me?
Will she remember me?Embed
