Put the Sun Back Lyrics
I caught you crying, trying to hide your tears away
And all the while I never knew you felt this way
I've loved you from the start, how could we let this come apart?
We've got to put the sun back in our hearts

Through the alleyways, the avenues and dreary days
Your schoolyard eyes hypnotizing every time
When we kiss in the park, emotion tearing us apart
We've got to put the sun back in our hearts

Down the cinder path and through the hedge
Climbing up to the window ledge
Throwing lockets to make a scene
I can't explain, you know what I mean

I caught you crying, trying to hide your tears away
But your crippled smile will always give the game away
Are we falling apart? Are we just walking in the park?
We've got to put the sun back in our hearts1Embed
