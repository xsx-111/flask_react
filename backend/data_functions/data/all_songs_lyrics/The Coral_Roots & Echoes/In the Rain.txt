In the Rain Lyrics
Outside the factory gates, where I will sit and wait
For you to turn around and show me there's a way
I am a stranger to the light
Enchanted by the walkers of the night

I stepped into the dark with all the broken hearts
I've searched the empty streets, distant and apart
I am a stranger in this life
Haunted by yesterday's desires

And when we meet again, you'll know I am to blame
When you see me standing in the rain

They say they can see what I'm supposed to be
But what is right for them don't mean it's right for me
I am a stranger to the light
Enchanted by the walkers of the night

And so the story goes as I watch from my window
Across the water front but they will never know
I am a stranger in this life
Haunted by yesterday's desires
And when we meet again, you'll know I am to blame
When you see me standing in the rain


I am a stranger to the light
Enchanted by the walkers of the night

And when we meet again, you'll know I am to blame
When you see me standing in the rain

In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
In the rainEmbed
