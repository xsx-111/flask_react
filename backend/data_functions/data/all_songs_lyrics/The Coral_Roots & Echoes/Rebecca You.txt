Rebecca You Lyrics
Stay by my side, let me wander
Through the darkness of your eyes
The moon, it comes rising like a ghost
Upon the tide of your sweet smile

And when you hide
Where do you hide?
What do you do?
Rebecca you
You're out of reach
You built a wall around you I can't breach
There's no way through
Rebecca you

Catch your dream of the silence
On the pathways of my mind
When I return on the roads
That always seem to lead nowhere
Will you be there?

Oh, when you hide
Where do you hide?
What do you do?
Rebecca you
You're out of reach
You built a wall around you I can't breach
There's no way through
Rebecca you


And when you hide
Where do you hide?
What do you do?
Rebecca you
You're out of reach
You built a wall around you I can't breach
There's no way through
Rebecca you
Rebecca you
Rebecca you
