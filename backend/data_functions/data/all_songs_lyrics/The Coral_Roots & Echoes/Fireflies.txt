Fireflies Lyrics
I walked by the window and stopped in the light
I stood there watching the fireflies
Went down to the ocean in search of a song
Wherever I'm going that's where I belong

Fireflies, fly on by
You will never ever see me cry
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry

Sand puddled pavement appear on the shore
If you ask for nothing you'll get nothing more
I walked by the window and stopped in the light
I stood there counting the fireflies

Fireflies, fly on by
You will never ever see me cry
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry

Fireflies, fly on by
You will never ever see me cry
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry

I'm watching fireflies, watching fireflies
I'm watching fireflies, watching fireflies
I'm watching fireflies, watching firefliesEmbed
