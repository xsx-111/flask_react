Cobwebs Lyrics
There's a place where the creatures play
I'm going there at the end of the day
Who knows what I'll find
In the cobwebs of my mind

There's a face in the photograph
In the attic beside the mask
Closer to the tide
In the cobwebs of my mind

From the watch house to the marshes
Following the signs to how we make
And she'll show me the way

We'll stick together through the thick and thin
Lights go out, that's where I begin
Now I'm lost inside
In the cobwebs of my mind


There's a place where the music play
I'll meet her there at the end of the day
Who knows what she'll find
In the cobwebs of my mind
When she moves her beauty falls
In the garden the masters call
She knows where I hide
In the cobwebs of my mind

She reads my eyes
She reads my eyesEmbed
