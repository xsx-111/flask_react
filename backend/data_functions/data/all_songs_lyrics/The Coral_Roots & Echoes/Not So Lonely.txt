Not So Lonely Lyrics
Today when love has slipped away
That's when I picture you standing on the shore
And all my sorrows, oh how they disappear
And I don't feel so lonely anymore

Tomorrow when it seems so faraway
That's when I recall the way you watched me fall
And all my tears, they will turn to sand
And I won't feel so lonely anymore

And the light, it keeps on guiding me
Back to the memory of when I held you there
Oh, when I held you there, when I held you on the shore
Now I don't feel so lonely anymore

So long, looks like I'm leaving soon
But I'll be back again knocking at your door
And all my darkest thoughts, they will fade away
And I won't be so lonely anymoreEmbed
