Music at Night Lyrics
Nothing seems right
Except for the music at night
A change in the season
It comes like a thorn in my side
Lost in a maze, lost in a maze

I looked for you, I was invisible too
Sleeping on Sunday
Avoiding the pale afternoon
Deep in a dream, deep in a dream

But nothing seems right
Except for the music at night

When I awoke
I saw a face in the smoke
Chilled by the evening
Caught up in the undertone
I call your name, I call your name

Out of the blue
That's when you walk in the room
A shift in the darkness
You ask me if I still want you
Of course I do, of course I do
But nothing seems right
Except for the music at night


Nothing seems right
Except for the music at night
A change in the season
It comes like a thorn in my side
Lost in a maze, lost in a maze

But nothing seems right
Except for the music at night
