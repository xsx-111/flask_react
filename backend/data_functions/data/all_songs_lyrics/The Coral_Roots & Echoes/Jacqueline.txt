Jacqueline Lyrics
You left before the rain came down
December was the only sound
All the leaves fell to the ground
When you went away

It's a crying shame to see
A kiss become a memory
Now I know just what you mean
When you say

Way above
Where the north winds blow
We will watch out afar
To the valley below
Oh Jacqueline, I know
Oh Jacqueline, I know

A pattern of the ways it seems
That's the way it has to be
Now I know just what you mean
When you say
Way above
Where the north winds blow
We will watch out afar
To the valley below
Oh Jacqueline, I know
Oh Jacqueline, I know

The Coven House
Where you now go
It stole our love
Don't you know
Don't you know

Oh Jacqueline, don't go
Oh Jacqueline, I know
Oh Jacqueline, don't go
Oh Jacqueline, I knowEmbed
