Nita Nitro LyricsWell I pushed on that button but that button was on too tight - right!
That kind of bull shines morning, noon and night
Then, I get to see her face again, well that sweet Nita Nitro, she's locos tambien
Should I go? should I stay? should I have another try? why?
Don't try rules 'cos they do not apply
Then, well I get a message from a friend, (well) that sweet Nita Nitro, she's locos tambien
CHORUS:
Nita Nitro say goodbye to everything we knew
'cos I don't feel like crying (oo-oo-ooo-oo) and though I may stop trying
Nita Nitro say goodbye to all that we held true
Say goodbye to the Rock and Rolls and welcome to the Blues
That you swore you'd never show Nita Nitro (woo-oo-ooo), Nita Nitro (woo-ooo)
Well there is nothing like a person who reminds you of yourself
If you wish you were anybody else
Then, when you get all alone again, well sweet Nita Nitro, you're locos tambien
CHORUS
Nita Ni...Embed
