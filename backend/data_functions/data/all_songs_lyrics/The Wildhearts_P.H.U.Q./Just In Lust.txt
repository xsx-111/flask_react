Just In Lust LyricsHow you been? it's been awhile, I heard you found someone to make you smile
Stick around, you got a pen? it's just so great to see your face again
A-take a chair, pull up a glass, do you remember when I saw you last?
Things have changed, and no regret, I'm glad we got to share a little etiquette
CHORUS:
One of these days in a classical way I was just in lust with you
Shutting out fire where the flame of two lie I was just in lust with you
And in the passion that plays in a chemical haze I was just in lust with you
I know you felt it too
'cos I miss you, but not that much, we only shared a little human touch
Nothing wrong or impolite - you're acting like pleasures got a copyright
So so so so backtrack, get the record straight, we only had a day to intimate
No one signed on the dotted line, we never said there'd ever be a second time
CHORUS
You know I felt it too
So why the worry, so why the guilt, huh? (o-o) so why (o-o) deny a night under the quilt?
So we were lonely, so we agreed: we only did it for the company
Things is wrong and things is right, things got a way of changing overnight
What's so wrong in turning on? instead of being alone when the chances are gone
'cos it was...
CHORUS
D'you know, 'cos you, you felt it too1Embed
