Getting It LyricsGetting it cheap, a-getting it free
A-getting it safe, a-getting it sussed
A-getting it seen, a-getting it praised
A-getting it in, a-getting it out, a-getting it erased
CHORUS:
Getting it all the way, so don't ask for what I say
When I'm still getting it right (getting it, getting it, getting it!) (x2)
Getting it down, a-getting it back
A-getting it pain, a-getting it tight
Well getting it loose, getting it to stay
Well getting it hard, a-getting it real, a-getting it afraid
CHORUS:
Getting it all the way, it feels a whole lot better today
'cos I'm still getting it right (getting it, getting it, getting it!) (x15)
Getting it rich, getting it poor
Getting it still, getting a deal
A-getting it shut, a-getting it true
A-getting it good, a-getting it bad
A-getting it and keeping it
CHORUS:
Getting it all the way, it's the same for you and me
We're all still getting it right (getting it, getting it, getting it!)
I'm still getting it right (getting it, getting it, getting it!) (x2)
You're still getting it right (getting it, getting it, getting it!)
'cos I'm still getting it right (getting it, getting it, getting it!)
I'm still getting it right (getting it, getting it, getting it!) (x9)
(on and on and on and on and...) (x14)
(on and on...)
SHUT UP!Embed
