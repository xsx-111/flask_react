Jonesing For Jones Lyrics(right hand (to left hand))
And of all the feelings
It's the only choice that my senses make, it's like I could inject you, babe, aa-aa
And of all the faces, you're the only human I ever known
But ain't it good to be alone sometimes?
It's warmer than blood and stronger than bone, I scratch and I shake
CHORUS:
I'm Jonesing for Jones, streams on my pillow, whether I can sleep at last
I'm Jonesing for Jones, say goodbye to the past
Uh-oh
And in the blackest evening
A-just a taste of you and the heavens shine, light enough to daze the blind, aaaw
You've got the power to fix me when I'm sick and twisting from time I've known
But ain't it good to feel alone sometimes?
It's warmer than blood and stronger than bone, I scratch and I shake
CHORUS
To the past (x2)
Oo-oo-oo oo-oo-ooo
I'm feeling warm and sated, a little dehydrated
But that's okay, a-'cause there's nothing in the way this time
It rains when I'm dry, it speaks when I'm alone, I can't leave it - I've tried
CHORUS
To the past (x6)Embed
