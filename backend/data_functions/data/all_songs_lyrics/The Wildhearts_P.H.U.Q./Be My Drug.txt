Be My Drug LyricsHold me, baby, try to think of how you made me
Hold me, baby, while the world gets bored and lazy
And hold me, hold me, tighter than I ever thought I could be, tighter than you'd hold a memory...
Time, bubbling under, I will rise, I will shake
Material gain in a new lifetime to be rid of the right
When I can only sing true nature of things
And I'll rearrange and I'll stand, tall as Centrepoint
Time, subtle as sunshine, I will rise, I'll abstain
With patience I gain in a new lifestyle, to be rid of the rage
Then I can only sing of the power of learning
When I realise I can stand, tall as Centrepoint
CHORUS:
Be my drug (x3)
Hold me, baby, try to make it a little less crazy
And hold me, tighter than I ever thought I could be, and tighter than you hold a memory...
Time, bubbling under, I will rise, I will train
Then I can only sing of the true nature of things
And I'll feel the pain I won't feel again
And I will rise to the other side where I'll stay, and I'll stand, tall as Centrepoint
Justice, be my drugEmbed
