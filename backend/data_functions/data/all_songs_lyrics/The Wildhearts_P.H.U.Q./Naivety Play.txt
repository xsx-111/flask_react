Naivety Play LyricsWatch yourself... here it comes... aaaaah...
Try to run and you try to hide, hide your face in the other side
Sycophantic or paranoid? suck on the milk of your plan destroyed
CHORUS:
Tell me
Where, where, where the fuck you been?
Where, where, where?
Where's the world through your palace walls? Babylon in the bargain stores
Naive says naive guess the rest, life's a play to the soon impressed
CHORUS:
Tell me
Where, where, where the fuck you been? (x3)
The more I see is the less I learn (x3), the less I feel is the more I burn
CHORUS:
Tell me
Where, where, where the fuck you been? (x3)
((where... where...) oh yeah)Embed
