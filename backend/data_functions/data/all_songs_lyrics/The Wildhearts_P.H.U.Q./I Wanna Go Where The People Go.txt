I Wanna Go Where The People Go LyricsOut of the misery, to wash my soul
Out of the ground with a new eight count
I never came to Rock 'n' Roll
Check in the mirror and I don't mind
Same old cracks in the face and glass
Just a little more defined
So I'm making a distance, avoiding the business
And me? In time - let it shine, let it shine
I wanna go where the people go yeah
(I wanna go where the people go yeah)
I wanna go where the people go yeah
(I wanna go where the people go yeah)
Take me there, anywhere
Just so long as there's an atmosphere
We'll be round, round, round
Come on down, we all went down
Show me a hero of head and heart
Rid of the stars and the blah, blah, blahs
Would be a worthy way to start
Rid of the clich√©s that go round and around
I wanna be where the cunts like me
Are buried six feet underground
If pride is a memory, is nobody angry?
And me? In time - let it shine, let it shine
I wanna go where the people go yeah
(I wanna go where the people go yeah)
I wanna go where the people go yeah
(I wanna go where the people go yeah)
Take me there, anywhere
Just so long as there's an atmosphere
We'll be round, round, round
Come on down, we all went down
Well...
I wanna go where the people go yeah
(I wanna go where the people go yeah)
I wanna go where the people go yeah
(I wanna go where the people go yeah)
Take me there, anywhere
Just so long as there's an atmosphere
We'll be round, round, round
Come on down, we all went down
We went down
We went down
We went down (We all went down)
We went down (We all went down)Embed
