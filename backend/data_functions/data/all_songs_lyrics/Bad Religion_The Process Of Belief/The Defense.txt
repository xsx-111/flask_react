The Defense LyricsNothing comes easier than madness in the world today
Mass paranoia is a mode, not a malady
Yeah, I'd like to watch a thousand cable channels but there's nothing on
And my high speed connection's monitored daily by the Pentagon
These things are seldom what they seem
I'm not inclined to enjoy my dream
Won't go away
(No peace) No peace
(And no friends) And no friends
(We trace) We trace the mortal edge (With no defense)
To state the obvious
This world is perilous for us
No sense (No sense)
And no guide (No guide)
Ain't it beautiful to be alive? (Yeah, right)
I won't resign before the struggle ends
So I'll construct this sound defense
We are the prey and culture is the predator
I'm running out of time where conditions are positional
Shadows of a doubt cast reluctance and depravity
There's got to be a way to overcome this grim reality
Is there an option left for me?
I'm not immune to despondency
There's no way
(No peace) No peace
(And no friends) And no friends
(We trace)
We trace the mortal edge (with no defense)
To state the obvious
This world is perilous for us
No sense (no sense)
And no guide (no guide)
Ain't it beautiful to be alive? (Yeah, right)
I won't resign before the struggle ends
So I'll construct this sound defense
There's a signpost on the corner and it keeps everybody safe
We were all made in the shade
And your mother's in the kitchen where she's patching all the cracks in the wall
We never had a care in the world
(No shade) Too much to sacrifice
(And no light) It's hard to recognize
(Just black) Traps to compromise
(And white) Obscuring deadly alibis
(My plans) It's combinational
(Designs) The pressure so intense
So I'll construct this sound defense
(No way) Nothing's plainer than the madness in the world today
(No sign) I must conceal myself and steal myself and break away
(No grace) I seek initiatives in matters that are black and white
(No sense) So I'll construct this sound defense1Embed
