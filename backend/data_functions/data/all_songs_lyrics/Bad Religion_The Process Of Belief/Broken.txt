Broken LyricsShe said "thanks, but I'm broken
I guess you must have misspoken
What a laugh
I've never been chosen by anyone"
She was barely a teen, hanging out in between, just a part of the scene
With mercurial smile and incurable style, she was only a dream
How's that he didn't know a thing about
Making love to the kind of girl you read about?
He said "I'm bound to be broken
My daddy bet that I'd amount to nothing
He won't let
Anybody show him anything"
He was a troubled child, had been down for a while, always kept to himself
Though she couldn't defend he only wanted a friend, now he's made something else
It's so sad, no one saw it coming
The paper said that he hit the ground running
Oh yeah, I know I'm not broken
A little cracked, but still I'm not broken
I want to laugh
But I think that I'm choking on reality
When the world is turning for you, don't turn on me
Who are you here to repair? Well, I don't know what you mean
You could never resist glorifying despair
And now it's coming to you and I don't really care
Well, I'm not the kind to insist
You couldn't have missed, we must coexist
So please listen to me
There is no such thing as human debris
Oh yeah, I know I'm not broken
A little cracked but that amounts to nothing
I want to laugh
I'm not joking
I'm unbroken, I said I'm unbroken
A little cracked, it's just a token
I'm really not broken
Well, I guess I'm unbrokenEmbed
