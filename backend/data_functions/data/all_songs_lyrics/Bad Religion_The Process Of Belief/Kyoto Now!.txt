Kyoto Now! LyricsIt's a matter of prescience
No, not the science-fiction kind
It's all about ignorance
And greed and miracles for the blind
The media parading disjointed politics
Founded on petrochemical plunder
And we're its hostages
If you stand to reason you're in the game
The rules may be elusive but our pieces are the same
And you know if one goes down we all go down as well
The balance is precarious as anyone can tell
The world's going to hell

Don't allow
This mythologic, hopeful monster to exact its price
Kyoto now
We can't do nothing and think someone else will make it right
You might not think it matters now
But what if you are wrong?
You might not think there's any wisdom
In a fucked up punk rock song
But the way it is cannot persist for long
A brutal sun is rising on a sick horizon
It's in the way we live our lives
Exactly like the double edge of a cold, familiar knife
And supremacy weighs heavy on the day
It's never really what you own
But what you threw away
And how much did you pay?

Don't allow
This mythologic, hopeful monster to exact its price
Kyoto now
We can't do nothing and think someone else will make it right
In your dreams
You saw a steady state of bounty for eternity
Silent scream
But now the wisdom that sustains us is in full retreat

Don't allow
This mythologic hopeful monster isn't worth the risk
Kyoto now!
We can't have vision for the future if it can't be fixed
Alien
We need a fresh and new religion to run our lives
Hand in hand
The arid torpor of inaction will be our demise
Kyoto now!1Embed
