Bored and Extremely Dangerous LyricsWith nothing better to do
No one to come home to
I woefully conclude
To take it out on you
I'm bored to the extreme, this world of foolish dreams
Disillusion, I am not who I seem to be
Yeah sure, I might do harm and bear my right to arm
Retribution, if only someone would listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
A room, an empty shelf
A book on mental health
I look for inner wealth
By punishing myself
I'm bored to the extreme, this world of foolish dreams
Disillusion, I am not who I seem to be
Yeah sure, I might do harm and bear my right to arm
Retribution, if only someone would listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to meEmbed
