Prove It LyricsHit the road in wander mode, inquire along the way
Savior-faire in dull despair while living day to day
My heart is not a cold cauldron of proof
I don't ever need to prove myself to you
Looking back I'm off the tracks more times than I recognize
Mistakes are another opportunity to refine
My heart is not a cold cauldron of proof
I don't ever need to prove myself to you
There's no such thing as hell
But you can make it if you try
There might come a day
When emotion can be quantified
But as of now there's no proof necessary
No proof necessary
No proof necessary
There's no proof necessary, it's only in your mindEmbed
