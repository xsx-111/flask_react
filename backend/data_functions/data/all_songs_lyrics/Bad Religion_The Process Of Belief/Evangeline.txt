Evangeline Lyrics
She came from heaven, well there's no point belaboring that
I've seen some trouble and I must admit that I'm in demand
I confront rejection with magnetic good intentions and yet
Hey Jack, get back, in fact, don't do that

I act sharp but feel uncertain
'Cause next time it could be curtains

Evangeline, conspirator so fine
Lend me your faith 'cause mine is broken
Compared to mine
What is your crime, Evangeline?

Now just to be certain, let's be sure to set the record straight
I could use an angel but I don't intend to split up the take
Never go for treason, but I got reasons that don't warrant debate
My act's intact and in fact you're not all that

You act sure but you're uncertain
'Cause next time it could be curtains
Evangeline, conspirator so fine
Lend me your faith 'cause mine is broken
Compared to mine
What is your crime, Evangeline?

Well, there's no use turning back
It's already much too late
When the house is burning

Evangeline, conspirator so fine
Lend me your faith 'cause mine is broken
Compared to mine
What is your crime, Evangeline?Embed
