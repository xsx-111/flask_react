Epiphany Lyrics
A new age of reason
Brain's treason to trick the mind
What good is searching
If nothing's there to find?

We arrive at this place of no return, my brothers
Only to discover that our minds have led us away
So far from the painful truth of who we are

What's right is wrong, what's come has gone
What's clear and pure is not so sure
It came to me
All promises become a lie
All that's benign corrupts in time
The fallacy of epiphany

Come forth, bear witness
See the profit from your loss
Beg for forgiveness
Only after you tally the cost

We arrive at this place of no return, my sisters
Only to discover that our values ran us aground
On the shore in the sea of what we could be
What's right is wrong, what's come has gone
What's clear and pure is not so sure
It came to me
All promises become a lie
All that's benign corrupts in time
The fallacy of epiphany

If it's real for me
Do I have to prove it to you?
Why do revelations fade
To cold blue untruths?
It's all so relative
Subservient in total to one's perspective, yeah


What's right is wrong, what's come has gone
What's clear and pure is not so sure
It came to me
All promises become a lie
All that's benign corrupts in time
The fallacy of epiphany
Always failing me
