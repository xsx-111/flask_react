Sorrow Lyrics
Father, can you hear me?
How have I let you down?
I curse the day that I was born
And all the sorrow in this world

Let me take you to the herding ground
Where all good men are trampled down
Just to settle a bet that could not be won
Between a prideful father and his son
Will you guide me, now, for I can't see
A reason for the suffering and this long misery
What if every living soul could be upright and strong?
Well then I do imagine

There will be sorrow
Yeah, there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more

When all soldiers lay their weapons down
Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns
Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves
It's easy to imagine
There will be sorrow
Yeah, there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more


There will be sorrow
Yeah, there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more
Yeah, there will be sorrow
Yeah, there will be sorrow
And there will be sorrow no more3Embed
