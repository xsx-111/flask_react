Destined for Nothing Lyrics
Who do you believe can put some meaning in your life?
Meaning in your life, meaning in your life
Who do you conceive to provide you guidance and light?
Guidance and light, guidance and light

Are they waiting for you in the by and by?
Do you even have to try?

Headed for eternity and destined for nothing
The future isn't difficult to see
It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions
Lament not your vanquished fantasy, it's only destiny

Why do you consent to live in ignorance and fear?
Ignorance and fear, ignorance and fear
Ancient people succumbed to it, can it happen here?
Can it happen here, can it happen here?

Does it make you suffer 'cause you have to die?
Is it best to live a lie?
Headed for eternity and destined for nothing
The future isn't difficult to see
It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions
Lament not your vanquished fantasy, it's only destiny

Why can't you see?
There ain't no destiny
For you and me
There ain't no destiny
Why can't you see?
There ain't no destiny
For you and me
There ain't no destiny

Headed for eternity and destined for nothing
The future isn't difficult to see
It's easy to confuse grand design with life's repercussions
Lament not your vanquished fantasy, it's only destinyEmbed
