Supersonic LyricsWell am I making haste or could it be haste is making me?
What's time but a thing to kill or keep or buy or lose or live in?
I gotta go faster, keep up the pace
Just to stay in the human race
I could go supersonic, the problem's chronic
Tell me, does life exist beyond it?
When I need to sate, I just accelerate into oblivion
Into oblivion
Now here I go again, everything is alien
How does it feel to be outstripped by the pace of cultural change?
My deeds are senseless and rendered meaningless
When measured in that vein
I could go supersonic, the problem's chronic
Tell me does life exist beyond it?
When I need to sate, I just accelerate
Into oblivion
I won't lie (pace setters, go getters)
It's exciting (rat racers, forgetters)
When I try (researchers, berserkers)
To decide things (strategies to help the workers)
I just want to live (new time saving devices)
Decently (quick vices, no crisis)
Meaningfully (brevity dependency)
I'm in misery (digital efficiency)
I could go supersonic, the problem's chronic
Tell me does life exist beyond it
When I need to sate, I just accelerate
Into oblivion, into oblivion2Embed
