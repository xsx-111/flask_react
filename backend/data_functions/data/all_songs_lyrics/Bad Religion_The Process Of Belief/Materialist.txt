Materialist LyricsYou're obsessed and distressed 'cause you can't make any sense
Of the ludicrous nonsense and incipient senescence
That will deem your common sense useless
This ain't no recess
I want to believe in you but my plans keep falling through
I know I have to face the harshness, grin and bare the truth
And I have to walk this mile in my own shoes
And I'm no fool
I'm materialist, a full-blown realist
And I guess I'm full of doubt so I'm prone to have it out with you
I'm materialist, there ain't no fear in this
It's there for all to see, so don't talk of hidden mystery with me
Mind over matter, it really don't matter
If the street's idle chatter turns your heartstrings to tatters
Flatter hopes don't flatter and soul batter won't congeal to mend a life that's shattered into shards
Was it in the cards?
The process of belief is an elixir when you're weak
I must confess at times I indulge it on the sneak
But generally my outlook's not so bleak
And I'm not meek
I'm materialist, call me a humanist
And I guess I'm full of doubt so I'll gladly have it out with you
I'm materialist, I ain't no deist
It's there for all to see, so don't talk of hidden mystery with me
Like Rome under Nero, our future's one big zero
Recycling the past to meet immediate needs
And through it all we amble forth to persevere and climb
Our mountains of regret to sow our seeds
I'm materialist
I'm materialist
I'm materialist
I'm materialistEmbed
