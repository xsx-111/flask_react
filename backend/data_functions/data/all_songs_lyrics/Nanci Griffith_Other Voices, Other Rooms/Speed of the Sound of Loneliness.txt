Speed of the Sound of Loneliness Lyrics
You come home late and you come home early
You come on big when you're feelin' small
You come home straight and you come home curly
Sometimes you don't come home at all

What in the world's come over you?
And what in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run

Well, I got a heart that burns with a fever
And I got a worried and jealous mind
How can a love that will last forever
Get left so far behind?

What in the world's come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run

It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
It's crossed the evil line today
How can you ask about tomorrow
When we ain't got one word to say?
What in the world's come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run
What in the world's come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run

You're out there runnin' just to be on the run
You're out there runnin' just to be on the run
You're out there runnin' just to be on the runEmbed
