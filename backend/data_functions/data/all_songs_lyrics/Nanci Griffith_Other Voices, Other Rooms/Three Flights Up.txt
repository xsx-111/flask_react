Three Flights Up LyricsWe returned to that five-room flat
Now it was empty and this the last time
There were blinking pictures
Of how we'd sit and chat
Some of them are scattered
Others shattered in my mind
Chorus:
It was always three flights up
Cathedral bells kept time
In the winter, a-chatterin' cold
While the building shook like ragweed in the wind
Stories from the heat pipes
We were told
But now they only leave me
With a half-enchanted grin
Chorus
Bridge:
Bicycles squeezed down alley ways into view
And towels warmed on oven doors
To not freeze
Was the only thing to do
And I wonder if we kept to the fair warning
'Cause I can see it in the flowers
Dyin' on the windowsill
I know we must be out by tomorrow mornin'
But am I going 'gainst my will
Chorus
Bridge
Repeat last verse
