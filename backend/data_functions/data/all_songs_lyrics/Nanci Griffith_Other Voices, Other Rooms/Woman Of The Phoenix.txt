Woman Of The Phoenix LyricsWell, I've listened to the words you lovers speak
The sound of the lover's song
And I've dreamed all the dreams that the wayward girl dreams
In a thousand places gone
Dallas was my late night out
Radcliffe's served to roust me out
And Houston lay like Cleveland with the color removed
All I ever wanted
Was to wander and be wooed
Like a Woman of the Phoenix
A welcomed Waterloo
I've seen the sun blaze the breasts of the countryside
I've seen her huddled in a winter freeze
And I've run cross paths of a thousand lives
Among the cactus and the white birch trees
Avloc ran a waterfront bar
Vito, he was the king of thieves
And Michael was a rock 'n roll hood from the Odessa plains
Now, all of them were my kind
Wild and damn near free
But, a Woman of the Phoenix is the medicine they needEmbed
