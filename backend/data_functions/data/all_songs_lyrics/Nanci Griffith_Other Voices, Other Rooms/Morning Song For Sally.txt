Morning Song For Sally LyricsAs the morning light stretched in across my bed
I thought of you
Mm-hmm
Remembering your laughing eyes and all we said
I love you too
Mm-hmm
As all my thoughts of you pass 'fore my face a thousand times
The way they race my heart, I cannot say it all in lines
How the short time together lasts so long
Makes me strong
Mm-hmm
As two weeks came and went then you and I were gone
Living on
Mm-hmm
For it seems our love was destined to be caught in other nets
But the love we held so brief I'd chance again without regret
Yes, standing by the road has been my song before
Much too long
Mm-hmm
But now somehow I'm forced to see me there once more
And that's the song
Mm-hmm
For my waking thoughts of you are but extensions of the dream
Without you here beside me
I'll never know all that they mean
As the morning light stretched in across my bed
I thought of you
Mm-hmm
Remembering your laughing eyes and all we said
I love you too
Mm-hmm
And as all my thoughts of you pass 'fore my face a thousand times
The way you race my heart, I cannot say it all in linesEmbed
