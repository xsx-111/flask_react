Boots Of Spanish Leather LyricsOh, I'm sailing away, my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the mornin'
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place where I'll be landin'?
There's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There is nothin' I'm a-wishin' to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Maybe silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
If I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
That's all I wish to be ownin'
Oh, I might be gone a long ole time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passin'?
How can, how can you ask me again?
Well, it only brings me sorrow
For the same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from his ship a-sailin'
Sayin' I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feelin'
If you, my love, must think that away
I'm sure your mind is a-roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country where you're goin'
So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of stormy weather
And yes, there is something you can send back to me
