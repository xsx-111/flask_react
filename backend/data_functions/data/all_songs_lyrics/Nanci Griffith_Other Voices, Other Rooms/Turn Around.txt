Turn Around LyricsWhere are you goin', my little one, little one?
Where are you goin', my baby, my own?
Turn around and you're two
Turn around and you're four
Turn around and you're a young girl
Going out the door
Chorus
Turn around
Turn around
Turn around and you're a young girl
Going out of the door
Turn around and you're a young wife
With babes of your own
Where are you goin' my little one, little one?
Little dirndls and petticoats, where have they gone?
Turn around and you're tiny
Turn around and you're grown
Turn around and you're a young wife
With babes of your own
Chorus
Where are you goin', my little one, little one?
Where are you goin', my baby, my own?Embed
