Are You Tired Of Me Darling LyricsAre you tired of me, my darling?
Did you mean those words you said
That made me yours forever
Since the day when we were wed?
And tell me, would you live life over?
Could you make another wife?
Are you tired of me, my darling?
Answer only with your eyes
Do you ever rue the springtime
When we first each other met?
How we spoke in warm affection
Words my heart can ne'er forget?
And tell me, would you live life over?
Could you make another wife?
Are you tired of me, my darling?
Oh, answer only with your eyes
Do you think the bloom's departed
From the cheeks you thought so fair?
Do you think I've grown cold-hearted
Beneath the load of woman's cares?
And tell me, would you live life over?
Could you make another wife?
Are you tired of me, my darling?
Oh, answer only with your eyes
And tell me, would you live life over?
Could you make another wife?
Are you tired of me, my darling?
Oh, answer only with your eyesEmbed
