In Waves Lyrics
In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves

Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, in waves)
Do I take everybody else down
(Everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?

In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves

Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, in waves)
Do I take everybody else down
(Everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?
I know that death approaches fast
(In waves, in waves)
What's the purpose if this life won't last?
(What's the purpose?)
Pulling everyone down with me

(Perpetually)
Perpetually, we are igniting in waves (igniting in waves)
(Incessantly)
Incessantly, we are sinking in flames (flames)


(Perpetually)
Perpetually, we are igniting in waves (igniting in waves)
(Incessantly)
Incessantly, we are sinking in flames (flames)


In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves
Do I end this all for the world to see (see, see)?
Do I take everybody else down (down, down)
Everybody else down with me?
I know that death approaches fast
What's the purpose if this life won't last?
(What's the purpose?)
Pulling everyone down with me (me)

Do I end this all for the world to see?
(In waves, in waves)
Do I take everybody else down
(Everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me?
I know that death approaches fast
(In waves, in waves)
What's the purpose if this life won't last?
(What's the purpose?)
Pulling everyone down with me

Pulling everyone down with me
(In waves)
Pulling everyone down with me5Embed
