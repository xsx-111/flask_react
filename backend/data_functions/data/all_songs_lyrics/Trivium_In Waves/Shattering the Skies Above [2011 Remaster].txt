Shattering the Skies Above  Lyrics
Yeah!

Take me into the seas
So I can clean off this disease
Death will complete me
It's what I need

Take my evil
To the skies
Take my evil
All light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest till I am drenched in blood

Take me into the seas
So I can clean off this disease
Death will complete me
It's what I need

Take my evil
To the skies
Take my evil
All light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest till I am drenched in blood

Take my evil
To the skies
Take my evil
All light dies


Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
I'm shattering
Shattering the skies above
Shattering the skies above (Skies above)
I won't rest till I am drenched in blood
(Drenched in blood)
Shattering
Take my evil
To the skies
Take my evil
All light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest till I am drenched in blood

Shattering the skies above
Shattering the skies
The skies above1Embed
