Forsake Not the Dream Lyrics
Been down this road too many times
(Been down this road too many times)
You taught me how it feels to die
(You taught me how it feels to die)

We learn what it feels like
To feel pain for the first time (for the first time)
We learn what it feels like
To suffer, feels like to suffer

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
By any length
To face what's in front of you, in front of me

I watch it fall before my eyes
(I watch it fall before my eyes)
This dream we've built for our whole lives
(This dream we've built for our whole lives)

We learn what it feels like
To feel pain for the first time (for the first time)
We learn what it feels like
To suffer, feels like to suffer
Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
By any length
To face what's in front of you, in front of me

Vanquish that which kills you, darling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
Through the world, I feel I'm falling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)

Ahh! Ohh!
Crest fall in on the crestfallen
Collide and collapse

Crest fall in on the crestfallen
Collide and collapse

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
By any length
To face what's in front of you, in front of me
Vanquish that which kills you, darling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
Through the world, I feel I'm falling
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)

Forsake (forsake)
Forsake (forsake)
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)
Forsake (forsake)
Forsake (forsake)
Forsake not the dream (forsake not the dream)Embed
