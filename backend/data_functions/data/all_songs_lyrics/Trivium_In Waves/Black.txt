Black Lyrics
Decomposing in this worthless tomb
Nothingness inhaled, I am consumed
Starving for the ending to this doom
We the parasite, our death overdue

Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul

(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night

Termination sits across my cell
Waiting patiently to unleash hell
Frothing at the mouth, its hunger tells
Of the feast I'll soon become, my soul melts

Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night

Ahh!
Rain
Rain down
On
This hopeless
Scorched abyss
Rain down
Termination's
All we're owed
Rain down
Rain
Rain down


Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul
Black is opening
Oh, how it stares
So deep into the soul
So deep into the soul

(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night
(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the night

(Black) Downfall of decimation
(Black) It tears apart the nightEmbed
