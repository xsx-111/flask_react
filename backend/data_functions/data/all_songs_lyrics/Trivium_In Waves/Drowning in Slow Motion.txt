Drowning in Slow Motion Lyrics
Drowning in slow motion
Drowning in slow motion

It's what I need
A place to freely bleed

All behold the bloodshed (bloodshed)
Down upon your knees
All extol the godsend (divine)
Construction or divine

I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?
I feel there's no place left to hide

Taken from me
My willingness to breathe

All behold the bloodshed (bloodshed)
Down upon your knees
All extol the godsend (divine)
Construction or divine
I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?
I feel there's no place left to hide

Blackened horizon
Light has withdrawn


Blackened horizon
Light has withdrawn
Blackened horizon
Light has withdrawn

I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?
I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?
I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
I am left behind!Embed
