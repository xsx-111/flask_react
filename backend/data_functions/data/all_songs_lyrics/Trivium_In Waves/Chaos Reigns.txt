Chaos Reigns Lyrics
I built these wings
(I built these wings with broken things)
With broken things
(With broken things found strewn in me)
Found strewn in me
(Found strewn in me, my nemesis)
My nemesis
(My nemesis)

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I break and bleed
(I break and bleed, I tear then feed)
I tear, then feed
(I tear, then feed, the wretchedness)
The wretchedness
(The wretchedness inside of me)
Inside of me
(Inside of me)
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I know where my hate truly hides
Front and center behind these eyes
Chaos
Reigns

It bites and holds
(It bites and holds)
With fangs, so old
(With fangs, so old)
That loathsomeness
(That loathsomeness, so bitter cold)
So bitter cold
(So bitter cold)

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
