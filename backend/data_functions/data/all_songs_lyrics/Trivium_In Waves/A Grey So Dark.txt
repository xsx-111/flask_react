A Grey So Dark Lyrics
Ripping out the feelings used to
Hold me in to place
Breaking through the
Structures, I unfold at my
Disgrace

I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown

A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End

Swallowing the ashes of a newly
Burned-down dream
Tasting only charred remains of
Cured and better me
I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown

A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End

I burst, not bleed
I'm pulled into the undertow
I burst, not bleed
I'm swallowed by the great below


A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so darkEmbed
