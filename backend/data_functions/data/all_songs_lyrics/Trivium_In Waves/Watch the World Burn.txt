Watch the World Burn Lyrics
If we all fall down
We fall before moving wheels
Crushed between the gears
If we fall in line
We see that this path leads straight
Into the great machine

If we all fall down
We're swallowed by hopelessness
Digested by the need
If we fall in line
We're cycled through as the blood
Keeping it alive

I cannot take it anymore (I cannot take it anymore)
I feel it bleed out on the floor (I feel it bleed out on the floor)
You are a lost cause (You are a lost cause)
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn, it sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn, we are the arson
Watch the world burn, it sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn, we are the arson
If we break their hold
We open our arms to fight
Unleashing the light
If we stand our ground
We become the enemy
The revolution sounds

If we break their hold
We're faced down by everything
Challenged with a war
If we stand our ground
We're sacrificing ourselves
To save so much more

I cannot take it anymore (I cannot take it anymore)
I feel it bleed out on the floor (I feel it bleed out on the floor)
You are a lost cause (You are a lost cause)
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn, it sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn, we are the arson
Watch the world burn, it sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn, we are the arson
Holding the breath now
Don't make a sound
Don't make a sound
We are the arson
We burn it down
We burn it down

I cannot take it anymore (I cannot take it anymore)
I feel it bleed out on the floor (I feel it bleed out on the floor)
You are a lost cause (You are a lost cause)
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn, it sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn, we are the arson
Watch the world burn, it sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn, we are the arson

We are the arson
We are the arson
We are the arson
Watch the world burn
We are the arson
We are the arson
We are the arson
