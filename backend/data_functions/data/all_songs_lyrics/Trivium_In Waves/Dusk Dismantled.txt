Dusk Dismantled Lyrics
We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding
We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding

A fire burns
In the back of
The throat
Let it out, let it out
Before the
Choke

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal

Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out
Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out
I dig a hole
Through what's left of
My world
Searching for something more
I turn it
Inwards

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal


I'm falling, I'm falling
In this colossal void (In this colossal void)
Each day that I spent digging downward
Built me up for a higher fall

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence1Embed
