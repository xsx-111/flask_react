Leaving This World Behind Lyrics
Could someone please erase me?
Take my body from this hell
I don’t know how it started
But I sure know how I fell

We dug our graves real deep
Surrounded by our moats
Such a shame, oh, such a shame
Our sins won’t help us float

I’m leaving this world behind
Making up for all our crimes
I’m leaving this world behind
Making up for all our crimes
I’m leaving this world behind
Making up for all our crimes

Making up for all our crimes
Making up for all our crimes
Making up for all our crimes
Making up for all our crimes1Embed
