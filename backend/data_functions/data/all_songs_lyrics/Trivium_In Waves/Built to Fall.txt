Built to Fall Lyrics
You are a cancer spreading its wings
So selfishly unaware to the things
Your existence is doing to my well-being
I feel my heart leaking
You start as a fissure, a crack in the skin
You become an ulcer, permeating
If I had known all that you’d do
Would it hasten what I’d do to you?

I don't want to hate you
But how could I not?
You killed off so much
I held dear in my heart

Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (every day!)
I will bury you, once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall
You're built to fall!

It's getting harder and harder to breathe
Choking on the same air as a walking disease
You are the thing that's killing me
From the inside out, let me be
I don't want to hate you
But you killed off everything in my heart

Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (every day!)
I will bury you, once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall

You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end
You've got your war against my head
You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end
You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end!


Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (every day!)
I will bury you, once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall
(You're built to fall! You're built to fall!)
You're built to fall
(You're built to fall! You're built to fall!)
You're built to fallEmbed
