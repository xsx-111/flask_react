Inception of the End Lyrics
Fire
Alight the new beginning
Desire
Make this life worth living

Hands are shaking (Shaking)
Heart is breaking (Breaking)
It's for the taking (Taking)
Every single thing

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear

Fire
Cleanse the world that would hold me back
Desire
By the throat I release you, goodbye (Goodbye)

Hands are shaking (Shaking)
Heart is breaking (Breaking)
It's for the taking (Taking)
Every single thing
Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear

We start this fire
We start this fire
The way we always do
We start this fire
The way we always do
Let the flames consume

The way we always do
Let the flames consume

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fearEmbed
