Revival Lyrics
I'm saved, I'm saved
And oh, would you believe it?
On the third day
I felt his presence near me

I know they won't believe me, but
I've got favorite memories, well

I'm saved, I'm saved
And oh, could you believe it?
You won't regret
If you choose to believe it

Freedom. Silence. Always, yeah
All these darkened hallways

Darkness always
It doesn't make much sense
Darkened hallways
Away from me, calling "stay"1Embed
