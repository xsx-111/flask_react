Fly (Home Demo) Lyrics
Please give me a second grace
Please give me a second face
I've fallen far down the first time around
Now I just sit on the ground in your way

Now if it's time for recompense for what's done
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun
And the clouds will roll by
And we'll never deny
It's really too hard for you to fly

Please show me your second game
Please tell me your second name
I've fallen far down the first time around
Now I just sit on the ground in your way

So come, come ride in my street-car by the bay
From now I must know how fine you are in your way
And the sea she will sigh
And ever night
It's really too hard for you to flyEmbed
