River Man Lyrics
Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
'Bout things today
And fallen leaves

Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes

Gonna see the river man
Gonna tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time
If he tells me all he knows
'Bout the way his river flows
And all-night shows
In summertime

Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure
For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more

Gonna see the river man
Gonna tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free
If he tells me all he knows
'Bout the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me

Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and go12Embed
