Thoughts Of Mary Jane (Alternative Version) Lyrics
Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?
Why she flies or goes out in the rain
Where she's been and who she's seen
In her journey to the stars

Who can know the reason for her smile?
What are her dreams when they've journeyed for a mile?
The way she sings and her long forgotten rings
Make her the princess of the sky

Who can know what happens in her mind?
Did she come from a strange world and leave her mind behind?
Her long-lost sighs and her brightly-coloured eyes
Tell her story to the wind

Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?
Why she flies or goes out in the rain
Where she's been and who she's seen
In her journey to the starsEmbed
