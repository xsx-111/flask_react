Hazey Jane I LyricsDo you curse where you come from? Do you swear in the night?
Would it mean much to you if I treat you right?
Do you like what you're doing? Would you do it some more?
Or will you stop once and wonder what you're doing it for?
Hey slow, Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence
Do you feel like a remnant of something that's past?
Do you find things are moving just a little too fast?
Do you hope to find new ways of quenching your thirst?
Do you hope to find new ways of doing better than your worst?
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move
Do it for you
Sure that you would do the same for me one day
So try to be true
Even if it's only in your hazey way
Can you tell if you're moving with no mirror to see?
If you're just riding a new man who looks a little like me
Is it all so confusing? Is it hard to believe?
When the winter is coming can you sign up and leave
Hey slow, Jane, clear your eye
Slow, slow, Jane, fly on by2Embed
