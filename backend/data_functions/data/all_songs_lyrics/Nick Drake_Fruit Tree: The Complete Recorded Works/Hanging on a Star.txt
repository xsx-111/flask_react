Hanging on a Star LyricsWhy leave me hanging on a star
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
And why leave me sailing in a sea
When you hear me so clear
When you hear me so clear
When you hear me so clear
And why leave me hanging on a star
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so high
When you deem me so highEmbed
