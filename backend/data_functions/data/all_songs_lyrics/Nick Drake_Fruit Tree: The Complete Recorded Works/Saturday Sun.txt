Saturday Sun LyricsSaturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun came without warning
So no-one knew what to do
Saturday sun brought people and faces
That didn’t seem much in their day
But when I remembered those people and places
They were really too good in their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun won’t come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people in their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again
But Saturday’s sun has turned to Sunday’s rain
So Sunday sat in the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by1Embed
