Rider on the Wheel LyricsAnd now you know my name
But I don't feel the same
But I ain't gonna blame
The rider on the wheel
You know my song is new
You know it's new for you
I tell you how it's true
For the rider on the wheel
And round and round we go
We take it fast and slow
I must keep up a show
For the rider on the wheel
For the rider on the wheel
And now you know my name
But I don't feel the same
But I ain't gonna blame
The rider on the wheel
The rider on the wheelEmbed
