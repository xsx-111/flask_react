Way to Blue LyricsDon't you have a word to show what may be done?
Have you never heard a way to find the sun?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say if you know the way to blue?
Have you seen the land living by the breeze?
Can you understand a light among the trees?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today if you know the way to blue?
Look through time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind
Can you now recall all that you have known?
Will you never fall when the light has flown?
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say if you know the way to blue?1Embed
