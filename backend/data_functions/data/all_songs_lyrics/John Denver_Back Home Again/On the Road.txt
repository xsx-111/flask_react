On the Road Lyrics
Back in 1958
We drove an old V8
And when it'd gone a hundred thou'
We got out and pushed it a mile

We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

Headin' down from Canada on a gravel road a mile from Montana
Then my daddy read a sign and took us in the wrong direction
I asked my daddy where are we goin', he said we'll just follow our nose
So I looked out the window and dreamed I was a cowboy

We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just on the road

I met a girl in a truck caf√©
Fell in love almost right away
Then the Mercury was ready to go
And I had to leave her
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-sh-doo
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-sh-doo-sh-doo
"Go home," said the man in the moon, "go home"
"Go home," said the man in the moon, "go home"
"Because it's gettin' sorta late
And I'll soon turn out my light
Go home," said the man in the moon, "go home"

We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just on the road
We didn't know who we were
We didn't know what we did
We were just a ridin' on
We were just a ridin' on the roadEmbed
