Matthew LyricsI had an Uncle name of Matthew
He was his father's only boy
Born just south of Colby, Kansas
He was his mother's pride and joy
Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
All the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had
Growin' up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a mule beneath the sun
Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in forty-seven
A twister came and stripped 'em clean
He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found the family Bible
A faith as solid as a stone
Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
And so he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend
And so I wrote this down for Matthew
And it's for him this song is sung
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders
Behind a mule beneath the sun
Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on
Love was just a way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer skyEmbed
