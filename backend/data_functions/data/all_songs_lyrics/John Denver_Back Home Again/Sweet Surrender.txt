Sweet Surrender LyricsLost and alone on some forgotten highway
Travelled by many remembered by few
Lookin' for something that I can believe in
Lookin' for something that I'd like to do with my life
There's nothin' behind me and nothin' that ties me
To somethin' that might have been true yesterday
Tomorrow is open and right now it seems to be more
Than enough to just be here today
And I don't know what the future is holdin' in store
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm not sure where I've been
There's a spirit that guides me, a light that shines for me
My life is worth the livin', I don't need to see the end
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Lost and alone on some forgotten highway
Travelled by many remembered by few
Lookin' for something that I can believe in
Lookin' for something that I'd like to do with my life
There's nothin' behind me and nothin' that ties me
To somethin' that might have been true yesterday
Tomorrow is open and right now it seems to be more
Than enough to just be here today
And I don't know what the future is holdin' in store
I don't know where I'm goin', I'm not sure where I've been
There's a spirit that guides me, a light that shines for me
My life is worth the livin', I don't need to see the end
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the air
Sweet, sweet surrender
Live, live without care
Like a fish in the water
Like a bird in the airEmbed
