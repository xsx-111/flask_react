Permanent lover LyricsI need your love not just for an hour
I need a permanent lover
And there is something so fantastic about you
And this wat i discovered
Now getting to know you more and more each day
Will mek me respond to your calling everyday
I need a lover i need you wen the lights are low
I need you wen the breeze start to blow
My love i need a lover not for an hour
I need a permanent lover
Someone i can control
I need you wen the lights are low
I need you wen the breeze start to blow
I need you wen the moon shine above
I need a lover not for an hour
I need a permanent lover
Someone i can control
I need a lover permanent lover
Not for an hour
Someone i can control
Lover i really really
I need a lover not for an hour
Someone i can control
I really really need a lover permanent lover...Embed
