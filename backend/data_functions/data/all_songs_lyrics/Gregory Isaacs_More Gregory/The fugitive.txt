The fugitive LyricsI feel like singing sad songs all night
I feel like tuning you out
Do you want to make it in to more of a fight
Is this yelling what love's all about?
(Chorus)
So go on, and tear me apart
Yeah just go on in straight for my chest
And maybe it's mostly my fault
'Cause if I'm the only girl you've ever had
I guess I can't be the best
I can't be the best
And I feel like falling asleep while you scream
I feel like tuning you out
Do you want to stand up and make a big scene?
Put the lid down, pick up the dog shit, and shut your mouth
(Chorus)
And I feel like singing sad songs all nightEmbed
