Oh What A Feeling LyricsThat girl was hot and ready to go
She's a mess from her heavy metal
And it's alright, yeah, that's alright
Falling into lost quantum of ten
My friends' going gods
And it happens again
But it's alright, this is my kind
I'm running through the street
My hits in the air, this city is rock
We're not in Bel Air
And it's alright, this is my kind
Oh, what a night, I guess you're ready for the show
(Live where be free again)
Oh, what a night, I guess you get to let me go
(Live where be innocence)
We use to learn by a hanging trees
I see the lights coming near, Like diamonds
I feel silence, your heart stops
(Pured of me)
I need no money, better watch your disease
And it's alright, you are my kind
We're running down the fields
Ravens in air, you wanna free world everywhere
And it's alright 'cause we are blind
Oh, what a night, I guess you're ready for the show
(Live where be free again)
Oh, what a night, I guess you got to let me go
(Live where be innocence)
I feel you realize
I see my innocence, in this world
I feel you realize
I see my innocence
Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night
Oh, what a night, I guess you're ready for the show
(Live where be free again)
Oh, what a night, I guess you get to let me goEmbed
