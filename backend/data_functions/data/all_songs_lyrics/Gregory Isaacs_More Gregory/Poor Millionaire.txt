Poor Millionaire Lyrics
Woah oh
I
Woah oh

Ain't got a penny in my pocket
But I feel like a millionaire
I feel so foreigner
Now that my woman is near
Now that my woman is near

Maybe won't find meal easy, yeah
But still I'll take good care
'Cause Jah never ever give a man more than he can bear

Ain't got no shoe upon my feet, but still I'm dancing
There ain't much food to eat, but music's playing

Maybe we won't find things easy, yeah
But I will try to take good care
'Cause Jah never ever give a man more than he can bear, no way

Ain't got a penny in my pocket
But I feel like a millionaire
I feel so foreigner
Now that my woman is near, ay
Now that my woman is near

We'll get along...
We'll get along...somehowEmbed
