Confirm Reservation LyricsI'd really like to make you confirm reservation
So here I am with my implication
I wanna be with my friends and family
With the living is my teasing up for me
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibe no more, oh
Could you take another day under this condition ?
I'm going over to cross river Jordan
The white men lose, one day I'm gonna win
I'm going to believe where there is nothing
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibes no more
I can't take the vibe no more, oh um
Could you take another day under this condition?
I'm going over to cross river Jordan
The white men lose, one day I'm gonna win
I'm going to believe where there is nothing
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibes no more
I can't take the vibe no more, oh
Am I leaving you today?
Am I leaving you to stay?
'Cause I can't take the vibe no more
Can't take the vibe no more, oh
Turn on your feeling
Can't take the vibe no more
Wanted to believe me
Can't take the vibes no more
I'm moving onEmbed
