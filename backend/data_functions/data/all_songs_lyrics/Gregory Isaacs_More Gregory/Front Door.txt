Front Door Lyrics
Mmmmm
Ohhhhh

I gave her back the key to her front door
'Cause it seems she didn't care about me anymore
I gave her all the love I had and she spilled it, yeah
So I packed my things into a shopping bag and decided to quit

But Lord know that
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I said, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
But I would rather to be lonely than to live a dirty lie

All of those things that we've been through
Used to make me happy, now make me blue
I didn't believe the things that I've heard, no
But now I've seen it with my own eyes
I know actions speak louder than words

But Lord know that, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
Granny know that, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I mean it, yes I mean it, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
But I would rather to be lonely than to live a dirty lie
I'm so sorry, we've been true
I'm so fed up I don't know what to do

All of those things that we've been through
Used to make me happy, now make me blue
I didn't believe the things that I've heard, no
But now I've seen it with my own eyes
I know actions speak louder than words

But Lord knows that, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
Granny, know that I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I mean it, yes I mean it, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
But I would rather to be lonely than to live a dirty lie

Ahhhhh
I'm so sorry, we've been true...
Mmmmmm
I'm so fed up I don't know what to do
Don't wanna be lonely...
Don't wanna be lonely tonight, I don't wanna be lonely tonight...Embed
