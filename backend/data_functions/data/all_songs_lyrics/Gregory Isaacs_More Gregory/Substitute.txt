Substitute LyricsSuzan told me to leave
Saying she's a woman who’s cute
All of a sudden she said she found a substitute
But I'm just letting you know that I'll be around
I'll be your bridge over troubled waters
So you won’t get drown
Cause Your substitute's gonna put you down..
I heard you're smoking cigarettes by the pack
Since you told me to leave and don’t come back 
It wasn't my fault
You were the one who said we're through
Now you're drinking liquor
Which you didn't do
But I'll be around
So you won't get drown
Cause your substitute's gonna put you down...
Whenever time you're in trouble 
Just call my name and I'll be on the double..
So you won't get drowned
Cause your substitute's gonna put you down...
But I'llbe around
Yes I'll be around.. etc, etcEmbed
