Hush Darling LyricsWe gonna lay it on
Bright and early cause the heat is on
And I know that you are ready
Let us lay it on
Now that we are moving in the groove
And mi seh, hush darling
Even if it hurts to cry
Hush darling
'Cause I'm a gonna tell you why
'Cause after a storm
There must be a calm
And I will keep you warm
Darling, um, darling
We gonna lay it on
Bright and early cause the heat is on
And I know that you are ready
Let us lay it on
Now that we are groovin' in the groove
Hush darling, even if it hurts to cry
Hush darling
'Cause I'm a gonna tell you why
'Cause after a storm
There must be a calm
And I will keep you warm
Hush darling
Wait a little longer
Hush darling
'Cause love is getting stronger
'Cause after a storm
There must be a calm
And I will keep you warmEmbed
