So Long Lyrics
So long, so long
Gee, I hate to see you go
You mean the world to me, you know
You've been mine so long
So long, so long
Hope we meet again some day
If we do I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope you'll say
Darling, I was wrong

All alone with my memories of you
I hope you are lonely too
You're my own
Even though we're so, so far apart
I shall keep you here in my heart

So long, so long
Though you leave me here to cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
This will never, never, never, never, never be goodbye
You've been mine so long

All alone with my memories of you
I hope you are lonely too
You're my own
Even though we're so, so, so far apart
I shall keep you here in my heart
So, so long
Though you leave me in a cry
This will never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never be goodbye
You've been mine so longEmbed
