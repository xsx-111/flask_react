The Lonesome Road Lyrics
Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up, look up
And see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn

I get weary toting such a load
Traveling down that lonesome road

Look down, look down
That lonesome road
Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, look down, look down
Look down the lonesome road
Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, look up, look up
Look up and see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn

I get so weary toting, weary toting such a load
Trudging down, trudging down the lonesome road
Look, look, look, look, look down
Look down the lonesome road
B-B-B-Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, look down, look down
Look, look down the lonesome road
Before you travel, before you travel on
Look up, look up
Look up and see your Maker
For Gabriel blows his horn

Whoa, I'm weary toting, weary toting such a load
Trudging down, trudging down the lonesome road

Look, look, look, look, look down
Look down the lonesome road
Look down the lonesome road before you travel on
Whoa-oh, before you travel on
B-B-B-B-B-Before you travel on
Whoa-oh, whoa, before you travel onEmbed
