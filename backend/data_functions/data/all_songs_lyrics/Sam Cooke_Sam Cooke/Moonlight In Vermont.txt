Moonlight In Vermont Lyrics
Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves
A sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont
I see finger waves
Ski trails on a mountainside
Snow-light in Vermont

Telegraph cables they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely evening summer breeze
Wobbling above that old lark
Moonlight in Vermont

(Pennies in a stream)
Pennies, pennies, pennies in a stream
(Falling leaves, a sycamore)
Falling, falling, falling, a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont, and oh, oh
(I see finger waves)
I see finger waves
(Ski trails on a mountainside)
Ski trails, ski trails, ski trails on a mountainside
Snow-light in Vermont
Telegraph cables they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely evening summer breeze
Wobbling above that old lark
Moonlight in Vermont
You and I and moonlight in VermontEmbed
