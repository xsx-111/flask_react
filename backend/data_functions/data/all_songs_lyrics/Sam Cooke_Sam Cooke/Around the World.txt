Around the World Lyrics
Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous
I knew sometime, someplace, somehow
You'd look at me, and I would see the smile
You're smiling now
It might have been in county down
Or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
No longer will I go all around the world
For I've found my world in you

And oh, oh, around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
To keep a rendezvous
I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow
You'd look at me, and I would see the smile
You're smiling now
It might have been in county down
Or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
No longer will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you

Oh, oh, for I have found my world
Found my world in youEmbed
