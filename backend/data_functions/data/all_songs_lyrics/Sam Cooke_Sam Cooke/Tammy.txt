Tammy Lyrics
I hear the cottonwoods whispering above
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love
The old hootie owl hootie-hoo's to the dove
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my love

Does my darling feel what I feel
When he comes near?
My heart beats so joyfully
You'd think that she could hear
Wish I knew if she knew what I'm dreaming of
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy, my love

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know
Tammy, Tammy, can't let her go
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low
Tammy, Tammy, you love her so

When the night is warm, soft and warm
I long for her charms
I'd sing like a violin
If she was in my arms
Wish I knew if she knew what I'm dreaming of
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's my loveEmbed
