Here We Go Again LyricsIt's not the ending, it's the beginning
The ground is moist and it rained last night
Smells like smoke and it smells so clean
The sun shines down like a friendly white light
Here we go again
Analyzed the world I was born into
But I never could understand
Knew I never wanted to grow up if that meant being a man
Dominating strict competition is the meaning of our lives
Stomping on the weak keeps us the winner of the battle in our minds
Tensions in our lives that are destroying our minds
Unite themselves together, make our consciousness blind
Conditioned to self-interest with emotions locked away
If that's what they call normal, then I'd rather be insane
Relax yourself from giving what you want to do with your life
Ease up from giving up things like-like control of your own mind
If you never ask any questions
Then you're never gonna get no answers
Always be wondering what do you want
While you keep getting older faster
Tensions in your lives that are destroying our minds
Unite themselves together, make our consciousness blind
Conditioned to self-interest with emotions locked away
If that's what they call normal, then I'd rather be insane
(Insane)
Insane
Tensions in our lives that are destroying our minds
Unite themselves together, make our consciousness blind
Conditioned to self-interest with emotions locked away
If that's what they call normal, then I'd rather be insane
Relax yourself from giving what you want to do with your life
Ease up from giving up things like control of your own mind
Never gonna ask any question
Then you're never gonna get no answer
Always be wondering what do you want
Keep getting older faster
(Here we go again) Conditioned to self-interest with emotions locked away
(Here we go again) If that's what they call normal, rather be insane
(Here we go again) Another test of manhood
(Here we go again) Just when you thought you won
(Here we go again) The more we keep competing
(Here we go again) The more the battle's just begunEmbed
