Unity LyricsThere's a war coming down between my brothers tonight
I don't want no war going down
Going down, going down tonight
Stop this war
Stop this war
Civilization? Ha!
I call it as I see it
I call it bullshit
You know, I still cannot believe it
Our evolution now has gone the way of hate
A world evolved, resolved Into a stupid fate
Stop this war
Stop this war
All so different?
Yeah, I say we're all the same
All caught, you know, in the division game
Self-destruction fast impending like a bullet
No one can stop it
Once it's fired, no one can control it
Stop this war
Stop this war
A final word
Wait, it's not a call to action
We ain't no sect
No, this ain't no fuckin' faction
Unity, unity, unity, you've heard it all before
This time it's not exclusive
We wanna stop the war
Stop this war
Stop this war
Ain't nothing wrong
With another unity song
Ain't nothing wrong
With another unity song
Ain't nothing wrong
Ain't nothing wrong
Ain't nothing wrong
Ain't nothing wrong with a unity song
Stop this war
Stop this war
Unity
As one, stand together
Unity
Evolution gotta come, right
Unity
As one, stand together
Unity
Evolution gotta come
Unity
As one, stand together
Unity
Evolution gotta come
Unity
As one, stand together
Unity
Evolution gotta come3Embed
