Hoboken LyricsI'm in this prison you built for you
In this situation I don't know what to do
Can't make a connection or get a reaction
There's this wall I can't get through
You're dying of guilt, dying from words
What did I say?
What did I do?
Youth hostels I lodged
Seeing you as a mirage
Flashes of you were everywhere
Hoboken, New Jersey
I'm in this prison you built for you
In this situation I don't know what to do
Always something makes me think
Things don't have to be so wrong
You put up the walls with nothing spoken
In your weakness you're so strong
Youth hostels I lodged
Seeing you as a mirage
Flashes of you were everywhere
Hoboken, New Jersey
I'm in this prison you built for you
In this situation I don't know what to do
(Let's go!)
Yeah!
Youth hostels I lodged
Seeing you as a mirage
Flashes of you were everywhere
Hoboken, New Jersey
I'm in this prison you built for you
In this situation I don't know what to do
I'm in this prison you built for you
In this situation I don't know what to do
Let's go!1Embed
