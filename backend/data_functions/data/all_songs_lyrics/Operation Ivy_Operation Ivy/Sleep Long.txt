Sleep Long LyricsSleep long, sleep well
Only to awake in Hell
Sleep long, sleep well, sleep well
Only to awaken in Hell
One day I saw a man asleep
In a doorway on the street
Walls of sheltered inhibition
I perceived his condition
Dying of hunger and exposure
Food and shelter two blocks over
Within this place we breed and dwell
We've created living Hell
Sleep long, sleep well
Only to awaken in Hell
Let's go!
Sleep long, sleep well
Only to awaken in Hell
City sleeps and pigeons flutter
Vagrant dies in the gutter
Prideless death somehow befitting
Life spent working on forgetting
Riding on the bus, I looked outside and thought about death
Passing cars the only tribute to his gasping, final breath
Sleep, sleep long, sleep well, sleep well
Only to awaken in Hell
Sleep long, sleep well, sleep well
Only to awaken in Hell
Let's go!
Yeah!

Then I went home
To get my mind off things, I decided to watch television
Constant subliminal brain immersion
Subconscious death wish coercion
Buy and consume and want and need
Never fall from the trap of greed
Listen up!
Sleep long!
Sleep long, sleep well!
Thought about the bitter pain
Of jail cells and falling rain
Thought ahead and looked away
What can you do, anyway?
Sheltered youth and our pretension
Avert our eyes to divert attention
Only to see the advertisement
Always there to remind us
Sleep long, sleep well
Only to awaken in Hell
Sleep long, sleep well
Only to awaken in Hell
Only to awaken in HellEmbed
