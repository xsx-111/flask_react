Officer Lyrics(1-2-3-4!)
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Fuck you!
Pick it up!
Do you have to force yourself with power and control?
Do you feel a need to live your life playing up a role?
Intimidating people with your wall of sight and sound
You and your kind destroy our underground
All the happiness that you have destroyed
All the brutal tactics that you always employ
All the fucking bullshit, when will it ever stop?
The comparison is obvious
You're just a fucking cop
Officer
You act like an animal, you're outta control
Officer
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yeah!
Wear a tie if you wanna wear a uniform
Join the Army if you want to conform
Tough guy, big man, do what you can
Whatever you destroy, we'll create it again
All the happiness that you have destroyed
All the brutal tactics that you always employ
All the fucking bullshit, when will it ever stop?
The comparison is obvious
You're just a fucking cop
Officer
You act like an animal, you're outta control
Officer
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yeah!
Yeah! (Yeah!)
Yeah! (Yeah!)
Yeah! (Yeah!) Yeah! (Yeah!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
(Officer) Officer, officer, officer, officer
(Officer) Officer, officer, officer, officer
(Officer) Officer, officer, officer, you fucking cop
Why don't you, why don't you, why don't you fucking stop?Embed
