Big City LyricsConcrete and chaos rise up
Spiderweb across the land like a giant rash
And forests lie down below
Foundations of buildings in a bed of ash
Some people here got it real good
'Cause the glass towers bring prosperity
And other people starve in the street
Concrete knows no sympathy
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, it's a wishing well
Big city, it's a living hell
This town, it's fucking insane
One will starve and another will gain
It's like a giant mechanical brain
And the people are cells, and the streets are veins
Thinks only of itself
A thousand limbs crawling, it expands and grows
And still the concrete sits there
Sits there, stark grey and cold
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, it's a wishing well
Big city, it's a living hell
And I think I wanna be a bricklayer
So I can put another brick in the wall
Sanitary, rational and happy and sane
Growing like a flower to surround us all
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, it's a wishing well
Big city, it's a living hell
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, big city
Big city, it's a wishing well
Big city, it's a living hellEmbed
