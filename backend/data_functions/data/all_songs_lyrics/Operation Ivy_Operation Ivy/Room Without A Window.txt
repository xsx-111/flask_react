Room Without A Window LyricsThe position being taken is not to be mistaken
For attempted education or righteous accusation
Only a description, just an observation
Of the pitiful condition of our degeneration
Walls made of opinions, through which we speak but never listen
Ceiling made of pride, vicious and self-satisfied
Door thats made of rage, hard and slowly aged
Always closing tighter with any war we wage
And it's a room without a window, can't see out
Room without a window, can't see out, can't see out
Floor is made of lives we'd gladly end to stay inside
Corners made of borders, and borders made of order
Painted with the words of politicians and religion
Plastered with the wreckage of our cultural division
Room without a window, can't see out
Room without a window, can't see out, can't see out

Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, we're so stupid!
Killin' each other
Don't we learn nothin'?
Gotta room inside our mind, yeah, we gotta
We can't see out because we're blind, but it goes to show
Got to make ourselves dream, all right
From the room without a window to a different way to see
Gotta room inside our mind, yeah, we gotta
We can't see out because we're blind, but it goes to show
Gotta make ourselves dream, all right
From the room without a window to a different way to see
The position being taken is not to be mistaken
For attempted education or righteous accusation
Only a description, just an observation
Of the pitiful condition of our degeneration
Room without a window, can't see out
Room without a window, can't see out, can't see out
Room without a window, can't see out
Room without a window, can't see out, can't see out1Embed
