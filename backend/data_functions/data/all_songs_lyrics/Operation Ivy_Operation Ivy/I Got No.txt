I Got No LyricsWhen you're dying (dying), giving up hope
You're living (living) for smoking dope
You're singing (singing) that same old song
Yeah yeah yeah, it's always the same
You're dying (dying), giving up hope
You're living (living) for smoking dope
You're singing (singing) that same old song
Yeah yeah yeah, it's always the same
I got no, I got no
I got no nothin' in mind
I got no, I got no
I got no nothin' in mind
I was trying a new adventure
I was buying that old peer pressure
Wasting my mind away
But I saved it just in time
The reason I was going mad
I was hating my mom and dad
I was riding a sinking ship
Thank God I never did slip
I got no, I got no
I got no nothin' in mind
I got no, I got no
I got no nothin' in mind
When you're dying (dying), giving up hope
You're living (living) for smoking dope
You're singing (singing) that same old song
Yeah yeah yeah, it's always the same
You're dying (dying), giving up hope
You're living (living) for smoking dope
You're singing (singing) that same old song
Yeah yeah yeah, it's always the same
I got no, I got no
I got no nothin' in mind
I got no, no
I got no, no
I got no nothin' in mind
All right!1Embed
