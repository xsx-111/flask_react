Vulnerability LyricsHa!
I saw this guy go down
Wasn't time for fear before his body hit the ground
Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity
Car that hit him pulled to a stop
Driver hid his bottles, he anticipated cops
Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity
Oh yeah
Crowd assembled to take a look at death
Shattered skull, fractured body, blacktop running red
Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity
And people look bored like expecting more
People look bored like expecting more
Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity
And sympathy is only friendship's whore, you know
And maybe we don't know who we are anymore
And another spectacle, and it's respectable
To take it lightly like another TV show
So desensitized, so dehumanized
Why stop and think when you can find someplace to go?
We're drowning
We're drowning
Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity
We're drowning
We're drowning
Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity
And it's gonna be the death of us, just you wait and seeEmbed
