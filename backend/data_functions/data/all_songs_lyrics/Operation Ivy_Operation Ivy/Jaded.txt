Jaded LyricsSomething breaks inside of you
With the spectacle of all the shows
Fifteen fights and your six bucks
Has gone up some promoter's nose
Jaded eyes see clearly, but only half of what's there
Good old days are far behind, what's left is boredom and despair
Sometimes every once in a while
Sometimes every once in a while
It's beautiful, I would say
I wouldn't have it any other way
If I said different, that would be a lie
If I said different, that would be a lie
Be a lie
What was once rebellion is now clearly just a social sect
Or are you just upset because your own social clique has left?
Leave when you want, 'cause I know that someday I will, too
But I won't burn my bridges, be just another jaded fool
Sometimes every once in a while
Sometimes every once in a while
It's beautiful, I would say
I wouldn't have it any other way
If I said different, that would be a lie
If I said different, that would be a lie
Be a lie (Be a lie)
It's beautiful, I would say
I wouldn't have it any other way
If I said different, that would be a lie
If I said different, that would be a lie1Embed
