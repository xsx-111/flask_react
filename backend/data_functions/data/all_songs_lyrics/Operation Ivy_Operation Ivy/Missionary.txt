Missionary LyricsI start it, I end it
I kill and words'll defend it
Got big plans, blood-stained hands
Wanna put my name on the map
On my way to save the world
On my way to save the world
Got a brand new set of words, and the going rate is cheap
Unconditional devotion, unquestioning belief
Words carved in stone, chiseled in with sharpened bones
Of the ones who thought my righteousness was something to oppose
I start it, I end it
I kill and words'ill defend it
Got big plans, blood-stained hands
Wanna put my name on the map
On my way to save the world
On my way to save the world
Missionary
Can you see the flag rising up beyond the smoke
Of dying authors burning books?
There was a problem with what they wrote
The flag is hard to read
All flags start to look the same
When covered with the blood of the faithless and insane
I start it, I end it
I kill and words'll defend it
Got big plans, blood-stained hands
Wanna put my name on the map
On my way to save the world
On my way to save the world
(My world!)
My world
On my way to save the world
On my way to save the world
(Let's go!)
Man of many names, but the motives stay the same
My actions are the means to the end
My actions are the means to the end
On my way to save the world
On my way to save the world
On my way to save the world
On my way to save the worldEmbed
