Smiling LyricsSmiling
Friends
Watching you
At the party, at the bus stop, at the bar
You're looking at women 'cause your score is under par
When you find her, it doesn't mean anything
You wonder why your life is so boring
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
You would gladly waste it just to, just to save face
Her desire was your wish, and without it you are lost
Integrity is fragile, but you ignored the cost
Smiling when your friends are watching
Smiling when your friends are watching you
Smiling when your friends are watching
Smiling when your friends are watching you
One night stand, car keys in hand
You've fulfilled your gender's sexual demands
Are you feeling insecure and empty
When you're rushing to report to your peers?
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
You would gladly waste it just to, just to save face
Her desire was your wish, and without it you are lost
Integrity is fragile, but you ignored the cost
Smiling when your friends are watching
Smiling when your friends are watching you
Smiling when your friends are watching
Smiling when your friends are watching you

Smiling when your friends are watching
Smiling when your friends are watching you
Smiling when your friends are watching
Smiling when your friends are watching you
Smiling when your friends are watching
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Smiling when your friends are watching
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
