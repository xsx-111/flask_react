Freeze Up LyricsEmpty factories to the east and all our waste
The shape of things that came show on the broken worker's face
To the west you'll find a silicon promised land
Where machines replace our minds for systematic profit plans
Course of human progress staggers like a drunk
Its steps are quick and heavy, and its mind is slow and blunt
I look for optimism, but I just don't know
Its seeds are planted in a poison place where nothing grows
It's 1989, stand up and take a look around
Weather's bitter tension, it seems, is sinking down
Drunk with power and fighting one another
Every hour shows the winter getting harder
There's a freeze up
(There's a freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up
(Freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up
(There's a freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up coming
One nation stands the tallest radiating blinding light
Plastic and florescent energy robbing us of sight
Set in our way, content with our decay
We wave the flag of freedom as we conquer and invade
Ever ask yourself, "Where's my place in this hell?"
But no one's there to tell you, 'cause they don't know that themselves
Well-rehearsed lines from our elated politicians
No longer offer solace, we can see the self-destruction
It's 1989, stand up and take a look around
Weather's bitter tension, it seems, is sinking down
Drunk with power and fighting one another
Every hour shows the winter getting harder
There's a freeze up
(There's a freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up
(Freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up
(There's a freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up coming
(Let's go!)

Just one political song, just one political song
To drop into the list that stretches years and years long
Just one political song, just one political song
To drop into the list that stretches years and years long
Static and division is increasing like a storm
We are shelter
We are forewarned
Nothing can be changed except ourselves
Nothing can be changed except ourselves
There's a freeze up
There's a freeze up coming
There's a freeze up
There's a freeze up coming
There's a freeze up
(There's a freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up
(Freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up
(There's a freeze up coming)
There's a freeze up comingEmbed
