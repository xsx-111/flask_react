Bombshell Lyrics(She) She (she) she's a bombshell
(She) She (she) she's a bombshell
(Whoa)
Down in south Oakland, off East 14th it's raining (Oh yeah)
Six a.m. on Sunday, the bums are praying (Oh yeah)
Met her at a party, we were drunk, now we're sober (Oh yeah)
She said, "It's cold, got a long walk home, come over"
Oh yeah
She's a bombshell
She's a bombshell
She's a bombshell
I've retraced my steps a thousand times (Oh yeah)
Seems like I've spent hours asking all my friends about her (Oh yeah)
Been six months, I'll never be the same (Oh yeah)
Nobody, nobody, nobody remembers her name
Oh yeah
She's a bombshell
She's a bombshell
She's a bombshell
(Go!)

Oh yeah
She, she, she, she's a bombshell
She, she, she, she's a bombshell (Oh yeah)
She, she, she, she's a bombshell
She, she, she, she's a bombshell (Oh yeah)
She's a bombshell2Embed
