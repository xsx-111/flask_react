Healthy Body LyricsExpensive vitamin pills and wheat germ on your windowsill
Your schedule's hectic, and you've got no time to kill
Earning money and you're spending it the right way
Just in such a rush, you don't know if it's night or day
5:30, get up, run run run
Then you work eight hours slaving at the gun
Little world is based on lies, lies, lies
Always rushing but you're never, ever satisfied
Healthy body, sick mind
Working overtime
Healthy body, sick mind
Too hectic, too hectic
Healthy body, sick mind
Why don't you just unwind?
It's just a matter of time
Sick body, sick mind
The money you spend on running shoes could feed me for a week
Your plans are laid so well that you can't even sleep
Pursuit of happiness got your life locked under martial law
You got everything to lose, so you're paranoid about some fatal flaw
5:30, get up, run run run
Then you work eight hours slaving underneath the gun
Your little world is based on lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies-lies
Always rushing but you're never, ever satisfied
Healthy body, sick mind
Working overtime
Healthy body, sick mind
Too hectic, too hectic
Healthy body, sick mind
Why don't you just unwind?
It's just a matter of time
Sick body, sick mindEmbed
