Sound System LyricsSound system gonna bring me back up
Yeah, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
Try to describe it to the limit of my ability
It's there for a second, then it's giving up what it used to be
Contained in music, somehow more than just sound
This inspiration coming and twisting things around
'Cause you always know that it's gonna have to go
You always know that you'll be back in the cold
Point of departure sublimated in a song
It's always coming to give me that hope for just a second then it's gone
But sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up, yeah
Yeah, one thing that I can depend on
Static pulse inside of music bringing us escape
It's always temporary, changing nothing in its wake
Just a second where we're leaving all this shit behind
Just a second, but it's leaving just this in my mind
To resist despair, that second makes you see
To resist despair, 'cause you can't change everything
To resist despair, in this world is
What it is, what it is, what it is to be free
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Yeah, one thing that I can depend on
Hup, hup, hup, hup
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
(Sound system)
Pick it up
Sound system
Sound system
Wake up, turn my box on, bust the shade, let the sun in
Times are getting tougher, 'bout time to start running
Box in my hand, music by my side
Skankin' to the rhythm of the music by my side
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Yeah, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
Yeah
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Right, one thing that I can depend on
Sound system gonna bring me back up
Yeah, one thing that I can depend on
Sound (sound!) system (system!)
Sound (sound!) system (system!)1Embed
