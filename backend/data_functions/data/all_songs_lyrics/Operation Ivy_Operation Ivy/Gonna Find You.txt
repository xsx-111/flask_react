Gonna Find You Lyrics
Back in school, you ever get busted for trying to walk and have some administrator tell you, "Son, you can shirk your obligations and try to be different from your peers, but the responsibility of your future is gonna find you!"
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Well, I saw this kid get beaten down 'cause he was out of luck
In the lottery of acceptance in the school of growing up
Saw a bunch of convicts doing time inside a cage
Got locked in factories within the school of paid wage
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Saw this boy so strung out that his body sweats and shakes
From his field education in the school of cheap escape
Got told the school of human thinking teaches only truth
One of its educations is gonna find you
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Saw a civilization where grabbing onto wealth
Was the only guarantee of freedom, peace, and health
Dollar sign value system upheld as the truth
If you can't find a place, it's gonna find you
Saw the paranoid response to all of the examples
Of the ones who don't fit in this way of living getting trampled
Success is obedience to a structured way of life
Can't ignore the structure 'cause we're all within its sight
Gonna find you
Gonna find you
Gonna find you, ho ho ho
Gonna find youEmbed
