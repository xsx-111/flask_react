Artificial Life LyricsGot a song about some love that's gone away (Right!)
Sometimes his eyes shed tiny teardrops when he plays (Right!)
Touching feelings are just sitting there to buy
They call it music, but it seems more like a lie
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
Epic ballads by the musical whores (Right!)
Life is boring so project theirs onto yours (Right!)
Hear the anthems of the Pepsi generation
See the martyrs of our spiritual degradation
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
American culture
Disneyland freak show
Screen in your living room
A window for your tomb
If you can't compare to the world sitting there
Repress your insecurities
Watch and escape
Gimme artificial
Gimme superficial
Gimme a commercial life that can't be bought
This I say to you, what I say is true
Emotions aren't a product to sell or be consumed
Coming attraction, it's coming real soon
Prince is having brunch with Pat Boone
Wanna know where all the bullshit goes?
It goes down the sewer to be disposed
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
Artificial life in the market
Artificial life in the marketplace
Artificial life
Artificial life
