The Crowd LyricsWrenched into the world
Deanaesthetized
Blurry images fight their way through halfway-opened eyes
Awakened by alarm, fifteen minutes of hygiene
Twenty minutes of eating, thirty seconds to the door
Looked outside, looked into the eyes
Of the impersonal mob I've seen a thousand times before
Feelings under cover like books on a shelf
Scared of one another, must be scared of ourselves
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
We need a gathering instead
Drink, drink in the badlands
Liquid bread for the poor
Another member of the crowd goes down
To drown at the liquor store
Choose your escape in the heartlands of product and demand When you feel like a wasp in the swarm
Gotta get away any way that you can
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
We need a gathering instead

More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
More than just another crowd
We need a gathering insteadEmbed
