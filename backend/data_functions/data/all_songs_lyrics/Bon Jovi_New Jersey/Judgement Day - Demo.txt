Judgement Day - Demo Lyrics
You take and you take without giving
Like the ride is never going to end
You think you know who's going to heaven
Well I know I'm going to see you again
On Judgment Day
Others, they walk the bad road
If you do you better watch what you say
You think that you can hide in your shadow
But it's your shadow gonna ruin your way

On Judgment Day
You walk through the fire
Nowhere to run to and no one to blame
'Cause, hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgment Day

Some people they call me brother
Some people they say that they care
Some people they steal from the heavens above
It's gonna be a cross to bear
On Judgment Day
You walk through the fire
With nowhere to run to and no one to blame
Well, hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgment Day
Hey, Hey, Hey


It's just me and you
I don't wanna fade away
Let's face up to the truth
It's our own Judgment Day

On Judgment Day
You walk through the fire
Nowhere to run to and no one to blame
Well, hey, hey, hey
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay
On Judgment Day
On Judgment Day
On Judgment Day
On Judgment DayEmbed
