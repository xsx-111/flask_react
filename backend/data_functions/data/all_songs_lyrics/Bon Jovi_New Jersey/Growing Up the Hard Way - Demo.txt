Growing Up the Hard Way - Demo Lyrics
Growin' up the hard way
We're growin' up the hard way

She's got a blue tattoo on the back of her hand
That says I love you, from the boys in the band
She's been livin' on the run for almost a year
Her daddy would abuse her, she's been livin' in fear
She's got a diamond in her teeth and a leather beret
She knows every city street from New York to LA
Shes got little girl eyes
And her heart's made of stone
I guess you gotta grow up fast
When you're out on your own

Try, to hold your head up high
You live and then you die
Can someone tell me why?

Growin' up the hard way, learnin' how to live with the pain
The weight of the world on your shoulders
I guess that's just the price that you pay
Growin' up the hard way, it's gettin' harder every day
Lying in a bed made of fire
Praying to God for some rain
Growin' up the hard way
He was the pride and joy of his family
He always was the good boy they told him he'd be
But no one knew the anger that was buildin' up inside
He was drinking from the bottle
That his old man used to hide
He stole a rented car off route 35
And when he gunned it I heard him scream
'Straight to hell I'm gonna drive'
Cops came out of nowhere
And that truck got in his way
I'm sorry Mrs Johnson that it had to end this way

Try, to hold your head up high
You live and then you die
Can someone tell me why?

Growin' up the hard way, learning how to live with the pain
The weight of the world on your shoulders
I guess that's just the price that you pay
Growin' up the hard way, it's gettin' harder every day
Lying in a bed made of fire
Praying to God for some rain
Growin' up the hard way, Growin' up the hard way
Growin' up the hard way, Growin' up the hard way

Try, to hold your head up high
Growin' up the hard way, learning how to live with the pain
The weight of the world on your shoulders
I guess that's just the price that you pay
Growin' up the hard way, it's gettin' harder everyday
Lying in a bed made of fire
Praying to God for some rain

Growin' up the hard way, Growin' up the hard way
I'm growin' up the hard way
Growin' up the hard way baby
Growin' up the hard wayEmbed
