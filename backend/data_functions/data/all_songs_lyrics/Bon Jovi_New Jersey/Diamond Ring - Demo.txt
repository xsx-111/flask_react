Diamond Ring - Demo Lyrics
I bought a diamond ring, bought it just for you
Told you that you're mine, that no one else will do
Diamond ring, diamond ring
Darling, you're my everything
Diamond ring
I bought a red rose, brought it home to you
A blood red rose, tells you that I'm true
Red, red rose, blood red rose
Like a fire inside that grows, blood red rose

And when you're hungry, I will fill you up
When you're thirsty, drink out of my loving cup
When you're crying, I will be the tears for you
Look, there's nothing that I wouldn't do for you


And when you're hungry, I will fill you up
When you're thirsty, drink out of my loving cup
When you're crying, I will be the tears for you
'Cause there's nothing that I wouldn't do

Diamond ring, wear it on your hand
It's gonna tell the world, I'm your only man
Diamond ring, diamond ring
Darling, you're my everything, diamond ring
Diamond ring, oh, diamond ring
You're my queen and I'm your king, diamond ring
Now you've got me on your string, diamond ringEmbed
