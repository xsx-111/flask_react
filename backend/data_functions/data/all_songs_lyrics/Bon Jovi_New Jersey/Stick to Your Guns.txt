Stick to Your Guns Lyrics
So you wanna be a cowboy
Well, you know it's more than just a ride
Guess you gotta know the real thing
If you're gonna know the other side
Ain't nobody riding shotgun
In the world tonight
And when you spit, you better mean it
You better make 'em all believe it
If you're gonna be the one, woah-oh

Stick to your guns
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can pull the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to

So you wanna be the big time
Some people gonna drag you down
There's no living in the backseat (Backseat)
If you're gonna drive through town
And when you pray for independence
Boy, you better stand your ground
You gotta give it all you got now
Or you might get shot down
You fight hard until the battle is won, woah-oh
Stick to your guns
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, you know that I been through it
I got the scars to prove it
You fight hard and the battle is yours, woah-oh

Stick to your guns
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, baby
You can go for the trigger
But only if you have to
Aim from the heart
Some will love and some will curse you, baby
And you can go to war
But only if you have to
It's only if you have to
But stick to your guns, woah-oh-oh-oh
Stick to your guns, woah-oh-oh-oh
So you wanna be a cowboy
Well, you know it's more than just a ride
I guess you gotta know the real thing
If you're gonna know the other sideEmbed
