Full Moon High - Demo Lyrics
"Go ahead"
"One, two, three, four"

A penny for you thoughts now baby, tell me what you see
You know I wanna to play with you but this ain't hide and seek
With me
Can't you see?
I know your momma don't approve of what I'm thinkin' of
You gave me just a little piece but it just ain't enough
You say stop
I say go
I say yeah
You say no, no, no, no, no
I just can't wait
Cause I do stop much too late and only you can save me now

You know I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together
With the full moon high
We'll remember the night forever
It's just you and I
River of love and the full moon high
Oh, full moon high
Pretend I'm Valentino and you're the beauty queen
Pretend we're in some movie instead of faded jeans
You and me we're the same just believe there's so much more to see
Oh baby save me now

Oh, I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together with the full moon high
We'll remember the night forever, it's just you and I
River of love and the full moon high
Full moon high
Oh, full moon high


You know I've been to heaven and the other side
We can share our dreams together with the full moon high
We'll remember the night forever, it's just you and I
River of love and the full moon high
Oooh, full moon high
Full moon high
Baby you and I, full moon high
"Ok"Embed
