Love Hurts - Demo Lyrics
I go to work, beds aren't made
Honeymoon's over, bills aren't paid
What happened to us? Do we battle too much?
Man loves a woman, it's never enough
A love that won't bleed me of money and time
I run to the shelter of your arms tonight
We sit at the table at the end of the day
A couple of drinks, the pain goes away

I know we're both too tough to cry
No one knows the reasons why

Love hurts, hurts you inside
From the day that you're born to the day that you die
Love hurts, the hurt goes away
Hold on to your heart, we'll make it someday
Love hurts, love hurts

Weapons of love they'll sting and they'll burn ya
But you've got it beat yeah, if you play out your hand
Till death do us part to the end of the line
Cause words at the altar still burn in my mind
Just can't stand to see you cry
When no one knows those reasons why
Love hurts, hurts you inside
From the day that you're born to the day that you die
Love hurts, the hurt goes away
Hold on to your heart we'll make it someday
Love hurts, when it needs you
Love hurts, when it bleeds you
Love hurts, when it bleeds you
Love hurts


Sometimes we're so afraid to try
Well sometimes it's alright to cry

Love hurts, hurts you inside
From the day that tou're born to the day that you die
Love hurts, the hurt goes away
Hold on to your heart we'll make it someday
Love hurts, hurts you inside
From the day that you're born to the day that you die

When it needs you
When it bleeds you
When it bleeds you
When it wants youEmbed
