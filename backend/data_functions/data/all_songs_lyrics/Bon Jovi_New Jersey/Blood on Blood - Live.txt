Blood on Blood - Live Lyrics
I can still remember
When I was just a kid
When friends were friends forever
And what you said was what you did
Well, it was me and Danny and Bobby
We cut each other's hands
And held tight to a promise
Only brothers understand

But were so young (So young)
One for all and all for one (For one)
Just as sure as the river's gonna run

Blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standing
When all was said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be here for you
Until Kingdom come
Blood on blood
Well, Bobby was our hero
Because he had a fake ID
I got busted stealing cigarettes
And he took the rap for me
Danny knew this white trash girl
We each threw in a ten
She took us to this cheap motel
And turned us into men

We were so young (So young)
One for all and all for one (For one)
Just as sure as the river's gonna run

Blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standing
When all was said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be here for you
Until Kingdom come
Blood on blood

Now Bobby, he's an uptown lawyer
Danny, he's a medicine man
And me, I'm just the singer
In a long haired rock and roll band
Through the years and miles between us
It's been a long and lonely ride
But if I got that call in the dead of the night
I would be right by your side

Blood on blood
Blood on blood
Blood on blood
One on one
We'd still be standing
When all is said and done
Blood on blood
One on one
And I'll be here for you
Until Kingdom come
Blood on blood
