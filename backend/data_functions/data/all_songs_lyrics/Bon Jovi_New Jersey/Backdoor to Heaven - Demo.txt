Backdoor to Heaven - Demo Lyrics
Well, now we're alone
My heart's in your hands
I need someone to love
Can't I be your friend?
I feel your innocence, baby
Won't you give it to me tonight?
I need someone to save me
To keep me warm, because it's cold outside

Oh, won't you help me, baby?
Don't you hide now
Won't you take me, darlin'
For a ride now?
You've got me beggin' on my knees
You've gotta let me in, let me in, let me in

The backdoor to Heaven
Is in your arms tonight
You're my backdoor to Heaven
So, baby, let me in, let me in, let me in

You make it so hard
To open your door
I know you're an angel
Just never, never flown before
I'm in the dark, won't you give me some light now?
Come on and tell us, baby
What's wrong and right now
You've got me beggin' on my, on my knees
Oh, won't you let me in, let me in, let me in

The backdoor to Heaven
It's in your arms tonight
You're my backdoor to Heaven
Yeah, baby
Won't you let me in, let me in, let me in


Ohh, I'm just a sinner, but this ain't no sin
So let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in
The backdoor to Heaven
Is in your arms to Heaven
You're my backdoor to Heaven
You gotta let me in, let me in, let me in
The backdoor to Heaven
Yeah, baby, it's my time
You're my backdoor to Heaven
Let me in...Embed
