Rain LyricsWell I woke up one morning
Seen my baby fly away
Sugar don't go
She said I don't be treatin' her
Right by the things I say
Sugar don't go
I feel I'll be left alone
And I'll cry all alone
Oh in the rain
Early one morning
I packed her bags
She said she gotta leave me now
I've done her wrong
I said baby
I'm gonna change
Gonna change for the better
Sugar don't go
You can't be leaving me all alone
'Cause I'll cry all alone
In the rain
In the rain
Oh in the rain
In the rain
Sugar go
Sugar go you leave me alone
And I packed your bags
You've got your plane on the road
I said oh why'd you leave
Oh why'd you leave
You gotta leave me alone
I'm feeling sad
I'm feeling sad
You gotta back off
Baby you treat me
Baby you treat me
My life and I could take my mind I lose it
What I have
Is what I have
Is what I give to you
And I feel I'm gone
I've been crying
What you gonna do
Who you gonna see
Where you gonna pack your bags
And where you gonna stay
Say where you gonna go
Who you gonna ho'
Where you gonna lay your hat today
I said what you gotta change what you gonna do
Where you gonna lay your mines down
What you gonna do
What you gonna take
Where you gonna go baby
Who you gonna stay with me again
I said move it on
Oh won't you move it on
You gotta move it on
Hey, move it on
On down the line
Well down the line
On that line
I said pack your bags now baby
You gotta move it down the line
I said I wanna tell you
Say, what you gonna do
Who you gonna see
Where you gonna ho' your ass out all over town
Baby, where you gonna go
Who you gonna see
What you gonna do with your time
I said what you gonna do
Who you gonna take
Where you gonna lay your hat down
Where you gonna call your home
Where you gonna go
Who you gonna see
What you gonna do with your time
I said move it on
Oh won't you move it on
You gotta move it on
Hey, move it on
On down the line
On down the line
On that line
Said move it on down the line
Said move it down...
What you gonna do
Where you gonna stay
Who you gonna ho' your ass out
Baby, where you gonna lay your hat today
Said, what you gonna do
Who you gonna see
Where you gonna go and spend your time to be
Baby

Who you gonna see
Where you gonna go
When I set you free
I said move it on
Oh won't you move it on
