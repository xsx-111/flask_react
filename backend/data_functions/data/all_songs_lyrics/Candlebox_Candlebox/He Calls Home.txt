He Calls Home Lyrics
No, no, no, no
The trouble

Well I see him everyday in that blanket that he calls home
Wonder does he know that his family, they're left alone?
He says "Brother can you spare, can you spare a dime?"
I'm down to my last dollar, and this life of mine
Said this life of mine, gets rough at times
Now I wonder does he know, does he even care?
That his family they're safe at home, and they wonder where?
As he wanders through this life, he's ever searchin' for
A warm blanket on warm fields and he wanders on
And he wonders
Is he safe from the cold?

Safe out from the cold
(Mm-mm)

Well, see he left the other day, took his blanket that he called home
Did he go for good, or did he pass away? Yeah
Well I wonder does he know?
See I'm down to my last dollar, and this life of mine
Said this life of mine, it gets rough at times
Now I wonder does he know, does he even care?
That my family they're safe at home, and I wonder where?
As I wander through my life, I'm ever searchin' for
My warm blanket on warm fields, and I wander on
And I wonder
Will I always be helped along?
I said ayy, yeah, I'll never know, oh-oh
Because ayy, yeah, I'll never go, no-no
And yes ayy, yeah, I said I wonder why, yeah-yeah-yeah
Because oh-yeah, oh-no, I won't never come home
I'll never come home
Never come home
Won't you let me come home
'Cause I wanna come home, oh-oh
Oh, I said, but I gotta
Oh, yeah, I'll never know, no-no
And yes ayy, yeah, I'll never go, no-no-oh
And yes ayy, yeah, I said I wonder why, yeah-yeah-yeah
Because oh-yeah, oh-no, I'll won't never come home
I'll never come home
Never come home

Oh-woah, I want to come home
Won't you let me come home
'Cause I want to come home, oh-oh
Let me come home, come home
Woah, woahEmbed
