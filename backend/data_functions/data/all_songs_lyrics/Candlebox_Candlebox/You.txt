You LyricsYou
It's for you
Only you
It's for you
I'll never know, I'll never care, I'll never believe my people
I'll tell you what I say
I'll never lie, I'll never try, I'll never cry for you people
I'll push you, push away
As you lonely people
Keep on runnin' 'round my door
Yes, you lonely people
Keep on beggin', beg for more
And I'll cry for you, yes, I'll die for you
Pain in my heart it is real
And I'll tell you now how I feel inside
Feel in my heart, it's for you
It's for you
Only you
It's for you
I'll never try, I'll never die, I'll never push for you people
I'll tell you how I feel
I'll never lie, I'll never cry, I'll never try for you people
I'll tell you, yes, it's real
And you lonely people
Keep on passing time away
Yes, you lonely people
Keep on passing, pass away
And I'll cry for you, yes, I'll die for you
Pain in my heart it is real
And I'll tell you now how I feel inside
Feel in my heart it's for you
And I'll take everything as it comes my way
Pushin' your pain 'round my door
And I'll I cry for you as I die for you
Is this blood on my hands all for you?
You shiver and shudder recovers your mother
You feel it take control
All alone
Feel alive
In your soul
Come around town, steal another dime
Take another line, won't you feel it blanket your soul
Out of mind
Come around town, steal another dime
Do another crime, won't you get it higher and higher
All through time
Come around town, steal another dime
Don't you push your drugs in my face, yes, I feel it
Feeling fine
Don't you push your drugs in my face
Or I'm gonna put you in your place
Fuck you, I don't want it no more
And it's mine
Said this pain in my heart, it's all mine
Yes, it's mine
All alone
I don't want it no more
I don't want it no more
I don't want it no more
I don't want it no more
And it's mine
On my own
Yes, it's mine
All alone
As I cry for you, yes, I'll die for you
Pain in my heart, it is real
And I'll take everything as it comes my way
Feel in my heart it's for you
And I'll lie for you as I die for you
Pain in my heart, it is real
And I'll tell you now how I feel inside
Fuck you, it's for youEmbed
