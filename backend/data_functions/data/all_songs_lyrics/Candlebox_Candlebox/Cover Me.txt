Cover Me Lyrics
And cover me, yeah, when I walk alone
And cover me, yeah, when my stance it stumbles home
And cover me, yeah, we'll trip on through the sands of time
And cover me, 'cause I've been branded

I've lost my mind, yeah
Lost my mind, yeah
But you cover me, yeah
Won't you give me shelter from the storm?

And over me, yeah, fade into the night
And over me, yeah, melt into the light
And over me, yeah, you will fear the things I need
And over me, you will feel the hate I breed

You're under me, and you will question my authority
You're under me, and you elude almost everything, no
You're under me, you will feel the pain I wanna bring you
You're under me, you never change... never changed

A fuckin' thing
Not a... a fuckin' thing
But you... you cover me
And give me shelter from the storm
Cover me, cover me
Won't you
Cover me, cover me
Don't you
Cover me, cover me
Give me shelter from the storm
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
No, no, no

People push and shove on time, I give it to you
What I have is... what is mine, I feel it for you
You've got to cover me
You've got to cover me
People take and people steal, I have it for you
What I have is... what I fear, I fear it for you
You've got to cover me
'Cause I've been branded
A broken man
Broken man, yeah
But you cover me
Yeah, won't you give me
Shelter from the storm

Cover me, cover me
Won't you
Cover me, cover me
Don't you
Cover me, cover me
Give me shelter from the stormEmbed
