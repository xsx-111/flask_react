Arrow Lyrics
Still she don't have a name, she don't have a face
Never had much of anything
Yes, I see you and I fall from grace
She don't have the line, she don't have the time
Never had much of anything
Yes, I see you, I point too
You waste me, oh, you want me out my mind
Oh, no, yeah

Still she don't have a name, she don't have a face
Never had much of anything
Yes, I see you and I fall from grace
She don't have the line, she don't have the time
Never had much of anything
Yes, I see you, you point too
You waste me, oh, you want me out my bed, yeah
And I'm losing you again now

No, no, no, no
Feel you slip right down now
Something's on my mind, I can't find the time
Zooming arrow
Zooming arrow
Something's on my mind I wanna tell you
But that I can't find the time, I wanna feel it
Zooming arrow
Zooming arrow
If there's one thing you feel I should tell you before I go
I won't
If there's one thing you feel I should tell you, I'm moving along
Arrow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah


Arrow
Arrow, yeah
Yeah, yeah, now, now
Feel I'm losing you again now, now
No, no, no, no
Feel you slip right down now

Something's on my mind, I can't find the time
Zooming arrow
Zooming arrow
Something's on my mind I wanna tell you
But that I can't find the time, I wanna feel it
Zooming arrow
Zooming arrow
Oh-noEmbed
