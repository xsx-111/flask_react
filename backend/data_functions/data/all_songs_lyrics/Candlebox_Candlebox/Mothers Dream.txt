Mothers Dream Lyrics
I'm flipping through these pages
My memory seems jaded
A lot's been lost since my mother's dream
But these sudden flashing colors
Close my eyes, only seven full of life
Feel my heart, it's aching over
Feel my heart, it's aching over

And I, I remember being young
Seventeen, yes, you'd come to my house
Won't you tell me the things that I'd done to you this time
Never in my life did I feel so unsheltered
My mind, I feel you're nothing, good for nothing
As you told me, yes, you told me how hard I tried

These broken bones, what you say?
You carry me home, now, now, baby
My mother's dreams, she called it
My mother's dreams, she called it
These broken bones, what you say?
You carry me home, now, now, baby
My mother's dreams, she called it
My mother's dreams
Yes, my age has turned in my direction
Cold and lonely resurrection
Lies they told me, why I'm lost within your soul
But I've worn all those patches in my dreams
Always broken at the seams
Won't you help me, won't you help me
Oh no, angel

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

These broken bones, what you say?
You carry me home, now, now, baby
My mother's dreams, she called it
My mother's dreams

What you say?
What you say?
Now, now, now, now, baby
My mother's dreamsEmbed
