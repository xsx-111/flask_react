Telepath LyricsTesting
One, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, oops
Up and down, I think
(On repeat, give me a count)
The stuff that they know
The one on the right and then turn it up while I'm counting
One... (three), four, five, six, seven, eight
(It's too loud)
Well, this is quite close to me
Let's play it back and see what it sounds like
(Could I get the one voice?)
(Nervous? Don't be nervous)
One, two, three, four, five, six, sevenEmbed
