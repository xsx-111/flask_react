Soulreaper Lyrics
Wail - O desolate gale
Bring forth your bitter winds
Wail through heart and through soul
A poisoned kiss so deathly cold
Vanish grief and inner pain

Wail - O desolate gale
Through empires by blackened tears created
On the wings of a wind - The wind of a wraith
Whose scythe caresses in rage

Wind shall sweep the moonless sky
The reflection of a sulphur fire
Wind shall sweep the moonless sky
The reflection of a sulphur fire

Dismal gale - Malicious storm of fate
Brought forth to assail the creation
To bring souls to the wind
Beyond the veils of damnation
To the one without face or name
Woeful one of endless sight beyond the veil of time
Of grand darkness you are the keeper
My soul is black and black as night are the ways of thine
Wield the scythe of the Soulreaper

Caressed by the cutting wind
To voyage the oceans of oblivion
Fall into the hands of destiny
For a dawn there no more will be

Wail - O desolate gale
Through empires by blackened tears created
On the wings of a wind - The wind of a wraith
Whose scythe caresses in rage

Wail - O desolate gale
Bring forth your bitter winds
Wail through heart and through soul
A poisoned kiss so deathly cold
Vanish grief and inner pain

Woeful one of endless sight beyond the veil of time
Of grand darkness you are the keeper
My soul is black and black as night are the ways of thine
Wield the scythe of the Soulreaper
Wind shall sweep the moonless sky
The reflection of a sulphur fire

...and the wind swept through the moonless sky
The reflection of a sulphur fire...
...and the wind swept through the moonless sky
The reflection of a sulphur fire...Embed
