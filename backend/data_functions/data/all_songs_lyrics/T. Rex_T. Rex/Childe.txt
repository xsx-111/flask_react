Childe Lyrics
I want to give every childe
The chance to dance
I want to spread my feet
In the silver heat

I want to give every man
A kingdom fair
To hide inside
His golden hair

I want to give every face
A secret place
Where to take their tears
So there's no disgrace

I want to give every childe
The chance to danceEmbed
