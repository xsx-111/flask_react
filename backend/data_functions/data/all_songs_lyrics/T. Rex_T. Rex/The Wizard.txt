The Wizard Lyrics
Di-di-di-di-de-die, di-di-di-di-die
Di-di-di-di-de-die, di-di-di-di-die
Walking in the woods one day
I met a guy who said that he was magic (magic!)
Wonderful things he said, oh yeah
Pointed hat upon his head
Knew why people laughed and cried
Why they lived and why they di-di-di-di-de-die
Di-di-di-di-de-die, di-di-di-di-die
Shadows followed him around
He walked through the woods without a single sound
Di-di-di-di-de-die, di-di-di-di-de-die, di-di-di-di-die
Golden eagles at his door
Cats and bats played on the floor
Silver sunlight in his eyes
The wizard turned and melted in the sky
Walking in the woods one day
I met a man who said that he was magic (magic!)
Wonderful things he said, oh yeah
Pointed hat upon his head
Knew why people laughed and cried
Why they lived and why they di-di-di-di-de-die
Di-di-di-di-de-die, di-di-di-di-die
Shadows followed him around
He walked through the woods without a single sound
Golden eagles at his door
Cats and bats played on the floor
Silver sunlight in his eyes
The wizard turned and melted in the sky
