Suneye Lyrics
Love you
Oh girl I do love you

Come the sun, see it run across the sky
Cosmic eye is for you and no one else
Come the sun, see it run across the sky
See it cry for you and no one else

Love you
Oh girl I do love you
Come the sun, see it run across the sky
Cosmic eye is for you and no one else
 (repeat)
Come the sun, see it run across the sky
Cosmic eye is for you and no one else
Come the sun, see it run across the sky
Cosmic eye is for you and no one else

(How, how, how how)
Tree Wizard Puretongue, the digger of holes
(How, how, how how)
The Swan King, The Elf lord, the eater of souls
(How, how, how how)
Lithon The Black, the rider of stars
(How, how, how how)
Tyrannosaurus Rex, the eater of cars
(How, how, how how)Embed
