The Visit Lyrics
My eyes went up, it was sunrise
The sky turned black, it was noon
A ship of the silverest metal
Shadowed out all of the moon

Truly I do love you
Truly I do love you

A shape that was golden and crimson
Extend a claw to my frame
I sunk in the sand like an infant
I screamed but my tongue was lame

Truly I do love you
Truly I do love you

My heart on a platter they'd stolen
My eyes were all fiery flame
A sound like sweet dove, I stuttered
And then the ship swum the skies again
 2x
Truly I do love you
Truly I do love youEmbed
