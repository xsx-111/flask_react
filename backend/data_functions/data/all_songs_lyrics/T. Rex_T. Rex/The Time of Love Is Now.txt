The Time of Love Is Now Lyrics
Light up your face
With all the love within you
Say your word
Make it heard
Light up the wind
With all the kings inside you
Shout it out
Have no doubts

For the time of love is now

Light up your head
With things the children said child
Make a start
From your heart
Light up the world
With poems from within you
Shout it out
Have no doubts

For the time of love is now
And your days of love are always
In a dream, you know
And the time of love is now

Light up your face
With all the love within you
Say your word
Make it heard
Light up your head
With things the children said child
Shout it out
Have no doubts

For the time of love is now
And your days of love are always
In a dream, you know1Embed
