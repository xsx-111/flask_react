Jewel Lyrics
I've got a little babe
With jewels upon her lip
I've got a little babe
With jewels upon her lip
Her hair's like a river
It's fast and slowly drips

How, how
How, how

She bathes in thunder
The elves are under her
She bathes in thunder
The elves are under her
She walks the wind
And has a panther
With silver fur

How, how
How, how
Aw!
Her thoughts are gold
Her eyes electric blue
Her thoughts are gold
Her eyes electric blue
She sleeps upon the dreams
Of me and you

How, how
How, how
How, how...Embed
