Seagull Woman Lyrics
One day she came like a seagull woman
One day she came, one day she came
One day she came like a seagull woman

One, one, one, one day
(He-hey, one day, hey)

One day she came like a seagull woman
(One day she came, one day she came)
One day we changed from children into people
(One day we changed, one day we changed)
One day we changed from children into people

One, one, one, one day
He-hey, one day, hey
One day we changed from children into people
(One day we changed, one day we changed)

One day she went like a seagull woman
(One day she went, one day she went)
One day she went like a seagull woman
One, one, one, one day
He-hey, one day, hey
One day she went like a seagull woman, one dayEmbed
