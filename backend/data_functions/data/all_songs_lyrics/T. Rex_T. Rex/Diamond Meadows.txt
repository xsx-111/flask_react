Diamond Meadows Lyrics
If I could have grown
All upon my own
If I could have grown
I grew
If I could have grew
I do

If I had a throne
You could call it home
If I cry, my tears are yours
To open any frozen doors

Hey, let's do it like we're friends
Let's do it, do it
Hey, let's do it like we're friends
Hey, let's do it like we're friends
Let's do it, do it
Hey, let's do it like we're friends

If I could have grown
All upon my own
If I could have grown
I grew
If I could have grew
I do
If I could have grew
I do
If I had a throne
You could call it home
If I cry, my tears are yours
To open any frozen doors

Hey, let's do it like we're friends
Let's do it, do it
Hey, let's do it like we're friends
Hey, let's do it like we're friends
Let's do it, do it
Hey, let's do it like we're friends
If I doEmbed
