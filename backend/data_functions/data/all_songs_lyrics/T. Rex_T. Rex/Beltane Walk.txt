Beltane Walk Lyrics
Trucking down by the roadside
Met a man with a starhide
He said boy wouldn't you like to look
But could it

Give me love, give me little love
Give me little love from her heart
Give me love, give me little love from her heart
And then we'll walk

Bopping down by the whirlpool
I met a girl she was god's tool
I said girl wouldn't you like to rock
But could it

Give me love, give me little love
Give me little love from god's heart
Give me love, give me little love from god's heart
And then we'll walk

Walking down by the westwind
I met a boy he was my friend
I said boy we could sing it too
And we do, ooh
Give us love, give us little love
Give us little love from your hearts
Give us love, give us little love from your hearts
Give us love, give us little love
Give us little love from your hearts
Give us love, give us little love from your hearts, oh
Give us love, give us little love
Give us little love from your hearts
Give us love, give us little love from your hearts, oh
And then we'll walkEmbed
