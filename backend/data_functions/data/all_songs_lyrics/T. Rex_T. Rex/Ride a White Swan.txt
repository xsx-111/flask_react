Ride a White Swan Lyrics
Ride it all out like a bird in the skyways
Ride it all out like you were a bird
Fly it all out like an eagle in a sunbeam
Ride it all out like you were a bird

Wear a tall hat like the druid in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tattooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong

Catch a bright star and place it on your forehead
Say a few spells and baby, there you go
Take a black cat and sit it on your shoulder
And in the morning you'll know all you know, know

Wear a tall hat like the druid in the old days
Wear a tall hat and a tattooed gown
Ride a white swan like the people of the Beltane
Wear your hair long, babe, you can't go wrong1Embed
