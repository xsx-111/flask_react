Root of Star Lyrics
A root of star I gave to thee
From the canyons of the sea
A jewel of frost that was lost
In days of dreams when we were free
A shield of bronze a thousand gongs
That calls the queen of dreams to me
A mask of jade I shyly laid
To thy form of finery
 (repeat)
La la la ra lo la la

A shield of bronze a thousand gongs
That calls the queen of dreams to me
A mask of jade I shyly laid
To thy form of finery
A root of star I gave to thee
From the canyons of the sea
A jewel of frost that was lost
In days of dreams when we were free

A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star baby
A root of star babyEmbed
