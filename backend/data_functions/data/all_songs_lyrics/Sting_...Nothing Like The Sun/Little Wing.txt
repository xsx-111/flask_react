Little Wing Lyrics
Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairy tales
That's all she ever talks about
Riding with the wind

When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free

It's alright, she says
It's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything
Fly on, little wing

Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind
That's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
And fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind
When I'm sad she comes to me
With a thousand smiles
She gives to me free

It's alright, she says
It's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything
Fly on, little wing

Anything
Anything
AnythingEmbed
