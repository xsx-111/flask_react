Where Did the Night Go LyricsLong ago the clock washed midnight away
Bringing the dawn
Oh God, I must be dreaming
Time to get up again
And time to start up again
Pulling on my socks now
Where did the night go?
Should have been asleep
When I was sitting there, drinking beer
And trying to start another letter to you
Don't know how many times I didn't write again last night
Should've been asleep
When I turned the stack of records over and over
So I wouldn't be up by myself
Where did the night go?
Should go to sleep now
And say "Hell, fuck a job and money"
Because I spend it all on unlined paper and can't get past
"Dear baby, how are you?"
Brush my teeth and shave
Look outside, sky is dark
Think it may rain
Where did the...?
Where did the...?
Where did the...?
Where did the night go?
Oh God, I must be dreaming
Sky is dark, think it may rain
Sky is dark, oh God, I must be dreaming
Sky is dark, think it may rain
Sky is dark, oh God, I must be dreaming
Sky is dark, think it may rain
Sky is dark, oh God, I must be dreaming
Should've been asleep
When I turned the stack of records over and over
And over and over and over
And over and over and over
And over and over and over
Sky is dark, think it may rain
Sky is dark, oh God, I must be dreaming
Where did the night go?Embed
