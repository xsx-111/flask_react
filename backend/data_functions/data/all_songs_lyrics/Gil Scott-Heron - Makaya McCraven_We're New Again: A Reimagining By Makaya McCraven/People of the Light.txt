People of the Light Lyrics
Standing in the ruins of another black man's life
Or flying through the valley separating day and night
"I am death!" cried the vulture. "For the people of the light."
Charon brought his raft from the sea that sails on souls
And saw the scavenger departing, taking warm hearts to the cold
He knew the ghetto was a haven for the meanest creature ever known

Light of the people

In the wilderness of heartbreak and a desert of despair
Evil’s clarion of justice shrieks a cry of naked terror
Taking babies from their mamas
Leaving grief beyond compare


So if you see the vulture coming
Flying circles in your mind
Remember there is no escaping
For he will follow close behind
Only promise me a battle
Battle for your soul and mine
