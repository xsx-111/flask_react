New York is Killing Me Lyrics
Yeah, the doctors don't know, but New York was killing me
Bunch of doctors coming round, they don't know
That New York is killing me
Yeah, I need to go home and take it slow down in Jackson, Tennessee
Let me tell ya city living ain't all, it's cracked up to be
Fast city living it all, it's cracked up to be
Yes seem I need to go home
And slow down in Jackson, Tennessee

Yes I lay down, I lay down
The doctor try to take it all in
Yeah lay down, lay down
To try to take it all in
Yeah you got 8 million people
And I didn't have a single friend
Don't you know, don't you know
New York was killing me
Yes, I was standing nearly dying
And New York was killing me
Seems like I need to start over
And move back home to Jackson, Tennessee

Lord have mercy, mercy on me
Yeah, Lord have mercy, have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, mercy on me
Yeah, Lord have mercy, have mercy on me
Tell him to bury my body back home in Jackson, Tennessee
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
Yeah, Lord have mercy, have mercy on me
Yeah, I need to be back home, need to be back home
Need to be back home, need to be back home, yeah
Born in Chicago but I go home Tennessee
Yeah, I born in Chicago but I...
Down in TennesseeEmbed
