Me and the Devil Lyrics
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
And I say: "Hello Satan"
I believe, it's time to go

Me and the Devil
Walking side by side
Me and the Devil
Walking side by side

And I'm gonna see my woman
'Til I get satisfied
See, you don't see why
Like you're a dog me 'round
Say, I don't see why
People dogging me around
It must be that old evil spirit
Drop me down in your ground

Me and the Devil
Walking side by side
Me and the Devil
Walking side by side
And I'm gonna see my woman
'Til I get satisfied
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit
Can greyhound bus that rideEmbed
