Blessed Parents LyricsI was guided to get here
I believe that the spirits are your parents
And their parents and their parents and their parents
And they are in your bloodstream
And they run through your body constantly
Because they want you to live on
Because they want to live on
And they're trying all the time to tell you shit
And if you just spend a few minutes listening to yourself
You'd hear them
I was guided to get hereEmbed
