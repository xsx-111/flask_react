Lily Scott (Broken Home, Pt. 3) LyricsShe had more than the five senses
She knew more than books could teach
And raised everyone she touched just a little bit higher
And all around her, there was a natural sense
As though she sensed what the stars say, the birds say
What the wind and the clouds say
A sensual soul and self; that African sense
And she raised me like she raised four of her own
And I was hurt and scared and shocked
When Lily Scott left, suddenly one night
And they sent a limousine from heaven
To take her to God, if there is one
So I knew she had gone
And I came from a broken homeEmbed
