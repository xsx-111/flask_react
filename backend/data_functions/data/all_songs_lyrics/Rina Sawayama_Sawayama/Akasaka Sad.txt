Akasaka Sad Lyrics
ドアが閉まります

Hotel corridor
Blacked out rear window
Crawling under my skin
Flew here to escape
But I feel the same
Jetlag making me thin

Sucks to be me (Ayy)
Sucks to be so lonely
Egyptian sheets (Ayy)
Unraveling slowly
Don't look at me (Ayy)
Fragile, I bruise easily
You make me

Akasaka sad 'cause I'm a
Sucker, sucker, so I suffer
Akasaka Sawayama
Just like my mother
Akasaka sad 'cause I'm a
Sucker, sucker, so I suffer
Akasaka Sawayama
Just like my father
Akasaka sad, I guess I'll be sad
Akasaka sad, I guess I'll be sad
Forever and ever and ever
Wherever I go, forever

Akasaka sad

国々に　歩き渡り
鳴り響き　悲劇のシンフォニー
喜びに　変わる悲しみ
をさぐる毎日

Twenty-eight and I still want to scream (Rrah)
Can't face who I can and can't be
Five thousand, nine hundred thirty-eight miles between you
You make me

Akasaka sad 'cause I'm a
Sucker, sucker, so I suffer
Akasaka Sawayama (Sawayama)
Just like my mother
Akasaka sad 'cause I'm a
Sucker, sucker, so I suffer
Akasaka Sawayama
Just like my father
Akasaka sad (Woo), I guess I'll be sad
Akasaka sad, I guess I'll be sad
Forever and ever and ever
Wherever I go, forever
Akasaka sad (Ayy), I guess I'll be sad
Akasaka sad, I guess I'll be sad
Forever and ever and ever
Wherever I go, forever17Embed
