XS Lyrics
More

Hey, I want it all, don't have to choose
And when the heart wants what it wants, what can I do?
So I'll take that one, that one, yeah, that one too
Luxury and opulence

Cartiers and Tesla Xs
Calabasas, I deserve it
Call me crazy, call me selfish
I'm the baddest and I'm worth it

Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)
Oh me, oh my
I don't wanna hear (No, no), only want a (Yes, yes)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (XS, XS)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)
Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)
Oh me, oh my
I don't wanna hear (No, no), only want a (Yes, yes)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (XS, XS)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)
Flex, when all that's left is immaterial
And the price we paid is unbelievable
And I'm taking in as much as I can hold
Well, here are the things you'll never know

Make me less so I want more (More)
Bought a zip code at the mall
Call me crazy, call me selfish
Say I'm neither, would you believe her?

Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)
Oh me, oh my
I don't wanna hear (No, no), only want a (Yes, yes)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (XS, XS)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)

Oh me, oh my, where did it go awry?
When all this time, heaven was in our eyes
So, say goodnight, forget about it 'til the end of time
Yeah, I want more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more
Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)
Oh me, oh my
I don't wanna hear (No, no), only want a (Yes, yes)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (More), little bit of (Excess)
(I need it now)
Gimme just a little bit, little bit of (Give me just a little more)
Oh me, oh my
I don't wanna hear (No, no), only want a (Yes, yes) (I don't wanna hear no, woah)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit (Give me just a little more)
Oh me, oh my
Gimme just a little bit, little bit of (Give me just a little)

Bit more (XS, XS)
A little bit more (XS, XS)
A little bit more (XS, XS)
More, yeah, yeah29Embed
