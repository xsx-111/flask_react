Dynasty Lyrics
I'm losing myself
In the darkness of the world
Catch me before I fall
Saving myself
Is all I really know
Seen it being done before

I'm a dynasty
The pain in my vein is hereditary
Dynasty
Running in my bloodstream, my bloodstream
Dynasty
And if that's all that I'm gonna be
Won't you break the chain with me?

I'm a, I'm a, a, I'm a, I'm a, a
I'm a, I'm a, a, I'm a, I'm a, a, ooh
I'm a, I'm a, a, I'm a, I'm a, a
I'm a, I'm a, a

I'm gonna take the throne this time
All the words all mine, all mine
It's been way too long, too far
Too gone, to carry on
You can't hide it in the walls
Sweep it under marble floors
It's been living in our lives
Passed on down family lines
(Anything to carry down our)
Dynasty
The pain in my vein is hereditary
Dynasty
Running in my bloodstream, my bloodstream
Dynasty
And if that's all that I'm gonna be
Won't you break the chain with me?

Mother and father, you gave me life
I nearly gave it away for the sake of my sanity
(Hurting inside, no end in sight)
(Passing it down, am I losing this fight?)
Mother and father, I know you risked everything
Fighting about money and his infidelity
(Now it's my time to make things right)
And if I fail, then I am my dynasty

Dynasty
The pain in my vein is hereditary
Dynasty
Running in my bloodstream, my bloodstream
Dynasty
And if that's all that I'm gonna be
Won't you break the chain with me?10Embed
