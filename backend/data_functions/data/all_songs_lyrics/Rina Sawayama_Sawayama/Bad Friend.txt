Bad Friend Lyrics
We ran through the bright Tokyo lights, nothing to lose
Summer of 2012, burnt in my mind
Hot, crazy, and drunk, five in a room
Singing our hearts out to Carly, sweat in our eyes

Throwing drinks at each other
Making fun of our lovers
Getting kicked out on the street, oh
We were best friends forever, but the truth is

I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit, but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
I'm a bad friend, yeah

Guess we fell out, what was that all about?
Maybe I overreacted, well, maybe you shouldn't have...
God, it's insane how things can change like that
Don't even know where you are
What you do and who you do it with
Throwing drinks at each other
Making fun of our lovers
Getting kicked out on the street, oh
We were best friends forever, but the truth is

I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit, but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad

Put your hands up if you're not good at this stuff
Put your hands up if you're not good at this stuff
(Oh, I'm a bad friend, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Put your hands up if you're not good at this stuff
(Should we put the bridges back together?)
Maybe I'm a bad friend

I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit, but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything (Everything)
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad
I'm so good at crashing in
Making sparks and shit, but then
I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend
So don't ask me where I've been
Been avoiding everything
'Cause I'm a bad, I'm a bad, I'm a bad friend17Embed
