Love Me 4 Me Lyrics
Baby, I've been telling you
If you can't love yourself
How are you going to love somebody else?

Every day, I wanna start over
'Cause I remind me of me
At my worst, I let my mirror
Tell me lies, saying I

I gotta do right, be nice, smile just like a lady (Like a lady)
I gotta work hard, make up, hair done like a star (Like a star)
I gotta be that angel, good girl, soft and sexy (Woah, oh)
Well, I don't care, I don't care who you are (Who you are)

You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy

Every time I let you in (Every time)
My mind, you find remedies
But you can't fix me, you can't win
So goodbye, goodbye
I gotta do right, be nice, smile just like a lady (Like a lady)
I gotta work hard, make up, hair done like a star (Like a star)
I gotta be that angel, good girl, soft and sexy (Woah, oh)
Well, I don't care, I don't care who you are (Who you are)

You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy


If you can't love yourself
How are you going to love somebody else?

You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy
You wanna love me for me
If I made it, I made it easy (I know I got what you want, but)
You wanna love me for me (You wanted more than I got, love)
If I made it, I made it easy (This is a message for me)
You wanna love me for me (I can finally breathe)
If I made it, I made it easy14Embed
