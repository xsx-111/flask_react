Fuck This World (Interlude) LyricsSometimes, I can only see the bad side of life
At times, I let it consume my whole mind, oh, oh, oh
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Yeah, oh
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
You, you, you
Fuck this world, I'm leaving
Sick of what you people taking
From the bottom to feed the top
Fuck this world, it's dying
'Cause you people keep on lying
Power gets, power drips on down
That's why I'm covered in stars
Drawing a map with my scars
Gravity can't pull us apart
Let's start a new life on Mars
Forget it, let's get fucked up
Fuck this world, I'm leaving you
If I leave, then maybe I can start again
Do right on the wrongs and have a better chance
Then I look around and see that I'm alright
This is our mission impossible
May not be solvable
May not be viable
But it's worth trying
This is our mission impossible
May be unlovable
May be unstoppable
But it's worth trying7Embed
