Tokyo Love Hotel Lyrics
(Tokyo)
(Tokyo)
(Tokyo) People don't know what they're taking until it's gone

You got that something that everyone wants
You got that movie star glow
You got them askin' to have you on their skin
Even though they don't know

They don't know you like I know you, no, they don't
Use you for one night and then away they go
Thought I was original, but after all
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo (東京)

I don't wanna check into the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Everybody's staying at the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Tokyo
Tokyo
Tokyo
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo
I know there's nothing that I could say
That hasn't already been said
You got that neon lights, Golden Gai
Falling for a stereotype
Has it all gone to your head?

'Cause they don't know you like I know you, no they don't
Use you for one night and then away they go
All that love for you is simply just for show
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo (東京)

I don't wanna check into the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Everybody's staying at the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Tokyo (I just want your love)
Tokyo (All to myself)
Tokyo
I guess this is just another song 'bout Tokyo, ooh

If you've been through what I have
Then you know what is true love
Yes, I see, yeah, I see it now (Yeah, I see it now)
All the years figuring out
Spent my life shutting you out
Yes, I see, yeah, I see it now
Yeah, I see it now
I don't wanna check into the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself (All to myself)
Everybody's staying at the Tokyo Love Hotel
I just want your love all to myself
Tokyo
Tokyo

(Tokyo) Yeah, your fascination's my world
(Tokyo) Yeah, your fascination's my world
(Tokyo) Yeah, your fascination's my world
(Tokyo) Yeah, your fascination's my world
(Tokyo) Yeah, your fascination's my world
(Tokyo) Yeah, your fascination's my world
(Tokyo)
(Tokyo)
