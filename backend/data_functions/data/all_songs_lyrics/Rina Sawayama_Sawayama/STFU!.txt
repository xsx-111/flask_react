STFU! Lyrics
Let's go
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
I want to know, I want to know

Silence finally in my head
But it's too late, you already left
You're preaching even though I'm dead
Like the first time, I'm in my prime

How come you don't expect me
To get mad when I'm angry?
You've never seen it done
I know I'm not the only one (Uh)
How come you don't respect me?
Expecting fantasies to be my reality
Why don't you just sit down and

Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up (You)
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up (Uh huh, shh)
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up (You, I see you)
Shut the fuck up (Uh huh, shh)
Have you ever thought about taping your big mouth shut?
'Cause I have, many times, many times
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
I want to know, I want to know

Patience, overrated
If you want it, come and get it (Come and get it)
That feeling, eating at my chest
Rips me open (Rips me open), rips me open (Rips me open)

Not never naturally negative, no
I don't wanna be that girl again 'cause
I've been done and been through more friends
Than I can count on my fingertips

How come you don't detest me?
I am your medicine, and your reality
Why don't you just sit down and

Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up (You)
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up (Uh huh, shh)
Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up (You, I see you)
Shut the fuck up (Shh)
Have you ever thought about taping your big mouth shut?
'Cause I have, many times, many times
Have you ever thought about taping your big mouth shut?
'Cause I have, many times, many times
Like the first time (Like the first time)
Like the first time (Like the first time, yeah)
Like the first time (Like the first time, uh)
Like the first time (Like the first time, yeah)
Like the first time (Like the first time)
Like the first time (Like the first time, yeah)
Like the first time (Like the first time)
(Like the first time)

Yeah
Like the first time, it's
Like the first time, it's
Like the first time, it's
Like the first time is15Embed
