Snakeskin Lyrics
Looking for forgiveness
I ran into your madness
Shutting off my brain just to spite my
Heart
Heart
Ha-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

You're slithering, slithering, slithering into my heart, yeah
You're changing my, changing my, changing my, changing my mind, yeah
I'm shedding, I'm shedding, I'm shedding, I'm shedding my snakeskin
You're wearin' it, wearin' it, wearin' it every day, yeah

Buy my expensive, exclusive, pain wear
My fine couture is your branded repayment
I tear my soul into two so that you can
P-p-p-pretend despair

Like a snakeskin, l-l-l-like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin, l-l-l-like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin, like a snakeskin
Wear me out and tear me down like
Rip rip, rip rip, rip rip
I'll tear you down like
Strip strip, strip strip, strip strip
So run before I
Bit bit, bit bit, bit bit
And make you all
Addicted, addicted
Addicted to my snakeskin
Rip rip, rip rip, rip rip
I'll tear you down like
Strip strip, strip strip, strip strip
So run before I
Bit bit, bit bit, bit bit
And make you all
Addicted, addicted
Addicted to my snakeskin

Buy my expensive, exclusive, pain wear
My fine couture is your branded repayment
I tear my soul into two so that you can
P-p-p-pretend despair

Like a snakeskin, l-l-l-like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin, l-l-l-like a snakeskin
Like a snakeskin, like a snakeskin
Wear me out and tear me down like
