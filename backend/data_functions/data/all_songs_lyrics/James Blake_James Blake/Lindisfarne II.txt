Lindisfarne II Lyrics
Beacon don't fly too high
Beacon don't fly too high
Beacon don't fly too high

Cute but I'll take the bus
(Beacon don't fly too high)
With fees and favours gone
Cracks in savers pass
And a white that sometimes shone
(Beacon don't fly too high)
Wanton borrowed gun
Wanton borrowed gun
Wanton borrowed gun

Beacon don't fly too high
Beacon don't fly too high


Cute but I'll take the bus
With fees and favours gone
Cracks in savers pass
And a white (And a white) that sometimes shone
Beacon don't fly too high
Wanton borrowed gun
Wanton borrowed gun (Beacon don't fly too high)3Embed
