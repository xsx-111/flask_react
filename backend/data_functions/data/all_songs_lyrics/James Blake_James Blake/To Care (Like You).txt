To Care (Like You) LyricsNow no more
To watch two go
They don't know
(They don't know)
Well I wish I could have known
I wish I could have known
How easy it

Was to care like you
Protest too much?
Was to care like you
Protest too much?
Now no more
To watch two go
They don't know
And I wish I could have known
How easy it
How full on to watch you grow
Never alone
I can cope
How forlorn to watch you go
How full on to watch you grow
How forlorn to watch you go
How full on to watch you grow
How forlorn to watch you go
Was to care like you
Protest too much?
Was to care like you
Protest too much?
Now no more
To watch two go
They don't know
And I wish I could have known
How forlorn to watch you go
They don't know
And I wish I could have known4Embed
