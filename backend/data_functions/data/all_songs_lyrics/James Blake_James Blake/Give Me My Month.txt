Give Me My Month LyricsGive me my month as a lucky one
Let me see where she has gone
Let me see where she has gone
Let me see where she has gone
Help me back south with my changed love
I never told her where the fear comes from
I never told her where the fear comes from
I never told her where the fear comes from
Half way through nine, she won't have come
Or seen where I have been in the time we were undone
In the time we were undone
In the time we were undone2Embed
