Lindisfarne I Lyrics
Kestrels breed
Looking farther than I can see
Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me
Beacon don't fly too high
Beacon don't fly too high

For all your time
Playful crime in rain
Worth it being cold
Roofing for the lanes
A lesson lost again
A lesson lost again

Cute but I'll take the bus
With fees and favours gone
Cracks in savers pass
And a white that sometimes shone
Wanton borrowed gun
Wanton borrowed gun
Kestrels breed
Looking farther than I can see
Without tact to read
She'd take a shine to me
Beacon don't fly too high
Beacon don't fly too high5Embed
