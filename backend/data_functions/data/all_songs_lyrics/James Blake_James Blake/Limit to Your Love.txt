Limit to Your Love LyricsThere's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love
There's a limit to your care;
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare?
There's a limit to your care
There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love
There's a limit to your care
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare?
There's a limit to your care
There's a limit to your care
So carelessly there
There's a limit to your care
There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love7Embed
