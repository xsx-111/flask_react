Heartshine LyricsHey baby
Come on!
Hey Bruce, give me that sound
I said, waste away my tears
Baby, I can't cry no more
No less, my love
I said, my brother's drowning
Like a star, babe, like a slower suicide
Me, I gave mine away
I give to you my heartshine
Yes I do
I give to you my heartshine
Only for you
A sad hello to death
I'm a stubborn goat on trial
No more, no less
I said, time will tell
If love is gonna have the strength to push it
The strength to push it, my pain away, yeah, yeah, yeah
I give to you
I give to you my heartshine
I give to you my heartshine
I give to you my heartshine
I give to you my
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I give to you
I give to you my heartshine
I give to you my heartshine
I give to you my heartshine
My heartshine, baby
You got to listen to me, said
Love flourishes
Love flourishes
You've gotta value love supreme
Love flourishes
Love flourishes
You got to
You got to
You got toEmbed
