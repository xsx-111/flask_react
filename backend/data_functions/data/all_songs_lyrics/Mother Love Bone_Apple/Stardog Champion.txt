Stardog Champion Lyrics Oh....oh yes...yeah, yeah
San Francisco, where the flowers bloom in spring
I said, fade to winter
And see what disease brings
Augustino, with his eyes once a shining sea
I said he's half a shadow
God don't let that be me

I'm a Stardog Champion
West Virginia, that's where my father lies
He was a wartime hero
The kind that money buys
It's a diamond bracelet, for my mommy's memory
I said that's all she wrote, boy
That's all she wrote for me

I'm just a Stardog Champion (2x)
I'm a Stardog
That's right!
And the children
They used to sing of love
With the grace
From the Lord above
I said the children, they used to sing out loud
Sing it loud and proud
I'm a Stardog Champion (2x)
I'm a Stardog, baby
I ain't gonna let you down
The children sing...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ah (x8)Embed
