Stargazer LyricsCrazy, crazy, I'm the boy
Who defies all, yeah
Lift me higher, than anyone
And hold me arms, yeah
Woman, woman, she out of mind
And simply out of soul, ohh, yeah, yeah, yeah
She gets me higher than anyone
And I miss her so, so do it, I miss her so
Stargazer you call the shots and I take 'em
Stargazer won't you kick with me, ohh, please
Stargazer you call the shots, I take all
Stargazer won't you kick with me, ohh, baby please
Dancer, dancer, I'm all wrong
She thinks she's young and wise but no, no, no
She dance around my, my pretty little cable car
And fix me up with a guy, why?
C'mon, how dare you do this?
Why she done that to me, ever?
Why she done it to me? So I'm singing
Stargazer you call the shots and I take 'em
Stargazer won't you kick with me, please
Stargazer you call the shots and I take 'em
Stargazer won't you kick with me, ohh, baby please, tell you what?
Stargazer you cry in blue
Anything I've ever seen
It ain't as good as you child
I'm not trying to push your feelings
But I know you hold me like butter in your hands
Cry for me and rub it in
Cry for the savior and the prophet's son, yeah
Dream of me and Julie Ann, ohh, Xana come back again, yeah
Cry for me and rub it in
Cry for the savior and the prophet's son, yeah, ohh
Dream of me and Julie Ann, ohh, Xana come back again2Embed
