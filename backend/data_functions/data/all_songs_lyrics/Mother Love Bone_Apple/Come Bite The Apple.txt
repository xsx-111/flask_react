Come Bite The Apple LyricsI said, how did I get here?
What song did I sing, yeah?
And just what have I done
To deserve such a thing?
You say, "I've heard all that before"
So won't you give it up babe
And stop using me boy, hey hey
"I've heard all that before"
So bring me an apple
I'm cryin'
I been persecuted
Like a lying man
The spirit provides me
It'll sho 'nuff make my todays, yeah
The spirit it gives
But it also can take away, yeah, yeah
You say, "I've heard all that before"
So won't you give it up baby, baby, baby
Just stop using me boy! Ha ha!
"I've heard all that before"
So come bite the apple
I'm run down
Like Sodom to Gomorrah, all dead now
All dead now
All dead now
So please stop to laugh
And pity me
My soul means well
But I'm sorry
My skin it is withered
And I'm nervous, yes I am
My future was in my hands
'till I washed it all away
I washed it all away
Washed it all away
Said, get along, little sister
I heard you're doin' well
I heard you're doin' well
I said, get along, a-little sister
I heard ya doin' well, yeah, yeah
Said, get along, little sister
I heard you're doin' well
I heard you're doin' well
Get along, little sister
I heard you're doin' well
I heard you're doin' well
I said show me to ya
Send me to ya
Sing me song
Sing me a real real song, yeah
Sing me real song
Sing me real song
Come on, yeah
Come on, come
Sing that songEmbed
