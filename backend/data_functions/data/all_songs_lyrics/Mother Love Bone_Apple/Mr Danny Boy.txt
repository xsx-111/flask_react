Mr Danny Boy LyricsOh, ooh-ooh
Oh
Yeah

What can I take from you?
I said, what can I take from you?
What's worth a plug nickel from a silly fool?
What can I take from you?
Said, why did I leave you there?
Why did I leave you there?
With your long black kitty and your funky hair
Why did I leave you there? (Give it to me)

See Mr. Danny Boy?
Did you see Mr. Danny Boy?
He's a rock top boxer just a bundle of joy
You see Mr. Danny Boy?
Said, why did I leave you there?
Why did I leave you there?
With your long black kitty and your funky hair
I said, baby
Stop lovin' by the rules
Alright, come on, do it
I heard the rumors, Danny
So stop that talkin', Danny
I heard the rumors, Danny, Danny

Lost back in Santa Fé
I had love with a runaway
And to think my daddy thought I was gay
I said I lost back in Santa Fé
The riff-meister was my friend
The riff-meister is my friend
I love that motherfucker 'til the very end
Bolan was my man, baby

Stop lovin' by the rules
Ayy, come on, do it

I heard the rumors, Danny
So stop that talkin', Danny
Heard the rumors, Danny, Danny

It's a long, long road for this here desperado (Ooh)
And it's cold, cold, cold, my visions of tomorrow (Ooh)
So, when was the last time you wrote for me a song?
Said, baby
Stop lovin' by the rules
And don't wait for sorrow, don't play the fool
Don't play the fool, yeah

Danny, baby, Danny, baby
I'm talkin' to you, baby, Danny, baby
I'm talkin' to you, sweet little Danny, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I heard the rumors, Danny
So stop that talkin', Danny, yeah
'Cause of them, you could've told me, Danny, Danny, yeah

Danny
Come on now, she said, you my little Danny, baby
Come on now, she said, you my little Danny, baby
Danny, yeah, DannyEmbed
