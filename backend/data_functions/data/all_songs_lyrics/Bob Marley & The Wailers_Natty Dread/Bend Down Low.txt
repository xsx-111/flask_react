Bend Down Low Lyrics
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know now
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know
Oh! Fisherman row to reap what you sow now
Oh, tell you all I know (Oo-oh!)
You have got to let me go now (Oo-oh!)
And all you have got to do
(Bend down low) Oh yeah! Let me tell you what I know
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know, Oh yeah

You keep on knocking, but you can't come in
I get to understand you been living in sin
But if you love me, woman, walk right in
I have got a notch for your safety-pin
But bend down low

Keep on knocking, but you can't come in
I get to understand you been living in sin
But walk right in, woman, sit right down
I will keep on loving you, I play the clown
But bend down low, baby, let me tell you what I know
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know, yeah
Let me tell you, baby! Let me tell you
Knock on, babe! Just won't let you in
You been living in sin
