So Jah Seh Lyrics
So Jah seh
Not one of my seeds
Shall sit in the sidewalk
And beg bread
(No, they can't and you know that they won't!)

And verily, verily, I'm saying unto thee, I
Inite oneself and love Imanity
'Cause puss and dog they get together
What's wrong with loving one another
Puss and dog they get together
What's wrong with you my brother

So Jah seh
Ye are the sheep of my pasture
So verily, thou shall be very well
So Jah seh (yeah)
Ye are the sheep of my pasture
So verily, thou shall be very well, yeah

And down here in the ghetto
And down here we suffer
But I and I hang on in there
And I and I, I don't let go
I and I hang on in there
And I and I, I don't let go
For so Jah seh (yeah)
I'm gone to prepare a place
That where I am, thou shall abide, yeah
So Jah seh
Fear not for mighty dread
Because I will be there at your side

And down here in the ghetto
And down here we suffer
But I and I hang on in there
And I and I, I don't let go
I and I hang on in there
And I and I, I don't let go4Embed
