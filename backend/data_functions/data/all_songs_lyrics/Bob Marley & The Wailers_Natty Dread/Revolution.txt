Revolution Lyrics
Revelation reveals the truth, revelation
(revolution, revolution, revolution - ooo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(revolution - ooo-doo-doo-doo-doo)

It takes a revolution (revolution) to make a solution
(doo-doo-doo-doo)
Too much confusion (aaa-aaah), so much frustration, eh
I don't want to live in the park (live in the park)
Can't trust no shadows of the dark (shadows of the dark), yeah
So, my friend, I wish that you could see
Like a bird in the tree, the prisoners must be free, yeah (free)

Never make a politician (aaa-aaah) grant you a favour
(doo-doo-doo-doo)
They will always want (aaa-aaah) to control you forever, eh
(forever, forever)
So if a fire make it burn (make it burn, make it burn)
And if a blood make you run (make you run, run, run)
Rasta up on top (aaa-aaah), can't you see (doo-doo-doo-doo)
So you can't predict the flock, Eh-eh (doo-doo-doo-doo)

We got lightning (lightning), thunder (thunder)
Brimstone (brimstone) and fire, fire (fire, fire)
Lightning (lightning), thunder (thunder)
Brr-brimstone (brimstone) and fire, fire, fire, fire
(fire, fire)
Heâ€™ll come a paralyze all we call conception
(aaa-aaah, doo-doo-doo-doo)
Wipe them out of creation (creation), yeah! (creation)
Wa-Jah, Jah, Jah! Wa-Jah, Jah, Jah! (creation)
Wa-Jah, Jah, Jah! (creation)

Oh! Let eyes is eyes (eyes), in eyes is black (eyes)
In eyes is red (eyes), in eyes is dread
Let righteousness cover the earth
Like the water (aaa-aaah) cover the sea, yeah, yeah
Lightning (lightning), doo-doo-doo (thunder)
Doo-doo-doo (brimstone), doo-doo-doo (fire, fire)
A lightning (lightning), thunder (thunder)
Brimstone (brimstone) and fire1Embed
