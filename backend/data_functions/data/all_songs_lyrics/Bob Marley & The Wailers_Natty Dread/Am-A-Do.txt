Still ya bap a woman I got you on my mind
And I've get it with you again, now woman
And I've got to do it with you again, got to say

(Do it with your bad self) Are you tellin' me to do it
(Do it with your bad self) Thank you woman
Cause every man needs a woman
Every woman, every woman needs her man
Closer together they would be
Sharing a world so free
And though we're far apart

Every woman, needs her man, oh
Closer together they would be
Sharing a world so free
And though we're far apart
You're still in my
Still ya bap you're in the middle of my heart
And I've got to do it with you again
