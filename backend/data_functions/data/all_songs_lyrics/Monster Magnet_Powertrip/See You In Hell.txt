See You In Hell Lyrics
Our little room on 7th Street is getting cold
And secrets ain't like mescaline, they don't get old
I saw a pattern on a blanket just the other day
It looked just like the pillow you threw away, uh-huh
You were like a zombie when you told me what you did that day
And I drove out to the Meadowlands
To throw our baby away
Well, time and snow couldn't bury
Years of forgotten guilt
That little body's calling, rising up
From under a Jersey landfill

I just woke up the other night
And now I know what to do
I guess I'll see you in hell
Yeah

The creature's waitin' for a battle in the ancient swamp
You pissing on the pyramids
Ain't gonna move things along
So pack your scars and your makeup
And give your money to the poor
'Cause you've been riding a twenty gauged ticket
Into reality's door
I just woke up the other night
And now I know what to do
I just woke up the other night, girl
And now I know what to do
I guess I'll see you in hell

Our TV's gone and you've been huffing on paint
And your punk rock band still sucks anyway
I was talking to Jesus through a hole in the floor
He said our time is up, we can't stay anymore, no more
No more

Our little room on 7th Street is getting cold
And secrets ain't like mescaline, they don't get old
I saw a pattern on a blanket just the other day
It looked just like the pillow you threw away

I just woke up the other night
And now I know what to do
I just woke up the other night, girl
And now I know what to do
I guess I'll see you in hell
Yeah, I'll see you in hell
I'll see you in hell
Yeah, I'll see you in hellEmbed
