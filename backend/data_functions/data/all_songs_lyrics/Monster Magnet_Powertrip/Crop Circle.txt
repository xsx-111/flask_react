Crop Circle LyricsCome on...
I was born underwater, I dried out in the sun
I started humping volcano's baby when I was too young
I started surfing the madhouse, and I decided to stay
I got an itch in my cosmic pocket and it won't go away
Instead of dragging your swamp for your lost love
Come to me I'm your living crop circle...yeah
Like a lamb to the slaughter, like a peach in the sun
I'll curl you up in my flame pit baby until your way over done
I came up from the ground, I came down from the sky
And I'm grabbing her knees like a worm with a mission
Cause I'm made out of salt and I'm made out of coal
And I live like a king in a show mercial
Instead of 'make you a man'; 'make you a monkey'
Throw your head in the living crop circle
Let me tell you about it
Let me tell you about it...come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I'm your living crop circleEmbed
