Atomic Clock LyricsThe moon crashed into the desert
It gave me my brand new home
These souls come to feed in my crater
I eat 'em as fast as they come
I dig your love and affection
I dig your voice on the phone
So pour some coins in my crater
I spend 'em as fast as they come
A greased up atomic pavillion
A great way to swallow my time
But I do think I need a stronger witness
To watch me blow my mind
You ain't digging on my questions
And I know I ain't digging on your lies
Keep on selling me my future
And I'll keep on wearing my disguise
Bullshit may last forever
But my fuse gets shorter every day
I'll be glad to take your money
But gladder to burn it all away
So won't you put my dick in plastic
And put my brain in a jar
If there's something left of my spirit
It'll find you where you are
Still so goddamn hungry
I'm feeding off my own bones
So lay me out in my crater
And nuke me 'til I glowEmbed
