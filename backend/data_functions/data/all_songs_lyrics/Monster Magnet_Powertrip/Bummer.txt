Bummer Lyrics
You're looking for the one who fucked your mom
It's not me
It's not me
You're looking for the one who made you cry
That's not me
It's not me

If you wanna stuff your garbage in that hole
Oh, baby, I'm your man of the hour, yeah, yeah

You think the world's got the evil eye on you
That's not true
That's not true
The only one I see causing major pain
Is just you
It's just you

If you wanna spank your demons and make them pay
Then, baby, I'm your man of the hour, yeah
Some people go to bed with Lucifer
Then they cry when they don't greet the day with God
I know life's a bummer, baby
But that's got precious little to do with me
You think you've found the one most like yourself
And that's me
Yeah, that's me
You're sure we've known each other all our lives
That could be
That could be

If you wanna spank your demons and make them pay
Then, baby, I'm your man of the hour, yeah, yeah
Some people go to bed with Lucifer
Then they cry, cry, cry when they don't greet the day with God
I know life's a bummer, baby
But that's got precious little to do with me
I know life's a bummer, baby
But that's got nothing at all
To do with me

I needed a small vacation
So they put me on a train
They called it "rehabilitation"
Oh, but here I am again
It's against my second nature
Not to chase you down that hole
I need a fistful of medication
Just to keep it in my pants
Ain't nothing like it
You're looking for the one who fucked your mom
It's not me
It's not me
You're looking for the one who made you cry
It's not me
That's not me

If you wanna spank your demons and make them pay
Then, baby, I'm your man of the hour, yeah
Some people go to bed with Lucifer
Then they cry, cry, cry when they don't greet the day with God
I know life's a bummer, baby
But that's got precious little to do with me
I know life's a bummer, baby
But that's got damn nothing at all
To do with meEmbed
