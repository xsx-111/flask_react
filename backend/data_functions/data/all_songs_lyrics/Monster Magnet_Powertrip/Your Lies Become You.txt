Your Lies Become You LyricsHow did I get here without you?
It's a miracle we're all sane
We're kinda like sucked in a vacuum
Or booking a flight on a doomed plane
Well you claimed you could read the future
And I'd say that you've nailed that down
You still want everyone to love you
Well here's a tip of my hat to your big brain
Do you really believe they can't see through
A circus punk playing a foul game?
Let me cast you in light that is natural
And with me you can strike that pose yeah
And you melt for the camera
'Cause your lies become you
Yes, your lies become you
Yes, your lies become you after all
How am I living without you?
Mmm I'm not even sure now that I'm sane
But this little dog's got enough sense
To know not to sleep in the cold rain
Yeah yeah yeah
How are you doing without me?
I'm sure you've found some new game
I never wanted to miss you
But then I never thought I could take pain
Hope it's warmer for you, princess
I in fact hope it's hot as hell
And you get what you asked for
'Cause your lies become you
Yes, your lies become you
Yes, your lies become you after allEmbed
