Tractor Lyrics
Well, my buddy Joe gave me a laughing pill
Well, it tasted like shit and it gave me the chills
I saw his girlfriend's face in a bucket of water
He said a buck for the snatch and a nipple's a quarter, yeah, yeah

Well, I'm telling you freaks, I've got eyes in the back of my head
And I can hear you laughing at me when I'm lying in bed
You better be righteous when you're cuttin' me up
'Cause you be doing me light and I'll be fucking you up

I had a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back, got a hole in my arm
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back, got a hole in my arm
I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm, get down

I got a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back, got a hole in my arm
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a nail in my head and I know that I'm gone
When I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm
Got a knife in my back, got a hole in my arm
I'm driving the tractor on the drug farm, alrightEmbed
