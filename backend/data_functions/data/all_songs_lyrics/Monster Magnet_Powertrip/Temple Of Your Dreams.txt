Temple Of Your Dreams Lyrics
Wake up, baby, 'cause I'm coming to you from the future
Now don't be surprised when I'm sittin' at the foot of your bed
I bring you a light you could never see in the daytime
Planting the seed of my perfume in your head

Well, I've wasted enough of my time on the edge of forever
And I've paid all the goddamn dues that I wanna pay

Never let them hear you beg
Never let them know
Your pillow nest of a dripping gods is a place you go alone
But late at night I hear you cry
Your taste for dirt just makes me smile
My purple tablet turns to goo
Have I got something warm for you

Well, I've wasted enough of my time on the edge of forever
And I've paid all the goddamn dues that I wanna pay, yeah
If I can't slip into the thirteenth house of your twilight, baby, yeah
I'll plant a bomb in the temple of your dreams
I'll plant a bomb in the temple of your dreams, yeah
Wake up, baby, 'cause I'm coming to you from the future
And don't be surprised when I'm floatin' above your bed
I bring you a god you could never love in the daytime
Nailing the seed of my perfume in your head

Well, I've wasted enough of my time on the edge of forever
And I've paid all the goddamn dues that I wanna pay, yeah
If I can't slip into the thirteenth house of your twilight, baby, yeah
I'll plant a bomb in the temple of your dreams
I'll plant a bomb in the temple of your dreams, yeah
