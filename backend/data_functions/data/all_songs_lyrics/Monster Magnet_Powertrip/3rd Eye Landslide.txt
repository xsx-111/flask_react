3rd Eye Landslide LyricsCome on, Baby, skim the top with me
I'll tell you stories 'bout victory
I used to be a dreamer just like you
And then my pocket told me what to do
All things are looking good from where I sit
Or in the United States of who gives a shit
Sucking love from wherever I can
Cashing Satan's checks with my dick in my hand
Talkin' 'bout a free ride
Talkin' 'bout a landslide
You're wanted on the 3rd eye, Baby
I'm talkin' 'bout a landslide
Now I'm living on top of it
Sweet little slice, I'll give you what you need
Just give your card and your soul to me
Talkin' 'bout a free ride
Talkin' 'bout a landslide
You're wanted on the 3rd eye, Baby
I'm talkin' 'bout a landslide
Now I'm living on top of it2Embed
