Space Lord (Intergalactic 7 Remix) LyricsSpace Lord, motherfucker...
I been stuffed in your pocket
For the last hundred days
When I don't get my bath
I take it out on the slaves
So grease up your baby
For the ball on the hill
I'm polish them rockets now
And swallow those pills
And say oh...
Space Lord, motherfucker
There's a car in the field
Now in a column of flame
With two doors to choose
But only one bears your name
You been drinkin' my blood
Well I been lickin' your wounds
Well I'll shave off the pitch now
And the scope of your tune
You'll sing oh...
Space Lord, motherfucker
I left my throne
A million miles away
I drink from your tit
I sing the blues every day
Now give me the strength
To split the world in two yeah
I ate all the rest
And now I've gotta eat you
Well I say
Milkin' my nightmares
And usin' my name
You're strokin' my cortex
When you know I'm insane
I'm squeezed out in hump-drive
And I'm drownin' in love
Encompass immortal
Position above
And sing oh...
Space Lord, motherfucker
I left my throne
A million miles away
I drink from your tit
I sing the blues every day
Now give me the strength
To split the world in two yeah
I ate all the rest
And now I've gotta eat you
Well I say
I lost my soul when I fell to earth
My planets call me to the void of my birth
The time has come for me to kill this game
Now open wide and say my name
Space Lord, motherfucker
Space Lord, motherfucker
Space Lord, motherfucker
Space Lord, motherfucker
Space Lord, motherfucker (fading out)Embed
