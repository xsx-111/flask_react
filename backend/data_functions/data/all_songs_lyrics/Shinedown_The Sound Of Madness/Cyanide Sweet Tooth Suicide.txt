Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide Lyrics
She’s a steel thriller suicide they say
Cyanide in her plastic veins
She’s a mannequin of misery
She’s on a bender, but she ain’t gonna break, hey, hey!
Tastes like sugar but it’s Novocaine
She’s grinding teeth so she can sharpen the pain

White!
Light!
Train!
Wreck!

Black lips, pale eyes
Cyanide sweet tooth suicide
She’s a killer, she’s my
Cyanide sweet tooth suicide

Strychnine cerebellum feeds the brain
Hurricane in a violent rage, they say
She’s a looker just like Anna Nicole, oh no
Fuck the silver, let’s go straight for the gold, hey, hey!
Digging deeper than a six-foot hole
She’s snorting cocaine through a suicide note
White!
Light!
Train!
Wreck!

Black lips, pale eyes
Cyanide sweet tooth suicide
She’s a killer, she’s my
Cyanide sweet tooth suicide

White!
Light!
Train!
Wreck!

Black lips, pale eyes
Cyanide sweet tooth suicide
She’s a killer, my my
Cyanide sweet tooth suicide

Black lips (black lips), pale eyes (pale eyes)
Cyanide sweet tooth suicide
She’s a zero point five
Had a cyanide sweet tooth suicide1Embed
