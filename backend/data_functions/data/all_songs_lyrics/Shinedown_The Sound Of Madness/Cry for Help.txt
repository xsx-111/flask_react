Cry for Help Lyrics
You've been hiding out for quite a while now
Living off of people you know
Trying to raise a little money to pay off all the monkeys
That you met inside the rabbit hole
You're taking candy from the white witch
You're smoking tea with Mama Kin
Well, there's a wolf outside a brick house screaming
"This time I'm gonna blow it in!"

Because the mind is a weapon, see
And it's got you on your hands and knees
Pull the trigger if you gotta
We all know that you wanna
Count off 1, 2... 1, 2, 3!

You'd better pray that there's another way out
You'd better pray that someone's listening now
(And doesn't wanna watch you drown)
'Cause when you lie like the devil himself
No angel's gonna hear your cry for help!

I know you must really think it's funny
You had everybody fooled in the end
But it's a little unassuming, considering how you knew me
I'm the only one that called you a friend
Because the mind is a weapon, see
But you're not gonna use it on me
Pull the trigger if you gotta
We all know that you wanna
Count off 1, 2... 1, 2, 3!

You'd better pray that there's another way out
You'd better pray that someone's listening now
(And doesn't wanna watch you drown)
'Cause when you lie like the devil himself
No angel's gonna hear your cry for help!
Count off 1, 2, 1, 2, 3!!!

You'd better pray that there's another way out
You'd better pray that someone's listening now
(And doesn't wanna watch you drown)
'Cause when you lie like the devil himself
No angel's gonna hear your cry for help!

For help
