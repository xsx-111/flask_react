Breaking Inside Lyrics
I caught a chill
And it's still frozen on my skin
I think about why I'm alone
By myself, no one else to explain
How far do I go, no one knows
If the end is so much better, why don't we just live forever?

Don't tell me I'm the last one in line
Don't tell me I'm too late this time

I don't want to live, to waste another day
Underneath the shadow of mistakes I've made
'Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside
I don't want to fall, and say I lost it all
'Cause baby there's a part of me that hit the wall
Leaving pieces of me behind
And I feel like I'm breaking inside

Out here, nothing's clear
Except the moment I decided to move on and I ignited
Disappear into the fear
You know there ain't no comin' back when you're still carrying the past
You can't erase (can't erase), separate (separate)
Cigarette in my hand, hope you all understand
I won't be the last one in line
I finally figured out what's mine

I don't want to live, to waste another day
Underneath the shadow of mistakes I've made
'Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside
I don't want to fall, and say I lost it all
'Cause baby there's a part of me that hit the wall
Leaving pieces of me behind
Leaving pieces of me behind
And I feel like I'm breaking inside

I won't be the last one in line
I finally figured out what's mine

I don't want to live, to waste another day
Underneath the shadow of mistakes I've made
'Cause I feel like I'm breaking inside
I don't want to fall, and say I lost it all
'Cause baby there's a part of me that hit the wall
Leavin' pieces of me behind (Leavin' pieces of me behind)
Leavin' pieces of me behind (Leavin' pieces of me behind)
And I feel like I'm breaking inside
And I feel like I'm breaking
And I feel like I'm breaking inside7Embed
