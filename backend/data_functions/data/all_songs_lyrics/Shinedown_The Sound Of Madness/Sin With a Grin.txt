Sin With a Grin Lyrics
Take a good look at agony
Force fed passed down, time release
I'm inspired to find the liar
Blackless 'X' on the back of a soulful man
I've got ways you understand
Look left, look right, but I'm behind you

I never noticed, until I focused
On everything you did, you said
You lit the fuse inside my head

Thank you for reminding me
Of why I am sick inside
Thank you for the venom
Did you think it would paralyze?
These scars I scratch, I tear are there
Under my skin
Where you've always been
Thank you for reminding me to sin with a grin

Hangman standing on a twisted 2 by 4
Built your house, but forgot to lock the door
I'm inside with two black eyes
I have not one shred of sympathy
I have no use for apologies
I'm inspired to find the liar
I never noticed, until I focused
On everything you did, you said
You lit the fuse inside my head

Thank you for reminding me
Of why I am sick inside
Thank you for the venom
Did you think it would paralyze?
These scars I scratch, I tear are there
Under my skin
Where you've always been
Thank you for reminding me to sin with a grin

Thank you for reminding me
Of why I am sick inside
Thank you for the venom
Did you think it would paralyze?
These scars I scratch, I tear are there
Under my skin
Where you've always been

Thank you for reminding me
Of why I am sick inside
Thank you for the venom
Did you think it would paralyze?
These scars I scratch, I tear are there
Under my skin
Where you've always been
Thank you for reminding me to sin with a grin
Sin with a grin
Sin with a grin
