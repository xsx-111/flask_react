What a Shame Lyrics
Two packs of cigarettes a day
The strongest whiskey Kentucky can make
That's a recipe
To put a vagabond on his hands and knees
I watched it all up close, I knew him more than most
I saw a side of him he never showed
Full of sympathy
For a world that wouldn't let him be

That's the man he was
Have you heard enough?

What a shame, what a shame
To judge a life that you can't change
The choir sings, the church bells ring
So, won't you give this man his wings?
What a shame
To have to beg you to see
We're not all the same
What a shame

There's a hard life for every silver spoon
There's a touch of grey for every shade of blue
That's the way that I see life
If there was nothin' wrong, then there'd be nothin' right
And for this workin' man they say could barely stand
There's gotta be a better place to land
Some kind of remedy
For a world that wouldn't let him be
That's the man he was
Have you heard enough?

What a shame, what a shame
To judge a life that you can't change
The choir sings, the church bells ring
So, won't you give this man his wings?
What a shame
To have to beg you to see
We're not all the same
What a shame

God forgive the hands that laid you down
They never knew how
Much a broken heart can break the sound
And change the seasons
Now the leaves are fallin' faster
Happily ever after
You gave me hope through your endeavors
And now you will live forever

What a shame, what a shame
To judge a life that you can't change
The choir sings, the church bells ring
So, won't you give this man his wings?
What a shame
To have to beg you to see
We're not all the same
What a shame, what a shame
'Cause we're not all the same
What a shame, what a shame
'Cause we're not all the same1Embed
