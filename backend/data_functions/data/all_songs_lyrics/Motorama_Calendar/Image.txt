Image Lyrics
You have a soul
It's permanently weak
You have a whip
And it's lying on your window sill

While I have no thoughts
You have clear image of our love
Clear image of our love

You always have a stone
For the window in my heart
Two scars on your back
Two flowers in your hand

While I have no thoughts
You have clear image of our love
One clear image of our love1Embed
