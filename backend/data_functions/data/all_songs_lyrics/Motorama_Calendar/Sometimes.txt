Sometimes Lyrics
With your tear-stained eyes
You see clearly things that were so nice
Here is truth, here is lie
And after all you simply want to cry

Sometimes I want to count your tears

So we met on the stairs
Such a bad sign, but now who cares
And only lantern light
And the smell of lilies in the darkest night

Sometimes I want to count your tears

You are on fire
When I'm shrouded in snowEmbed
