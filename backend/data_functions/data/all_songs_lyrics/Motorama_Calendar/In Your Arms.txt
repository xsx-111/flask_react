In Your Arms Lyrics
Is it you? Is it you?
You were born in the night
Silent goddess of the night
It took so long
It took so long
No shadow no light
For the silent goddess of the night

Sickness isn't gone
It can't be over
Woe and pain
Your twin daughters

City is sleeping tight
So I have the time to hide away
But I don't want to, I don't want to
Take me in your arms todayEmbed
