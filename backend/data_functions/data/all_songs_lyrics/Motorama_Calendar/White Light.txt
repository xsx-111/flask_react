White Light Lyrics
So many things she tried to forget
So many things he tried to save
Inside of my head I feel cool breeze
Good beginning for the storm

You are searching new lover
When I'm lying beside

It's so divine when clouds are getting grey, oh boy
You see the light from evening sky
Is it a cure or a lousy disease?
So hold on tight, hold on tight

Snowstorm outside, you'd better keep
Warm thoughts for this cold time of year
Something has changed, something has changed
You know, you know it's hard to fight

You are searching new lover
When I'm lying beside
White light is rushing to my blood
White light is rushing straight into my heart
It's so divine when clouds are getting grey, oh boy
You see the light from evening sky
Is it a cure or a lousy disease?
So hold on tight, tight, tight
It's so divine when clouds are getting grey, oh boy
You see the light from evening sky
Is it a cure or a lousy disease?
So hold on tight, hold on tightEmbed
