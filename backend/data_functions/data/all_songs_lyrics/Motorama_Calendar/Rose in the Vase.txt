Rose in the Vase Lyrics
Several years
Away from each other
Away from each other
Several years
From highlands and oceans
To lowlands and rivers

Therefore, the pain won't stop

I spend my days sitting
In front of the fireplace
You spend your days dying
Like a rose in the vase

New day comes
Days go by

I spend my days sitting
In front of the fireplace
You spend your days dying
Like a rose in the vaseEmbed
