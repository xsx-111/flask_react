To the South Lyrics
Look outside
You see how winter is leaving our town
We were spending time together in the country house
Spending time together in the country house
Enjoying the snow

You will drive to the south
I will stay alone
Just look at yourself
You've become someone else

You will laugh but I feel someone
She's touching my hair when I'm sleeping
She's kissing my forehead when I'm lying with you

You will drive secretly
To the south
I look at myself
Did I turn into someone else?1Embed
