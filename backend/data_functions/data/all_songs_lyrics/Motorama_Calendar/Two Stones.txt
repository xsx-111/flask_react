Two Stones Lyrics
Picture on the wall, on the wall, ta-da-da-da-da
Young boy near the pond, near the pond
It's you, ta-da-da-da-da

Press your knife into my arm
And you will see the glow
Hold your breath and dive with me
Just like two little stones underwater

Everything was said
Do you remember that night?
Everything was done
Yes I remember that night

Press your knife into my arm
And you will see the glow
Hold your breath and dive with me
Just like two little stones underwater
It sounds like two little stones hit underwaterEmbed
