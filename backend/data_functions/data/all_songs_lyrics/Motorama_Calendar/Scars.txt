Scars Lyrics
You took his hand and said:
"Run as fast as you can
Together we will grow the wings"
Let him look back, he lost something there
Let him look back, he lost someone there

Morning spares the wounded sky
He asked you to, but you don't even try

Heal those scars
Scars that no one can heal
One by one they'll disappear
Tiny soul, drowned in melancholy
In pieces of old memories

She took his hand and said:
"Run as fast as you can
Together you will grow the wings"
Let him look back, he lost something there
Let him look back, he lost someone there

Evening chills the southern sun
He asked you to, but you don't even tryEmbed
