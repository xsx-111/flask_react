Young River Lyrics
It's an excitement for sure
You've got something
With a special smile
You are somewhere
No one knows this place

They told me that he found a road
To young river
In pants and shoes and overcoat he fell
Into young river

Don't speak about it
Just keep it to yourself, keep it, keep it, keep it
Keep it to yourself

They told me that he found a road
To young river
In pants and shoes and overcoat he fell
Into young riverEmbed
