Gasoline Lyrics
To be afraid is a luxury
So cool your engines for me
I don't want a sweetheart
I want a machine

I love you the most, I do
When you're so close to me
I can smell the gasoline

To be soft is too easy, huh
Don't get soft on me
I don't want a sweetheart, sweetheart
I want a machine




What you whispered should be screamed
Screamed at the top of your lungs
Any sense you had in the morning
Is gone when the day is done
