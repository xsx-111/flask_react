Die By The Drop Lyrics
Let's dig a hole in the sand, brother
A little grave we can fill together
I got myself a problem
That I been looking to sell

Some people die just a little
Sometimes you die by the drop
Some people die in the middle
I live just fine on the top

I'm gonna take you for worse or better
To my little grave

I never said we was equal
I never wished to be saved
If I'm a problem then preach on?
Let's dig a little grave


Let's dig a hole in the sand, brother
Starve off the land for worse or better
Get right down to the bottom
If one goes I'll dig the other
