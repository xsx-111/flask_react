Old Mary Lyrics
Old Mary full of grease
Your heart stops within you
Scary are the fruits of your tomb
And harsh are the terms of your sentence
Old Mary, sister of mine
Mother to the world, carry this burden

Now until the moment of your last breath
Now until the moment of your last breath

Old Mary full of grease
Your heart stops within you
Scary are the fruits of your tomb
And harsh are the terms of your sentence
Old Mary, sister of mine
Mother to the world, carry this burden

Now until the moment of your last breath
Now until the moment of your last breath
Now until the moment of your last breath
Now until the moment of your last breathEmbed
