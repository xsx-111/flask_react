The Difference Between Us LyricsI'm not the way that you found me
I'm never here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well
Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the edge
Let's go where no one can see us
And find the difference between us
You can cry like a baby
Just let me do what I need to
It might be to me or to you
Just let me do what I need to
I'm not the way that you found me
I'm neither here nor there
One day I'm happy and healthy
Next I ain't doing so well
Let's go walk to the border
Let's go walk along the edge
Let's go where no one can see us
And find the difference between us
I'm not the way that you found me
(I'm not the way that you found me)
I'm neither here nor there
(I'm neither here nor there)
One day I'm happy and healthy
(One day I'm happy and healthy)
Next I ain't doing so well
(Next I ain't doing so well)
Let's go walk to the border
(Let's go walk to the border)
Let's go walk along the edge
(Let's go walk along the edge)
Let's go where no one can see us
(Let's go where no one can see us)
And find the difference between us
(And find the difference between us)
You can cry like a baby
Just let me do what I need to
It might be to me or to you
Just let me do what I need to
I'm not the way that you found me
(I'm not the way that you found me)
I'm neither here nor there
(I'm neither here nor there)
One day I'm happy and healthy
(One day I'm happy and healthy)
Next I ain't doing so well
(Next I ain't doing so well)Embed
