Jawbreaker Lyrics
I run too far away from you
It don't matter where I've been
I run around the world from you
And here you are again

You're a real jawbreaker
A real crook, obscene
I'd call you a heartbreaker
But I reserve that for nicer things

I tried to kill the memory
Shacking up with livid things 
You must get a socket stinger
And here you are again

You're a real jawbreaker
A real crook, obscene
I'd call you a heartbreaker
But I reserve that for nicer things

I run too far away from you
It don't matter where I've been
I run around the world from you
And here you are again
You're a real jawbreaker
A real crook, obscene
I'd call you a heartbreaker
But I reserve that for nicer things


You're a real jawbreaker
A real crook, obscene
I'd call you a heartbreaker
But I reserve that for nicer things2Embed
