Looking At The Invisible Man Lyrics
I'm the invisible man
Like a broke down engine
No skin on my bones at all
No skin on my bones at all
I got nothin'
You can't hit me
Yeah, you're looking at me
Like you know what you're talking about
Ain't nothing to see
Wave your hands in the dark woman
Yeah, you're looking at me
Like you know what you're talking about
Ain't nothing to see here, now nothin'
You can't hit me
I'm like a broke down engine
I'm the invisible man
No skin on my bones at all
You look like you know what you're talking about

Like you know what you're talking about
There ain't nothing to see
You can't hit me

I'm the invisible man
I'm like a newspaper
You can't read
There ain't nothing to see
Like you know what you're talking about
Like you
Like you know what you're talking about
Like you
