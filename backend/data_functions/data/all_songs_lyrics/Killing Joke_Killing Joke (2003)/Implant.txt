Implant Lyrics
Silent weapons for a quiet war

Under my skin, getting under my skin
All systems go
Security clause, passing of laws
Reality

Silence in the air, silence in the air
Acceptance
Information from birth, animals are first
Then man

Silent weapons for a quiet war

ID not free for me
You can't escape
Implant
Implant to the next step
You don't want to protect, you just want to fucking control

Know my DNA, know my DNA
My structure
Know the movements of my day
Know the movements of my day and haunts
Hypnotise, hypnotise
Acclimatise
Fingers in control, fingers in control
Watch the high beam

Silent weapons for a quiet war

ID not free for me
You can't escape
Implant
Everything is under control

Deep below the ground
Deep below the ground
Blasphemies
Deep below the ground
Deep below the ground
Hybrids

Hypnotise, hypnotise
Acclimatise
Hypnotise, hypnotise
Acclimatise
Silent weapons for a quiet war

ID not free for me
You can't escape
Implant
Tear up your ID cards and stick your implant up your ass
You just want to fucking controlEmbed
