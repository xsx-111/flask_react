Inferno (Bonus Track) Lyrics
Southern countries
Come in 20 chains
When the dust picks the dust
All the things are crossed insane
And my skin, feel my skin
Getting melanoma
Scorcher scorcher
Tell me when it's over
Tell me when the nightmare's over

Drop shell bomb
Inferno
Drop shell bomb
Inferno

Brother, brother, kill brother now
Mother, mother I'm alone
Mother, mother, my love is gone
What's happened at my home
Father, father, kill son
Cousin, cousin why?
Father, father, my head
Father, father, just offer my wife
Fire your home
Inferno
Drop shell bomb
Inferno

Fuckin' situation
You're a sociopath
With the best intention
Leaders that bleed us
Shit on your descendants
Eyes flying in the sky
Eyeing the triangle
Talk good on the phone
Everything is wrong
And my mind turns black
And my mind turns black
And my mind turns black
Cause there's seizures in my Big Mac

Fire your home
Inferno
Drop shell bomb
Inferno
Fire your home
Inferno
Drop shell bomb
