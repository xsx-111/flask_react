A Man Called Sun Lyrics
Everybody seems to know when he's around
He lifts me up and fades without a sound

Mr. Sun, won't you shine over me?
Mr. Sun, won't you shine over me?

Why he's here, I will never know
He makes you know you feel
Like somewhere to go

Mr. Sun, won't you shine over me?
Mr. Sun, just shine over me

Walking with a man called Sun
I think my journey's just begun
Do you think he'll mind?

He lifts you up, he shines
And then he's gone
But you know you need him more
When he's gone
Mr. Sun, just shine over me
Mr. Sun, just shine over me

Walking with a man called Sun
I think my journey's just begun
Do you think he'll mind?

Shine
Shine
Shine
Shine
Let it shineEmbed
