Call of the River LyricsCome away and follow me
She will call you from her winding
Come away and follow me
She will call you, reminding
Come feel along your sides
The long cool touch of current
Like a far remembered life
Come quicken to the now you hear
Cutting off from closer years
Bounding into heavy pouring sound
Come quicken to the icy sting
Sharpening to everything
Pounding boundaries
Come away and follow me
On a winding to the sea
Come away and follow me
Unwinding to be free
And the call of the river
A man will answer cause he's thirsty
For a far remembered life
Of pulsing to a larger rhythm
Feeling things that now lie hidden
Clean and cold within
The liquid taste of leaf and rock
The timing to a slower clock
Yearning for dampened musty wood
Come away and follow me
She will call you, she knows
Come away and follow me
Come taste this life and growEmbed
