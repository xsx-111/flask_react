Hey, Who Really Cares? LyricsBeen coming down for a long time
Changes coming down on me
Can't seem to carry them all now
Been wishing there was someone else I could be
Hey now, who really cares
Hey, won't somebody listen
Let me say what's been on my mind
Can I bring it out to you
I need someone to talk to
And no one else would spare me the time
I used to think of ferris wheel light sounds
The friday hum of neons and blue
But now they're like circular cages
Of graded tin and rusted wind
Hey now, who really cares
Hey, won't somebody listen
Let me say what's been on my mind
Can I bring it out to you
I need someone to talk to
And no one else will spare me the time1Embed
