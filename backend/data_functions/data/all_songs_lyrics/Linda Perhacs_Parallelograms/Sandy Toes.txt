Sandy Toes LyricsAs the sand is to my toes
And the wind is to my face
And the rain upon my hair is felt
So his eyes were to my eyes
And to myself
Each day I heard the wind and surge
At night I breathed the pine and earth
That salty feel upon my dampened skin
Time was flow, I feared no ebb
And life was him
If I last for ninety years
Will I say I lived but three
That began when he said to me
Windy-one, five minutes can you
Spare me, for eternityEmbed
