Delicious LyricsIt's the silk and the sound
And the cold creasing down
Of a lone blade of grass
Tracing and cooling down
A bare leg
It's the soles of your feet
Finding touches to breathe
On the bare naked ground
Each step a puddle
So soft a sound
Like sandals in hand
Climbing a waterfall
Like sandals in hand
Climbing a waterfall
Oh, how delicious
Oh, how I want this now
It's the slip into sleep
With the memories you hold
Burrowed and deep
Turned like pages
The break and release
It's the first gust of drops
When it's ripening to rain
And the flavor is warm
Scented like leather
Dusty and brown
Like hot desert wind
Teasing along your skin
Like hot desert wind
Teasing along your skin
Oh, how delicious
Oh, how I want this now
It's the narrowing instant
When I look across at you
And I wish I could be
Emotion naked, simple and sure
It's the murmur of growth
Whenever I'm with you
And I don't want to hide
In simple elastic
Protecting skin
If only I could
Stand so before you
If only I would
Stand so before you
Oh, how delicious
Oh, how I want this now
Oh, how I want you now, now, now1Embed
