Moons and Cattails LyricsMoons and cattails
Sun and sandstone
Moons and cattails
Sun and sandstone
I knew them way back
I knew them way back
Come along, past the cave
Past the howl, come along
Back to damp nights
To the heavy sleep of time
The naked blackness
Of basalt
Come along, past the paw
Past the fin, come along
I knew them, way back
I knew them, way back
Come along
Back to wet stone
To the soaking taste of leaf
The cooling memory
Of shadows
Come along, past the cave
Past the howl, come alongEmbed
