Porcelain Baked-Over Cast-Iron Wedding LyricsIt's a splendid high waisted white flavored day
It's Pavlov with barking and feathers and pearls
It's porcelain, oh, so bored, faces and curls
Buckles and gadgets and bell-bottom cools
Strutting and studding and preening by the rules
Cinderella for a day
She's a queen in white angel lace
In a dream that she fabricates
From her last remaining green dollar bill
In a corrugated castle with so many fossilized remains
Plaster baked in Saks special powder and villafranchian lace
Long shanks, lean shanks with mini-skirted brims
It's a harem in conquest with alabaster skins
Did I see you in Rome? I wintered abroad
Silky and creamy, they're a peppered prime cause
Of gallery flocking and rank hierarchy lockin'
Arena behavior, one man to a hill
In turtle neck style with clean verbal kills
Pass the champagne, will you please?
And let's get on with the next social squeeze
Female favored, custom tailored
The strutting grounds for the posh aggregates
Spilling, dividing and multiplying
In a system of social rotating mates
It's a splendid high waisted white flavored day
It's Pavlov with barking and feathers and pearls
It's porcelain, oh, so bored, faces and curls
Buckles and gadgets and bell-bottom cools
Strutting and studding and preening by the rules
By the rules
Ah, the hell with the rulesEmbed
