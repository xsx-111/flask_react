Chimacum Rain LyricsAnd it rains here
Everyday since I came
And the lichen covers rocks
And the green finds everything
Chimacum rain (and the rain, the rain, the rain)
Rain (and the rain, and the rain, the rain, down, around you)
Chimacum rain
In the soak of leaves
And the needle tufts and forms
In the grasses and the reeds
And the spilling over stones
Chimacum rain (and the rain, the rain, the rain)
Rain (and the rain, and the rain, the rain, down, around you)
Chimacum rain
I'm spacing out (spacing out, spacing out, spacing out)
I'm seeing silences between leaves
I'm seeing down (seeing down, seeing down, and down)
I'm seeing silences that are his
He belongs here
Can't have him
He belongs here
Can't know him
He belongs here
It kinda gets inside you
The silences, I mean
They kinda wrap around you
And loosen everything
Chimacum rain (and the rain, the rain, the rain, the rain)
Rain (and the rain, and the rain, the rain, down, around you)
