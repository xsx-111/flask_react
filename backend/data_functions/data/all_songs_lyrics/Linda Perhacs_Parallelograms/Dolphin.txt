Dolphin LyricsDolphin, take me with you
But I am bound by the tin
That's under my feet
And the engine behind
If I held you for a tow
Would you take me there and back
But what is there
And what good is back?
I don't know
Dolphin, take me with you
I want to feel the speed
And the pulse of moving
Of going away
But where shall we go
Does it matter, should I know
When the reason is to taste
Vacillando
Dolphin, take me with you
Take me with youEmbed
