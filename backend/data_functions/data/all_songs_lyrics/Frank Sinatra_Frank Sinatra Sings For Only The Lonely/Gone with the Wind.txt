Gone with the Wind LyricsGone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has blown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away
Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips
But now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind
The gladness that filled my heart
Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind
But now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind
The gladness that filled my heart
Just like a flame
Love burned brightly, then became
An empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind
Gone with the windEmbed
