Blues in the Night LyricsMy mama done told me, when I was in knee-pants
My mama done told me, "Son
A woman'll sweet talk
And give ya the big eye
But when the sweet talkin's done
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing
The blues in the night."
Now the rain's a-fallin'
Hear the train a-callin, "Whooee!"
My mama done told me
Hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin' 'cross the trestle, "Whooee!"
My mama done told me
A-whooee-ah-whooee
Ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back
The blues in the night
The evenin' breeze
Will start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night
And take my word, the mockingbird
Will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong
And he's right
From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds, they might blow
I been in some big towns and I heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night
Mmm, ooh
My mama was right, there's blues in the nightEmbed
