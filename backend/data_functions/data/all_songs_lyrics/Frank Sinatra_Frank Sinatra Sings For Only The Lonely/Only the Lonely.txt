Only the Lonely LyricsEach place I go only the lonely go
Some little small caf√©
The songs I know only the lonely know
Each melody recalls a love that used to be
The dreams I dream only the lonely dream
Of lips as warm as May
That hopeless scheme only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care
And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new
It well could be the one time
A hopeless little dream like that comes true
If you find love, hang on to each caress
And never let love go
For when it's gone, you'll know the loneliness
The heartbreak only the lonely know2Embed
