Angel Eyes LyricsHey, drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me
Try to think that love's not around
Still, it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gainin' any ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Angel eyes, that old devil's sent
They grow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight?
So drink up, all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me
Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
'Scuse me, while I disappear1Embed
