Poney (Part 2) Lyrics
I'm just a little pony
Working in the funfair
Life has never been easy
That's not life, that's a nightmare
I've never seen a prairie
Never seen - a tree
Be the judge you're about to ride me
Is it touch - I don't do it
They could do the same with you
And what the groom may not of touched
Forced to turn around a pick
At your will - just like me

I'm just a little pony
Working in the funfair
Life has never been easy
That's not life, that's a nightmare
I've never seen a prairie
Never seen - a tree
Be the judge you're about to ride me
Is it touch, I don't do it
I'm just a little pony
Never seen - a tree
They could do the same with you
Is it touch, I don't do it
They could do the same with you
And what the groom may not of touched
Forced to turn around a pickEmbed
