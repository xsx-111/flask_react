Suicide Commando LyricsShe was my dark haired Lydia
Of my suburban german dreams
And he was the boy called James
And it will all end up like the
New York scene
Too much drugs, too much pills
And too much songs
Suicide commando
Suicide commando
King Kong was a murderer
But it was me
I can't stand the scene at all
You are hip and you are down
You are hip and you are down
Find a city, find a room
And find a drug
Suicide commando
Suicide commandoEmbed
