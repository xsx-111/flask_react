My Friend Dario LyricsMy friend Dario
Has a super mega car
Drives too fast
Drives to flash
The noise the wheels make when screeching on the tarmac
Echoes in his head
Then echoes in his veins
My friend Dario
Has a super mega car
Drives too fast
Drives to flash
Doesn't care about the crash
Dario knows it's prohibited
You either drive or either drink
But he can't resist the pleasure
To down a bottle before each trip
My friend Dario has a super mega car
Drives too fast
Drives to flash
Doesn't care about the crash
My friend Dario has a super mega car
Drives to flash
Doesn't care about the crashEmbed
