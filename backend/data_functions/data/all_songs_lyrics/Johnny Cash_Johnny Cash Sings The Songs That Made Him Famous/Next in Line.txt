Next in Line Lyrics
The next in line will be someone who loves you
The next in line is me, because it's my time
Now how long will it be, till you end my misery
You better be prepared to linger, when you get to me
The time has come for you to love me, if you ever are
Come to me now, so I can make you mine
I watched them rush to you so fast
I waited so I'd be the last
It's my time, because I'm the next in line
The next in line will want your love forever
The next in line is me and here I am
Give me a day or two and I'll get through to you
You'd been my baby long ago, if you'd turned down a few
This old heart can't take much more waiting for your love
I'm tired and we're running short of time
I'll make you love me more than everyone before
It's my time to try, because I'm the next in line
I stood and watched you take their hearts
And break them one by one
My time is coming, so I waited while you had your fun
Now I'm through a-waiting way behind
It's my time, because I'm the next in line1Embed
