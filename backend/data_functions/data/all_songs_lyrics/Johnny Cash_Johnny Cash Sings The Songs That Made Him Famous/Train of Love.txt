Train of Love Lyrics
Train of love's a-coming, big black wheels a-humming
People waiting at the station, happy hearts are drumming
Trainman tell me maybe, ain't you got my baby
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Now stop your whistle blowing, because I got ways of knowing
Your bringing other people's lovers, but my own keeps going
Train of love's deceiving, when she's not gone she's leaving
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
Train of love's now hasting, sweethearts standing waiting
Here and there and everywhere, they're going to be embracing
Trainman tell me maybe, ain't you got my baby
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home

Train of love's a-leaving, leaving my heart grieving
But early or late, I sit and wait, because I'm still believing
We'll walk away together, though I may wait forever
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's coming home1Embed
