Carrion Lyrics
Even though you're gone
I still carry on
It's the same big sea
It's the same to me

To carry on
Carry on
I will stay strong
I will stay strong
I set you free
I set you free
Now run along
Now run along
In the midnight hour
I will lose my power
I will dig my hole
I will become a mole
In the ground
In the ground
It's much too deep
It's much too deep
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
Everywhere I go
I'm reminded
Long ago
It's so long ago
But it won't leave
Please, leave me
Leave me alone
I am along
Deep in the ground
Looking around
Trying to find my home
Trying to find a home
But I dug too deep
I dug too deep
I cannot see
I cannot see
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?

Even though you're gone
I still carry on
It's the same big sea
It's the same to me1Embed
