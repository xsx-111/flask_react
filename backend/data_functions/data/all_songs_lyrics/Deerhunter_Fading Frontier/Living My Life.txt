Living My Life Lyrics
Living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life
I'm living my life

I’m off the grid, I’m out of range
And the amber waves of grain
Are turning grey again
The darkened stage
The infinite ways
Distance can change fate
I'm out of range again

And I'm living my life
I'm living my life

Will you tell me when you find out
How to conquer all this fear?
I've been spending too much time out
On the fading frontier
Will you tell me when you find out how
To recover the lost years?
I’ve spent all of my time now
Chasing a fading frontier
I’m living my life
I’m living my life
I’m living my life
I’m living my life

I’m off the grid
I’m out of range
And the amber waves of grain
Are turning grey again
The darkened stage
And the infinite waves
Distance can change fate
It's happening again

I’m living my life
I’m living my life
I’m living my life
I’m living my life2Embed
