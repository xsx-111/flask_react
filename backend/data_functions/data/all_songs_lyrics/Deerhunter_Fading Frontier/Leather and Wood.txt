Leather and Wood LyricsI believe my head is on straight
I've been given this chance
To make things great
I believe I can focus
Reel in the air
I know I can
I can
I believe the sun will rise
In the east now
I believe we will find
That elusive peace now
I can't believe there is
No hope
I drove my car over the edge
The leather and the wood
Formed a ledge
I believe we can fly
I believe anything is real
I believe we can die
I believe we can live again2Embed
