All the Same Lyrics
My home, anywhere
Expect no comfort save for air
Take it anyway
I could leave or I could stay
Wouldn't matter much to me
Much to me

My home it's so cold
Air condition to the bone
Take me anywhere
I could see a light out there
I could see a lot of things

A lot of things
A lot of things
A lot of things

It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same

My friend's dad got bored
Changed his sex and had no more
No more wife, no more kids
Nothing left to live with
To exist
You should take your handicaps
Channel them and feed them back
Until they become your strength
Hollowed out
It's all the same

It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the same
It's all the sameEmbed
