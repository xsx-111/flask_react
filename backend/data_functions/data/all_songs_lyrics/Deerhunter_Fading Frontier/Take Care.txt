Take Care LyricsTake care
Lift the guard and you might find
Your place in that life
A place where you found hope
There’s nothing more than the fog from the dry ice burning
Corpses turning
Take care
Lift the guard you won’t be lonely
Too much longer
Too much longer…
Raise your crippled hand into the clouds and
Wave bye bye now
Wave bye bye bye
Wave your hands around
You can’t tell
It’s the last thing you’ll see
Last game you’ll play
Hopeless
Would you call “Hi! Hi.”
What is it you’re after?
Don’t just stand there
Oh…
