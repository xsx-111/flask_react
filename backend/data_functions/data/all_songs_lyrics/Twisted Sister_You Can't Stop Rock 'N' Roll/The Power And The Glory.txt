The Power And The Glory LyricsI don't wanna think about it
Why can't I live without it?
Oh, I need the love
I'm free and independent
I just take life and I spend it
Oh I need the love
Oh I want the love
I just need the power from above
I just got the power from above
Can't believe I saw the light
Never thought I'd see the day
So filled with wrong I couldn't see right
Almost lost the way
I was headed down
Taken by the tide
I was lost at sea
Missing in action
Taken for a ride
Chorus:
Now I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power from above
I've got the power and the glory
I've got the power, power of love
All the time I knew I was wrong
But denied it all the same
I was so blind I sang the same song
Thought it was a game
But when I looked inside
The writing on the wall
Said "It's a long way down
Face it clown
Fool you're gonna fall"
