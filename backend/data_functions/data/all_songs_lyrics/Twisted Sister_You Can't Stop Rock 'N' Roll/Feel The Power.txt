Feel The Power LyricsSo you think we'll have to save our name, oh
And we haven't got the stuff it takes
Let's lay the cards out on the table
There ain't no way we'll lose our stakes
We ride the tiger, we ride the storm
We'll fight your fire, like never before, you'll hear our roar
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power, feel the power
Feel the power, feel the power
So we hear you think you're so amending
We'll show you all that we will do
You think your powers neverending
We'll show you what the truth can do
We have the reason, we have the might
And for your treason we're gonna fight you day and night
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power, feel the power
Feel the power, feel the power
Alright
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power, feel the power
Feel the power, feel the power
So you better think before you trail on
There's single truth we ain't your bet
And if it's got to set your mental
Well, man you ain't seen nothing yet
We are the tiger, we are the storm
We are the fire, like never before, you'll hear our roar
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power
You got to feel the power, feel the power
Feel the power, feel the powerEmbed
