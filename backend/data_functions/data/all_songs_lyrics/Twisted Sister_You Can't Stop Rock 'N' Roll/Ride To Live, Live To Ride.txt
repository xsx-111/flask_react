Ride To Live, Live To Ride LyricsHard roads and endless lines
Flow through his veins
Cold steel and hot fuel injected
'S the dream, that fills his brain
But no, not slow, the speed fever grows
He rides, he sees, he knows
Chorus:
You've got to
Ride to live, live to ride
Feel the flames burn inside
And though you know
You ride to hide
You ride to live to ride
Life's short and goes too fast
Most pages burn
Don't wait, the end's too near
Some people never learn
You all won't fall, the road fever calls
So run or fly, don't crawl
Repeat chorus
Guitar solo - Jay Jay French
Ride on and don't look back
You can't change what's done
Drive hard for greater glories
You all must be someone
So win, don't show
Let the life fever go
The world is yours you know
Repeat chorus (twice)Embed
