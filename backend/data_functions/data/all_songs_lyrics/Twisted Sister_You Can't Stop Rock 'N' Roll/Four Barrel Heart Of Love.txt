Four Barrel Heart Of Love LyricsTires squealing, freewheeling
Lines coming through the night
Head's roaring disorderly
Engine screams, everything is alright, well
CHORUS:
Four barrel heart of love (get ready, hold steady)
Four barrel heart of love (get ready, hold steady)
You're the one that I'm dreaming of
You're my four barrel heart of love
Raw pounding, hot sounding
Heart stopping and you bet you're alive
Red lining, white lining
Man and thunder in the powerdrive, well
REPEAT CHORUS
Let's ride
Solo - Jay Jay
Gas burning, head turning
Riding hard like never before
Earthshaking, lawbreaking
Hammers down man to the floor, well
REPEAT CHORUSEmbed
