One Man Woman LyricsThe boys all want her badly, they just love her stuff
They love to love her madly, can't get enough
But the party's over, what they don't all understand
Is she's a one man woman, she's a one man woman
Well, she's a one man woman and I'm a one woman man
They'd love to lay down on the saddle, it's the boyhood dream
They want a ticket to ride her, how she makes 'em scream
But the show ain't open just for a popular man
CHORUS:
'Cause she's a one man woman, she's a one man woman
She's a one man woman and I'm a one woman man
Solo - Jay Jay
REPEAT CHORUS
Now boys don't feel defeated 'cause she don't wanna play
Your pass won't be completed, there ain't no more to say
So forget this number, she'll never wear your brand
REPEAT CHORUS
Alright, come onEmbed
