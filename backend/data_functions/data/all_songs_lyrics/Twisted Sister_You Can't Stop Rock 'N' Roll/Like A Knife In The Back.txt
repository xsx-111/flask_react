Like A Knife In The Back LyricsCome inside
Take a seat
Or a ride
We're so glad
That you're here
Now come on
Have a drink
Or some coke
Gasoline
Or some rope
A guillotine
Are you gone?
Don't turn around
Ignore that sound
Just lie on this rack
Are you starting to crack?
I need this like a knife in the back
I need this like a knife in the back
Hey, my man can you feel
Can you stand?
That's a shame
Really sad
Do you want some more?
Like to help if I could
But I don't think I should
I don't care
Shall I pour?
Nothing to fear
Just lay right here
All that you lack
Will start fading to black
I need this like a knife in the back
I need this like a knife in the back
Ain't it sad
That he's dead?
Was it something we said?
Such a drag
What could we do?
He was an ass
Always smelling of gas
Not at all one of us
The chosen few
He turned around
And heard the sound
Those with the knack
Get to run with the pack
I need this like a knife in the back
I need this like a knife in the back
I need this
I need this
I need this like a knife in the backEmbed
