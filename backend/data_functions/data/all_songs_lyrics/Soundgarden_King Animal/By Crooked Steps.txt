By Crooked Steps LyricsI'm addicted to feeling
Stealing love isn't stealing
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
I'm a walking believer
I'm a ghost and a healer
I'm the shape of the hole inside your heart!
Not looking for a brighter side
Crooked steps will take me higher
I don't care if you want to cry!
I'm a soldier for hire
Killing all you admire
And you live in denial but that will change
Not looking for a brighter side
Crooked steps will take me higher
I don't care if you want to cry
When blood is raining down
It cuts a deep deep river
And we're diving, yeah, we're diving
My crooked steps
Right behind you, right behind you
My crooked steps
Right behind you, right behind you
My crooked steps
(Right behind you...)
My crooked steps
(Right behind you...)
I'm a walking believer, I'm a ghost and a healer
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
My crooked steps right behind you
Right behind you
Right behind you
Right behind you1Embed
