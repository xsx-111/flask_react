Rowing Lyrics
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Moving is breathing and breathing is life
Stopping is dying, you'll be alright
Life is a hammer waiting to drop
Drift in the shallows and the rowing won't stop

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row

Can't see the sky, nothing's on the horizon
Can't feel my hands and the water keeps rising
Can't fall asleep 'cause I wake up dead
I just keep pulling, I just keep rowing

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Rowing is living and living is hard
But living beats losing all that we are
All that we know of and all that we feel
All we remember, imagined or real
(All we remember, imagined or real)
Hey
I heard an echo, but the answer had changed
From the word I remembered that I started out saying
Living is cheating, if you're not pulling oars
The current is leaving, I'll get mine, you'll get yours

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row

Rowing is bleeding, bleeding is breathing
Breathing is feeling, burning, and freezing
We're getting dirty, but I started out clean
Keep on rowing at
Keep on rowing at
Keep on pulling at
Keep on pulling at
Keep on rowing at
Keep on rowing at
Keep on rowing at
Keep on rowing at
Keep………. on rowing
Keep on rowing

Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row
Don't know where I'm going, I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling, gotta row2Embed
