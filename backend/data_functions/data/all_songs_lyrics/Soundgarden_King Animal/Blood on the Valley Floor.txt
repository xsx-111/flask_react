Blood on the Valley Floor Lyrics
Mountains all around
Altogether we stumble

Eleven million clowns
Every one with a razor out

And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spill some more

Once we were the end
The end of the long road
Leading to the start
Of the ever-invading crowds

And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries

Endless summer, needless space
Fill it all up with a void
Mountains all around
Altogether we tumble down

And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spillEmbed
