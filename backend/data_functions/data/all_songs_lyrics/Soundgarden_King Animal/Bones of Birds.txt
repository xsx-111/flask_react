Bones of Birds Lyrics
Time is my friend
Till it ain't, and runs out
And that is all
That I have, till it's gone

Tried to build a home bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth

Hey! Sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is trapped
Too weak to survive
Probably maybe

Tried to look out
Through a hole, in the vague
Circling above
Looking down, bird of prey

Tried to build a home bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth
Hey! Sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is trapped
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive
Probably maybe

Tried to build a home bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth

Hey! Sometimes she won't cry!
When the smallest one is trapped!
Too weak to survive! Probably
Hey! Sometimes she won't cry!
When the smallest one is trapped!
Too weak to survive!
Too weak to survive!
Too weak to survive!
MaybeEmbed
