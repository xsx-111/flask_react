A Thousand Days Before Lyrics
Life, a thousand days ago
Hours sinking in a hole
Try to melt into the walls
Now I am here inside the bowl
Here in the cold
Where no one stands behind me
Now a thousand days have gone
Again, like the sun and moon at war
And give or take a thousand more
Here in the cold
Where no one stayed behind me
I’ll be on my own side
You know where to find me
You know where to find me

Here in the cold
Where no one stayed beside me
I’ll be on my own side
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
Born with a thousand little holes
And a tear to fill up every one
A thousand to ignore
I’ll be on my own side...
I’ll be on my own side...
I’ll be on my own side!
