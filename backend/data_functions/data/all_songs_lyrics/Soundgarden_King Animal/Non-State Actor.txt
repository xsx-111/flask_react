Non-State Actor Lyrics
Coin in every pocket, more mouths to fill
So weak in the land, strong in the will (need)
I'll be your beast of burden
I'll be the seed
I'll bring you the healer, feel your disease
I bring dirty water and make it clean (young)
And you are the cure, I am the drug

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected, but we will speak
We're not the chosen, but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything

Bullets, guns and missiles, a stone and a sling
A motherless country of thee I sing (song)
You are the tank and rockets, I am the bomb
I teach you a lesson, sword for a pen
Reading, turn the pages, a history of man (look)
You are tabula rasa, I am the book

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected, but we will speak
We're not the chosen, but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor

And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected, but we will speak
We're not the chosen, but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything

A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit moreEmbed
