Attrition Lyrics
Lay here under bombast and gloom
A parade of ghouls marches by
Headed down to Nero's tomb
Raising flags and burning rights

Warm yourself by a god-made fire
Pinocchio with spinning eyes
Laugh aloud under bomb-lit skies
A victim's smile never lies

You have always lived your life like a joke with no time
What you going to do about it until you get the punchline right?

On the cliff above stormy waves
Can't decide to climb or drown
Up is folly and down disgrace
Under thumbs over-written
The ladder is poison have to find a new way around

What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
You have always lived your life like a joke with no time
You have always lived your life like a joke with no time1Embed
