Worse Dreams Lyrics
Let it swirl around you now and let it fall apart
Put it back again and find every piece, but it's not the same
And you never can be sure just how it looked when you started
Turn around again now and do it all over and over

Like a doll from a bad dream
When it's gone, worse dreams are born
Steaming in the line of fire, you're wild and free

Everybody in, sit down and keep on holding on
Pull your arms around black clouds drown and the rain is walking
Bodies in the ground by now down seven feet and rolling
Hanging on the tail of the sunrise till you can't let go

Like a doll from a bad dream
When it's gone, worse dreams are born
Like a doll from a sad dream
When it's gone, worse dreams are born

Like a doll from a bad dream
When it's gone, worse dreams are born
Like a doll from a sad dream
When it's gone, worse dreams are born
Worse dreams are born
Worse dreams are born
Worse dreams are bornEmbed
