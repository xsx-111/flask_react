Falling Angel Lyrics
From this cloud where I hang dangle in the blue
I spy you all tiny creatures on the ground below
For my being reckless got me strung up in the sky
But love is flawed now see the lowlies cry
Cut my cord now better then better off to die

Here am I your falling angel dangle in the blue
I'm your angel and I wish that I could be like you

It's my time all I have for my crime is such
Knowing that the thing I love is that which I can't touch
So I watch your fragile beauty changing in the sun
Love is flawed now see the lowlies cry
Cut my cord now better then better off to die


I believe in you I don't believe it all but I believe in you
I don't believe it all but I belive in you
I don't believe it all but I believe in you
I don't believe it allEmbed
