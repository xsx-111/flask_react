Femme Fatale Lyrics
Here she comes you better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
Its true it's not hard to realize
Just look into her false coloured eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down
What a clown

'Cause everybody knows... (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
Sees just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks

You're written in her book
You're number 37 take a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy she's from the street
Before you start your're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
Yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows... (She's a femme fatale)
Things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
Sees just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks
Yeah, I see that girl. So man, I know
Where you're coming from...
She's all lips, and eyes, and legs
And then, just wait, y'know what?
She's gonna mess you up, pal
She will try to bring you down
The hardest girl around

'Cause everybody knows...
The things she does to please
Sees just a little tease
And everybody knows, she, she, she...
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale
She's a femme fatale1Embed
