None Of The Above Lyrics
I am I, myself alone
Realize I never need to use no one
When it comes down to my soul
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
There was a time I was so afraid
Of everything people around me said
That I wanted to hide my face in the shadows
There was a time on a bed of nails
I was dreaming a plan up that could not fail
But no power under the sun could pull it together

Can't take this attitude
Got to show now i've got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question

I am I myself alone
Realize i never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy roads
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
If there's a time that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there
To kick at the answer

I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
When it comes down to my soul
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy roads
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above 

None of the above
My faith in none of the above
None of the above
I stand by none of the above
None of the above
I stand by none of the aboveEmbed
