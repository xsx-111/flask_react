Stop Dead LyricsStop!
Stop!
Stop dead!
Stop (stop stop stop stop stop)!
I pulled up at a west end junction (Seeker of attention)
A full body kit and bass bins pumping (Size up competition)
Come on red light, get into green
I hit the brake, I must be dreaming
I'm stop! (stop), dead! (dead)                                                                In my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where you going to?
Gotta know now..
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
In my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where you going to?
Oh-oh-oh
I've got my eyes on the action
(Killer reputation)
Heat crazed in full satisfaction
(We're goin` one phase up)
Do what you do and do it to me
Body in motion, now you see me
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
In my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where you going to?
Gotta know know
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
In my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where you going to?
Gotta know know...Stop!
Come on now, Come on now
Come on now, Come on now
Wise up to remain young victim
(Come on, ways of attraction)
A full scale attack on the system
(Come on, no one visor?)
Do what you do and do it to me
I'm into red line territory
And I'm
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
In my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where you going to?
Gotta know know
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
In my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where you going to?
Stop!
Dead in my tracks
Again
I'm stop dead in my tracks
Stop!
In my tracks
Yeah
I'm stop dead in my tracks
(Oh-oh) Gotta know now..
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
In my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
In my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead)
