Too Much Information Lyrics
Destroyed by MTV
I hate to bite the hand that
Feeds me so much information
The pressure's on the screen
To sell you things that you don't need
It's too much information for me

Hey TV child look into my eyes
Here by intervention I want your attention
Promotion boy in a suit and tie
He wants you to use it
You're too shot to loose it
It's pumping down the cable
Like never seen before
A cola (condom) manufacturer is sponsoring the war
Here comes the news with love from me to you

Destroyed by ABC
I hate to bite the hand that
Feeds me so much information
The pressure's on the screen
To sell you things that you don't need
It's too much information for me
Turn on the tube
Hits you with the groove
Advertizing music
We want you to choose it
These teeth are white trainers ultra bright
This band is perfect just don't scratch the surface
We covered all the angles
The survey people said
Just put us on the cover we'll be smiling anyway
This video was made with love to you

Destroyed by BBC
I hate to bite the hand that
Feeds me so much information
The pressure's on the screen to
Sell you things that you don't need
It's too much information for me

Destroyed by MTV
I hate to bite the hand that
Feeds me so much information
The pressure's on the screen to
Sell you things that you don't need
It's too much information for me
Dialate your mind 
Got to give it to me
Got to listen to me
Got to give in to me
Now I'm on the line
I try......Embed
