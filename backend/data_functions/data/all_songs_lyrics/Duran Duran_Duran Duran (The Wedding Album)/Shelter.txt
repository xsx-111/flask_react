Shelter Lyrics
I watch you from my window working this vicious road
You shudder when the wind blows
Girl you're looking beat and cold
Don't know your situation but you look so alone to me
In my imagination this is how the message reads

Reaching out, calling out for your love, babe
Just come softly to me
Reaching out, calling out for your love
For your love, babe
In the shelter of my heart

Trust my intuition, you're the one I've got to know
I give without condition, wouldn't try to save your soul
Money or reputation doesn't mean a thing to me
Special communication - it's the only thing we need

Reaching out... Calling out
Just come softly to me
Calling out... Hear me now
In the shelter of my heart
Reaching out
(Reaching out calling out for your love babe)
Hear me now
Calling out do you read me?
(In the shelter of my heart)
Calling out...
(Reaching out calling out for your love, for your love babe)
Hear me now
Just come softly to me
Here is no hurt to feel
Here is safe for lips unsealed
In the shelter of my heart

Reaching out calling out for your love, babe
Just come softly to me
Reaching out calling out for your love, for your love, babe
In the shelter of my heart

Reaching out
Hear me now
Calling out
Do you read me? 
Reaching out
(Reaching out calling out for your love, for your love babe)
Hear me now
Calling out
Do you read me? Embed
