U.M.F. Lyrics
Here we stand
In the shadow of the master plan
Making trouble wherever we can
Stir it up, stir it up, stir it up
Can't you see this boy is going cheap -
Knockdown to a basement deal
But I really won't stop til I get to the top
Take it from me, I'm waiting here on my knees
And I love the way you tease me
(Oh) such a wonderful person
Don't play rough -
It's easy when you know your stuff
Say please and sure enough, so kind
I'm making love to the ultimate mind

Come on, take a look, put it to me, baby
You could feel a love come tumbling down
I just want to wrap myself in you baby
We could tell the world we're fooling around

Ultimately, I'd say she's toying with me
It's a case of wait and see
But right now I'm gonna keep my pants on
A to Zed, shes doing it to my head
We don't need to go to bed, you'll find
To make love to the ultimate mind
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Put it to me, baby
(you could feel a love...)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Wanna wrap myself in you, baby
(We'll tell the world...)

Talk me round
Let's do it right here and now
I don't want you cooling down
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
We could fit reality's two-way split personality
Life's a bitch, but I'm fine
Making love to the ultimate mind
Heaven's bent, we're completely innocent
We all got to pay the rent
And in time we learn to compromise
Talking tall, but I feel invisible
Can you see me after all that I said
There's only one thing for it

Take a look, put it to me, baby
You could feel a love come tumbling down
I just want to wrap myself in you baby
We can tell the world were fooling around
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Come on, take a look, put it to me, baby
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
You could be a love come tumbling down
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
I just want to wrap myself in you baby
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
We could tell the world we're fooling around 

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Come on, take a look (put it to me baby)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
I'm making love to the ultimate mind
Ultimate mind
Ultimate mind...Embed
