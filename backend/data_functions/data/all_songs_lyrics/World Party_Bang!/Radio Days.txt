Radio Days LyricsI don't know why, I don't know when
I don't know how, I don't know who
I don't know where, I don't know what
I don't know which, I don't know why
Thought we could work it out
But I might have been sleeping
I used to give a uhh
But now I don't care
I'll plug you into heaven
Turn up the level
I'll pull you in and out
Watch the fuses blow
'Cause you just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
I don't know why, I don't know when
I don't know how, I don't know who
I don't know where, I don't know what
I don't know which, I don't know why
I don't know when
But all I see is chaos and misunderstanding
Why don't you turn it off
Leave the world alone
'Cause you just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
You just don't know
I don't know why, I don't know when
I don't know how, I don't know who
I don't know where, I don't know what
I don't know which, I don't know why
I don't know when
I don't know how, I don't know who
I don't know where, I don't know what
I don't know which, I don't know why
I don't know when
I don't know who, I don't know where
I don't know what, I don't know which
I don't know why, I don't know whenEmbed
