Give It All Away Lyrics
Don't ask me who I am, 'cause maybe I don't know
Just someone with half a brain and nagging doubts won't go
But it seems to me you're killing all the things you love the most
All the way down to the coast

I don't want to see you, ooh
Give it all away
Don't give it all away, ooh, don't give it all away, ooh

That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
It ain't here to stay, yeah
That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
Let go

Read the morning papers, seems like nothing turns out right
Take a deep breath, yeah, it knocks out your lights
Hypocrites and zealots are struggling for the throne
Kings and queens and presidents, younger than the stones, ohh

Give them all away, ohh
Give them all away
Just give them all away
That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
Let go
That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
Let go

Here's a list of things that one day you won't know you've missed
Naked in the river, watching planets as they kiss
Surfers in the sunlight, dances on the sea
Nothin' on your mind, spirit so free

I just don't want to see you, ooh, give it all away
I don't want to see you, ooh, give it all away
'Cause it ain't here to stay and you can't take it anyway

That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
Let go

Cake it and eat it, that's what you want
And right now
But that slice is going to kill you
And it's time that you found out
Just don't want to see you, ooh, give it all away
Don't want to see you, ooh, give it all away
I don't want to see you, ohh, friend, give it all away
'Cause it ain't here to stay and you can't take it anyway

That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
That's what we're talking 'bout, that's what we're talking 'bout
Let goEmbed
