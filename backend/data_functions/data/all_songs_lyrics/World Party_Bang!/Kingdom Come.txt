Kingdom Come LyricsNow here comes the world, here comes the moon and the sun
From a top of the pyramid you can see everyone
Over here is the desert, over there is the frozen north
In Sweden they are blonde, in Africa they're black, for what it's worth
The eagle's getting tired, the bear cannot flap his wings
People running scared while the little girl sing
What goes up surely must come down
Don't keep your head in the ground
Let the kingdom come, let the kingdom come
Let the kingdom come, let the kingdom come
And there's always more
Forever, forever, wandering around my cave
Forever, forever, walking past my window
Forever, forever, wandering around my cave
Forever, forever, walking past my window
Forever, forever, wandering around my cave
Finding the girl, follow her down to the stream
Well you're scanning the walls, searching for stills from your dreams
You know the pandas are skating on very thin ice
If you understand me tap once, babe, if you don't, just tap twice
Please let the kingdom come
Let the kingdom come
And there's always more
Forever, forever, wandering around my cave
Forever, forever, walking past my window
Forever, forever, wandering around my cave
Forever, forever, walking past my window
And forever, forever, wandering around my cave
Yeah, the money is so different, those computers are cute
You better phone home right now, see if they can find your lost parachute
Well the best lack all conviction, while the worst is yet to come
Yeah you should pick the politician up, kick his bum
Roll over Beethoven let the kingdom come
Let the kingdom come, hey
Let the kingdom come

Don't it just flow through you
Don't it just flow through everyone
Don't it just flow through youEmbed
