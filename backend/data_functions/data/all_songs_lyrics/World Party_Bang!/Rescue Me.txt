Rescue Me LyricsHold me up 'cause I think I'm going under
Cheer me on if I'm gonna fall behind
Rescue me 'cause the sky is full of thunder
Speak for me when I finally lose my mind
Until now, I've always felt in control of my life
A happy man on the best of days
Someone been rocking my ladder
And the scenery has changed in so many ways
I can't get back to a place I know so well
I look and there's no face to trust
I know that no one said that happiness is everybody's right
But why should it be out of sight?
Hold me up 'cause I think I'm going under
Cheer me on if I'm gonna fall behind
Rescue me 'cause the sky is full of thunder
Speak for me when I finally lose my mind
When I finally lose my mind
Hold me up 'cause I think I'm going under
Cheer me on if I'm gonna fall behind
Rescue me 'cause the sky is full of thunder
Speak for me when I finally lose my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Whenever I think of you I'm sighing inside
I don't understand why I can't love you
I just go under in the surfer's tide
In the surfer's tide, in the surfer's tide
Rescue me
Cheer me on
Speak for me
Hold me up if you think I'm going under
Cheer me on if I'm gonna fall behind
Rescue me, 'cause the sky is full of thunder
Speak for me when I finally lose my mindEmbed
