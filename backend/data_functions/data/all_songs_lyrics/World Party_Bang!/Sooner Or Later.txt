Sooner Or Later LyricsPositivity
Positivity, please won't you breathe on me?
Positively
I'm positively freezing to death
I want to find my way to my own time
Relativity
I'm waving at you while you driving by me
Relatively
It's getting harder to catch their breath
I want to find myself in a good time
Faith
You don't need to believe it
Faith
'Cause they're just going to deceive you sooner or later
Sooner or later
Sensitivity
I'm in need of those things that you do to me
Sensibility
Having a feeling is not enough
Don't want to walk on by my own time
Possibilities
The possibilities dance all around me
Momentarily
Just takes a second to lose your way
But I can find myself in my own mind
Faith
You don't need to believe it
Faith
'Cause they're just going to deceive you sooner or later
Sooner or later
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Know and you'll feel so sure
Sooner or later
I'll find out
Sooner or later
Find myself
Find myself
Faith
You don't need to believe it
Faith
'Cause they're just going to deceive you sooner or later
Sooner or later
Faith
You don't need to believe it
Faith
'Cause they're just going to deceive you sooner or later
You'll find out sooner or later
You'll find out sooner or later
You'll find out sooner or later
You'll find out sooner or later
