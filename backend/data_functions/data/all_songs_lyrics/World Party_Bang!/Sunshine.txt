Sunshine LyricsYou can't see forward, you can't look back
There's nothing that you need, nothing that you lack
And it ain't gonna last this way
You say you're living out on the edge
But you're on solid ground, not on a ledge
And I think we're gonna make it this time
Sunshine, I just can't get enough of you
Sometimes you just blow my mind
Gonna take it all, gonna change it all for you
And I'm so glad that you found me
Yeah, you made it just in time
Yeah, I'm so glad now, I'm getting delirious
You're down in the basement when we're up here on the roof
You're looking for evidence when you're living proof
But we hope you're gonna make it up here
Sunshine, I just can't get enough of you
Sometimes you just blow my mind
Gonna take it all, gonna change it all for you
Sunshine, don't leave me behind
I keep getting caught in the rain
Fooled again and again
I start acting like there's no tomorrow
Drowning in a sea of pain and sorrow
Oh, I said, "Sometimes I just can't get enough of you"
Sunshine, you just blow my mind
Gonna take it all, gonna change it all for you
And I'm so glad that you found me
Yeah, you made it just in time
Yeah, I'm so glad now, I'm getting deliriousEmbed
