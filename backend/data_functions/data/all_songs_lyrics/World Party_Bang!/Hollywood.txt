Hollywood LyricsThere she is on a lifeboat
There she is setting sail
There she is in someone else's dreams
There she is looking beautiful
There she is again
There she is in a mountain stream
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
There she is in the kitchen
There she is out at sea
There she is enveloping me
She said she's just a mirror
Said she leads the way
Babble on and dooming me today
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
The sun it sighs
Wave upon wave
In the grass and dew
I dance
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
Hollywood, wouldn't she?
Hollywood
Hollywood
Hollywood
And in winter we shall ride
In a pink carriage with blue cushions
Kiss ran down your neck like a little spider
We will find it
Though it is a great travelerEmbed
