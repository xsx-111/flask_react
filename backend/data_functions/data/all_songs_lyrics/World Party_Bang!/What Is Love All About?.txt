What Is Love All About? LyricsI only breathe when your mouth opens
I only dream when you're asleep
When I'm in this room, I don't see nothin'
'Cept whatever's runnin' through your mind
I only breathe when your mouth opens
I only dream when you're asleep
I only see this room when you are in it
And they're askin' do I know what love's about
I only sigh when I'm not with you
I can't remember why I am
I only speak when you are thinkin'
And they're askin' do I know what love's about
(What is love all about?)
(What is love all about?)
(What is love all about?)
Everyone should know
(What is love all about?)
Everyone should know
(What is love all about?)
Everyone should know, everyone should know
Everyone should know
(What is love all about?)
I only speak when you are breathin'
(What is love all about?)
I only dream when you're asleep
(What is love all about?)
I only see this room when you're in it
(What is love all about?)
Same for the sea and trees and lonely sky
(What is love all about?)
I only sigh when I'm not with you
(What is love all about?)
I can't remember why I am
(What is love all about?)
I only speak when you are thinkin'
(What is love all about?)
And they're askin' do I know what love's about
And they're askin' me if I know what love's about
Everyone should know
Everyone should know
Everyone should know
Everyone, yeah
(What is love all about?)
Everyone should knowEmbed
