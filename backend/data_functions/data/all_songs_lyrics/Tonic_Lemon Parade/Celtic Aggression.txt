Celtic Aggression LyricsSomebody cried the death of culture
Somebody spit in a little boy's face
Somebody said you robbed my homeland
Somebody got the wrong impression
So we came across the water
From the shores of the isle of green
Speaking separate tongues
In the death of culture
Somebody said you stole my language
Some people will say anything
Somebody said you robbed my heritage
Some people will believe anything
Somebody said you always spoke English
Somebody got the wrong impression
So we came across the water
From the shores of the isle of green
Speaking separate tongues
In the death of culture
Oh it was the death of culture
Oh it was the death of culture
Bhi machree
Ohin trasna na farraige
Bhi machree
Ohin trasna na farraige
So we came across the water
From the shores of the isle of green
So we came across the water
Speaking seperate tongues
In the death of culture
Oh it was the death of cultureEmbed
