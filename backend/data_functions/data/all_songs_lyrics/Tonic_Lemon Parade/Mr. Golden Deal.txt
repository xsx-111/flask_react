Mr. Golden Deal LyricsSwallow your pride
Make way for the new bride
Holding your tongue
When they call another winner
And, oh, there is more to this life
Hey, Mr. Golden Deal
Tell me, how does she feel?
She's like the wind
And that boy couldn't sail
He says I've washed these decks for years
I've carried those pails
And, oh, there is more to this life
Hey, Mr. Golden Deal
Tell me, how does she feel?
Does she hold you in the night?
Does she tell you everything
Is gonna be all right?
Hey, Mr. Golden Deal
How does she feel?
Captain, oh, my captain
Steer the first mate true
The men, they sing a song of fear
Ghosts of ships that failed before
And the captain, he is laughing
You can't control the sea
She will always do as she pleases
It's her nature to be free
And, oh, there is more to this life
Hey Mr. Golden Deal
Tell me, how does she feel?
Do you hold her in the night?
Do you tell her everything's gonna be all right?
Hey, Mr. Golden Deal
I know how you feel, ooh yeah
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I, I know
Hey, Mr. Golden Deal
How does she feel?Embed
