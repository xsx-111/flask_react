Mountain LyricsShe
She came down
From the mountain
And I
I stood my ground
On the mountain
Like a fire I'm drawn to her lust
I can't run from her but Lord I must
Like a demon I'm drawn to her flame
I'm gonna burn calling her name
I'm gonna burn calling her name
She
She came down
From the mountain
And I
I stood my ground
On the mountain
Like a fire I'm drawn to her lust
I can't run from her but Lord I must
Like a demon I'm drawn to her flame
I'm gonna burn calling her name
I'm gonna burn calling her name
She's got a sweetness, about her
That I can't explain
She's got a wonderment, about her
That I can't deny
And if we, are patient
Then maybe, we'll get it straight
On the mountain
Like a fire I'm drawn to her lust
I can't run from her but Lord I must
Like a demon I'm drawn to her flame
I'm gonna burn calling her name
I'm gonna burn calling her name
Oh I'll burn calling her nameEmbed
