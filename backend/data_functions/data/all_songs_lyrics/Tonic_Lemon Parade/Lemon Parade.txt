Lemon Parade Lyrics
I wish I'd seen you as a little girl
Without your armor to fend off the world
I would have kept you underneath my wing
I would protect you from everything

Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl

Did the boys all tease you when they had the chance?
Always left standing when it came time to dance
Did you hide behind your books, girl?
Did you find your secret friends?
Always I'll want you, always 'till the end

Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl

Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for the lemon parade
Make way for my girl
Make way for my girlEmbed
