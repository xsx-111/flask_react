Wicked Soldier LyricsOh tell the tale of the wicked soldier
Oh tell the tale of the wicked man
Oh tell the tale of the wicked soldier
Oh tell the tale of the wicked man
They say they heard him cry the fool's prayer
They say they heard him cry the fool
They say they heard him cry the fool's prayer
They say that, they just say that
For oh my love's by the old tin wall
She's waiting there, she's waiting there for me
My love's by the old tin wall
She's waiting there, she's waiting there for me
Some say the rope, she is hanging
Some say the rope, she is free
Some say the rope, she is hanging
So say the rope to hang upon me
So say the wise, she can't hear you
So say the wise, she can't hear
So say the wise, she can't hear you
Some say that, they just say that
For oh, my love's by the old tin wall
She's waiting there, she's waiting there for me
All others will compare to her
She's waiting there, she's waiting there for me
Oh my love I've waited here for you
All this time
Oh my love I've waited here for you
All this time
My love's by the old tin wall
She's waiting there, she's waiting there for me
My love's by the old tin wall
She's waiting there, she's waiting there for me
All others will compare
She'll never know
She'll never know
She'll never knowEmbed
