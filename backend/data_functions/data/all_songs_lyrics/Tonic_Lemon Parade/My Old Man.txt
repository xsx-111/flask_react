My Old Man LyricsMe and my old man
Don't see eye to eye
We take our walks outside
Underneath the birch trees
He said I think it's gonna freeze this year
I said I gotta get away from here
Me and my old man
Me and my old man
Should have been enough to know
That you'd let us all down
Could have been enough to try
Without making a sound
It's all part of the plan my dear
It's all part of the plan my dear
So we walked along the mending walls
Laid beneath the tortured talls
And we sang a song of newfound cheer
Laughed at the passing years
Yeah we talked about things to come
Talked about the battles won
He said I think it's gonna freeze this year
I said I gotta get away from here
Should have been enough to know
That you'd let us all down
Could have been enough to try
Could have been enough to try
Oh I've been such a fool
Spent my life waiting for you
Through these trees I see
With my father's eyes
I realize the weight
Should have been enough to know
That you'd let us all down
Could have been enough to try
Without making a sound
It's all part of the plan my dear
It's all part of the plan my dear
It's all part of the plan my dear
Between me and my old man
Gotta get away from here
Gotta get away from here
Gotta get away from here
Gotta get away from here
Gotta get away from hereEmbed
