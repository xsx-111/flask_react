Bigot Sunshine LyricsBig wings
And small waters
Carry me back home
Small minds
Stand protected under bigot sunshine
I'm not alone
But I'm far from Rome
You can never go home again
You can never go home again
Main street
Standing naked on the Fourth of July
Down stream
All the maniacs on my face they spy
I'm not alone
But I'm far from Rome
You can never go home again
You can never go home again
You can never act the way that you did back then
I'm not alone
But I'm far from Rome
You can never go home again
You can never go home again
You can never act the way that you did back then
You can never act the way that you did back then
When you were just a little boyEmbed
