Thick LyricsOh my sugar she won't bend
Fly with me
On your love she will depend
Fly with me, my love
When you're down, feeling low
Not quite paid for not quite sold
And they all have got you tricked
And the world has made you thick
My love she dreams
And she sleeps with broken faces inside
Cold water runs deep
When she sleeps with broken faces
I can wonder, she can see
I roll over, she will breathe
All the others make you smile
Just lay back girl don't drive for a while
My love she dreams
And she sleeps with broken faces inside
Cold water runs deep
When she sleeps with broken faces
Oh my sugar she won't bend
Fly with me
On my love she will depend
Fly with me
My love she dreams
And she sleeps with broken faces inside
Cold water runs deep
When she sleeps with broken faces
Oh my sugar she won't
Oh my sugar she won't
Oh my sugar she won't bend
Oh my sugar she won't
Oh my sugar she won't
Oh my sugar she won't bendEmbed
