Open Up Your Eyes LyricsChoosing stones
Big enough to drag me down
Where I am
People's voices make hollow sounds
Just be quiet
They'll go away
Open up your eyes
Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes
Just let me go
It's so safe
It's so safe floating in the glass
While above
While above all your troubles pass
Just be quiet
They'll go away
Open up your eyes
Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes
Just let me go
Open up your eyes
Don't let your mind tell the story here
Open up your eyes
Just let me go ,let me go ,let me go
Open up your eyes
Just let me goEmbed
