Blackberry Stone LyricsWell I own this field
And I wrote this guide
And I have no reason to reason with you
I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered
But I'd understand that I'd never let it go
I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered
But I'd understand the world does what it does
And you never did learn to let the little things go
And you never did learn to let me be
And you never did learn to let little people grow
And you never did learn how to see
But I'd whisper that I love this man now and for forever
To your soul as it floats out of the window
To the world that you turned your back on
To the world that never really let you be
And I am Laura now, and Laura still
And you did always say that one day I would suffer
Did always say that people get their pay
You did always say that I was going places
And that you wouldn't have it any other way
But I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, wouldn't let me
But I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, I needed
And I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, wouldn't let me
And I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, I needed
And I shouldn't turn my back on a sweet smelling blackberry stone1Embed
