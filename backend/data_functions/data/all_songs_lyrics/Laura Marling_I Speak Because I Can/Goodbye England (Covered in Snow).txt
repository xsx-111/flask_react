Goodbye England (Covered in Snow) LyricsYou were so smart then
In your jacket and coat
My softest red scarf was warming your throat
Winter was on us
At the end my nose
And I'll never love England more than when covered in snow
But a friend of mine says it good to hear
That you believe in love even if said in fear
Well I'll hold you there brother and set you straight
I only believe true love is frail and willing to break
I will come back here, bring me back when I'm old
I want to lay here forever in the cold
I might be cold but I'm just skin and bones
And I'll never love England more than when covered in snow
I wrote my name in your book
Only God knows why
And I bet you that he cracked a smile
And I'm clearing all the crap out of my room
Trying desperately to figure out what it is that makes me blue
And I wrote an epic letter to you
And it's 22 pages front and back but it's too good to be used
And I tried to be a girl who likes to be used
I'm too good for that, there's a mind under this hat
And I called them all and told them I've got to move
I'm out now
It's too hard
I'm on my own
It's too hard
Feel like running
Feel like running
Running off
And we will keep you
We will keep you, little one
Safe from harm
Like an extra arm, you are a part of us
You were so smart then
In your jacket and coat
My softest red scarf was warming your throat
Winter will leave us
Left the end of my nose
Well goodbye old England, until next year's snow1Embed
