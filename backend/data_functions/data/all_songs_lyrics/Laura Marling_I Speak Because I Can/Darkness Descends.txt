Darkness Descends LyricsYou're holding bits of styrofoam
With your face painted on to your friends
You listen to them whine and moan
About everything you can't understand
Can I just say I don't fear the light
But darkness descends once more into my life
And suddenly we're all alone in silence
So I take a step away
I look up to the falling snow
As it makes its home upon my face
Well I wouldn't want to ruin something I couldn't save
The gap will keep us safe
The gap will keep us safe
Step away, get me when I'm down
And suddenly I'm five years old
And I'm just so cold I want to cry
I haul up on my gentlemen
Who have always been there in hard times
They're just not like that man of mine
Who visit me from time to time
My love, I treasure you
I hear that summer's coming back
So I stretch out my back and travel a long
The winter though it darkens me
It is pure and clean and all I want
I'll apologize to the ones I love
For leaving them when the sun comes up
Too bright for me, darkness descends
Oh well I'm not well again
And once more darkness it descends
The ground is falling under me
And I can't find the means to leave
Convinced that I am going mad
Oh I bury my head into his hands
So sure that I'm loosing faith
Oh I clear a space in his fathers land
You deal with God far too young
Before you know it your life has run away1Embed
