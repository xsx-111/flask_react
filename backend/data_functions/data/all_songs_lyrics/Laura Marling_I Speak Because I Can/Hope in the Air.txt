Hope in the Air Lyrics
There is a man that I know
For seventeen years, he never spoke
Guess he had nothing to say
He opened his mouth on Judgement Day
I listened with all of my might
But was scared by the look in his eyes
Like he'd already lost the fight
And there was no hope ever in sight

No hope in the air
No hope in the water
Not even for me
Your last serving daughter

Why fear death, be scared of living
Our hearts are small and ever thinning
There is no hope ever of winning
Oh, why fear death, be scared of living

I have seen men provoked
And I have seen lives revoked
And I looked at my life and I choked
From there no more ever I spoke
I can't give up that quick
My life is a candle and a wick
You can put it out, but you can't break it down
In the end we are waiting to be lit

There's hope in the air
There's hope in the water
But sadly not me
Your last serving daughter

A friend is a friend forever
And a good one will never leave, never
But you've never been south of what blows off your mouth
You will never understand that, ever
You speak minds handed down to you
By the lies, handed down by your truth
And your angels will dance at your will
Will mask your scrambling youth
I forgave you your shortcomings
And ignored your childish behaviour
Laid a kiss on your head
And before I left said, "Stay away from fleeting favour"
There's hope in the air
There's hope in the water
But sadly not me
Your last serving daughter


Pick up your rope, Lord, sling it to me
If we are to battle, I must not be weak
And give us your strength, world, and your food, and your water
Oh, I am your saviour, your last serving daughter

There's hope in the air
There's hope in the water
But sadly not me
Your last serving daughter
There's hope in the air
There's hope in the water
But no hope for me
Your last serving daughter1Embed
