I Speak Because I Can LyricsMy husband left me last night
Left me a poor and lonely wife
I cook the meals and he got the life
Now I'm just old for the rest of my time
For he, Oh he, oh my
I speak because I can
To anyone I trust enough to listen
You speak because you can
To anyone who'll hear what you say
I swear it was not my choice
I used to be so kind
Never rode my bike down to the sea
Never finished that letter I was writing
Never got up and said anything
Worthy, for he, for my
Graceful sleeper
You midnight dreamer
I'm floored by your sound
I'm floored by your sound
I swear it was not my choice
To reach out for someone wise
I used to be so kind
I used to be so kind
In the breaking of the morning we'll be dancing on my soft lawn
When you're shaking out the anger that stops you from taking my call
When you're running up the highway
Singing I'm the king, the king of you all
When you look back to where it started
I'll be there waving you on
Never rode my bike down to the sea
Never quite figured out what I believe
Never got up and said anything
Worthy, for he, for my1Embed
