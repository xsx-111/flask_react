Made by Maid Lyrics
They danced like sirens, hoping the sun would come out again
And I was born in the fog of that day
Could they hear a babe, under all that faith
Or have they forgot what it was they made?

Crawled out of the fog, found a river
Found a log and floated away
Didn't think I'd be coming back this way
But my feet resolute, found their root
And brought me back to its place

And on the hill where I was born
There is a rose without a thorn
They cut it off each year and give it away
But can they hear a babe, after all these days
Or have they forgot what it was that they made?

So left to wander blind
I find myself in cautious times, and they say
Love's labors never lost
But labor on to this very day
So I walk into the fog
Find a babe atop a log, and all alone
Took him under, took him on
Taught him everything about the world I've come to know
He blames me for every wrong ever he made
I'm blamed for every wrong ever he made
Forgive me I am only a maid
Forgive me I am only a maid
But I can still see a babe
Under all that blame
But I am forgot from the day I am laidEmbed
