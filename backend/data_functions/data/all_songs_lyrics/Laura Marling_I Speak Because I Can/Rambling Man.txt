Rambling Man LyricsOh na√Øve little me
Asking what things you have seen
And you're vulnerable in your head
You'll scream and you'll wail 'till you're dead
Creatures veiled by night
Following things that aren't right
And they're tired and they need to be led
But you'll scream and wail 'till you're dead
But give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am
Beaten battered cold
My children will live just to grow old
But if I sit here and weep
I'll be blown over by the slightest of breeze
And the weak need to be led
And the tender are carried to their bed
And it's a cold and pale affair
And I'll be dammed if I'll be found there
But give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am
It's funny that the first chords that you come to
Are the minor notes that come to serenade you
And it's hard to accept yourself as someone, you don't desire
As someone you don't want to be
Oh give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am
Oh give me to the rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am1Embed
