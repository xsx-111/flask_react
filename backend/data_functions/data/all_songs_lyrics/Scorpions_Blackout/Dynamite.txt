Dynamite Lyrics
Kick your ass to heaven
With rock'n'roll tonight
I'll make this night a special one
Make you feel all right
Shoot my heat into your body
Give ya all my size
I'm gonna beat the beat tonight
It's time to break the ice

Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite

Hit the top together
Get ya with me spell
I'm gonna make my shot tonight
Take you down to hell
Eat your meat until your're breathless
Twirl your hips around
I'm gonna break my neck tonight
I'll get you off the ground
Dynamite
You're Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite

Get it now or never
Let's get it really tight
We'll make this night a special one
Make us feel all right
Put your heat into my body
Give ya all my size
We're gonna beat the beat tonight
Come on let's break the ice

Dynamite
You're Dynamite
Dynamite
Dynamite
Baby you're Dynamite
Dynamite
