Blackout Lyrics
I realize I missed a day
But I'm too wrecked to care anyway
I look around and see this face
What the hell have I lost my taste

Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

My head explodes my ears ring
I can't remember just where I've been
The last thing that I recall
I got lost in a deep black hole

Don't want to find out
Just want to cut out

Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
I grab my things and make a run
On my way out, another one
Would like to know before I stop
Did I make it or did I flop

Don't want to find out
Just want to get out, yeah!

Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout

Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I really had a blackout, baby

Don't want to find out
Just want to get out
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout
Blackout
I really had a blackout

Blackout
Blackout
Blackout
Oh, yeah....!1Embed
