When the Smoke Is Going Down LyricsJust when you make your way back home
I find some time to be alone
I go to see the place once more
Just like a thousand nights before
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
This is the place where I belong
I really love to turn you on
I've got your sound still in my ears
While your traces disappear
I climb the stage again this night
Cause the place seems still alive
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going down
When the smoke is going downEmbed
