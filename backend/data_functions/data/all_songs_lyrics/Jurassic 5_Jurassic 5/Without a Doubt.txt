Without a Doubt Lyrics
You know we turn the party out (Without a doubt)
And show em what it's about (Without a doubt)
We'll win whether you like it or not (Without a doubt)
We make it hot (Without a doubt)
You know we turn the party out (Without a doubt)
And show em what it's about (Without a doubt)
We'll win whether you like it or not (Without a doubt)
We make it hot (Without a doubt)

We keep it heated like stones in Hell's Kitchen
MC's are wishing that they had a pot to piss in

Akil is on a mission to smash the competition
I whip my opposition with words into a sentence
And combat your verbal attacks with no assistance
I'm too consistent for you brothers to keep bitching
Pay close attention to my verbal composition
I keep it distant like my love for the business
You ask "What is this? Is it real or fictitious?"
I kill the wise and intelligent rebels with precision

It's a true conspiracy, battle for world supremacy
Huh, send me brothers they maybe try to contend with me
But me and my staff soon shine like a perfect half moon
And get you open like a public bathroom, paragraph doom
The vicious lyric solicitor
No commissioner keeping it different for my listeners
Taking no prisoners, sealing perimeters
Never singular, giving you something that you remember because
You know we turn the party out (Without a doubt)
And show em what it's about (Without a doubt)
We'll win whether you like it or not (Without a doubt)
We make it hot (Without a doubt)
You know we turn the party out (Without a doubt)
And show em what it's about (Without a doubt)
We'll win whether you like it or not (Without a doubt)
We make it hot (Without a doubt)

We recommend Jurassic 5 like daily check-ups
From waist to your neck up, so next man step up

You're now the victim of a vocal verbal stick up
My style will make you get up and down just like a sit up
To those who want to get us, brother keep your chin up
What up? I roll with winners, beyond beginners
The average nigga squeezes triggers when your rap style's bigger
How you figure that you can disrespect my art?
I know the true MC's take this life to heart
Let's take it back to the start, Donnie Dew kick your part

And it's the outlaw about to rock y'all, now watch my hands go
Over the nickle full black tainted pearl handle
And watch it ricochet, captivate the airwaves
Hit you with the ever blade connected with the wordplay
Mister Professional with the clever flows
Hear it on your radio, Donnie Brasco
With the defness, and the ways of the West
Represent the flavor breathless
You know we turn the party out (Without a doubt)
And show em what it's about (Without a doubt)
We'll win whether you like it or not (Without a doubt)
We make it hot (Without a doubt)
You know we turn the party out (Without a doubt)
And show em what it's about (Without a doubt)
We'll win whether you like it or not (Without a doubt)
We make it hot (Without a doubt)
Uh, no doubt, when J5 comes, that's rightEmbed
