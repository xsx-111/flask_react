The Sage LyricsI carry the dust of a journey
That cannot be shaken away
It lives deep within me
For I breathe it every day
You and I are yesterday's answers
The earth of the past come to flesh
Eroded by time's rivers
To the shapes we now possess
Come share of my breath and my substance
And mingle our streams and our times
In bright infinite moments
Our reasons are lost in our rhymesEmbed
