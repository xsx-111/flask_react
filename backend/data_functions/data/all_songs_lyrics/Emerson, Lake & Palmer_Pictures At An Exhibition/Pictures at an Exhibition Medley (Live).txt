Pictures at an Exhibition Medley (Live) Lyrics
Lead me from tortured dreams
Childhood themes of nights alone
Wipe away endless years
Childhood tears as dry as stone
From seeds of confusion
Illusions dark blossoms have grown
Even now in furrows of sorrow
The doubt still is sown
My life's course is guided
Decided by limits drawn
On charts of my past ways
And pathways since I was born

I carry the dust of a journey
That cannot be shaken away
It lives deep within me
For I breathe it every day
You and I are yesterday's answers
The earth of the past come to flesh
Eroded by time's rivers
To the shapes we now possess
Come share of my breath and my substance
And mingle our streams and our times
In bright infinite moments
Our reasons are lost in our rhymes

Come forth, from love's spire
Born in life's fire
Born in life's fire
Come forth, from love's spire
In the burning, all are  yearning
For life to be
And in pain there will  be gain
New Life!
Stirring in, salty streams
And dark hidden seams
Where the fossil sun gleams
They were, sent from  the gates
Ride the tides of fate
Ride the tides of fate
They were, sent from  the gates
In the burning all are  yearning
For life to be
They were, sent from  the gates
Ride the tides of fate
Ride the tides of fate
They were, sent from  the gates
In the burning all are  yearning
For life to be
There's no end to my life
No beginning to my death:
Death is lifeEmbed
