The Great Gates of Kiev Lyrics
Come forth, from love's pyre
Born in life's fire
Born in life's fire
Come forth, from love's fire
In the burning, all are yearning
For life to be

And in pain there will be gain
Blasts of new life!
Stirring in, salty streams
And dark hidden seams
Where the fossil sun gleams

They were, sent from the gates
Ride the tides of fate
Ride the tides of fate
They were, sent from the gates
In the burning all are yearning
For life to be


They were, sent from the gates
Ride the tides of fate
Ride the tides of fate
They were, sent from the gates
In the burning all are yearning
For life to be
Oh, to be
To be!
There's no end to my life
No beginning to my death
Death is life1Embed
