Beef Boloney Lyrics
My baby, she been talkin' about, talkin' about, talkin' about a low down skag-a-doo
And, and she sing, and my baby sing, my baby talkin' about, just about a low down skag-a-doo, child, woo-hoo
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

Don't like cash, she don't like phonies
She don't like junkies, she don't like drunkies
She just wants my beef bologna

Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna
Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna
Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna

Don't like salami, she don't want pastrami
She don't want no chicken, don't want no roast
She just wants her my double dose

Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna
Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna
Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna
Don't like salami, she don't want pastrami
She don't want no chicken, don't want no roast
She just wants her my double dose

Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna
Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna
Beef, beef, beef, beef bologna

That ain't all
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hah1Embed
