Fresh Flesh LyricsFresh flesh, slingin' down your street
Fresh flesh, won't you eat my meat?
Fresh flesh, oozin' through the slime
Fresh flesh, and the city's mine!
Fresh flesh!
Fresh flesh!
Under the subway ditch
Chewin' on some old bitch!
With nothin' else to do
I just might you
If you get in my way
I cut your leg, won't pay!
Drop you off downtown
Watch you crawl around!
Fresh flesh!
Fresh flesh!
I don't wanna fuck you to death
I don't wanna smell your breath
Piss on your warm embrace!
I just wanna cum in your face!
I don't care if you're dead
And I don't care if you eat lead!
I don't care if you're all cut up -
Blood on your dress!
Fresh flesh!
Fresh flesh!
Fresh flesh!
Fresh flesh!Embed
