We Gotta Get Out of This Place LyricsIn this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
My girl you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due!
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
'cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
My girl you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due!
See my daddy in bed a-dyin'
See his hair been turnin' grey
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
'cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'
We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
'cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
Better life for me and you Embed
