Camarillo Lyrics
First, I fell down and then I got shot up again!
First, I fell down, then I got shot up again!
First, I fell down and then I got shot up and...
First, I fell down and then I got shot up again!

Sanitarium!
Electro-shockin' 'em!
Disciplinary correctional surgery
We're not thera—
We're not thera—
We're not therapeutic

First, I fell down, then I got shot up again!
First I fell down, then I got shot up again!
First I fell down, then I got shot up again!
We just love it here, 'cause it's all really therapeutic!Embed
