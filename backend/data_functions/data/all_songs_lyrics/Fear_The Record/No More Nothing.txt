No More Nothing LyricsNo more peace talks!
No more disarmament!
No more Mr. Nice Guy!
No more nothing! 
No more Playboy!
No more Newsweek!
No more Walter Cronkite!
No more watered down television crap!
No more nothing! 
No more whinin'!
No more sulkin'!
No more nothing! 
No more Scientology!
No more EST!
No more Jim Jones!
No more suck-ass philosophy!
No more nothing! Embed
