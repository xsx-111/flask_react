Mingusings LyricsBoy I wish you weren't such a paranoid actress
And I the assassinated candidate
I feel like an accidental species
Some mutant love-child, never meant to be
No motion dancing, feel like we're an impossibility
Trying to keep the heart in the head but I was so down on the closing night
Couldn't even fake a smile, wanting to fire all my friends
And just start over again
Ah! Sisters don't you know, our shit is only gonna get better
Ah don'tcha know don'tcha know don'tcha know
I feel like the last time is gonna be
My final collapse
Ah! Sisters don't you know, our shit is only gonna get better
Ohh ohh aahhh ahhhh
I feel like the last time is gonna be
My final collapse
I know from past experience
He never takes it easy on his readers
And you'll become a foreign substance lying in your familial bed
Technology makes such an ugly mother
But no lessons does it offer only chaos scenarios
And the dream that we've inherited, look it's just random numbers
Still they love you at the office cause you've been the subject of countless masturbation fantasies
