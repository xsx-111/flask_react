Wicked Wisdom LyricsI'm the motherfuckin' headliner, bitch, you don't even know it
(Process it!)
I'm a motherfuckin' headliner, bitch, you don't even know it
Why is it white girls don't ever have any ideas and they don't even know what's on my channel?
But that is true for almost everyone
Everyone but you
My goat, my crab, my scorpion
You're my icons cause you're different
You're different
All the wicked dreams
Have turned my head to wet concrete
Don't send me no more evil visions
They just stab my heart
I'm just a powdered belle
And I don't know what you people are all about (my chalkie people)
What you people are all about (you're made of chalk)
I just know how to make it
(Peanut butter) Like this
Oooh, just a look at her is god
Can't you see it baby
Can't you see it baby
Can't you see it baby
(I'm like)
Oooh, just a look at her is god
Can't you see it baby
Can't you see it baby
Can't you see it baby
When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
When we get together
When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
It's always we are the champions, my friends
When we get together
We gonna hit
What we got to work with
Ooh, you've got such super wicked style
Show it to me baby
Let me see it baby
Show me to your baby
Ooh, you've got such super wicked style
Show it to me baby
Let me see it baby
Show me to your baby
When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
When we get together
When we get together
It's always hot magic
When we get together
It's always we are the champions, my friends
When we get together
We're gonna hit
What you work with
All I care to hear
All the scuttling grey insects inside the house machines
Know what comes next
Some contemporary reference for they’re off our side
All I care to hear
Elitist commentary about some Phaidon press limited edition
I hear the toy ball bouncing on cheap hardwood through their elegant conceit
All I care to hear
You have such power to destroy
No time to process that now
(no time)
You’re so iconic in my mindEmbed
