Nonpareil of Favor LyricsMy lover, I've been donating time to review
All the misinterpretations that define me and you
And I'm thinking about you
In my secret language
Cause I know you're the only one
Who can help me take it easy
Now I'm happy in the head
Knowing there ain't no sucker in the world
That's a threat to us
We've become material
It's like hey you were always there
Just on the tip of my tongue
And I needed you to happen, yeah
And now that you happened
And it really really really came true
I feel like I oughta thank somebody
So I'm gonna thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you
So I'm calling your ass up at like
Three in the morning saying
"Wake up young dragon, let's go get compromised"
You'll be my little ally and
You can have it which way you choose
Now I'm so bombed out by your paradigm kisses
How I've hacked at our southern hemispheric eleven gods
Now I'm cracking my sweet love
I'm cracking my sweet love
I'm cracking my sweet love
I'm cracking my sweet love1Embed
