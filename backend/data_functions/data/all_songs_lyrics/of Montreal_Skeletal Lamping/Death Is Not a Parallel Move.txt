Death Is Not a Parallel Move LyricsAll of my thoughts are from a foreign host
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
All of my thoughts are from a foreign host
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
All of my thoughts are from a foreign host
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Now I feel just like a ghost
Don't be afraid lille v채n of violence
I'm only poisoning you, not gonna stab you
Don't be afraid lille v채n of my troubled mind
I'm just poisoning you a little
With my gloom
There's far too much light and noise
It happens to be not so nice
I must numb
I must shatter
I must diffuse
This fractured consciousness
This soft abuse
The identity I composed out of terror has become oppressive now
I must (deny) defy (defeat) this dark assignment
I'm over it now
I'm so over it now
Don't be afraid lille v채n of violence
I'm only poisoning you, not gonna shoot you
Don't be afraid lille v채n of my troubled mind
I'm just poisoning you a little
