Plastis Wafer LyricsLover face, I view you as the
Revolver introduced in my play, act one
Lover face, want to make you ejaculate
'til it's no longer fun
I confess to really being quite charmed
By your feminine effects
You're the only one
With whom I would role play Oedipus Rex

I want you to be my pleasure puss
I want to know what it's like to be inside you
I want you to be my pleasure puss
I want to know how it feels
(x2)
Want to give you that ou la ou la la
Want to give you that ou la ou la la
Lover face, how your ass is pumping
Sweet licentious songs. lover face
You're a scandal, your body is so wrong, wrong
Bless my lips with your Sunlandic kisses
(Kiss me)
While our hands explore each other's human vessels
Whoa, you know, like four excited spiders
I want you to be my pleasure puss
I want to know what it's like to be inside you
I want you to be my pleasure puss
I want to know how it feels
(x2)
Want to give you that ou la ou la la
Want to give you that ou la ou la la
You gave me such a rush
Make my whole body blush
I don't care if they say you're just my crutch
I know you're not
You're the only good thing I've got
Everything's so much more complicated
Over the phone
You are such a fucking star, oh, you know you are
I just once looked through today
Had the mind to call your name, internally
Through my seventh sense that's hallucinating
Anyway we're artifacts of demigodly zero logic denizens
I just came in your arms tonight
You and I are friends, not some polemic
To be puzzled over, listen
They set my wings so randomly
When you're dead I'll search for you like Orpheus
I'll find you, some way
You are such a fucking star, oh, you know you are
I'll tell you one thing
I know you want my kisses in your narcissistic collapse
Because it's so painful when they amputate the ego
See all the pretty corpses lined up along beach
They're ringing the bells of the church to drive everybody insane
As the patina lips of the fountain stallion vomits water on the shirtless little brat
I can't get all those moving lights off her face
No, I can't get all those little moving lights off her face
So I went out to the country, sat down on some straw
But I'm not putting out for God tonight
I'm not putting out for God, keeping my legs shut, shut
It's a mistake lighting little white candles to make him love you
Oh, he's cold by any city's standards
They want to turn you down
It's messed
"How 'bout if I wilt your plantations?"
No
Ha
Stop
"You know the nightmares, they don't forget about you?" (they don't)
God damn the concierge to a dreadful reincarnation
I think I can do it by myself
Just trying to get healthyEmbed
