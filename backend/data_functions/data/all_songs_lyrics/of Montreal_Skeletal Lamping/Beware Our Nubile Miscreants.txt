Beware Our Nubile Miscreants LyricsYou only like him cause
He's sexually appealing
But I read his journal
It was very revealing
He fucked your sister
In an elevator junior year
Oh yeah oh yeah
And let your brother suck him
But then beat him
So he could prove
He wasn't queer
Oh no
So what do you think
He has in store for you
My dear?
You only like him cause
He's sexually appealing
But I've seen him working
I am getting the feeling
He has some serious predatory
Domination issues
Oh yeah oh yeah
He goes to climax alone
His heart beats a busy tone
Oh oh oh
He's the sort of guy who will leave you
In a k-hole
To go play Halo in the other room
Remember
While you were bereaving Michael's death
He was over at Rachel's cooking crystal meth
Oh, don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
You only like him cause
He's sexually appealing
But his psychic's prediction
Has him hanging from a ceiling fan
In eight months
All our wizard dreams are still not possible
All our wizard dreams are still so possible
All our tough little dreams you know they're still possible
And this goes directly to you
I don't know, I don't know
What it is that you want from me
But you
You cannot have me
If you could read my mind
Know what I really feel
I wonder would we still be friends?Embed
