Forgiveness Lyrics(Doesn't mean that
Doesn't mean that
Stations of the
Doesn't mean that, doesn't mean that)
I've come to beg for forgiveness
So forgive me
And I'll take all that I'm given
All that I'm given
And I dream to live by your reason
I am my reason
But I read all of my speeches
All of my speeches
I've walked Stations of the Cross
Doesn't mean that much, doesn't mean that much
I've come to beg for forgiveness
So forgive me
And I'll take all that I'm given
All that I'm given
And I've tried to teach by my doing
Your undoing
But my time will be your ruin
Will be your ruin
I've walked Stations of the Cross
Doesn't mean that much, doesn't mean that much
I've walked Stations of the Cross
Doesn't mean that much, doesn't mean that muchEmbed
