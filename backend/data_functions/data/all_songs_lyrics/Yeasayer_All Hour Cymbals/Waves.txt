Waves LyricsCan you feel it?
Making waves
The bubbles churn(?)
And curls turn(?)
On a cloud that doesn't fade
Like the wheels of a motorcade
Like the star in a float parade
Like it's time to celebrate
Like Grandma's house it smells so great
Can you feel it?
It's in your bones
Love texts sent from each other(?)
On a cellular telephone
Like the thought of getting old
In the cemetery home
All the things I should've known
I'll find my wave or ride aloneEmbed
