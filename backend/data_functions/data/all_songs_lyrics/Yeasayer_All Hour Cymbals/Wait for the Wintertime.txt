Wait for the Wintertime LyricsOn a cold day, nothing's gonna stop us
'Cause on a cold day, you can see forever
On a cold day, nothing's gonna stop us
'Cause on a cold day, you can walk through metal
In a brick yard, we'll be making babies
In a brick yard, it's raining up in heaven
Solid gold now, nothing's gonna stop us
Solid gold now, solid, solid gold
A man can be happy with the weather
As long as he doesn't love her
Snow will fall, be a storm, there's nowhere warm
To run and hide
Wintertime is a razor blade the devil made
It's the price we pay for the summertime
In a brick yard, we'll be making babies
In a brick yard, it's raining up in heaven
Solid gold now, nothing's gonna stop us
Solid gold now, solid, solid gold
A man can be happy with the weather
As long as he doesn't love her
Snow will fall, be a storm, there's nowhere warm
To run and hide
Wintertime is a razor blade the devil made
It's the price we pay for the summertimeEmbed
