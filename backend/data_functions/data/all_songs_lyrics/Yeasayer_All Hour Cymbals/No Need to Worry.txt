No Need to Worry LyricsSister won't you rise with me?
Run 'way from your grave
Father set our house to flame
Please his new family
Brother won't you steal away?
Dreams of night a play
Father set our house ablaze
Blackened stones, I beg you speak
Of the murderous hand
Words will never sound again
On this shadowland
Blackened sky, I beg you weep
What the day has lost
No one left to weep for us
No need to worry
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
No need to worry
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
No need to worry
We'll get some jewelry for your momma
