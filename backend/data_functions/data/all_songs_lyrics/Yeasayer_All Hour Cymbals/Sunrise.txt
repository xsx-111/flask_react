Sunrise LyricsIt all started with a stumble
When I get old then I'll get humble
The sky cracked a million ways
Making me blind
And as the trees grew higher and higher
And the fish began to fly
I went and stole some wings
And thought why can't I
Get in the sunrise
I want to get in the sunrise
Lift the world upon your shoulders
I stay young while I watch everyone getting older
You could take a million years
Out of my head
But I'm starting to lose my place
In the circles that I trace
And if I let go only then
Will my face
Get in the sunrise
I want to get in the sunrise
I want to get in the sunrise
I want to get in the sunrise
(Do you hear me now
Oh, won't you hear me now)
(But in the end
I'm paper, you're glue
I get stuck on you)Embed
