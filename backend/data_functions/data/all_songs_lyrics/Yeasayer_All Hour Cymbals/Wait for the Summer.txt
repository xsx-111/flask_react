Wait for the Summer LyricsLife is easier when one of us is dead
I will wait a year
No one's thoughts are near an accidental fall
And they won't suspect a thing at all
Wait for the summer
We'll sleep where we wanna
Don't tell your mother
We'll leave when we, we'll leave when we wanna
And I have dreamed about it
How I'll read about it
And I can grieve about it
And I can hear
Someone help me, someone help me
Someone help me please
Someone help me, someone help me
Someone help me please
Just an accidental fall
And they won't suspect a thing at all
Wait for the summer
We'll eat what we wanna
Look at your mother
Is that who you, is that who you wanna?
Killed my lady here when I was drinking
Held her neck too long, won't she stop screaming?
What a proud old mare, what was she thinking?
I hear her voice sometimes, when I've been dreaming
Killed my lady here when I was dreaming
Held her neck too long, what was I thinking?
What a proud old mare, won't she stop screaming?
I hear voice sometimes, when I've been drinking
When I've been drinking
Rising, rising, falling down
I'm rising, rising, falling down
I'm rising, rising, falling down
I'm rising, rising, falling down
I kissed my baby with a bullet
Words I shot right into her head
And I'm falling, falling, falling down
Sink into the river, sink into the riverbed
I kissed my baby with a bullet
Words that shot right into her head
And I'm falling, falling, falling down
Sink into the river, sink into the riverbed
Killed my lady here when I was dreaming
Held her neck too long, what was I thinking?
What a proud old mare, won't she stop screaming?
I hear voice sometimes, when I've been drinking
When I've been drinking
I'm rising, rising, falling down
I'm rising, rising, falling down
I'm rising, rising, falling down
I'm rising, rising, falling downEmbed
