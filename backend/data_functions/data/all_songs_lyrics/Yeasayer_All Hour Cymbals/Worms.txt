Worms LyricsI know headaches are always
Someplace on my mind
But your drug
Just make it worse, love
Little pains are just fine
Sometimes, medicine works well
Chemicals help out, for sure
But your drug
Just make it worse, love
The treatment's worse than the cure
But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned
As long as the sun's in the heavens
The worm stays underground
But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned
As long as the sun's in the heavens
The worm stays underground
But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned
As long as the sun's in the heavens
The worm stays underground
But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drowned
As long as the sun's in the heavens
The worm stays underground
But when there's a rain fills the meadow
The worm he can't be drownedEmbed
