Red Cave Lyrics
I went out, past the willow and the well
Caught my breath upon the hill
At the edge of the domain
And I went down, and fell down
And when I got up
I’m at the red cave
And without sound as if I had been put under a spell
She led me to her whirlpool
Warm despite a winter’s day

Mary’s house in the hollow of the white hazel
Rapid whirlpool
And the church of the red cave

I’m so blessed to have spent the time
With my family
And the friends I love
In my short life
I have met
So many people I deeply care forEmbed
