Germs LyricsMy ears are ringing
There's a tingling in the back of my throat
Can't stop all the pressure building up in my head
In the night
Everybody wants it
Everybody needs it
Everybody needs it
What's hurting me when I breathe?
Perhaps it's just mold on the ceiling?
Everybody's coming down with the same thing
Everybody's coming down with the same thing
Germs!
They'll get you when you're not careful
Germs!
They'll get you when you're not careful
Germs!
They'll get you when you're not careful
Germs!
They'll get you when you're not careful
Germs!
They'll get you when you're not careful
Germs!
They'll get you when you're not careful
Better get some medicine
If you know what's good for you
Sand in my throat, sand in my throat
And I wanna turn the water onEmbed
