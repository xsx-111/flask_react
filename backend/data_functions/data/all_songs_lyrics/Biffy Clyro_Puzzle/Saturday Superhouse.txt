Saturday Superhouse Lyrics
I'll be sitting on the left side
You'll be sitting on the right
Dying to share our problems, make everything alright
Then I see a darkness
You see the blinding light
Will Oldham's in the corner moaning, "Can't you write your own lines?"

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid, 'cus here it comes
You're not the lucky ones

There's a dozen corpses on the left side
Swear one's smiling at me
Compliments on your confessions baby, wow, you really showed me
You think that you're full of conviction
Really you're just trying to survive
Tie them up then spit them out, it's good to help the boy shine

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid, 'cus here it comes
You're not the lucky ones
(Instrumental break)

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid, 'cus here it comes
You're not the lucky ones

If we don't know where we belong
It'll make no difference from where we started
Look out kid, 'cus here it comes
You're not the lucky ones

You're not the lucky ones
You're not the lucky ones1Embed
