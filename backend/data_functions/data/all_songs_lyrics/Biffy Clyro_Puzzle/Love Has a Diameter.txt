Love Has a Diameter Lyrics
You can give up if you like
Your head's lying down at your feet
You can call on the phone
Any time you want to talk to me
If you know who you are
You can always go round and see
If you don't and you're scared
Comcentrate and grit your teeth

I'm watching the radio cause I don't compare
I'm watching the radio but it's the television looking at me
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

Feathers will fly if you shoot
A bullet full of bubblegum
At my throat or my heart
I'm protected by a hummingbird
Receive only luck if you can
It wouldn't be a constant mistake
Over-flown but under-worn
So please come and follow me
I'm watching the radio cause I don't compare
I'm watching the radio but it's the television looking at me
I'm watching the radio cause I don't compare
I'm watching the radio but it's the television looking, the television looking at me

Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
(I'm a clown, and you're a thief)
Woah
(Dressed in blood, it tastes so sweet)
Woah
(Take it on, the quiet storm)
Woah
(It's not like you and me)
Woah

I'm watching the radio cause I don't compare
I'm watching the radio but it's the television looking at me
(I'm a clown, and you're a thief)
I'm watching the radio cause I don't compare
(Take it on, the quiet storm)
I'm watching the radio but it's the television looking, the television looking at me
Wooooah
Wooooah
(Television looking at me)
Wooooah
Wooooah
(Television looking at me)
Wooooah
Wooooah
(Television looking at me)Embed
