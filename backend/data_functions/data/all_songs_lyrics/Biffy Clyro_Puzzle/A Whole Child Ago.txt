A Whole Child Ago Lyrics
I don't want to let you know, your heart's an attraction
But I know what you're looking for
It's me you're waiting for
You're not allowed to live anymore

And a whole child ago I would sleep all day
Doing handstands in bottle bins to prove that I'm sane
And I'm not fooling around

Looks like we made it
(I can tell that you've been flying)
Looks like we made it tonight

I'm the second devil on your right or left with an eyeball
Melting out the corner of my mouth
Your wings are bleeding
You're not supposed to fly anymore

And a whole child ago I would sleep all day
Doing handstands in bottle bins to prove that I'm sane
And I'm not fooling around
Looks like we made it
(I can tell that you've been flying)
Looks like we made it tonight
Looks like we made it
I can tell that you've been flying
I saw in the sky

Why don't you just ask her yourself?
Why don't you just ask her yourself?
Why don't you just ask her yourself?
Why don't you just ask her yourself?
Why don't you just ask her yourself?
Why don't you just ask her yourself?Embed
