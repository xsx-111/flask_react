9/15ths LyricsWe're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
Are you irrelevant? You're falling to pieces
How do you become one again?
Are you an elephant? You crush me to pieces
How do you, how do you do?
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help us, We're on a hellslide
We're on a hellslide, help us, help usEmbed
