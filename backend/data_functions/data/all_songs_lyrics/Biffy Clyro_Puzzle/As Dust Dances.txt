As Dust Dances Lyrics
There's a man on the corner selling dozens of bones
Every type of bone except the one that I want
Ever think what your eyes do when trying to sleep
Or where your tongue rests, is it against your teeth?

But now, it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch

Asleep is the safest place you can be
You can try hard to catch it, it just catches you
Imagine a camera coming up from your feet
Relax all your muscles, son, just hope your heart's in one piece

Now, it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch
It's bigger than a halo, a devil, an angel, and a crow
The bone's got the wrong detail, I hoped it would have
Save for a shinbone or even a hand

Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Such a lonely ride, such a lonely ride
Now, it's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything it decides to touch
The bone's got the wrong detail, I hoped it would have for you
Save for a shinbone or even a hand

There's a man on the corner selling dozens of bones
Every type of bone except the one that I wantEmbed
