The Conversation Is ... Lyrics
I wander streets at night and hope to God to see your face
The fluorescent billboards sell a wonderful life that doesn't exist anymore

The conversation is
The conversation is over

What will I do if I'm wrong?
Will I blame it on everyone
Else like I always do?
So I'm a coward because of you

Are pills the only way to make myself complete again
They become the only way to a wonderful life with a happy ending

The conversation is
The conversation is over

What will I do if I'm wrong?
Will I blame it on everyone
Else like I always do?
I'm a coward because of you
I'm finding it hard to explain
Why I think that I'm right again
I'd love someone else to blame
So I'm a coward because of you
And then you try to understand
What it takes to be a man
And then you look into your heart
It defines you

What will I do if I'm wrong?
Will I blame it on everyone
Else like I always do?
I'm a coward because of you
I'm finding it hard to explain
Why I think that I'm right again
I'd love someone else to blame
So I'm a coward because of you

And then you try to understand
What it takes to be a man
And then you look into your heart
It defines you

The conversation is over
The conversation is overEmbed
