Coward Lyrics
Make up your mind, ignore your senses
Leave us behind, we're willing you sadness
Remember a time you would listen to me
Embrace your demise, improves your senses
Eyes open wide, we're saving our madness
The end of time
Until the end of time

The Cowards become the profiteer
The Cowards become the profiteer
Get on your knees and worship it boy?
Cowards become the profiteer
The Cowards become the profiteer
Get on your knees and start the tribute

Covered in white the words for masses
Egger desires, you know your limits
Wake up your dead
Wake up your dead
Make up your mind, ignore your senses
Leave us behind, we're willing you sadness
Remember a time
Do you remember a time?
The Cowards become the profiteer
The Cowards become the profiteer
Get on your knees and worship it boy?
Cowards become the profiteer
The Cowards become the profiteer
Get on your knees and start the tribute
Some people are scared to take chances
Got to leave them behind 
Whoooooo WhoooooooEmbed
