Semi-Mental Lyrics
I smoke my face in, night after night
To numb the pain and stop the world spinning round and round
But how was I to know that in my mind I'm not so pure?
Look into my eyes, you can see I'm many different people

You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental

I'm not a drinker, I try it every night
I force it down to throw it up and start all over again
But I will climb a tower just to stick my flag on top
And look down on everyone, well help me to salute the people

You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental

You have tried to resist the pain but you know you're not alone
No, you know you're not alone
I have tried to resist the pain but now I'm all alone
And now I'm all alone
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental
You shone a light on my life, now I'm just sentimental

Are you irrelevant? You've fallen to pieces
How do you become one again?
Are you an elephant? You'll crush me to pieces
How do you
How do you do?Embed
