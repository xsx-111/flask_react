Folding Stars Lyrics
Take a long hard look at yourself
How did you end up here?
The blood drips like red inverted balloons
Tomorrow is a promise to no-one

If you want, follow me and I'll lead you aside
You don't have to run and hide

Eleanor, Eleanor
I would do anything for another minute with you cause
It's not getting easier, it's not getting easier

In a bedroom with no windows or doors
All the happy people are crying
You can't hold a gaze for a second or two
It always ends in total darkness

If you want, follow me and I'll lead you aside
You don't have to run and hide

Eleanor, Eleanor
I would do anything for another minute with you cause
It's not getting easier, it's not getting easier
You will be folding stars, Eleanor
You can't ever understand
It's not getting easier, it's not getting easier
It ends in a place with no love only hate
And a mirror reflecting the truth
In your eyes, in your face you can't wash it away
From your cold, cold heart

Eleanor, Eleanor
I would do anything for another minute with you cause
It's not getting easier, it's not getting easier

You will be folding stars, Eleanor
You can't ever understand
It's not getting easier, it's not getting easier
It's not getting easier, not getting easier
I hope that you're folding starsEmbed
