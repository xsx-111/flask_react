Living Is a Problem Because Everything Dies Lyrics
Come on baby, do you think it's good to feel
Like I'm lying here, swimming in memories?
I fear God because everything dies, babe
Got a gun in the back of my car
A spasm of good sense is making my eye twitch
I've had enough of all your consolation
I'm drowning, caught in a shit tide
Tape my face to the inside of love
Nothing to eat but fingers in the back seat
Well I've met God and he had nothing to say to me
I pray to God that you're right before my eyes
Bathed in white light with halos in your eyes
Don't wanna waste no more time
Time's what we don't have
Everywhere I look, someone dies
Wonder when it's my turn

How well do you know me?
Leave an open door
What you looking for?
Babe, when you come down?
I built a time machine to escape from
All the pain in the back of my car
Living's a problem cause everything dies, babe
Save yourself, I'm not too far away
I pray to God that you're right before my eyes
Bathed in white light with halos in your eyes
Don't wanna waste no more time
Time's what we don't have
Everywhere I look, someone dies
Wonder when it's my turn
I pray to God that you're right before my eyes
Bathed in white light with halos in your eyes
Don't wanna waste no more time
Time's what we don't have
Everywhere I look, someone dies
Wonder when it's my turn1Embed
