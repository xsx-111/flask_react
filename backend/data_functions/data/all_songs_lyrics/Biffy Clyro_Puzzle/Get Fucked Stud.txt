Get Fucked Stud Lyrics
Oh my distorted smile will tighten its grip
Now somebody is asking when you will disappear
You have to believe yourself, to be happy now
You can't rely on someone else, to be happy, happy

Get fucked stud, it's time to kill
Only you see the sun set on amphetamines

All hands on the courtesy cunt
Get fucked stud, I know you will
Burn in hell for pretending to be
The god of man, I demand of you
Pretend to burn in hell to be
The god of all well follow me
You're fucking right, I'm all at sea
My teeth are made of baby hair

The skyline is burning red so we'll all go down
Follow my lead to survive 'cause it won't take us long to come round
The skyline is burning red so we'll all go down
Follow my lead to survive 'cause it won't take us long to come round
Get fucked stud it's time to kill
Only you see the sun set on amphetamines

The skyline is burning red so we'll all go down
Follow my lead to survive 'cause it won't take us long to come round
The skyline is burning red so we'll all go down
Follow my lead to survive 'cause it won't take us long to come roundEmbed
