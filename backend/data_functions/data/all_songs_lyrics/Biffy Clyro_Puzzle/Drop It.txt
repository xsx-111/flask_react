Drop It Lyrics
I fell in love with the root of all good
She turned round and left me
I knew that she would
I fell in love with the root of all evil
Now I'm just starting to see

I drop into the ocean
My friend, the stormy sea
As long as the blindness
Won't leave me tonight

I felt the wrath of the chosen one
I wanted forgiveness but was given none
Let all the lights scream in my eyes
That's how I want it to feel

I drop into the ocean
My friend the stormy sea
As long as the blindness
Won't leave me tonight

I fell in love
I fell in loveEmbed
