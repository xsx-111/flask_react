Strange Relationship Lyrics
Oh, oh

I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
But I seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (Ship, ship, ship)

I came and took your love, I took your body
I took all the self-respect you ever had
I took you for a ride and, baby, I'm sorry
The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad

'Cause, baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (Ship, ship, ship)
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
Then you could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, yo baby, I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way you were, so I had to make you mine

Baby I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (Ship, ship, ship)

Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo...
Mmmmm, my strange relationship
Can't live with you can't live without you
What it's all about?
Do you know?
(Strange relationship)
I think you and I got a strange relationship
What's this strange relationship?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah2Embed
