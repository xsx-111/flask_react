If I Was Your Girlfriend Lyrics
"Look at the bargains over here, ladies"

If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot when I was your man?
Hey, hey, when I was your man

If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only a best friend can, oh
Only best friends can

If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

If I was your girlfriend
Uh-ah, ooh-hoo-hoo
If I was your girlfriend

Would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime?
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together?
'Cause to me, baby, that would be so fine

(If I was your girlfriend)
Baby can I dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
(If I was your girlfriend)
Listen girl, I ain't sayin you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
(Sugar)
Sugar, do you know what I'm saying to you this evening?
(Sugar)
Maybe you think I'm being
A little self-centered
(If I was your girlfriend)
But I, I said I want to be
(Sugar)
All of the things you are to me
(If I was your girlfriend)
Surely, surely you can see

Is it really necessary for me to go out of the room just because you wanna undress?
(If I was your girlfriend)
I mean, we don't have to make children to make love
And we don't have to make love to have an orgasm
(If I was your girlfriend)
Your body's what I'm all about
(If I was your girlfriend)
Can I see you?
I'll show you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Why not?
You can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it for you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Of course I'll undress in front of you!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
(If I was your girlfriend)
How can I make you see that it's cool?
Can't you just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend you could
(If I was your girlfriend)
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would that get you off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there
(If I was your girlfriend)
You know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long
(If I was your girlfriend)
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try to imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try9Embed
