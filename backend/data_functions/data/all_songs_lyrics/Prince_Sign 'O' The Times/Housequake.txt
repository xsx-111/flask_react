Housequake Lyrics
Shut up already, damn!
Tell me who in this house know about the quake?
We do
I mean really, really
If you know how to rock say 'yeah'
Yeah
If you know how to party say 'oh yeah'
Oh yeah
But if you ain't hip to the rare house quake:
Shut up already, damn!

Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In your funky town
(Housequake)
And the kick drum is the fault
You got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)
We got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)
We're going to show you what to do
You put your foot down on the two
You jump up on the one
Now you're having fun
You're doing the housequake
Yeah
Question:
Does anybody know about the quake?
(Yeah!)
Bullshit!
You can't get off until you make the house shake
Now everybody clap your hands
Come on
Let's jam y'all
Let's jam
Don't wait for your neighbour
Green eggs and ham

Doing the housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
In your city, in your town: Housequake
And the kick drum is the fault
Housequake
(Housequake)
Housequake
You got to rock this mother
(You got to rock this mother)
Housequake, housequake
You got to rock this mother down
Come on
Housequake, housequake
Now that you got it, let's do the twist
A little bit harder than they did in '66
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Twist little sister and go to heaven
Come on you all, we got to jam
Before the police come
A groove this funky is on the run
Hey yeah!
Shake your body until your neighbours stare atcha!
Quake, quake, quake, quake, quake, quake

Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In this city, in your funky town
And the saxophone is the fault
Check it out
If you can't rock steady
Shut up already, damn, you got to get off!
You know what I'm talking about?
On the one, you all say: housequake
Top of your body, let me hear you shout
Say, housequake
My lord
(Housequake)
My lord
(Housequake)
Bullshit
Louder, say it
(Housequake)
Shock-a-lock-a boom!
What was that? After shock!
Everybody, everybody
You got to rock, you got to rock
Come on
We're going to shake, we're going quake
Because we got the baddest groove that we could a make
We on the two, y'all
The drummer's gonna tap
We gonna see if we can rock this mother to the max
And that's a fact
Housequake
Come on say it
(Housequake)
Come on
You can't follow it
We got the baddest jam in the land
Everybody shut up, listen to the band
Housequake
Shut up already, damn2Embed
