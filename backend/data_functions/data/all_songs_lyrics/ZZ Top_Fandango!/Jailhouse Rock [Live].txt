Jailhouse Rock  LyricsGoin' to a party in the county jail
Prison band was there and they began to wail
Kid is shakin' and began to sing;
You should've heard them knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock! Everybody, let's rock!
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Spider Murphy sittin' on a block of stone;
Little Joey blowin' on a slide trombone
Come on, Silly Willy, don't you be no square
If you cannot find a partner, use a wooden chair
Let's rock! Everybody, let's rock!
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rock
Shifty Henry said to Bugs,"For heaven's sake
No one's lookin'; now's our chance to make a break."
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix. I
Want to stick around awhile and get my kicks."
Let's rock! Everybody, let's rock!
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the jailhouse rockEmbed
