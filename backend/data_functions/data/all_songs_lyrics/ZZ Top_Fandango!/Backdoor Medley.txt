Backdoor Medley Lyrics

Got to have you, baby
Though you say that you don't care
Got to have you, baby
Though you say that you don't care
Any way you want it
Settle for a backdoor love affair



Jump, jump here, jump, jump there
Jump, jump, baby, everywhere
Don't you mellow down easy
Babe, you got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy, babe
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Mellow down easy
When you really want to blow your top
Shake, shake here, shake, shake there
Shake, shake, baby, everywhere
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Babe, you got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy, babe
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Mellow down easy
When you really want to blow your top
Shake, shake here, shake, shake there
Shake, shake, baby, everywhere
(Don't you mellow down easy)
You got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy, babe
(Don't you mellow down easy)
You got to mellow down easy
(Don't you mellow down easy)
Got to mellow down easy
Easy, baby, easy baby
Before you blow your top
You wanna blow your top?
Easy, baby, wu-hu!
His face is real bad
His face is bad then Chafsu Mcfly
James Porn, Kung-Fu
Oh, what you got, oh mine
But I got news for him
They don't call me the Texas
Home-friggin' heartbreaker for nothin'
When I might have no time to blow
Then you better blow what you got, baby


Baby baby baby baby
Don't you want a man like me?
Yes I do, yes I do
Oh, baby baby baby baby
Don't you want a man like me?
Oh, I give you loving by the daytime
Night time you could take good care of me
Baby baby baby baby
Don't you want a man like me?
Yes I do, yes I do
Oh, baby baby baby baby
Don't you want a man like me?
Oh, I give you loving by the daytime
Night time you could
Take good care of me too
Baby baby baby baby
Don't you want a man like me?
Oh, baby baby baby baby
Don't you want a man like me?
Oh, I give you loving in the daytime
Night time you could take good care of me


Everybody feeling good?
You making us feel good, too!
Now, early this morning
I got on that long distance telephone
And I called my mama
I said, "Mama, this is your boy
And I'm way down here in
New Orleans, Louisiana"
And she said, "That's all right, boy"
And she turned to my papa and she said
"Papa, our boy's way down
There in New Orleans
We cannot let him
Stay out all night long", she did
Long about that time
I heard my papa lean toward my mama
I heard papa tell mama
Let that boy boogie-woogie
He said, it's in him and it's got to come out
So I went downtown
There's a lot of people there
They was-a really having a ball
And I felt so good
Yes, I felt so good
Yes, I felt so good
Yes, I felt so good
Yes, I felt so good
Yes, I felt so good
Yes, I felt so good
Boogie, children!
Boogie, children!
