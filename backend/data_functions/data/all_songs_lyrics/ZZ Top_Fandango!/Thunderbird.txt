Thunderbird Lyrics
You ready for ZZ Top?
Ladies and gents, the fantastic ZZ Top!

Get high everybody, get high
Get high everybody, get high
Get high everybody, get high
Get high everybody, get high
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird
And all you kids from Texas
You grow so big and tall
All of them kids from Texas
They grow so big and tall
All of them like to roam
In that T-bird hall

Get hi-hi-high
Really makes you feel so fine
Really goes down so smooth
Really puts you in the groove
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird

Juice, juice, juice
Really maks you loose, loose, loose
Really goes down so smooth
Really puts you in the groove
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird
Get hi-hi-high
Way up in the sky
Going to get, yes sirree
If you come and rock with me
Have you heard? What's the word?
It's Thunderbird
