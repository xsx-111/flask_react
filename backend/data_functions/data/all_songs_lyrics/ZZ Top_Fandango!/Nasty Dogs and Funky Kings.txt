Nasty Dogs and Funky Kings Lyrics
Well, I knocked down on your door, baby
To see if you were at home
Your shade was down
There wasn't even a sound
But something told me you weren't alone
What in the world can a nasty dog do
But try to get next to you?

Well, don't laugh because it isn't funny
Look how it happened to me
It could happen to you
You could be a fool too
And it'd leave you in misery
I guess there's nothing
More funky king can do
But to try to get next to you
