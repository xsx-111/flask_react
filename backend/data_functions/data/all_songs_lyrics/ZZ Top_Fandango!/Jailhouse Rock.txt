Jailhouse Rock Lyrics
Going to a party in the county jail
Prison band was there
And they began to wail
Kid is shaking and began to sing
You should've heard them
Knocked out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock
Spider Murphy sitting on a block of stone
Little Joey blowing on a slide trombone
Come on, Silly Willy, don't you be no square
If you cannot find a partner
Use a wooden chair

Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For heaven's sake
No one's looking
Now's our chance to make a break"
Bugs turned to Shifty and he said, "Nix nix
Wanna stick around awhile and get my kicks"
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rockEmbed
