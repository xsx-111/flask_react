Balinese Lyrics
Deep in the south of Texas
Not so long ago
There on a crowded island
In the gulf of Mexico
It didn't take too much money
Man, but it sure was nice
You could dance all night
If you felt all right
Drinking whiskey and throwing dice

Everybody knows it was hard to leave
And everybody knows
It was down at the Balinese
I remember Ruby
She always dressed in red
Wearing skintight pants
Lord, and how she could dance
With a rag wrapped around her head

Everybody knows it was hard to leave
And everybody knows
It was down at the Balinese, yeah
Everybody knows it was hard to leave
Everybody knows
It was down at the Balinese
It was down at the Balinese
It was down at the BalineseEmbed
