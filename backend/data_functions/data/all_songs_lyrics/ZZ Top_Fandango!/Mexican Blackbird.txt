Mexican Blackbird Lyrics
If you're down in Acuna
And you ain't up to being alone
Don't spend all your money
On just any honey that's grown
Go find the Mexican blackbird
And send all your troubles back home

They all call her "Puta"
Cause no one really knows her name
She works the cantina
Dancin' and a-lovin's her trade
Her mama was Mez'can
And her daddy was the ace of spades
Oh, let's drive that old
Chrysler to Mexico, boy

Said, keep your hands on the wheel there
Oh, it sure is fine, isn't it?
Now, you got it
Hand me another one of them
Brews from back here
Oh, this is gonna be so good
She's hot as a pepper
But smooth as a Mexican brew
So head for the border
And put in an order or two
The Mexican blackbird
Will be there waiting for you
Oh, one more timeEmbed
