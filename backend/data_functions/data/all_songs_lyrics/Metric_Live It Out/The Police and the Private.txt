The Police and the Private Lyrics
Get straight, wait here while I try to find the exit sign
When will you stop asking strangers?
No one wants what we want
Keep one eye on the door, keep one eye on the bag
Never expect to be sure

You're working for the police and the private
The pirates and the pilots
Fingerprinted, waiting for the train
The doctor, the writer, the hairdresser
Felt up and fingerprinted, waiting for the train
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing mama
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing something (I don't got)

There's a place that ends here
I know when they close the gates, I'll cry
I'm so tired of never sleeping
The whole world wants what we're on
Didn't make this up, I learned
I learned it from a friend
My friend is coming clean, she told me
"Keep one eye on the door, keep one eye on the bed
Never expect to be sure who you're working for."
You're working for the police and the private
The pirates and the pilots
Fingerprinted, waiting for the train
The doctor, the writer, the garbage collector
Fingerprinted, waiting for the train
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing mama
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing mama
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing mama
Lord, lord, mother, we are all losing love
Lord, listen lover, we are all missing love

Got to get out
Got to get to you, the orphanage is closing in an hourEmbed
