Empty Lyrics
There was no way out
The only way out was to give in
When there's no way out, the only way out is to give in
How I love to...
How I love to...
How I love to give in

Here, no one sleeps
One lays up while the other lies down
Where no one sleeps, one lays up while the other lies down
Ask the line on your face what the line on your hand meant
We, we couldn't see what was coming

Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your hips, move your feet
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your hips, move your feet
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your head, it's empty
Shake your head, it's empty
I'm so glad that I'm an island
I'm so glad that I'm an island
I'm so glad that I'm an island now

Sickness was fixing me some
Coughed out my heart in the last stall
Now that the damage is done
I never miss it at all2Embed
