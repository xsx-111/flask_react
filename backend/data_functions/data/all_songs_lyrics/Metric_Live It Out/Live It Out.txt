Live It Out Lyrics
Hope I live it out
Hope I live it out
Hope I...

On the day we were supposed to leave
You changed your mind at the station
You had a nice apartment
There was a good bar downstairs
Your old friend worked there
I'll go anyway, I'll go anyway
They won't refund the ticket
Well, it's a good story

But I don't wanna live it alone
Crash to take a chance
I wanna live it out
I know I'm already dead
No concrete adversity
Only traps of our own actions
How we wanted it to be
Now, I'm never gonna see you again
You turned off
Vertebrae by vertebrae
Roll your way out of a coma
Look up, the nurse is smiling
What luck, the nurse is me
Your old body is dead
Your body's dead, you're a word instead
In my sleep, I repeat it
Well, it's a good story

But I don't wanna live it alone
Crash to take a chance
We were gonna live it out
Look at you, you're already dead
How will you remember me?
Digging ditches out of boredom
Said you could never leave
Now, you're never gonna be here again
You checked out

Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum
