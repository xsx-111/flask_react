Monster Hospital Lyrics
Bam-chika-bam-chika-boom-boom-boom
Sha-lang sha-lang-boom, sha-lang sha-lang-boom
Bam-chika-bam-chika-boom-boom-boom
Sha-lang sha-lang boom

Monster hospital, can you please release me?
You hold my hands down, I've been bad
You hold my arms down, I've been bad
I've been bad, I've been bad!

I fought the war
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won
I fought the war
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won

Monster movie
Daddy Warbucks up against Bobby Fuller
And he beat him, hands down
Lead in his head
They put a little lead in, in his head!
I fought the war
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won
I fought the war
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of god
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won

I fought the war
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of god
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of god
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of god
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won
I fought the war
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of god
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won't stop for the love of god
I fought the war
I fought the war
But the war won2Embed
