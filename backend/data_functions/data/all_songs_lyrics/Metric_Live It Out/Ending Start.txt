Ending Start LyricsAll this that is more than a wish is a memory
All this that is ceases to be
All is revealed
The obvious door opens nothing
Nothing, nothing left, nothing left
Nothing left to chance
When you try to see, we'll watch you
When you try to leave, we'll keep you
When you should be dreaming, we'll wake you
But don't scream, we'll make you swallow your words
Gave them our reactions, our explosions, all that was ours
For graphs of passion and charts of stars
Gave them our reactions, our explosions, all that we are
For graphs of passion and charts of stars
