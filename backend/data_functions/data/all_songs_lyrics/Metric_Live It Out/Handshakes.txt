Handshakes Lyrics
Say you wanna get in
And then you wanna get out
When you get the money
To buy yourself a castle
How will you wear your leisure?
Your zipper back and front
On the fence together
Weekends in leather
Flip to the right
Slip back to the left
For handshakes at the ranch
Small talk at the crossroads
Rubbing up to the ladder
Sucking on every rung
Coming up forever and hanging on

That's entertainment
When the cameras roll
Can you face the pavement
For a happy dog and pony show?
Everybody loves you, baby
Of course they do
Do you miss me?
I miss you
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car
Buy this car to drive to work
Drive to work to pay for this car

Say you wanna get in
And you're gonna get out
But you won't
'Cause it's a trapEmbed
