Glass Ceiling Lyrics
Only know what I'm told, only know what I'm told
Fast asleep, daydreaming
Start to push, break your own glass ceiling
Can't count, catch the pieces falling

Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
Who?
Who?
How am I gonna know you're letting me down?
How'd I end up on the ground?

Only do what I'm told, only do what I'm told
Last to leave, cold calling
You're gonna lose your arms
Amputate, Plasticine
There's no knight in silver armor, shining

Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
Who?
Who?
How am I gonna know I'm letting you down?
Who?
Who?
Who let it end up on the ground?
How did he end up on the ground?
Face down on the ground
Only go where I'm told, only know what I'm told
Inch to inches, crowding
We can't leave, it's the last road open
Every speed on our knees is crawling

Every speed on our knees is crawling
Every speed on our knees is crawling
Every speed on our knees is crawlingEmbed
