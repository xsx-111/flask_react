Orgasm LyricsI met a girl
Who'd never had
An orgasm
I couldn't believe
She'd never had one
I said, "Sit back
And just let yourself relax"
You looked so good
So good
So good
So good
You looked so good to me
So good to me
She thought that I
Was just the one
She said, "I know
That you could do it"
She had to know
Got curious
What it was like
Enough to trust me
You looked so good
So good
So good
So good
You looked so good to me
So good to me
You looked so good
So good
Oh so good
So good
You looked so good to me
So good to meEmbed
