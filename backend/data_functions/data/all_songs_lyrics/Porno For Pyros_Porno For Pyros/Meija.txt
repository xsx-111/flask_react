Meija LyricsWhere you going, Meija?
Yeah, you got your money
In your hand
And your mind
Already out of the door
Didn't get her started
There ain't no stopping her
You gotta
Wait till she runs
Out of money
Or maybe get some sleep
She knows everybody
Go!
Go..
She took the car
Out for a drive
She didn't come back
For nearly two days
Where's she been?
Why'd she go?
Why's she back now?
We all know!
We know why!
We know why!
She's back again
We know
Where's she goin'
Someplace better than here...
Everybody, count your money!
Everybody, count your money!
Everybody, yeah, you better count your money!
Where you going, Meija?
Took the car
Out for a drive
Didn't come back
For nearly two days
Where's she been?
Why'd she go?
Why's she back now?
We all know!
We know why!
We know why!
Baby's back again
We know
Where's she goin'
Someplace better than here...
Everybody, count your money!
Everybody, count your money!
Everybody, yeah, you better count your money!Embed
