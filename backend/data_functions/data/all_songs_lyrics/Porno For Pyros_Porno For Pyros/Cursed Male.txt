Cursed Male Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

All the guys
That really have the money
Are too old
To have a good time with it
All the guys
That really have the money
Are too old
To have a good time with it
Too old to turn the women on
Too old to have a fast car and drive it
Yeah, yeah
All the guys
That really have the money
Are too old
To have a good time with it
All the guys
That really have the money
Are too old
To party or get dirty
Too old to turn the women on
Too old to have a fast car and drive itEmbed
