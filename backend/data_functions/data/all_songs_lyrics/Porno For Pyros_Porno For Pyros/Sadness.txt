Sadness LyricsI got the devil in me
It's a cloud
It's sadness
It's a cloud
Then I want to find compassion
And I find
It vanishes
These thoughts I have they seem
To pass me by
Like a cloud
I was praying
It's a cloud
And hope is just another form of prayer
It's a cloud
I want to find some laughter
When you laugh, they can't kill you
These thoughts I have, they seem
To pass me by
Like a cloud
Fuel and release!
Happiness is good for an hour
Fuel and release!
Happiness is good for an hour
I hate him for all the things he's done!
Because I love her so!
I got the devil in me!
It's sadness!
It's a cloudEmbed
