Bad Shit LyricsGot some bad shit
Then I walked the beach in Venice, ooh!
I went outside
I been in too long
I went outside
For some inspiration
Did the G-O
Did the No-Go
There were stars
There were flies
Even the flies dropped like...
What does a fly drop like?
Stars
Oh, but didn't slow down
I went outside
There was a Chinese blues player
Outside
I've been in too long
Did the G-O
And then I did the No-Go
There were stars
There were flies
Even the flies dropped like...
What do the flies drop like?
Like stars
But didn't slow down
Didn't slow down
Didn't slow down
Never went down
Didn't go down
Stars
