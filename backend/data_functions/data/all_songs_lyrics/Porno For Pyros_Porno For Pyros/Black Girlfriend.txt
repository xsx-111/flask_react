Black Girlfriend LyricsEver since the riots
All I really wanted
Was a black girlfriend
They don't play around
They're hard enough
To keep any man in line
Thinking of my pale white skin
Thinking of her, dark and smooth
She against me
(My black girlfriend) My black girlfriend
Black girlfriend
Met her on the corner
Where she lived, I asked her
"Can you braid my hair?"
She and her girlfriends
Laughed at me, said that
It was easy but it'll cost you some
Looking out her window
It's so exciting and foreign
But I'm staying
With my black girlfriend
Drivin' thru the 'hood
In my Chevy Nova '62
And my arm around my
Little black girl
People on the corner
Looking in my car
Wanna do me
Because I won't give back
That little black girl
Do you wanna come on in?
Do you wanna eat some?
Meet my family?
My black girlfriend
My black girlfriend
Ever since the riots
All I really wanted
Was a black girlfriendEmbed
