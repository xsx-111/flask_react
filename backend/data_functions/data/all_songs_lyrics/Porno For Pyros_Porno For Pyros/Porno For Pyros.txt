Porno For Pyros Lyrics
Came home last night, there was fire and smoke on the TV
Cops and the army, people runnin' out in the street, lootin'
I took off my clothes, and came four times
Could not leave myself alone

It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
Porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros

I got in my car, saw the fire and smoke, headed to it
Just for this night, I believe it is good, just destroy it
Get back in the car, let's drive on by
Everybody bump and grind

It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
Porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros


Ooh, there's so much trouble
Ooh, but I love it so much
Havin' the time of my life
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
Porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros7Embed
