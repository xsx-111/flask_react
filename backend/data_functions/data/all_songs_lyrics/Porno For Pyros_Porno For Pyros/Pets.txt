Pets LyricsChildren are innocent
A teenager's fucked up in the head
Adults are even more fucked up
And elderlies are like children
Will there be another race
To come along and take over for us?
Maybe martians could do
Better than we've done
We'll make great pets! 

My friend says we're like the dinosaurs
Only we are doing ourselves in
Much faster than they
Ever did
We'll make great pets! 
We will make great pets
We'll make great pets! 
We will make great pets!
We'll make great pets! 3Embed
