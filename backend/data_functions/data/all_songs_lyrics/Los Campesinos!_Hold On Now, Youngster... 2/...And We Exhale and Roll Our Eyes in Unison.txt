...And We Exhale and Roll Our Eyes in Unison LyricsOne, two, three, four, five, six

It's bad enough you ever use the word as an adjective
But to suggest we do it in heels is really quite crass
And frankly, we're reasonably practical
We know the benefits of always doing these things in flats
And I spent the last seven years perched on the edge of my bed
Scratching, "I am incredibly sincere" into my forearm
You should know better

A fifteen-year-old's editorial, some lazy innuendo
The last man standing is a girl
Four sweaty boys with guitars tell me nothing about my life
And the earth's air pressure gets far greater when I hear you
You should try harder

It takes an educated guess to see I like you little at best
And if you come here for the faces hope you leave under duress
And you still treat it like a novelty
Less pop concert, more butchery
And we exhale, and roll our eyes in unison

And we exhale, and we roll our eyes
And we do these things in unison
And woe is me and woe is you
And woe is us, together
And woe is me and woe is you
And woe is us, togetherEmbed
