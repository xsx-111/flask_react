Little Boy Lyrics
Little boy
You probably don't know it
But on the night we met you stole my heart away
Little boy, (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Can't help it if I show it (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
But I wish that you could love me too
Just as much as I love you

Yes, I know you would see that you were meant for me
Little boy, please let me be your little girl

Little boy, (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
I hope that you believe me (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
'Cause it would break my heart if you should walk away
Little boy, (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Just say you'll never leave me (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
And I'll give my heart and soul to you
Then you'll see my love is true

Yes, then I know you'll see how much you mean to me
Little boy, please let me be your little girl
I just want to go every place that you go
And do everything that you do
I just want to know everyone that you know
And spend my whole life loving you


Yes, then I know you'll see, just what you mean to me
Little boy please let me be your little girl

Little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Oh, little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)
Oh, little boy (Do-Ronde-Ronde)Embed
