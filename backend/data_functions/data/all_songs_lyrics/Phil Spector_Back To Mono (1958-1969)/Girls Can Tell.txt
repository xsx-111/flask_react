Girls Can Tell LyricsGirls can tell if boys are true
By the things they say and do
And I can tell that you'll be true to me
Don't you know it means so much
When I feel your tender touch
When you say that I look real fine
When you put your hand in mine
We will always be together
Stay in love forever, girls can tell
Girls can tell if things are right
When they kiss a boy goodnight
And I can tell that you're just right for me
When its time for you to go
Gee I always miss you so
I gotta kiss you one more time
I gotta hear you say you're mine
We will always be together
Stay in love forever, girls can tell
Every day I love you more
Than I did the day before
Wish that I could make you see
Just how much you mean to me
Every time I look at you
I just don't know what to do and
I always wanna hold you tight
I wanna see you every night
By the stars that shine above me
I can say you love me, girls can tellEmbed
