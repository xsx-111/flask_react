Parade of the Wooden Soldiers LyricsThe toy shop door is locked up tight
And everything is quiet for the night
When suddenly
The clock strikes twelve
The fun's begun
The dolls are in their best arrayed
There's going to be a wonderful parade
Hark to the drum
Oh, here they come
Cries everyone
Hear them all cheering
Now they are nearing
There's the captain stiff as starch
Bayonet's flashing
Music is crashing
As the wooden soldiers march
Sabres a-clinking
Soldiers a-winking
At each pretty little maid
Here they come, here they come
Here they come, here they come
Wooden soldiers on parade
The toy shop door is locked up tight
And everything is quiet for the night
When suddenly
The clock strikes twelve
The fun's begun
The dolls are in their best arrayed
There's going to be a wonderful parade
Hark to the drum
Oh, here they come
Cries everyone
Hear them all cheering, now they are nearing
There's the captain stiff as starch
Bayonet's flashing, music is crashing
As the wooden soldiers march
Hear them all cheering, now they are nearing
There's the captain stiff as starch
Bayonet's flashing, music is crashing
As the wooden soldiers marchEmbed
