Soldier Baby (Of Mine) LyricsSoldier baby of mine, way across the sea
They've taken you, far away from me
Soldier baby of mine, I promise you
While you're away, I'm gonna be true
Soldier baby of mine, I'm so in love
But I'll be right here, to welcome you home
When you told me that had to part
You know it really really broke my heart
I say a prayer for you every night
I say a prayer that you will be alright
Soldier baby of mine, while we're apart
I hold your picture, close to my heart
Soldier baby of mine, Soldier baby of mine
I hold your picture, close to my heart
Soldier baby of mine
Soldier baby of mineEmbed
