Under the Moon of Love LyricsLet's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit down and talk
Under the moon of love
I wanna tell you that I love you
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling, let's walk
Let's talk under the moon of love
You are looking so lovely
Under the moon of love
Your eyes are shining so brightly
Under the moon of love
Hold me close, hold me tight
And be my love tonight
Little darling, let's walk
Let's talk under the moon of love
I'm gonna talk sweet talk
Whisper things in your ear
I'm gonna tell you a lot of things
I know you've been wanting to hear
Come on, little darling
Take my hand
Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit down and talk tonight
Under the moon of love
I wanna tell you that I love you
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling, let's walk
Let's talk under the moon of love
(Under the moon of love)
(Under the moon of love)
I'm gonna talk sweet talk
Whisper things in your ear
I'm gonna tell you a lot of things
I know you've been wanting to hear
Come on, little darling
Take my hand
Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit down and talk
Under the moon of love
I wanna tell you that I love you
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling, let's walk
Let's talk under the moon of love
Come on, darling, take my hand
Let's walk (under the moon of love)...Embed
