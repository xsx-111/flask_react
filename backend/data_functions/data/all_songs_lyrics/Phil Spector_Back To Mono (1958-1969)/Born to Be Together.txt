Born to Be Together LyricsThe moment I saw you my heart knew it was forever
You touched me and I swear I knew then and there that I'd never
No I never
Want somebody else to hold me
Let another's arms enfold me
Never never want nobody but you
And then you kissed me
And whispered tenderly
Darling I love you, I love you, I love you
And I knew we were born to be together
We were born to be together
Baby we were born to be together
I never said a word but I know you heard me sighing
You held me to your heart and I almost started crying, almost crying
Baby I'm so glad you found me
Put your loving arms around me
Say you want me just the way I want you
And then please kiss me and softly answer me
Darling I love you, I love you, I love you
I'll know we were born to be together
We were born to be togeter
Baby we were born to be together
Baby we were born to be togetherEmbed
