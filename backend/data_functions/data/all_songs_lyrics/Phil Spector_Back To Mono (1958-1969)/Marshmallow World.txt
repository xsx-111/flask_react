Marshmallow World LyricsIt's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's a time for play, it's a whipped creme day
I wait for it all year round
Those marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red
Like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
The world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter, it's a marshmallow world
The world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along
It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter, it's a marshmallow world
In winter, it's a marshmallow world
In winter, it's a marshmallow worldEmbed
