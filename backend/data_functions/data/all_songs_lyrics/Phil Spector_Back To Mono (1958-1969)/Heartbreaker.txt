Heartbreaker LyricsHeartbreaker, hip shaker, trouble maker
Yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the boy I'm waiting for
Cause he'll grow up someday
I know he treats me mean
But he's seventeen he thinks he's gotta act that way
Oh yeah he's a heartbreaker, hip shaker, trouble maker
Yeah yeah yeah yeah don't know he winks his eye at every girl he sees
They call him Mr. B.A.D
But I don't care
I loved that boy from the very first time I kissed him
So I have to wait until he gets it our of his system
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah he's a heartbreaker, hip shaker, trouble maker
Yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the boy I'm waiting for
Cause he'll grow up someday
I know he treats me mean
But he's seventeen he thinks he's gotta act that way
Don't you know he winks his eye
At every girl he sees
Yeah he's a flirt alright, stays out all night
They call him Mr, B.A.D
Oh yeah he's a heartbreaker, hip shaker, trouble maker
