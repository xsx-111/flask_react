To Know Him, Is to Love Him Lyrics
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worth while
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)

I'd be good to him
I'd bring love to him
Everyone says they'll come a day
When I'll walk along side of him
Yes, yes to know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
Why can't he see?
How blind can he be?
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me
Oh, oh, yes

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
Yes, I do
(And I do, and I)
(And I do, and I)
Yes, I do...Embed
