I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine LyricsBaby, do you know what you did today?
Baby, do you know what you took away?
You took the blue out of the sky
My whole life changed when you said goodbye
And I keep cryin', cryin'
Oh, baby. Oh, baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
'Cause if I never saw the sunshine, baby
Maybe, I wouldn't mind the rain
Every day is just like the day before
All alone a hundred miles from shore
All of my dreams I dreamed with you
Now they will die and never come true
And so I'm cryin', cryin'
Oh, baby. Oh, baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
'Cause if I never saw the sunshine, baby
Maybe, I wouldn't mind the rain
There wouldn't be this pain
And I know there wouldn't be cloud that's over me
Everywhere I go
Oh, baby. Oh, baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
'Cause if I never saw the sunshine, baby
Maybe, I wouldn't mind the rain
I wouldn't mind the rain. Oh, that pain
Oh, that rain, that sunshineEmbed
