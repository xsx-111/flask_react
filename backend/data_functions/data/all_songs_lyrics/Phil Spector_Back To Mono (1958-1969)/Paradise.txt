Paradise LyricsThere is a land I know where lovers go
And flowers grow forever more
Where time is standing still
And lovers fill the quiet places by the shore
We will cross a rainbow to a place where we'll be free
Where he'll give his love to me
So I'll wait for the day when he takes me away to
Paradise, he'll take me by the hand to
Paradise, we'll walk along the sand in
Paradise, a never-never land
Paradise whooo
We'll build a castle there so we can share
The happiness we've waited for
Where white flamingo's fly way up high
Way above the ocean's roar
We will climb a mountain to see our wonderland
Maybe now you'll understand
Why I wait for the day when he'll take me away to
Paradise, he'll take me by the hand to
Paradise, we'll walk along the sand in
Paradise, a never-never land
Paradise whooo
I'll stand by him, do right by him
And I swear that I would die for him, die for him
Paradise, he'll take me by the hand to
Paradise, we'll walk along the sand in
Paradise whoooo paradiseEmbed
