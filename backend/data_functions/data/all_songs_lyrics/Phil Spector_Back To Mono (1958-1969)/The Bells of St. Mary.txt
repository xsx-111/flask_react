The Bells of St. Mary LyricsThe bells of St Mary's
Ah, hear they are calling
The young loves, the true loves
That come from the sea
And so my beloved
When red leaves are falling
The love bells shall ring out
The love bells shall ring out
For you and me
The bells of St Mary's
Ah, hear they are calling
The young loves, the true loves
That come from the sea
And so my beloved
When red leaves are falling
The love bells shall ring out, yeah, yeah
The love bells shall ring out, yeah, yeah
The love bells shall ring out
For you and meEmbed
