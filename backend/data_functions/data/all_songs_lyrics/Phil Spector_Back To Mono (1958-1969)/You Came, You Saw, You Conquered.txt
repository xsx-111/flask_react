You Came, You Saw, You Conquered LyricsI didn't have a care or worry
I wasn't in the slightest hurry
To fall in love and give my heart away oh baby
So hurt many times before that I said this time for sure
I was locking up the door then baby
Oo you came you saw you conquered all the love in me
Oo you came you saw you turned your loving right on in me oooh
My enemy was warm desire
You shot me down with lips of fire
I ran for cover straight into your arms
Oh baby
Footloose and fancy free nobody, could get a hold of me
Then you kissed me tenderly and baby
Oo you came you saw you conquered all the love in me
Oh baby oo you came you saw you turned your loving right on in me oooh
Goodbye heart of mine
Hello sweet ties of love that bind
I'll try love just this one more time
Cause baby
Oo you came you saw you conquered all the love in me
Oh baby oo you came you saw you turned your loving right on in me oooh
