So Young LyricsI have a boyfriend he says I'm his only one
We wanna get married but we're so young (so young)
So young (so young) can't marry no one (can't marry no one)
They say our love is just a teenage affection
But no one knows our hearts direction
(So young) so young (so young) can't marry no one
(No one) no one (no one) no one (no one)
I'm I'm I'm so young, so young
I'm I'm I'm so young can't marry no one no one
(So young) got a go now cry myself to sleep
This loving baby, who has seen the last of me
(So young) so young (so Young) can't marry no one no one no one (so young) (fade out)Embed
