Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) Lyrics
(Christmas) The snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) Lots of people around
(Christmas) Baby, please come home

(Christmas) The church bells in town
(Christmas) All ringing in song
(Christmas) Full of happy sounds
(Christmas) Baby, please come home

They're singing "Deck the Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

(Christmas) Pretty lights on the tree
(Christmas) I'm watching them shine
(Christmas) You should be here with me
(Christmas) Baby, please come home

They're singing "Deck the Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
(Christmas) If there was a way
(Christmas) I'd hold back this tear
(Christmas) But it's Christmas day
(Please) Please
(Please) Please
(Please) Please, (Please) please
(Please) Please, (Please) please
(Please, please)
Baby, please come home
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
(Christmas) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
(Christmas) Oh please, baby
(Christmas) Please come home
(Christmas)
(Christmas)
(Christmas)
