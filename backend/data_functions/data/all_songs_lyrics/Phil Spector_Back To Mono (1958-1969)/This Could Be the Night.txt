This Could Be the Night LyricsAll of these nights that we've been a dating
All of there nights that we've been awaiting
Something tells me that the time is getting right
Each time we kiss it takes a little bit longer
And my love for you gets a little bit stronger
And I feel like I'm-a-sittin' on dynamite
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more
When it comes to lovin' she's a natural master
And each night she's there well my heart beats faster
Deep down inside I know the best is yet to come
Oh oh gonna pick her up about a quarter to seven
I know were gonna take a little trip to heaven
And if it's love she wants then I'm gonna give her some
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more
So this could be the night
The night I've waited for
This could be the night
I'm gonna give her all my love and more (fade)Embed
