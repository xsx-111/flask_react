Santa Claus Is Coming to Town Lyrics
Jimmy, I just came back from a lovely trip along the milky way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old, dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready, his reindeers and his sleigh

You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh, you'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too -

Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland all around the Christmas tree

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to townEmbed
