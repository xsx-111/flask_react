Why Do Lovers Break Each Others Hearts? LyricsWhy do lovers break each other's hearts?
Oh tell me why do lovers have to drift apart
When we met the world was bright now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each other's hearts?
Why do lovers break each other's hearts?
Oh tell me why can't lovers finish what they start?
A year ago we were one now just look at what we've done
Why do lovers break each other's hearts?
Help me help me I don't understand
Why we always hurt the ones we love
Tell me tell me where's the life we planned
Where are the dreams that we dream we're dreaming of?
Why do lovers break each other's hearts?
Oh tell me why do lovers have to drift apart
When we met the world was bright now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each other's hearts?
When we met the world was bright now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each other's hearts?
Why do lovers break each other's hearts?
Oh tell me why do lovers break each other's hearts (repeat and fade)Embed
