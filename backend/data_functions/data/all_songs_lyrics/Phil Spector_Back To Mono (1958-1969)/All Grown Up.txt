All Grown Up Lyrics
Well I'm all grown up, ain't no baby no more
I can do the things I couldn't do before
No more pony-tails, I wear my hair up high
Because I'm seventeen and that's the reason why

Because I'm all grown up
And I'll go where I wanna go
I'm all grown up
And I'll do what I wanna do
I'm all grown up
Be what I wanna be
See what I wanna see
Gee, I can hardly wait
Well I'm going on dates every Saturday night
And if he wants a kiss I might say all right
I got my high heels on and I'm a-ready to go
I'm gonna go downtown, I'm gonna steal the show

Because I'm all grown up
And I'll go where I wanna go
I'm all grown up
And I'll do what I wanna do
I'm all grown up
Be what I wanna be
See what I wanna see
Gee, I can hardly wait

Because I'm all grown up
And I'll go where I wanna go
I'm all grown up
And I'll do what I wanna do
I'm all grown up
Be what I wanna be
See what I wanna see
Gee, I can hardly wait

Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Ye-ye-ye-yeah...Embed
