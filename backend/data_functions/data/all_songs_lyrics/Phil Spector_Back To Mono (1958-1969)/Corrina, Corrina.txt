Corrina, Corrina LyricsI love Corrina, tell the world I do
I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I pray each night she loves me too
Corrina, Corrina, Corrina, Corrina
Corrina, Corrina, I love you so
Oh little darling, where you've been so long?
Oh little darling, where you've been so long
I ain't had no loving since you've been gone
Corrina, Corrina, Corrina, Corrina
Corrina, Corrina, I love you so
I left Corrina way across the sea
I left Corrina way across the sea
If you see Corrina, send her home to me
Corrina, Corrina, Corrina, Corrina
Corrina, Corrina, I love you so
Corrina, Corrina, Corrina, Corrina
Corrina, Corrina, I love you so
Oh darling, don't you know that I love you so?Embed
