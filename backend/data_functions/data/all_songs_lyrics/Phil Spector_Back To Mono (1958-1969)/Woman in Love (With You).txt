Woman in Love (With You) LyricsIt's like a dream come true
And my love I owe it all to you
Yesterday, I was a little girl
All alone in this big wide world
Then we met and when you held me tight
Ooh baby, I grew up over night
Now I'm a woman a woman in love
I'm a woman a woman in love with you
I said you baby it's you ooh its you
Cause I'm a woman a woman in love
I'm a woman a woman in love with you
I said you oh its you ooo you
Yes I'm a woman a woman in love
I'm a woman a woman in love with you
I said you baby you yes you (repeat and fade)Embed
