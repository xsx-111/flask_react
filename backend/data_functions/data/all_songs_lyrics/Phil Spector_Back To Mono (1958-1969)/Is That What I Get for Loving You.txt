Is That What I Get for Loving You LyricsThere's been a lot of talk around
That you've been seen with a certain party
And now I'm so afraid I'm losing you oh baby
Don't tell me you don't want my love
I couldn't give it to just anybody
Baby won't you tell me it's not true
Don't leave me baby
Don't tell me it's over
After I trusted you
And did my best to make you happy
Is this what I get for loving you baby
Is this what I get for loving you, baby
There was a night when
You held me tight and
You said you'd always love me
You said you'd never hurt me
What would there be left for me
It's such a cruel world to be alone in
I always needed you to look out for me oh baby
I'm gonna miss your loving arms
They're the only arms I feel at home in
Don't you know how lonely I'm gonna be
Don't leave me baby
Don't tell me it's over
After I trusted you
And did my best to make you happy
Is this what I get for loving you baby
Is this what I get for loving you, baby
There was a night when
You held me tight and
You said you'd always love me
You said you'd never hurt me
Don't leave me baby
Is this what I get for loving you baby
Is this what I get for loving you, baby
There was a night when
You held me tight and
You said you'd always love me
You said you'd never hurt meEmbed
