Silent Night LyricsHello, this is Phil Spector, it is so difficult at this time
To say words that would express my feelings
About the album to which you have just listened
An album that has been in the planning for many, many months
First, let me thank all the people who worked so hard with me
In the production of this album and in my endeavor and desire
To bring something new and different to the music of Christmas
And to the recording industry which is so much a part of my life
Of course, the biggest thanks goes to you
For giving me the opportunity to relate my feelings
Of Christmas through the music that I love
At this moment, I am very proud of all the artists
And on behalf of all of them, The Crystals, The Ronettes
Darlene Love, Bobby Soxx and the Blue Jeans, and myself
May we wish you the very merriest of Christmases
And the happiest of New Years, and thank you so very much
For letting us spend this Christmas with you
(Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace)Embed
