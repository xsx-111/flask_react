Chapel of Love LyricsGoin' to the chapel and we're gonna to get married
Goin' to the chapel and we're gonna to get married
Gee, I really love you and we're, gonna to get married
Goin' to the chapel of love
Spring is here
Theeee sky is blue
Whooooa! the birds all sing as if they knew
Today's the day, we'll say, "I do"
And we'll never be lonely anymore
Because we're going to the chapel and we're, gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel and we're, gonna get married
Gee, I really love you and we're, gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel of love
Bells will ring
Theee sun will shine
Whooooa, I'll be his and he'll be mine
We'll love until, the end of time
And we'll never be lonely anymore
Because we're goin' to the chapel and we're, gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel and we're gonna get married
Gee, I really love you and we're gonna get married
Goin' to the chapel of love
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Goin' to the chapel of love
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Goin' to the chapel of loveEmbed
