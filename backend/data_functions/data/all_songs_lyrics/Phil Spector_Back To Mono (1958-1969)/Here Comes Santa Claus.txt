Here Comes Santa Claus LyricsHere comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang up your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus is coming tonight
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that is filled with toys for the boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed, cover up your head
'Cause Santa Claus is coming tonight
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa is coming tonightEmbed
