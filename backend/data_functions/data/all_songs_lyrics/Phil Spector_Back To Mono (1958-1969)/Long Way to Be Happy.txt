Long Way to Be Happy LyricsMy it's a long way, my it's a long way
A long way, a long way, a long way
My it's a long way (a long way) to be happy now
I just don't know if I can take it
Oh, yeah, it's a long way (a long way) to be happy now
I wonder if I'm gonna make it
Nothing I do seems like any fun to me
You just don't know what losing him has done to me
It's the middle of June (but it feels like December)
So little I look forward to and so much I remember
It's gonna take a long time (a long time) to smile again
I just don't know if I can do it, oh, yeah
It's gonna take a long time (a long time) to smile again
I wonder if I'm gonna get through it
I gotta find a way to get a hold of myself again
Before I even try to give my love to someone else again
There are tears to be cried (and wounds to be mended)
New dreams can't be born until the old ones have finished
My it's a long way (my it's a long way) to be happy now
My it's a long way (my it's a long way) to be happy now
It's gonna take a long time (my it's a long way) to be happy nowEmbed
