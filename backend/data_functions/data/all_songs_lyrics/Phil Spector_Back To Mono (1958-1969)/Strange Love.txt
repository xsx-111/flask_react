Strange Love LyricsYou've got ways of lovin' I never saw
Not like any boys that I've known before
Yes you gotta strange kind of love
And I can't take it, can't take it no more
Don't want you hangin' 'round my door
'Cause you brought a strange kind of love to me
When you're seen in places you shouldn't be
You tell everyone you're lookin' for me
Yes you brought a strange kind of love
And I can't take it, can't take your lies
Don't want your silly alibis
'Cause you brought a strange kind of love to me
And I can't take it, can't take it no more
Don't want you hangin' 'round my door
'Cause you brought a strange kind of love to meEmbed
