Hold Me Tight LyricsHold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then then I might never be the lonely one
So hold hold me tight tonight tonight
It's you, only you
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you tonight tonight
Making love to only you
So hold hold me tight tonight tonight
It's you only you
You don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being held alone tonight with you it feels so right
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you tonight tonight
Making love to only you
So hold hold me tight tonight tonight
It's you only you only youEmbed
