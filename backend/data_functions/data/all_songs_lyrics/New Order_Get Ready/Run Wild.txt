Run Wild LyricsOpen hearts, empty spaces
Dusty roads to distant places
But all the time when I'm alone
I think of you and how you've grown
Far and wide, sweet and simple
Jehovah knows that I've been sinful
But if Jesus comes to take your hand
I won't let go, I won't let go
I'm not cruel and you're not evil
And we're not like all those stupid people
Who can't decide which book to read
Unless the paper sows the seed
You're the kind of person
That I've always wanted to be with
Well, you're really cool
And you always say the right things to me
Now I'll tell you something
For my heart beats for you deep inside
You'll never be a burden
And my love for you will never die
Never die, never die, never die
If Jesus comes to take your hand
I won't let go, I won't let go
If Jesus comes to take your hand
I won't let go, I won't let go
Good times around the corner
Good times around the corner
Good times around the corner
I swear it's getting warmer
Good times around the corner
Good times around the corner
Good times around the corner
I'm gonna live till I die
I'm gonna live to get highEmbed
