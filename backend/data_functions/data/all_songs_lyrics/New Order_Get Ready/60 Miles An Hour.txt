60 Miles An Hour LyricsI don't know if I told you
But I'm seeking sanctuary
You'd never guess the things that I do
I've had the devil around for tea
Don't you know that I'm here beside you?
Can't you see that I can't relax?
When I saw you in my rear view
You could have stopped me in my tracks
I'll be there for you when you want me to
I'll stand by your side like I always do
In the dead of night it'll be alright
'Cause I'll be there for you when you want me to
You could take me to an island
Ride across a stormy sea
We could worship pagan idols
There together you and me
Why don't you run over here and rescue me?
You could drive down in your car
Why don't we both take a ride and turn that key
We'll drive at sixty miles an hour
I'll be there for you when you want me to
I'll stand by your side like I always do
In the dead of night it'll be alright
'Cause I'll be there for you when you want me to
I'll be there for you when you want me to
I'll stand by your side like I always do
In the dead of night it'll be alright
'Cause I'll be there for you when you want me to
I'll be there for you when you want me to
I'll stand by your side like I always do
In the dead of night it'll be alright
'Cause I'll be there for you when you want me toEmbed
