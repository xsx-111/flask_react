Close Range LyricsI wanna scream, I wanna shout
I wanna know what it's all about
I've seen it before but not like this
I saw your name, it was on the list
By 4 o'clock (It's gonna change)
You were pretty high (It's gonna change)
Right on the floor (It's gonna change)
Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)
I remember you (It's gonna change)
When you were a kid (It's gonna change)
It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)
And things you did
You've got to pull yourself together man
You've got to get back on your feet again
How can I ever make you understand
You've got the world right in your hands
No cold heart could turn away
And not be moved by what I saw today
There on the floor, thirty years or more
He doesn't care, he just wants to score
By 4 o'clock (It's gonna change)
You were pretty high (It's gonna change)
Right on the floor (It's gonna change)
Looking at the sky (It's gonna change)
I remember you (It's gonna change)
When you were a kid (It's gonna change)
It was pretty strange (It's gonna change)
And things you did
You've got to pull yourself together man
You've got to get back on your feet again
How can I ever make you understand
You've got the world right in your hands
You've got to pull yourself together man
You've got to get back on your feet again
How can I ever make you understand
You've got the world right in your hands
Yet it only seems just like yesterday
We used to run and hide
Remember in the park where we used to play
The grass looked ten foot high
You've got to pull yourself together man
You've got to get back on your feet again
How can I ever make you understand
You've got the world right in your hands
You've got to pull yourself together man
You've got to get back on your feet again
How can I ever make you understand
You've got the world right in your handsEmbed
