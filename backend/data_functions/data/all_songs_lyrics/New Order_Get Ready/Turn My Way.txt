Turn My Way Lyrics(Take my hand
And don't let go
Trust this man
And let it flow)
Don't take me down
'Cause I'm not done
Don't steal my crown
Before it's won
The wide expanse
The wheel of chance
Will turn my way
The sky will not be gray
I don't wanna be
Like other people are
Don't wanna own a key
Don't wanna wash my car
Don't wanna have to work
Like other people do
I wanted to be free
I wanted to be true
Take my hand
And don't let go
Trust this man
And let it flow
I drank at every bar in town
I filled my cup when I was down
Saw the things I wanted to see
Became the man I wanted to be
But then somehow I lost my way
I've got to get back there today
I don't wanna be
Like other people are
Don't wanna own a key
Don't wanna wash my car
Don't wanna have to work
Like other people do
I wanted to be free
I wanted to be true
I don't wanna be
Like other people are
Don't wanna own a key
(Take my hand)
Don't wanna wash my car
(Don't let go)
Don't wanna wake at night
Or wait until it's light
I wanted to be free
I thought that I was right
I thought that I was right
I thought that I was right
I thought that I was rightEmbed
