Crystal Lyrics
We're like crystal, we break easy
I'm a poor man, if you leave me
I'm applauded, then forgotten
It was summer, now it's autumn

I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore
(whenever you're here with me)
You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core

We're like crystal, it's not easy
With your love, you could feed me
Every man, and every woman
Needs someone, So keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming

I don't know what to say, you don't care anyway
I'm a man in a rage (just tell me what I've got to do), with a girl I betrayed
Here comes love, it's like honey
You can't buy it with money, you're not alone anymore
(whenever you're here with me)
You shock me to the core, you shock me to the core
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming2Embed
