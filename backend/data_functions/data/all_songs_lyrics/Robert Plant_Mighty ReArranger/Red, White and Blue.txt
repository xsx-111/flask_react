Red, White and Blue LyricsAnd he’s bringing us peace and new honor
In the land of the lost and found
He’s just another highwayman but the promise in his hand
Is wrapped up in red white and blue
Oh, wrapped up in red white and blue
He speaks for youth the world over
Though his word seems a little askew
From his home on the range, he may seem a little strange
And he’s dressed up in red, white and blue
Oh, he’s dressed up in red, white and blue
Oh, ho, ho
And he speaks up for God and for country
Yes, he’s steadfast, loyal and true
In the land of the free, with his banjo on his knee
He will sing out for red, white and blue
Sing out for red, white and blue
Sing sing sing sing
Oh, ’bout the freedom
’Bout the liberty
’Bout the creditors
And he deals for the righteous and holy
Don’t go messin’ with that kid for me
He's a son of the gun when you want your doin’ done
In the name of the RWB
In the name of the RWB
Sing sing sing sing
Oh ’bout the freedom
Mmmm ’bout the equality
Oh about the color of your skin
The conservatism within
Sing sing sing
Sing sing sing
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ahhh
