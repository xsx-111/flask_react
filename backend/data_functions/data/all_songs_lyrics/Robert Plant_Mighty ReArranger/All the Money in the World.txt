All the Money in the World LyricsYou're living in a house of glass
There's no place left you can hide
You're running from the sea and the crash
Where everything beautiful died
Said
All of the money, the money in the world
Won't bring you back your reason
Won't bring you back your world
You're living in a house of cards
You're waiting for the weather to turn
I don't know how you made it this far
And now I feel my bridges have burned
Said
All of the money, the money in the world
Won't bring you back your reason
Won't bring you back your world
You waited till the last resort
To mix some of the truth with the lying
You're waiting for the damage report
It's there in the smoke without frying
Said
All of the money, the money in the world
Won't bring you back your reason
Won't bring you back your worldEmbed
