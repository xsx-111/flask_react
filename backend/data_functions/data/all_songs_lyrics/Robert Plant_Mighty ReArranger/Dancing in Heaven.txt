Dancing in Heaven LyricsThere'll be dancing in heaven
On the night before the longest day
A celebration in rhythm
At this time it was always this way
Sing out for the one light
Reach out to the flame
So fine, so fine
That we can make it this way, yeah
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahh
So sing the song of the ages
Giving voice on this beautiful night
Feed the flames in high places
From the earth to the giver of light
Sing out for the one light
Reach out for the flame
So fine, so fine
That we can make it this way
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahh
Bringing peace to the valley
Carry fire through the oaks and the grove
Precious memory carry
As we move through the circles and stone
Sing out to the one light
Reach out to the flame
So fine, mmm, so fine
That we can make it this way
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahh
Ahhh, ahhhh
Oooooh
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahh
Oooooo, oooooo,  oooo
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahh
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahh
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahhEmbed
