The Enchanter LyricsShe moves through the mountains and down to the sea
She sings in celebration with her piper for me
She's leading the man who's beating the drum
Love is all around her on the road to the sun
Round, round, moving me round
Round, round the air
She's lost in conversation with the birds of the air
She's trading information in a world without fear
She's fixing up a potion made of laughter and love love love love
And I will follow the enchanter on the road to the sun, yeah
Round, round, moving me round
Round, round, round
Oh, that the stars will light my way
Oh, that my tides dance the ebb and sway
She's studying the planets and she's searching for signs
Her eyes promise mystery and her treasure to find now
She's mixing my emotions, it's so easily done, easily done
In league with the enchanter on the road to the sun, oh yeah
Oh, that the stars will light my way
Oh, that my tides dance the ebb and sway
Yeah, it's so very easily done
She moves through the mountains and down to the sea
She sings in celebration with her piper for free
She's leading the man who's beating the drum
And love is all around her on the road to the sunEmbed
