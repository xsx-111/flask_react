Freedom Fries LyricsThe Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They took the last train to the coast
They were moving fast, they were raising sand
And they were running wild in the promised land
Ahhh, ahhhh
The Father, Son and the three wise men
Operating undercover out in Bethlehem
Will they heal the sick? Can they raise the dead?
Can they bring it on home like the good book said?
Ahhh, ahhhh
Ahhh, ahhhh
Billy the Kid told the Prince of Thieves
"A little give and take to satisfy my needs
Well, you can give me lots, but I'll take some more
I got my eyes on your treasure 'neath the desert floor"
Ahhh, ahhhh
Ahhh, ahhhh
Ooh yeah…
Oh, no, me and my
Oooh, yeah…
Freedom fries and burns and scars
Liberator goes too far
Freedom fries and screams and yells
The promised land is a promised hell, oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
