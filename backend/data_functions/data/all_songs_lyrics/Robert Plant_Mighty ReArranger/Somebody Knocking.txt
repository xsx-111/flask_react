Somebody Knocking LyricsBig star, she rise, she warn
Mamma, it ain't long before the day
Red rooster, he crow, he want
Blue moon on the wane
Old black snake, he crawlin', slip slidin'
Crawlin' across my floor
Old mule come, he jumpin', he kickin'
Mmm, kickin' in my stall
Oohh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
I hear it 'round midnight
I hear it, somebody knockin' on my door
I hear it 'round midnight
Mmm, somebody knockin' on my door
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Woah, woah, woah
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Oooo, oooo, oooo
Castin' your spell
Talkin' all out of your head
Woooooo
Woooooo
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Oh yeah, oh yeahâ€¦
Knockin' on my doorEmbed
