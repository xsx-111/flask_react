Let the Four Winds Blow LyricsAnd I open my eyes
As the sun leaves the western sky
Precious memory dies
Once again you are here at my side
Blow, wind, blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow
And I'm back on the hill
Yes, you've gone, but you're with me still
Now I'm way down the line
Yes, you're gone, but you're still on my mind
Blow, wind, blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow
I've been walkin' with strangers and talkin' all out of my mind
While the dog’s in the manger, elusive and so hard to find
Conversations with angels, I seek the dimensional key
I’ve been wheelin' and dealin', whatever will bring you to me
Ooooohh
Oh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Oh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh

Blow, wind, blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow
Blow, wind, blow
Through my heart let the four winds blow
I've been walkin' with strangers and talkin' all out of my mind
Now the dog’s in the manger, elusive and so hard to find
Conversations with angels, I seek the dimensional key
I’ve been wheelin' and dealin', whatever will bring you to me
Yes, now
Ooooohh
Oh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Oh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh
Bo, bo, bo
