Shine It All Around LyricsThis is the land where I live
Paint it all over golden
And take a little sunshine
Spread it all around
This is the love that I give
These are the arms for the holding
Turn on your love light
Shine it all around
Turn on your love light
Shine it all around
Oh, shine it all around
Yeah, yeah, now
Oh, shine it all around
These are the times of my life
Bright, strong and golden
This is the way that I choose
When the deal goes down
This is the world that I love
Painted all over trouble
Take a little sunshine
Shine it all around
Send a little sign now
Spread it all around now
Shine it all around now
When the deal goes down now

Yeah, yeah, now
Oh, shine it all around
This is the heart of the man
This is the heart of the matter
Break a little bread now
Spread it all around
Come on, make a little bread now
All around
Oh, shine it all around
Yeah, yeah, now
Oh, shine it all around
Oh, shine it all around
Yeah, yeah, now
Oh, shine it all around
Send a little sign now
Spread it all around now
Shine it all around now
When the deal goes down now
Send a little sign now
Spread it all around now
Shine it all around now
When the deal goes down now
Send a little sign now
Spread it all around now
Shine it all around now
When the deal goes down nowEmbed
