Get Out Alive Lyrics
"No time for goodbye", he said
As he faded away
Don't put your life in someone's hands
They're bound to steal it away
Don't hide your mistakes
'Cause they'll find you, burn you
Then he said

"If you wanna get out alive
Oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, run for your life"

"This is my last time", she said
As she faded away
It's hard to imagine
But one day, you'll end up like me
Then she said

"If you wanna get out alive
Oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive (If you wanna get out alive)
Oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive (If you wanna get out alive)
Oh, run for your life"
If I stay, it won't be long
'Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go, I can only hope
That I'll make it to the other side


If you wanna get out alive
Run for your life
If you wanna get out alive
Hold on for-
If you wanna get out alive (If you wanna get out alive)
Oh, run for your life
If you wanna get out alive (If you wanna get out alive)
Oh, run for-

If I stay, it won't be long
‘Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go, I can only hope
That I’ll make it to the other side
If I stay, it won't be long
‘Til I'm burning on the inside
If I go, and if I go
Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside
Burning on the inside14Embed
