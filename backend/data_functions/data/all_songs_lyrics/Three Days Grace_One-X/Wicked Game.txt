Wicked Game Lyrics
The world was on fire and no one would save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you

No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With you

What a wicked thing to play, to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you and

No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With you

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
No, I don't want to fall in love
With youEmbed
