Let It Die Lyrics
We had fire in our eyes in the beginning
I never felt so alive, in the beginning
You, you blame me but

It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't wanna hear it anymore

I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore

We had time on our side, in the beginning
We, we had nothing to hide, in the beginning
You, you blame me but

It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't wanna hear it anymore

I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore
You say that I didn't try
You say that I didn't try

I swear I never meant to let it die
I just don't care about you anymore
It's not fair when you say that I didn't try
I just don't care about you anymore

(I just don't care about you anymore)
I just don't care about you anymore
(I just don't care about you anymore)
I just don't care about you anymore8Embed
