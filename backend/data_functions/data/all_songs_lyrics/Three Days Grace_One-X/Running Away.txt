Running Away Lyrics
I'm thinking to myself that I've done something wrong
That I have crossed a line
Have you found out this time?
What led you to believe it's only you and me?
Do you see it in my eyes?
Have you found out this time?

You see right through me
'Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard, but you're running away
Please don't turn your back on me

I'm drinking by myself
And oh, I'm going down
But will you pick me up?
Will you leave me on the ground?
I led you to believe it's only you and me
I can see it in your eyes that you found out this time

You see right through me
'Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard, but you're running away
Please don't turn your back on me
Don't just turn and walk away
I can learn from my mistakes
Don't throw everything away

You see right through me
'Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard, but you're running away
But you're running away

You see right through me
'Cause you're running away
You keep turning your back on me
I tried so hard, but you're running away
Please don't turn your back on me1Embed
