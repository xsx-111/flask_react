Gone Forever Lyrics
Don't know what's going on
Don't know what went wrong
Feels like a hundred years
I still can't believe you're gone, so I'll stay up all night
With these bloodshot eyes
While these walls surround me with the story of our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying that I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever

Now things are coming clear, and I don't need you here
And in this world around me, I'm glad you disappeared
So I'll stay out all night, get drunk and fuck and fight
Until the morning comes
I'll forget about our life

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying
That I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
First time you screamed at me
I should have made you leave
I should have known it could be so much better
I hope you're missing me
I hope I've made you see that I'm gone forever
And now it’s coming clear that I don't need you here
And in this world around me, I'm glad you disappeared

I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever
I tell myself that I don't miss you at all
I'm not lying, denying
That I feel so much better
Now that you're gone forever

And now you’re gone forever
And now you’re gone forever13Embed
