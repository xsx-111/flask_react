British People in Hot Weather Lyrics
British people in hot weather (X4)

Fill green envelopes and send them to ya
On train ride, read Marx tracts
Play walkmans loud behind ya
Demonstrate on Oxford Street
About what the Hell they couldn't tell ya
British people in hot weather
Have a heart-to-heart with your sister
People in shorts drunk before ya
Beached whale in Wapping
His armpit hairs are sprouting
Serpentine ah.... Serpentine grrr...


Press hot houses waste tree statements
Compare your pearls before the King of Monks
I'm telling ya, oh
Do they know they can get cancer?
Designer tramp goes grrr...
Looking jolly from Stoke
As he walks through and makes up
Titles like this, to order
They're well off their trolley
Smoking like a chimney
Bespectacled stare-out

I was a candidate for club 18-30
But I've been through all that shit before
British people in hot weather
British people in hot weather
That's it, I'm looking straight for the car
If that's how you feel, let's go
British people in hot weather
British people in hot weatherEmbed
