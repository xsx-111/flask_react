Chicago, Now! LyricsDo you work hard?
Do you work hard?
You don't!
You don't!
You don't! chicago, now!
Do you work hard?
Do you try hard?
You don't. chicago, now!
All is commission time
Commission c.t. time
Set down, setting down
C.t c.t. time
Chicago, now!
Work hard
Do you try hard?
Dear crew
Try hard
Chicago, now!
That's it: you don't
That's it: you don't
Chicago, now!
Chicago, now!
Step down
Setting down, just setting down
See their butt all over the street
You just go up and meet
Just setting down
Chicago now
