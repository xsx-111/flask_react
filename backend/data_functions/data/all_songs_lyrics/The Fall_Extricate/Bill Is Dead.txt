Bill Is Dead Lyrics
Last week after Dynasty
I had crow's feet under my eyes
Paid two days for getting high
Freezing, wheezing
Got pasted in a bar
I hope I've got the number

These are the finest times of my life
This is the greatest time of my life
This is the greatest time of my life
These are the biggest times of my life

But just lately, seeing you
I rise A.M. off pink sheets
I am renewed, I am aglow
Red brick and green is the streets
You dressed today as if for riding school
Your legs are so cool
Came twice, you thrice

These are the greatest times of my life
These are the greatest times of my life
These are the greatest times of my life
These are the biggest times of my life
This is the greatest time of my life
These are the greatest times of my life
This is the greatest time of my life
These are the greatest times of my life
This is the finest time of my life
These are the greatest times of my lifeEmbed
