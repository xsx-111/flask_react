Hilary LyricsHilary
Where's the sixty quid you borrowed off me for the gas?
I won't give you a kiss
Hilary
Hey Hilary
'New Faces' on Saturday at six
Brought you back to me
Hilary
I'm sure it was you in the new Audi
Outside Sainsbury's
Hilary
Remember when you needed three caps of speed
To get out of bed
And now you're on ecstasy
Hilary
With your daft African pop
And that wine you call bull's blood
Hilary
I thank the lord that you still don't live next to me
