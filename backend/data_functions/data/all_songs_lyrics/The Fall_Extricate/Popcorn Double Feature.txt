Popcorn Double Feature LyricsEverybody's going through changes
Everybody's got a bag of his own
Everybody's talking about places
That can only be found in the greater unknown
People are dying
The babies are crying
Don't nobody care at all?
There's love and disaster
And good things come after
Just follow the paths along
Popcorn double feature
The whole world's a funny farm
That man is your teacher
No need to be alarmed
Music's coming out of the woodwork
Sounds so strange, nobody sleeps
I met a little man on the corner
Waving a flag and making a speech
Coffee each morning
Don't park or, nor warning
They tow your machine away
There's so much confusion
That's built on illusion
What's making the music play?
Popcorn double feature
The whole world's a funny farm
That man is your teacher
No need to be alarmed
NOT MUCH
Coffee each morning
No popcorn a-warning
They tow your machine away
There's love and disaster
But good things come after
What's making the music play
