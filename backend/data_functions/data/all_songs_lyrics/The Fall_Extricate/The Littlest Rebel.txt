The Littlest Rebel LyricsThere's loads of people
Trying to suss out the scene
Sniffing about and sticking
Their noses in
Rebel
But she was the littlest rebel
Blue suit with nylon weave
She wears jet black high heels
She throws planks down the well
She's the littlest rebel
Rebel
But she was the littlest rebel
She consigns them all to hell
She's the littlest rebel
Her tormentors jet past in Nissans
She says are those cars?
Are those shoes?
She consigns them all to hell
She's the littlest rebel
Hips like Shirley Temple
She's the littlest rebel
And she doesn't kiss and tell
She's the littlest rebel
Rebel
But she was the littlest rebel
A sophisticate plays truant
She's the littlest rebel
And she doesn't kiss and tell
'Cause she's the littlest rebel
Well she's the littlest rebel
Rebel
And she was the littlest rebelEmbed
