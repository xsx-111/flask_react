Welcome Tomorrow LyricsI am rich - he is on the T.V
I am cool - he lives in every room
I'm a jerk - you can find him in the phone book
I am today - his name's on every tomb
I'm gone - welcome tomorrow
I'm not a book - glistening in splendour
I'm not a tree - a high rise deity
I'm sad - he saves you from the devil
And I am free - he's the son of liberty
I'm gone - welcome tomorrow
Hoo Hoo Hoo
Fall asleep - militia men will murmur
Feel close to me - his name before they die
In love - holy saints will call him
Don't feel so free - then kiss the world goodbye
I'm gone
