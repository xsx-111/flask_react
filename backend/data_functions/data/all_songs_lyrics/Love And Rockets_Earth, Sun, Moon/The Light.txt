The Light LyricsHeaven, heaven
And do you remember
The blackest moment
Those blackest thoughts that rush?
And do you remember
When too much time
When too much time was mine?
Oh, these days
Oh, they're all mine
And do you recall
When you walk
Talk to yourself
In the street?
In your autumn
In your winter
In your wintertime, time
And do you recall when you fall?
I can't help notice
No light in our eyes, in our eyes
I give you my armour
I give you my glory
I give what's truly mine
And if you want
Give me, ooh, heaven
Because heaven should be mineEmbed
