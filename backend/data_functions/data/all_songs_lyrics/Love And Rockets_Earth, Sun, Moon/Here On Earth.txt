Here On Earth LyricsAll the little life forms
Upon this little earth
Multiplying dying and
Returning through rebirth
All the little children
Growing up in space
Adding their small stories
To the history of this race
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
Out-of-towners searching
For the way the world was made
Money spinners reaping
All the gifts from the arcade
All the winos drinking
To a methylated god
All the sleeping policemen
Who go by the book of plod
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
Here on Earth
Another mother's giving birth
To another mother
Who will then give birth
To a son of a gun
Who will cause the birth
Of another
Of the family of Earth
All the searchers asking
Who on Earth is heaven bent
All the gurus telling
That to be is heaven sent
The men in see through mirrors
Who observe the masquerade
And we the masqueraders
Who believe we have it made
Who believe we have it made
Here on Earth, Here on Earth (x2)Embed
