Rain Bird LyricsRain bird dives through the hole
In a broken guitar
Rain bird sings a song so sad in blue
Like a stranded insect
Stuck in a bowl of glue
He tries to fly
But he will die
If he ever leaves the zoo
Rain Bird / Rain Bird
Rain bird swoops through the
Chimney pots and rain
Rain bird flies to the edge of a gilded cage
Hiding in the spotlights
Of a famous stage
He tries to become invisible
Whilst stealing the front page
Rain Bird / Rain Bird / Rain Bird / Rain Bird
When you were a boy
You used to wish for this
But like the cat who turns his nose
Up at the dish
Now that you have it
You want to give it away
When you had to work so hard
Slogging for a pittance
In a boot and shoe yard
That's when you wanted
What you now give away
Rain Bird
You're all the rage, bird
Rain Bird
You're all the rage, birdEmbed
