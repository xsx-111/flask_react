Youth LyricsYouth, so self possessed
Then sometimes no self respect
Youth wants to give you all
Youth could be your downfall
Here comes another revelation
A revolution for us all
I never believed what you said
I only believe what we've done
"We are the Energy"
God bless, God bless, God bless us all
"We are the Energy"
God blessed, God blessed, God blessed
Our soul
Do do do do dooo
Do do do do dooo
Inhibitions - the exhibitions
Don't want to believe in this no more
"We are the Energy"
Don't want to believe in ghosts no more
"We are the Energy"
God bless, God bless, God bless us allEmbed
