No New Tale to Tell Lyrics
You cannot go against nature
Because when you do
Go against nature
It's part of nature, too
Our little lives get complicated
It's a simple thing
Simple as a flower
And that's a complicated thing

No new tale to tell
No new tale to tell
No new tale to tell
Ah

My world is your world
People like to hear their names
I'm no exception
Please call my name
Call my name

No new tale to tell
No new tale to tell
No new tale to tell
Ah
No new tale to tell
No new tale to tell
No new tale to tell
Ah

When you're down
It's a long way up
When you're up
It's a long way down

It's all the same thing
No new tale to tell
It's all the same thing
No new tale to tell
It's all the same thing
No new tale to tell
It's all the same thing
No new tale to tell
It's all the same thing
No new tale to tell
It's all the same thing
No new tale to tell
It's all the same thing
No new tale to tell
It's all the same thing
No new tale to tellEmbed
