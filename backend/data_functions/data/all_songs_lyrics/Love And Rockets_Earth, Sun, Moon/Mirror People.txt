Mirror People Lyrics
I'm so happy with my feet on the ground
So happy, my head spins around
Quite content to sit on this fence
Quite content now a little bit older
The mirror people one day shall be free
The mirror people laugh at you and laugh at me
The mirror people, know not how to cry
So they scream, the mirror people scream inside

Because I could be nothing at all
Because I should be nothing at all
I wish I could be nothing at all
I wish I could be nothing at all

Time goes by so slow
When your stuck to me
Time goes by so slow
When your stuck to me

Yes it's true we're all in a gutter
And yes it's true please set me free
The christian says
I love love everybody
And you and you and you can be free
But I'm so happy with my feet on the ground
So happy when my head spins around
Quite content to sit on this fence
Quite content
Now a little bit older
Because I could be nothing at all
Because I should be nothing at all
I wish I could be nothing at all
I wish I could be nothing at all

Time goes by so slow
When your stuck to me
Time goes by so slow
When your stuck to me
