Strife Lyrics
They wonder how we do it
They ask me if I care
They wonder how come the years
Haven't sought more lover's tear
They question that it's true
A love which never wilts
And they must seek you there
Where furies smite young slits

And they must seek you there
Down in the strife
And they must seek you there
Where death outnumbers life

And they have no idea
What we do at night
And how for you and I
The hour never strikes
They wonder how we do it
They wonder how come
How come I've been doing things with you
I would never tell my mom
And they must seek you there
Down in the strife
And they must seek you there
Where death outnumbers life1Embed
