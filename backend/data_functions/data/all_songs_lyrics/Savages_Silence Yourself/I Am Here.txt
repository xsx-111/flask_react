I Am Here LyricsI am here
And there
At the same time
The world is with me
And you're coming for the ride
I am here
I won't hide
I am shouldering you
This is easy
This is not hard
Are you coming for the ride
Are you coming

I
Am
Here
I am here
I am here
No more fear
No more dark shadows
Let it come
Let me talk to you
See the face of your future
I don't wanna hide
Hear it calling you

I am here
I am here
I am here
I am here
I am hereEmbed
