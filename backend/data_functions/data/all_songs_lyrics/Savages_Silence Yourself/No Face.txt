No Face LyricsDifferent shapes on your face
Which one is your true self
Fake sex fake smile
Waiting for the day you cry

Cause you have no face, you have no face
You have no Face
You have no face, you have no face
You have no face
Repeat every word I say
Miming another boring day
I have better things to do
Now you're here I must get rid of you

Cause you have no face, you have no face
You have no Face
You have no face, you have no face
You have no face
You argue everything
Like a bird who's never learned to sing
Oh darling are you free when doubt
Oh darling don't worry about
Breaking my heart
Don't worry about
Breaking my heart
Don't worry about
Breaking my heart
Don't worry about breaking my heart
Far bigger things will fall apart
Don't worry about breaking my heart
Oh Darling, are you free when you doubt

Don't worry about
Breaking my heart
Don't worry about
Breaking my heart

Cause you have no face, you have no face
You have no Face
You have no face, you have no face
You have no faceEmbed
