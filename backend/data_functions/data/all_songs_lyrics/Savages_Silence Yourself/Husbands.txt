Husbands LyricsWhoa, I woke up and I saw the face of a guy
I don’t know who he was, he had no eyes
His presence made me feel all ill at ease
His presence made me feel, all ill at ease oh, oh
He sung the final hour, he sung the final hour
Of my sleep, my sleep
God I wanna get rid of it
God I wanna get, get rid of it, yeah, yeah
Get rid of it
My house, my bed, my husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, oh
We’re standing here all alone
When my eyes went closed and my mouth went numb
And does he know me very well?
When you talk in the dark will I see him again?
Will I see him again?
He sung the final hour, he sung the final hour
Of my sleep, my sleep
God I wanna get rid of it
God I wanna get, get rid of it, yeah, yeah
Get rid of it
My house, my bed, my husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands
My room, my life
My husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands, husbands, husbands
Husbands, husbands2Embed
