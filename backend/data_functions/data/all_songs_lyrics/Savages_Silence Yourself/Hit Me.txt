Hit Me LyricsOh tell me
Tell me I'm miserable now
Oh cherie can you tell me
I took a beating tonight
And that was the best I ever had
Tell me tell me tell me
Help me
Will you help me
Tell me tell me tell me
Hit me
Will you hit me now

I think I'm ready tonight
I think I'm ready tonight
I think I'm ready tonight
Oh hit me
Hit me with your hands
Oh it's the only way I ever learn
Oh if hell is
If hell is a dog fight

I think I'm ready tonight
I think I'm ready tonight
I think I'm ready tonight
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm readyEmbed
