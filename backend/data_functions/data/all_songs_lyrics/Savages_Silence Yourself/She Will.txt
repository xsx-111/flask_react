She Will LyricsShe will enter the room
She will enter the bed
She will talk like a friend
She will kiss like a man
She will forget her name
She will come back again
Get hooked on loving hard
Forcing the slut out!
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You've got to get used to it
And give your heart a little kick!
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
Oh, oh, oh, oh
She will open her heart
She will open her lips
She will choose to ignite
And never to extinguish!
She will forget her pain
She will come back again
Got hooked on loving hard
Forcing the slut out!
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You've got to get used to it
And give your heart a little kick!
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
She will, she will
