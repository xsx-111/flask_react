Marshal Dear LyricsI hope you're breathing your last breath
Marshal Dear
And you will die, you will die soon
I give you a quarter of an hour
Oh Marshall Dear
Can't you see I'm winning
Can you hear me now
Silence yourself
Silence yourself
Silence yourself
Silence yourself
There are suicides in every dream
Oh Marshal dear
Even more when the army's on its knees
Crowds grow crazy and fire
Oh marshal dear
Can't you see we're losing
Can you feel it now
Silence yourself
Silence yourselfEmbed
