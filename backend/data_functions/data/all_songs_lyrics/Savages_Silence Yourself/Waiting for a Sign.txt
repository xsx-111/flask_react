Waiting for a Sign LyricsYou don't like their manners
You don't like their face
You turn yourself away
From the man who madly drinks
Now you find your nights deeper
Without anyone else
Without anyone else around

Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm waiting
You introduced me to
Different kind of lovers
Told me to walk through
Different kind of tunnels
I guess love by nature
Suited to your face
Something hard to get
But easy to embrace

Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for a sign
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm waiting for a sign
I'm waitingEmbed
