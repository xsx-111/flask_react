Stardust Remedy LyricsI was just a teenage jesus freak
Got drunk on punk and then I found my feet
Tried to make a mad man sane
But I jumped aboard his psychopathic train
You gotta try some
You better try some
Velvet skies and the Velvet Underground
I was lost but now I know I'm found
I don't need no way rainy day
All I really need is Sister Ray
You gotta try some
You better try some
Stardusted coming on
Stardusted coming on
Sister loves my noise distorted soul
Mister brother leather plays his role
What became of the teenage jesus freak
He's still making noise and making heatEmbed
