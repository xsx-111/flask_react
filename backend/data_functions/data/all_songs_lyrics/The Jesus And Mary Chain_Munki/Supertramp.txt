Supertramp LyricsReload and do it again now I'm a real believer
Go ahead and push it again yeah I'm a real believer
Liberate my mind
It's penetration time
Open up and tell me you know that I'm a real believer
Couldn't tell a drug from a sin but I could run forever
Couldn't tell a spike from a pin but I could run forever
Christ knows if I'm done
Well he's the only one
Open up and tell me you know that I could run forever
We know that we've blown the past
Maybe we could change the future
Don't think twice and don't look back
Maybe if we run then maybe we could run forever
(I'm a real believer
I'm a real believer
I'm a real believer
I'm a real believer)Embed
