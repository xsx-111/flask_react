Man on the Moon LyricsCome visit soon
Sure gets lonely living here on the moon
I've got a tale to tell
About my planetary prison cell
We could shoot the breeze
Go out walking in the godless freeze
I've got a mind to kill
But there's no people here so it's no thrill
But I can't find the sky
I can't find the sea
I can't find the people
I guess the people can't find me
Solitary space
I've been staring at the mirror's face
Another perfect day
It means nothing when you live this way
But I guess it's alright
I guess it's okay
I guess it's alright
I guess it's got to be this way
Come visit soon
Sure gets lonely living here on the moonEmbed
