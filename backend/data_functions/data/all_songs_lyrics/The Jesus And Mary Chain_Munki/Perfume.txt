Perfume LyricsMeeow
Meeow
Meeow
Meeow
Alive, alive, alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive alive alive alive
Baby I'm in heaven
But I don't believe a word
No I don't believe a word
Going down
I'm on five
I'm on five
I'm on five
Alive alive alive
Maybe I got lucky
But I always stood the chance
Yeah I always stood the chance of the prize
(aww hehe but there's no more music, come on)Embed
