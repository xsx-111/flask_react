Virtually Unreal LyricsLooking at the TeeVee
Maybe I should blow it away
Staring at the TeeVee
Maybe I should throw it away
Listen to the TeeVee
Maybe it's got something to say
Talking to the TeeVee
I'm really gonna blow it away
Blow it away
If you believe in B. B. King hey
That's okay just do your thing yeah
That's alright
That's alright
Looking for a sure thing
Maybe you can find it in me
Looking for a pure thing
Maybe you can find it with me
Nothing like a sure thing
Nothing like you thought it would be
If you need a pure thing
Maybe you'll be coming with me
Coming with me
If you believe in Jesus Christ hey
That's okay cause he's alright yeah
He's alright
He's alright
He's alright
He's alright yeah
He's alright
He's alright yeah
He's alright
He's alright yeah
(alright, alright, alright, alright)Embed
