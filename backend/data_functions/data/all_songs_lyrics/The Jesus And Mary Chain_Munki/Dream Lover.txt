Dream Lover LyricsWhat do you want if you don't want love
Why do you want
What you thinking of
My love or money
Well it just ain't enough
What do you want if you don't want love
You make me pay and pay
I gave it all away
I gave it all
I bleed for you
I've been looking for an ideal sound
I've been looking for an ideal you
But you don't exist
But you don't exist
What do you want if you don't want love
Why do you want
What you thinking of
But you don't exist
But you don't exist
My dirty money well there just ain't enough
What do you want if you don't want love
I've been pissed on, now I'm confused
I've been beaten, truly abused
I gave my soul away and had it refused
Well that's the only part that you haven't used
