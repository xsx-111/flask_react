Birthday LyricsEverybody loves me goes away
And I'd kill myself if that would make them stay
And I'm drinking to the day that I was made
And I'm sucking on my grown-ups lemonade
Yeah I'm a mean motherfucker now but I once was cool
Yeah I'm a bad motherfucker now but I once was cool
And I was born a long time ago today
And everybody loves me goes away
And it's Christmas time again
Yeah it's Christmas time again
And it's Christmas time again again and again
In my head
In my head
Am I dead
In my head
Curse the light that laughter shines on me
And I couldn't care if I'm never on TV
I'm fine and fit, I'm wasted, and I'm free
And everybody loves me lets me be
Yeah I'm a mean motherfucker now but I once was cool
Yeah I'm a bad motherfucker now but I once was cool
And I was born a long time ago today
And everybody loves me goes away
And it's Christmas time again
Yeah it's Christmas time again
And it's Christmas time again again and again
In my head
In my head
Am I dead
In my head
In my head
In my head
Am I dead1Embed
