Cracking Up LyricsSome said I was a freak
I am a freak
They said I was weak
I am a freak
They said I was in-com-plete
I am a freak
I am a freak
Hey, I got the eyes of a man that's being cut
I got the view of a rat king's son
I guess I'm new and I don't know what to do
I'll judge you fine in my mind in my...
I'm cracking up
Cracking up
Cracking up
One said I was a priest
I am a priest
They said I was least
I am a priest
They said I was in-com-plete
I am a priest
I am a freak
I'm cracking up
Cracking up
Cracking up
We're cracking up
Cracking up
Cracking up
