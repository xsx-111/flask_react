Fizzy LyricsElvis lives and Bob Dylan is dead
And OJ's wife's crawling back from the dead
Love is great
Oh yeah love is good
And my bed friend thinks that love is food
God is great
Oh yeah God is good
And my friend Ben thinks that beer is food
He's alright
Oh yeah he's okay
He can't stand the pain
Stand the pain
Don't you know I can be seen
And life is much too tough
Don't you know I can be seen
And I ain't tough enough
Elvis lives and Bob Dylan is dead
And OJ's wife's crawling back from the dead
Love is great
Oh yeah love is good
And my bed friend thinks that love is food
God is great
Oh yeah God is good
And my friend Ben thinks that beer is food
He's alright
Oh yeah he's okay
He can't stand the pain
Can't stand the pain
Don't you know I can be seen
And life is much too tough
Don't you know I can be seen
And I ain't tough enough
Why can't you see
I belong to me
Why can't you know
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
If you don't know yourself
If you don't know yourself
It's bad for your healthEmbed
