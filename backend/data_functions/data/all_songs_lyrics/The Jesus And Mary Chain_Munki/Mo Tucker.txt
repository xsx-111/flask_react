Mo Tucker LyricsYou know I think it's time you gave the girl a chance
You know she don't need love and she don't need no romance
You've got to walk before you run
You've got to live for number one
Don't get up for her 'cause you're going down
And if you make a deal you know she's got to have her say
And if you make a deal you know it's got to be her way
We're all f**ked up but it don't show
Tell me something I don't know
Uh huh
You know I think it's time you gave the girl a line
You know she don't know how but she knows it'll work out fine
She's gonna walk before you walk
She's gonna shout before you talk
Give her one good reason why she should hang around
Ahuh
And if you make a deal you know she's got to have her say
And if you make a deal you know it's got to be her way
You're all f**ked up but it don't show
Tell me something I don't know
Ahuh
It ain't free so
It ain't easy, yeah
It ain't free so
It ain't easy, yeah
It ain't free so
It ain't easy, yeah
It ain't free so
It ain't easy, yeah
It ain't free so
It ain't easy, yeah
It ain't free so
It ain't easy, yeahEmbed
