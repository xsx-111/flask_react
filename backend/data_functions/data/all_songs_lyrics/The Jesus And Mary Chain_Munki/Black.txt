Black LyricsAnd my mood is black
And my eyes are black
And my life is black
And my love is black
Turn the good thing back
Kiss the good thing back
Make the good thing back
Be the good thing back
Nothing here belongs
Nothing here belongs
Noone here is on my side
Nothing here is mine
Guess I get done wrong
Yeah, I get done wrong
Guess I get done wrong
Yeah, I get done wrong
And the black runs deep
Yeah, the black runs deep
I guess the black runs deep
I think the black runs deep
Nothing here belongs
Nothing here belongs
Noone here is on my side
Nothing here is mine
Nothing here belongs
Nothing here belongs
Noone here is on my side
Nothing here is mine
Hey, you've been saved (x2)
And my mood is black
And my eyes are black
And my life is black
And my love is black
And I guess I can
And I guess I can
Yeah, I guess I can
Think I guess I can
Nothing here belongs
Nothing here belongs
No one hear is on my side
Nothing here is mineEmbed
