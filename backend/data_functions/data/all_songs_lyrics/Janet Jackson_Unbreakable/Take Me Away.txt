Take Me Away Lyrics
Once upon a time was a dream that sounded crazy baby
In fairytales of mine, you would be the one that saved me oh baby
Any time I visualize you, I'm in paradise
It's you and me, thought you don't even know it
So even with a million miles distance between us
I know you'll be there to help me escape

Take me away from here
To somewhere the air is clear
Take me away from here
Go somewhere where love has no fear
Go!

You'll always be that spy that was sent to save me
From intimate danger
The world's playin' my mind
When I'm 'bout to lose it
But you're the game changer
Oh this silly heart of mine lost to a cutie pie
He so turns me on, it keeps getting stronger
Ooh I get a natural high just looking in his eyes
So just hold me close, I'm waiting for you
Take me away from here
To somewhere the air is clear
Take me away from here
Go somewhere where love has no fear
Go!

Oh, uh oh
Oh, uh oh
Take me away
Oh, uh oh
Take me away oh just take me away
Go!

Take me away from here
Just somewhere the air is clear
Take me away from here
Go somewhere where love has no fear
Go!Embed
