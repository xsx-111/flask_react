Love U 4 Life Lyrics
I just can’t
Get over my baby
He just make it all
Feel alright
Don’t know what no more
He just let me go
I just wanna know
Where this comin’ from

Oooh baby
I want you round my life
All the time
You just turned from Hyde
To another side
Freaky freaky
I let you lose your mind
I wanna touch you
Kiss you
Love you for life

You, oh, you
I can’t get used to you like this
I said it’s not right
Whatcha doing
How I feel
Just come over
Let me
Love you, love you
Love you for life
I just can’t
Get over my baby
Finally met my match
More than right
I just let you go
Oh you want some more
So you wanna know
Where this coming from

Ooh, baby
It’s been in my vibe
All this time
I just turned from Hyde
To another side
Freaky freaky
I let you lose your mind
Wanna touch you
Kiss you, love you for life

You, oh, you
I can get used to you like this
I said it’s not right
What you doing
How I feel
Just come over
Let me love you, love you
Love you for lifeEmbed
