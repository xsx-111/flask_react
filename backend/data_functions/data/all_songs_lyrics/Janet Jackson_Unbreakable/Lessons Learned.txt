Lessons Learned Lyrics
Dazed alone confused in thought
Feeling bad for whatever she's done
Got caught up fell in too deep
Played his part but she only blames she
She tells herself
Don't engage in all the wrong
He's not himself when that record comes on
He can't control the things he does
His well being in her prayers as her

Nights are long
The pain so strong
After all the lessons learned
Don't know which way she should turn
What makes her want to stay
So strong

She cries
I just want my baby back
I don't care I don't wanna think back
All the fights, the pain, the scars
Can't compare to the love in his heart
Now he's feeling bad for what he's done
He's himself cause that record is done
Apologies don't come in words
He puts a love song on says it for him their
Night is long
The love is bond
Forget what you've been through
Codependent lover that's her tune
For now his song plays on
Will you
After all the lessons learned
Codependent lover that's her tune
For now his song plays on
Will you
Play yours too
It goes on and on and on
Is it cool?Embed
