Well Traveled Lyrics
I don't know where this journey will end
'Cause the world keeps calling me
At home people embrace me as a friend
And I'm loving all the energy

I've come a long way
Got a long way to go
And I'm so well traveled
The only place in my life that I'll miss
It's on my bucket list
It's a place I don't know

In every race
Every place that I've ever been
There is so much beauty
Down every highway's the by-way to exit again
So much love I never wanna leave

I've come a long way
Got a long way to go
'Cause I'm so well traveled
Wherever life takes me I'm willing to go
Whatever it takes from me
I'ma let it all go
I think it's time to go
'Cause I'm so well traveled
Never stay too long
'Cause I'm so well traveled

Trippin' round the world
Destination unknown
Gotta keep movin'
Until I'm gone
To find the place
I never wanna arrive
'Cause if I ever reach there
There's no place left to goEmbed
