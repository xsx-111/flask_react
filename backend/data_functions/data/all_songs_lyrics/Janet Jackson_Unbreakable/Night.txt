Night Lyrics
I woke up in Heaven in the morning
With the biggest smile upon my face

Across the other side of bliss
Proof that Heaven does exist
I'm offering my gratitude
For what is meant to be
Is 'bout to break thru

Love is taking over
Like a tidal wave
Our universe is aligned
Feeling the love tonight
Love is taking over
Showing us the way
Darkness starts to fade
After the love tonight

I woke up in Heaven in the morning
With the biggest smile upon my face

Way beyond the highest high
Feel love pumping thru your body
Gonna redefine our attitudes
Like you better be good to me
And I better be good to you
Love is taking over
Like a tidal wave
Our universe is aligned
Feeling the love tonight
Love is taking over
Showing us the way
Darkness starts to fade
After the love tonight
Plush

I woke up in Heaven in the morning
With the biggest smile upon my face

Love is taking over
Like a tidal wave
Our universe is aligned
Feeling the love tonight

I woke up in Heaven in the morning
With the biggest smile upon my face
I woke up in Heaven in the morning1Embed
