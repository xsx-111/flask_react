Dream Maker/Euphoria Lyrics
Wish I could create a perfect place
(Wouldn't that be perfect someday)
Without jealousy, abuse or hate
(And all just living off love)
And I'm never giving up
Because I wanna master love
Cause the world is just so beautiful
I just wanna see it come to life

Dream maker
Make my dreams come true
Will you dream maker
I'm ready to take the journey to euphoria
I'm ready for you

Guess the dreamer has to be awake
(Be awake wake wake wake wake be awake)
Brilliant vision but what you gon do
(Crystal clear but what you gon do)
Cause you help me dream this up
Now I'm inspired to master love
I wanna do it just like you showed me
I just wanna see it come to life
Dream maker
Make my dreams come true
Will you dream maker
I'm ready to take the journey to euphoria
I'm ready for you
Dream maker
Make my dreams come true
Will you dream maker
I'm ready to take the journey to euphoria
I'm ready for you

I see a beautiful vision
Of what we can create
If we just master love
A world without war, hunger or hate
You are greater than my dreams
And my dreams are greater than I can do
So dream maker
Make my dreams come trueEmbed
