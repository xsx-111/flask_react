Promise of You LyricsWho can tell you
The promise of you
Will you
Live up to
The promise of you
Gotta stop
Say a prayer
I’m in shock
Can’t believe you just said
I’m nothing
Who are you
Judging me
‘Cause I don’t think like you
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Who can tell you
The promise of you
The beautiful flower
That just hasn’t bloomed
You’re judging the surface
But what’s growing inside
Just might amaze you
Bring it on
I’m prepared
Say I can’t
But I don’t even care
Doing things
You couldn’t dream
So just watch
While I keep doin’ me
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Say a prayer
Don’t recreate me as a clone
Won’t accept no as I go
Gotta vision all my own
I’ll control
The promise of you
Call me strange
I’m unique
No disrespect
I dance to my own beat
‘Cause I know
It’s up to me
Yeah to be
The promise I vow to keep
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh oohEmbed
