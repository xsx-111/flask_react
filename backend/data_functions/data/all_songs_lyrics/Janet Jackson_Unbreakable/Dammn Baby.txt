Dammn Baby Lyrics
Damn baby, baby
I gotta hear me
Damn baby, baby
Damn

Damn, ya same ol' song
Is draggin' me down
Not good for my body
Change it up
Cause it ain't nothing like
Having your own ID
My lanes been stuck
I've never been afraid
To switch oh no not me
And they show me love
For being original

And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby

Damn, A brand new movement
That started with a
Conversation in a caf√©
It's all about love
And how we ain't gon never let
Words get in the way
When you're giving it up
It's never what you say
It sayin' what you do
You wanna show me love
Let's keep that conversation going

And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby

And now the breakdown
Plush
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Watching them all go dammn
Watching them all go dammn baby
Watching them all go dammn baby
Come on

And tell 'em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
Watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby, watch 'em all go
Dammn baby, baby
Dammn

I wish me being happy didn't make you so sad
