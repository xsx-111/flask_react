Ordinary Lyrics
So, tell me, that time in the sunset
When we entered the sunlight
And were apart
Like in every clich√© revealing itself
It's so stupid
Look, a man, a woman, husband, and wife, two strangers, and a representative from the government performing a dissertation on love, but, with them, I'm not sure what it was
What am I afraid of?
It has to be ordinary

Can I only write these things?
Not all the other things?
Does it come to you for free?
I don't know

The curves on her face. The most ordinary
The ones she sees the most
The ones that make her cringe
Yet have the power to calm her
From her panic attacks
Because she knows her hands fit there
The skin makes room
Like the groove in my finger long after
I take the wedding ring off
It wrote something there, on my finger
And my skin just gave in
 finger
Coming through
Just gave in to the ordinary
Giving in to the ordinary
Giving in to the ordinary
To the ordinary
To the ordinary
To the ordinary
To the ordinary, ordinary
To the ordinary
To the ordinary
Ordinary, ordinary
Ordinary, ordinary
Ordinary, ordinary
Ordinary, ordinary
Ordinary

My finger
Outside again, the chaos
And I wonder what is lost
Long after I take the wedding ring off
We don't always get to choose
When we're close
And when we're notEmbed
