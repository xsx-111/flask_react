Lions Lyrics
Look at these trees
Look at this grass
Look at those clouds
Look at them now
And look at them now
Now, look at them now, look at them now
Take a closer look
Take a closer look
Study the raindrops on the leaves
Study the raindrops on the leaves
Study the ants on the ground
I am, all over the place
Study the ground, the brown, porous topsoil
I am, out of place
Its softness, the mushrooms
I am, elsewhere
And the strange blue flowers that grow near them
Study this and ask yourself: "Where is God?"
Oscillating

Back and forth and round and up
Avoiding the loops of the mind

This place doesn't know
Look at me
This place doesn't care
I feel tender in the elsewhere
About the holy scriptures or how to pronounce, and live by, the ecclesiastical
In the dark, a sudden empathy
This is a no-man's land
I am, threatening to some
This is a no-God's land
Like an empty body
Look at those trees again
Must be explained
Look at the bark
But not explored
Look at their height
Are they not darker than the trees you know?
I am, making room for tenderness
Are they not smaller?
TMI, bb, TMI, baby
Listen to the wind and the rattling leaves
Making room for lovers
It's whispering a pagan psalm
Back and forth and round and up
Avoiding the loops of the mind, mind
Back and forth and round and up
Avoiding the loops of the mind, mind
To become the untamed, smooth and muscular
Like lions of the mind, mind

I am, elsewhere
I am, all over the place
Making room for lovers
