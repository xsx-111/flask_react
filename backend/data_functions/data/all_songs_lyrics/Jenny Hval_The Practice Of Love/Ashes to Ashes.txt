Ashes to Ashes Lyrics
She had this dream about a song
She was certain that it was about a burial
The ritual beautifully written
Even the groove was filled with sadness
Every beat went all the way down
Into the two holes in the ground

It had the most moving chord changes
She was certain the lyrics
Went about burying someone's ashes
And then having a cigarette

Like it was telling her, "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
From me to you," but I don't think it was

I had a dream about this song
That I had not written yet
Like I used to dream of fucking before I knew how
I was playing some kind of instrument
That was just a shape in the earth
Like I was playing by digging my own grave
And I scooped out dirt with two fingers
Placed it in my mouth
Like ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Put two fingers in the earth
Into rotting plums
Into the honeypot
Into moist nude magazines
Or on your device
Swipe with two fingers
Like you were kicking feet underwater, or under the earth
To get up to the surface

Put two fingers in the earth
Into the honeypot
I am digging my own grave in the honeypot
Like ashes to ashes, dust to dust1Embed
