High Alice Lyrics
Alice lost, she took a long rest in an unknown place
She thought, "Where do all these creatures come from?
And why are they here?"
Like in a club of fur
Strange feeling, strange feeling

They must be drawn to something
They must be drawn to something
She reaches back through centuries of arms
She reaches back through centuries of arms

While hare and fox and doe and deer
Are all trying to find her
They're all trying to find her
Let her sketch out her rabbit hole
Her pleasure dome

Through centuries, through centuries
Through centuries, through centuries
Through centuries of art, of being drawn to something

They must be drawn to something
Creatures keep swimming around her
She must be giving them something
Those that sleep in the grass and trees
Something that would be better
And I have something better
I want something better
We all want something better
We are something better
To get us close
The beautiful queen, the beautiful clock
The ocean, the ocean, the ocean
Where I wrote my first poem
With my hand on my skin
With my hand between my thighs

I must be drawn to something
A thin layer of wax
I must be giving them something
She 
Something that would be better
And I, I want something better
I want something better
We all want something better
We all want something better
We all want something better
We are high, Alice
We all want something better
We, we are something better
We all want something better
Alice, Alice, AliceEmbed
