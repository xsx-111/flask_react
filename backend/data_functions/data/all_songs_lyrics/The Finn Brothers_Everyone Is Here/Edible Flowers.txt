Edible Flowers LyricsEverybody wants the same thing
Everybody wants the same thing
To see another birthday
Look at all the pretty numbers
Look at all the pretty numbers
Scattered on the calendars
I can see my reflection
I can see my reflection
In the shop window
Who owns that space
Declare it if you dare tonight
Don't let the moment pass
Until another day
Bright lights dissolve
Like sugar deep inside you now
It all ends up the same somehow
I'm hardly here at all
All the trash and the treasure
All the trash and the treasure
All the pain and the pleasure
Taste the edible flowers
Taste the edible flowers
Scattered in the salad days
Who owns that space
Declare it if you dare tonight
Don't let the moment pass
Until another day
Bright lights dissolve
Like sugar deep inside you now
And still the rain keeps coming down
I'm hardly here at all
And everything's gone quiet now
I'm hardly here at allEmbed
