Gentle Hum LyricsThis bird has to sing
My heart has to follow
A man with no soul
Is wooden and hollow
This gentle hum
Is just begun
This gentle hum
Make us one
My wish is for you
An end to your sorrow
And if it comes true
You'll wake up tomorrow
Alone
With a gentle hum
Is just begun
This gentle hum
Will make us one
There
For anyone who cares
Solemn faces in the courtroom stare
And this gentle hum
Will wake up tomorrow
With a gentle hum
This gentle hum
This gentle hum
Will make us one
This gentle hum
Is just begun
This gentle hum, coming up from before
Find a loving feeling, inside
This gentle hum, bringing it back to me
Find a loving feeling, in your lifeEmbed
