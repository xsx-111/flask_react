Nothing Wrong with You LyricsIt's a slow parade
Down a dusty road
We've learned to take abuse
From devils we don't know
People who have lost all heart
Look for someone else to blame
You just keep on walking
When they call you a dirty name
All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you
(You shake it off)
Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you
The moment that we dread
It comes all too soon
Voices in your head
Still carry on the tune
Let the sound come in
From the world outside
You just keep on singing
When they tell you filthy lies
All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you
(You shake it off)
Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you
Remember how it made you hurt
Even as you fight to go on
Turn it into something else
Turn it into something else
All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you
(You shake it off)
Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
No, you don't believe it
All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you
(You shake it off)
Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with you
No
I walk along with you
There's nothing wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with youEmbed
