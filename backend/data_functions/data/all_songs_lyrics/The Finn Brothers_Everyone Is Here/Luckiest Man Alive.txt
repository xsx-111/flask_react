Luckiest Man Alive LyricsI know that it's you behind
Everything that I do
And I wouldn't try to hide
Who I am from you
It's all me
That you see
I was ready for another try
But I needed you to set me free
Must be the luckiest man alive
Man finds love in his life
He's the luckiest man alive
Someone true by his side
He's the luckiest man alive
Once you cut right through
His foolish pride
He's the luckiest man alive
I've never had the time before
Leaving things where they fell
I was going door to door
Always thinking I was somewhere else
You saw me
And what I could be
And now I know what love is for
It's the only thing sets you free
Must be the luckiest man alive
Man finds love in his life
He's the luckiest man alive
Someone true by his side
He's the luckiest man alive
She cut right through
His foolish pride
He's the luckiest man alive
Feel the motion
It's an endless ocean
Rocking gently and
Moving deeply
Feels like always
Been knocked sideways
Over and over by the
Strength of your love
Man finds love
Man finds love in his eyes
He's the luckiest man alive
Someone true
Man finds love
He's the luckiest man alive
Someone trueEmbed
