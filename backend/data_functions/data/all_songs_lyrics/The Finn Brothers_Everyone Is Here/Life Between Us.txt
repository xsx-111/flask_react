Life Between Us LyricsIn so many ways
I'm the same as you
In so many things
Better left unsaid
From out of the deep well
The water flows into the sea
And that's the way it starts
And continues to unfold
But to both of us
That will never change
And we're staring at
Each other
Like the banks of
A river
And we can't get
Any closer
I won't give control to anyone
Walk around , kiss the ground
Like I own the place
But in the passage of time
The river banks get washed away
And that's the way it starts
And continues to evolve
I reveal myself
You watch over me
And we're staring at
Each other
Like the banks of
A river
And we can't get
Any closer
But we form a life
Between us
And brother
(Not my way
Must be the different direction we're facing
Not my way
You're still as unknown
As ever)
Are you still someone
Who'll watch over me
And we're staring at
Each other
Like the banks of
A river
And we can't get
Any closer
But we form a life
Yes, we form a life
Between us
Between usEmbed
