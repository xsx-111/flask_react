All the Colours LyricsI can never forget
The day we said goodbye
Holding your hands
A rainbow low in the sky
And all the colours there
To gather you up and carry you up
All the colours there
To gather you up
Now, we're left here
To get on with our things
Writing it down
And working with wood and strings
And all the colours there
To open us up and bring us luck
All the colours there
To open us up
You went walking through that door
Leaving it ajar
Whenever things come to an end
It takes a while to close it again
And all the colours gently
Pushing it shut, they're pushing it shut
All the colours there
To open us up and bring us luck
All the colours there
To gather us up, to gather us up
To gather us up, to gather you up againEmbed
