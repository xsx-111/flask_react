Disembodied Voices LyricsTalking with my brother
When the lights went out
Down the hallway
Forty years ago
And what became much harder
Was so easy then
Opening up and letting go
Disembodied voices
Floating in the air
This place in the darkness
Could be anywhere
Talking to each other
As we wait for sleep
The angel in the detail
Soon arrives
Spreading her wings over
Every memory
And keeping all our hopes alive
Disembodied voices
Floating in the air
This place in the darkness
Could be anywhere
We all made our choices
Let's work out what we're going to do
Disembodied voices
Revealing what we know is true
And so much is here
If we all disappear
We could be anywhere
We could be anywhere
We could be anywhere
We could be
We could be anywhere
We could be anywhere
We could
We could be anywhereEmbed
