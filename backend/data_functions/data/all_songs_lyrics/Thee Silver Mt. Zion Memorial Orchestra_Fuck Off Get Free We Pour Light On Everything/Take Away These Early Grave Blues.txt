Take Away These Early Grave Blues Lyrics
I don't think of myself as a girl singing rock and roll
I just think of myself as a person doing something
And that's it
And I suppose other people think of it like that
But I don't
Well I don't know why they think of it like that
That's just- they got closed minds, that's all

Take away these, take away these, take away these early grave blues
Fatten up their, fatten up their, fatten up their policemen
Let them sing our, let them sing our, let them sing our pretty song
Take away these, take away these, take away these early grave blues
Pale man always gots his
Pale man always gets his
Boot - on - our - necks
Lightning from a cloud
(Lightning from a cloud)
Lightning from a cloud
(Lightning from a cloud)
How do we get, how do we get lightning from a cloud
(How do we get, how do we get lightning from a cloud)
With love and love dear, love and love dear
Love and love dear, love and love dear
Love and love dear, love and love dear
Love and love dear, love and love dear
The world is awful cruel
The wrecked and worn get blue
My love and I
And so do you
And horses' necks
Straining true
Hearts these hearts
Just won't do
My love and I
And so do you
Take away these, take away these, take away these early grave blues
Fatten up their, fatten up their, fatten up their policemen
Let them sing our, let them sing our, let them sing our pretty song
Take away these, take away these, take away these early grave blues
The sky goes cold while we get old
Those selfish pricks won't ever know
The simple joy of letting go
The world is sick
We're born it
We did it 'cause
All we knew was this
Pale man always gets his
Pale man always gots his
Boot - on - our - necks
Love
Each other
That's
