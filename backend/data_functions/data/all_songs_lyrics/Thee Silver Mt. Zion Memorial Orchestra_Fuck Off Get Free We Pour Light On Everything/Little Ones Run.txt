Little Ones Run LyricsWake up darling the moon is gone
The sky's a mess and falling down
I woke up scared and stumbled out
Where day chased night the birds where shouting
The wind all night and through the dawn
So all their nests broke on the ground
Their little chests and whispering hearts
And tiny breaths all fall apart
They gather up what's left to save
And leave the rest and fly away
The big ones hunt the little ones
And the little ones run
The big ones hunt the little ones
And the little ones run
(The big ones hunt and the little ones run)
(Oh little one run run run)
(The big ones hunt and the little ones run)
(Oh little one run run run)
(The big ones hunt and the little ones run)
(Oh little one run run run)Embed
