Austerity Blues LyricsIf all of us carried our load
Dull and young and bright and old
But thieves and liars rule everything we know
And thieves and liars rule everything that grows
All we want is what we're owed
We've of us carried this load
Fucking high and awful low
We've all of us carried this load
All we want is what we're owed
We've of us carried this load
Fucking high and awful low
We've all of us carried this load
God we've tried how much we've tried
Drunk and high we've seen the sun rise
Many sleepless nights we've seen
The sun collapsed on everything
It's only love that's worth to sing
These bells are broke but still they ring
Love and love's the only thing
Shut up a while the birds are singing
God we've tried how much we've tried
Drunk and high we've seen the sun rise
Many sleepless nights we've seen
The sun on top of everything
Love is all that's worth to sing
We're deep in it and still we bring
The bells are broke but still they ring
The sun on top of everything
