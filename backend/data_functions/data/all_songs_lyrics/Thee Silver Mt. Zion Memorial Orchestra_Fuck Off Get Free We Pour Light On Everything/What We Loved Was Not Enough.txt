What We Loved Was Not Enough Lyrics
The world itself consumed
Man that's the only truth
And what we loved was not enough
Even though we wanted to
I learned it sick in bed
Mining golden vapors
Regrets like charms laid end to end
And other sweet divinities
And other sweet divinities
And other sweet divinities

And this I learned and thus I gleaned
What we loved was not enough
But kiss it quick and rise again
Kiss it quick and rise again
Kiss it quick and rise again
Kiss it quick and rise again
Kiss it quick and rise again
Kiss it quick and rise again
What we loved was not enough
But kiss it quick and rise again
What we loved was not enough
Kiss it quick and rise again
The day has come when we no longer feel
And the day has come when we no longer feel
And the day has come when we no longer feel
And the day has come when we no longer feel
(And the day has come when we no longer feel)
(And the day has come when we no longer feel)
There'll be war in our cities (And the day has come)
There'll be riots at the mall (When we no longer feel)
There'll be blood on our doorsteps (And the day has come)
And panics at the ball (When we no longer feel)
All our cities gonna burn (And the day has come)
All our bridges gonna snap (When we no longer feel)
All our pennies gonna rot (And the day has come)
Lightning roll across our tracks (When we no longer feel)
All our children gonna die (And the day has come)
All our children gonna die (When we no longer feel)
All our children gonna die (And the day has come)
All our children gonna die (When we no longer feel)
Then the west will rise again (And the day has come)
Yeah the west will rise again (When we no longer feel)
The west will rise again (And the day has come)
The west will rise again (When we no longer feel)

So goodnight vain children (And the day has come)
Tonight is yours (When we no longer feel)
The lights are yours (And the day has come)
If you'd just ask for more (When we no longer feel)
Than poverty and war (And the day has come)
If you'd just ask for more (When we no longer feel)
(And the days come when we no longer feel)
(And the days come when we no longer feel)
What we loved was not enough (And the day has come)
What we loved was not enough (When we no longer feel)
What we loved was not enough (And the day has come)
What we loved was not enough (When we no longer feel)
What we loved was not enough (And the day has come)
What we loved was not enough (When we no longer feel)
What we loved was not enough (And the day has come)
But kiss it quick and rise again (When we no longer feel)
(And the day has come when we no longer feel)
(And the day has come when we no longer feel)
(And the day has come when we no longer feel)
(And the day has come when we no longer feel)Embed
