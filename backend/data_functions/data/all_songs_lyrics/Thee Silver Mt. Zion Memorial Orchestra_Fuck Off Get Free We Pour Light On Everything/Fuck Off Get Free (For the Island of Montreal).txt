Fuck Off Get Free (For the Island of Montreal) Lyrics
We live on an island called Montreal
And we make a lot of noise
Because we love each other

Stifled and entitled while they play at boring games
We're stifled and entitled while they play at boring games
But there's fire in our dreams, fire in our dreams, fire in our dreams
And a crying shame!
Panicked born on crumbling shores
Our cities groan beneath the rain
While pennies pile the hoarders smile and proclaim
That what we want will never be
In between we fuck and dream at living free again
And kick at it until we end
Seen some things
Had tiny wings
But tore some light in everything
Seen some things
Had tiny wings
But tore some light in everything, amen!
Stifled and entitled, our proud town's overboard
Our town's been stifled since the day it got born
It's been too long since a stranger held my hand
Goddamn! I need a stranger to hold my hand
But there's fire in our dreams, fire in our dreams, fire in our dreams
And a crying shame
The end again is what we're born in and dull smoke and wide white men
The end again is what we're born in and dull smoke and wide white men
Our! Dreams! Are! All! Of! Us! Until the end!
Our! Dreams! Are! All! Of! Us! Until the end!
Fuck off get free we pour light on everything we see and then we
Fuck off get free we pour light on everything we see and then we
Fuck off get free we pour light on everything we see and then we
Fuck off get free we pour light on everything we see and then we
(Hold me under bright water never let us end)
(Hold me under bright water never let us end)
(Hold me under bright water never let us end)
(Hold me under bright water never let us end)
Hold me under bright water never let us end
Hold me under bright water never let us end
(Our! Dreams! Are! All! Of! Us! Until the end!)
Hold me under bright water never let us end
(Our! Dreams! Are! All! Of! Us! Until the end!)
Hold me under bright water never let us end
(Our! Dreams! Are! All! Of! Us! Until the end!)
Hold me under bright water never let us end
(Our! Dreams! Are..)1Embed
