Rains Thru the Roof at Thee Grande Ballroom (For Capital Steez) LyricsThe very last note choked
Then broke
And kicked like a burning star
And the atoms
In the glass
And the glass
In its window
Are still breathing
There's kids that are dead
That ought to be living
And rains thru the roof
At the grande ballroom
Hold on
Hold on
Don't ever be done
Hold on
Hold on
There
There
GoneEmbed
