Potential Suicide Lyrics
It's such a long way down
Maybe I should try a floor below
A softer landing might just ease the pain
Being a coward is such a drag

Getting so depressed!
Getting so depressed!
Getting so depressed!
Getting so depressed!
Getting so depressed!
Getting so depressed!
Getting so depressed!
Getting so depressed!
(Whisper)
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
I feel it in my brain
It's such a long way down
Maybe a floor below could ease the pain
Could ease the pain, ease the pain
It's such a long way down
Maybe I should try a floor below
A softer landing might just ease the pain
Being a loser is such a drag

Getting so oppressed!
Getting so oppressed!
Getting so oppressed!
Getting so oppressed!
Getting so oppressed!
Getting so oppressed!
Getting so oppressed!
Getting so oppressed!Embed
