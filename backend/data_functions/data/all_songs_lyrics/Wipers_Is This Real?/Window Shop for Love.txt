Window Shop for Love Lyrics
I can't believe my eyes
I can't see so clearly
A thick, dark cloud is hanging all about me
Suffocating me, suffocating me
Invasion from the outside works its way inward
Feeling like a bead of cold ice forming
Into a chamber of lost illusion

Window shop for love
Window shop for love
Want it so much
Look but don't touch


I can't believe my eyes
I can't see so clearly
A thick, dark cloud is hanging all about me
Suffocating me, suffocating me
Invasion from the outside works its way inward
Feeling like a bead of cold ice forming
Into a chamber of lost illusion
Window shop for love
Window shop for love
Want it so much
Look but don't touch
Window shop for love
Window shop for love
Want it so much
Look but don't touch
Window shop for love
Window shop for love
Want it so much
Look but don't touch
Window shop for love
Window shop for love
Want it so much
Look but don't touch
Window shop for love
Window shop for love
Want it so much
Look but don't touch
Look but don't touch
Look but don't touch
Look but dooon't...
