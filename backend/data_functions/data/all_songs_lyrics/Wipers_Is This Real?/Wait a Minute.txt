Wait a Minute Lyrics
Let's get just a little too proud
That's the way it appears in the crowd
But it's not quite the same
So you think that you'll never get burned
What are you doing waiting for your turn?
Wait a minute
So is it that we're really on trial?
But nothing's ever gonna change our style

Let's get just a little too loud
That's the way I've seen it written in the clouds
But I'm so far away
Thought you said I would never get hurt
What am I doing crawling in this dirt?

Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
So you think that you'll never get burned
What are you doing waiting for your turn?
Wait a minute
So just give a little smile
Nothing's ever gonna change for a while

Let's get just a little too proud
That's the way it seems in the crowd
But it's not quite the same
Thought you said I would never get hurt
What am I doing crawling in this dirt?

Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minuteEmbed
