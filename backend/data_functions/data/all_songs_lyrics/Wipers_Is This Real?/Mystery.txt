Mystery Lyrics
You think I'm retrospective
Of someone you used to know
I think it's indecision
That leaves us such a long way to go

But you say, "It's not that way."
Try to make amends
So it will never end

You don't care about it
You don't care about it
You don't care about it
You don't care about it

But can't you see?
It's a mystery

I always try to wonder
How it must feel to be real
In one door, out the other
Undercover, do you think it shows?
But you say, "It's not that way."
Try to make amends
So it will never end

You don't care about it
You don't care about it
You don't care about it
You don't care about it

But can't you see?
It's a mysteryEmbed
