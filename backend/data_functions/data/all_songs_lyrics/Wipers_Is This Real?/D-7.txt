D-7 Lyrics
Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Towards anti-social
Dull, dull, so dull

Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday, mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them

Dimension Seven
Dimension Seven

Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not straight
Reject, reject
Towards anti-social
Dull, dull, so dull
Past astro borders
Zeno lies waiting
Past gaseous remains
Intrigue, such intrigue
Gonna leave this region
They're taking me with them

Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Towards anti-social
Dull, dull, so dull
