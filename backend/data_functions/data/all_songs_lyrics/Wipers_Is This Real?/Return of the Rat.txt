Return of the Rat Lyrics
Well, you better watch out
Well, you better beware
Cause they're coming from all sides of the country now
You'd better beware

Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

They better confess
Well, they better confess
They started this mess
I know, I seen them do it now
They better confess

Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Well, you better watch out
Well, you better beware
They're coming from all sides of the room now
You'd better beware

Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Return of the rat
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...Embed
