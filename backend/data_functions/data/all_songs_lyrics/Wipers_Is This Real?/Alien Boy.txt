Alien Boy Lyrics
Go and grab your gun
They got him on the run
'Cause he's an alien
They hurt what they don't understand

So you got to turn away
There's no other way
'Cause you're an alien
They hurt what they don't understand

Got him on the run
Go and grab your gun
'Cause he's an alien, alien, alien
Alien boy
Got no rights
No rights at all
Just feeds off the sun

So you got to turn away
There's no other way
'Cause you're an alien
They hurt what they don't understandEmbed
