Up Front Lyrics
It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to trust
It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to touch
It's got to be up front
Be so close to trust
It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to trust
It's got to be up front
Be so close to trust
It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to touch
It's got to be up front
Be so close to trust
It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to trust

Oh, it's such a shame
You no longer feel no pain
I can't stick around
While you try to decide

It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to trust
It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to touch
It's got to be up front
Be so close to trust
It's got to be up front
It's got to be so close to touch
Oh, it's oh so plain
You no longer feel no pain
I can't stick around
While you try to decide

It's got to be up front
It's got to be up front
It's got to be up front
If you wanna, wanna touch
It's got to be up front
If you wanna, wanna trust
Be up front
If you wanna, wanna touch
It's got to be up front
Be so close to touch
It's got to...

So why just sit so plain?
Your eyes just show the strain
I can't stick around
While you try to decideEmbed
