Tragedy Lyrics
Tragedy
Oh, tragedy
You're, you're, you're such a tragedy
Oh, tragedy

But don't ever let go, oh no
Don't ever let go, oh no

Injury
Oh, injury
You, you, you caused me injury
Oh, injury

But don't ever let go, oh no
Don't ever let go, oh no

Tragedy
Oh, tragedy
You're, you're, you're such a tragedy
Oh, tragedy
But don't ever let go, oh no
Don't ever let go, oh no
Don't ever let go, oh no
Don't ever let go, oh noEmbed
