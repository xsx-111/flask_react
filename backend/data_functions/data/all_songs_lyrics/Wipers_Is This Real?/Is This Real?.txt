Is This Real? Lyrics
Sometimes I get these feelings and I don't know what to say
Is it that I don't belong here? 'Cause I, I really want to stay
Sometimes I wish that you could break up to me

Is this real?
Is this real?
Is this real?

In time, I found myself wishing you were here
But then I realized that all time has stood still
Sometimes I wish that you could break down to me

Is this real?
Is this real?
Is this real?

In time, I found myself wishing you were here
But then I realized that all time has stood still
Sometimes I wish that you could break down to me

Is this real?
Is this real?
Is this real?
Sometimes I get these feelings and I don't know what to say
Is it that I don't belong here? 'Cause I, I really want to stay
Sometimes I wish that you could break down to me

Is this real?
Is this real?
Is this real?1Embed
