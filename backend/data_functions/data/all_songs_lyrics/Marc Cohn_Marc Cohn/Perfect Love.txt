Perfect Love LyricsDown by the boathouse at Shaker Lake
When there wasn't nothing but love to make
They were two young lovers wishing on the stars above
Well, they carved their initials in an old birch tree
With a heart and an arrow and a 'sixty-three
You had to be blind not to see... It was a perfect love
It was a perfect love. Ooh, yeah, yeah
Well, they worked one summer together at the '64 World's Fair
They met Robert Kennedy there
Well, that was... right before the fall
They saved up a little money for his career
And they talked about the future, underneath the giant sphere
And all around them the little voices were singing:
It's a small world after all
Yes it is, it's a small world after all
And it was... Perfect love
It was a perfect love
(Under the moon and the stars above, it was a perfect love)
They were dizzy from dancing on Rockaway Beach
They came to Rockaway
Yeah and everything they dreamed of was still within reach
Dreaming, Dreaming as the years roll by
Like they always do
Well, they had their share of hard times too
But whatever they were, they never let it get them down
Now, they just go walking down a country lane
See the leaves are changing, in a misty rain
And only one thing remains the same, wo-oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Just a perfect love
(Under the moon and stars above it was a perfect love)
Ooh, yeah, yeahEmbed
