Silver Thunderbird LyricsVerse 1:
Watched it coming up Winslow, down South Park Boulevard
Yeah it was looking good from tail to hood
Great big fins and painted steel
Man it looked just like the Batmobile
With my old man behind the wheel
Bridge:
Well you could hardly even see him
In all of that chrome
The man with the plan and the pocket comb
But every night it carried him home
And I could hear him saying
Chorus:
Don't you gimme no Buick
Son you must take my word
If there's a God in Heaven
He's got a silver Thunderbird
You can keep your El Dorados
And the foreign cars absurd
Me I wanna go down
In a silver Thunderbird
Verse 2:
He got up every morning while I was still asleep
But I remember the sound of him shuffling around
Right before the crack of dawn
Is when I heard him turn the motor on
But when I got up they were gone
Bridge:
Down the road in the rain and snow
The man and his machine would go
Oh the secrets that old car would know
Sometimes I hear him saying
(I can hear him say)
Chorus:
Don't you gimme no Buick
(You can take my word)
Son you must take my word
(Me I'm going down)
If there's a God in Heaven
(Silver Thunderbird)
He's got a silver Thunderbird
(I still hear him say)
You can keep your El Dorados
(You can take my word)
And the foreign car's absurd
(Me I'm going down)
Me I wanna go down
(Silver Thunderbird)
In a silver Thunderbird
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Ahhh
Bridge:
Down the road in the rain and snow
The man and his machine would go
Oh the secrets that old car would know
I still hear him saying
Chorus:
Don't you gimme no Buick
Son you must take my word
If there's a God up in Heaven
He's got a silver Thunderbird
(I still hear him say)
You can keep your El Dorados
(You can take my word)
And the foreign car's absurd
(Me I'm going down)
Me I wanna go down
(Silver Thunderbird)
In a silver Thunderbird
(Me I'm going down)
Me I wanna go down
(Silver Thunderbird)
In a silver Thunderbird
