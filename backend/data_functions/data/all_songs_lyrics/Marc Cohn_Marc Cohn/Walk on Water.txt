Walk on Water LyricsLet's go down to the sound tonight
Tide is low and we can walk on water
Reel me in under that starry light
Just like the fisherman's daughter
Baby when the bands and the barkers go home
They say that Venus she rises
From out of the foam
She dances on air and laughs at the moon
And watches young lovers in fiery dunes
So are you willing to wait for the miracle
Willing to wait it through
Are you willing to wait for the miracle
Or don't you believe they're true?
There's an old man sitting by the side of the pier
He's got his cross and his camera
And his bottle of beer
He just sits all day and all through the night
Praying for a vision or a heavenly light
'Cause he's willing to wait for the miracle
Willing to wait it through
He's willing to wait for the miracle
What else is he gonna do?
What else is he gonna do?
Now me I don't need no heavenly sign
'Cause I got the water and the wine
So baby please let your lovelight shine
'Cause we're all gonna meet our maker
Sometime
That's why I'm willing to wait for the miracles
I'm willing to wait them through
I'm willing to wait for the miracles
But I just can't wait -- for you
Just can't wait for you
Let's go down to the sound tonight
And walk on water
Walk on water
Walk on waterEmbed
