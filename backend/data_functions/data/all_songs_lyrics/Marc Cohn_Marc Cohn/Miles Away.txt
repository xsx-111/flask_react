Miles Away LyricsMy friends will ask me how I'm doin'
But I just can't lie to 'em
Not feeling fine today
I saw my dreams they were a
Ship on the ocean now it
Looks like they're miles away
Miles away
Hey, hey -- they're miles away
I know there's always something
We have to go through
That has some deeper meaning but
Right now I just can't say
I know there's gonna be a lesson somewhere
I'm gonna think a lot about it later
But right now I'm miles away
Miles away
Hey hey I'm miles away
Hey hey hey I'm miles away
I'm a million miles away
Where I don't have to think at all
Don't have to listen to you whisper
Your little secrets in the hall
Yeah I'd really love to talk about it
But I think I hear my mama calling me...
Miles awayEmbed
