Dig Down Deep LyricsBaby let's go below the surface
And see what we can find
There's no reason to be nervous
'Cause it happens all the time
I dont wanna go up to the mountain
I dont need to go down to the sea
I'm gonna sit right here
'Till we unravel the mystery
While the lights of the city are shinin' below
I wanna hold on to you girl and never let go
While everyone else is just walkin around in there sleep
Baby let's dig down, dig down deep
I wanna dig down deep
I dont wanna wait until tomorrow
'Cause the fortune said that the time is now
It's time to find out what we're doin'
What we're doin' anyhow
Yeah, let's go out in the moonlight
And walk for a while
Maybe stay up all night
And talk the talk for a while
Baby kick off your shoes
'Cause you got nothin to lose but your sleep
Baby let's dig down, dig down deep
I wanna dig down deep
Could you dig down deep
It's an open invitation
So baby dont you cry
It's a life long celebration
I think we're right on time
It's a feelin in your heart
Lump in your throat
It's a strange and lovely ride
Wanna dig down deep inside
While the lights of the city are shinin' below
I wanna hold on to you girl and never let go
While everyone else is just walkin around in there sleep
Baby let's dig down, dig down deep
I wanna dig down deep
Could you dig down deep
I wanna dig down deepEmbed
