Still Love Me Lyrics
See it in your eyes
See it in your face, in your look
See it in you

If I make myself understood
Will you treat me like you know you should?

Still love me, still love me (Do you love me?)
Still love me, still love me (Do you love, do you love me?)
Still love me

See, it’s been a while
Looking through your eyes
I was taken in, taken by surprise
Why did you want me, why’d you stayed so close?
You’re still not leaving, was I enough?

If I make myself understood
Will you treat me like you know you should

Still love me, still love me (Do you love me?)
Still love me, still love me (Do you love, do you love me?)
Still love me
Do you love me, do you, love?
Do you love, do you love, do you still love me?
You’re the one that’s more easy to adore
I don’t ever have to leave if you still want me

If I make myself understood
Will you treat me like you know you should

Do you love me
Still love me, still love me (Do you love, do you love me?)
Still love me
(Do you love, do you love me?)
Still love me (do you love me?)
Still love me (do you love, do you love, do you still love me?)
Still love me (If I make myself understood)
Still love me (Will you treat me like you know you should?)
Still love me
Still love me
Still love me (If I make myself understood)
Still love me (Will you treat me like you know you should?)
Still love me
Do you love me?
Still love meEmbed
