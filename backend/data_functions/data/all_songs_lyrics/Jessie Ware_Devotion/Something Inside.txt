Something Inside Lyrics
Dreamy haze can blind me
So take me where the tide lines will find me
Underneath and in between
Swallowed up, you come for me
I see you

Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside

Come along, look down below
I want to go everywhere you go
You know the best, I catch my breath
So steal me, take me in, I want you

Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone
Let me run, let me feel like someone
(I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
I can see your face, I will find you)
Let me run, let me feel like someone
(I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
I can see your face, I will find you)
Let me run, let me feel like someone
(I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
I can see your face, I will find you)
Let me run, let me feel like someone
(I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
I can see your face,I will find you)
Let me run, let me feel like someone
(I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
I can see your face,I will find you)
Let me run, let me feel like someone
(I can hear my name, and I'm on my way
I can see your face)

Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
(Let me run, let me feel like someone)
Offer me something inside
A place to go, a place to hide
Offer me something inside
(Let me run, let me feel like someone)1Embed
