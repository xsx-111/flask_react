No to Love Lyrics
(Who says no?)
Who says no to love?, who says no to love?
(Who says no?)
Who says no to love?
(Who says no?)
No to love, no to love
Who says no to love?, who says no to love?, who says no to love?
What was I thinking of?
Who says no to love?, who says no to love?, who says no to love?
And what were you thinking of?
No to love
No to love, no to love
No to love, no to love
Who says no to love?, no to love?
What were you thinking of?
No to love
Who says no to love?
No to love
Who says no to love?
No to love
Who says no to love?, no to love?
And what were we thinking of?
No to love

Smashed on sours
Felt like the man of the hour when we first met
I can’t deny the power
Could you feel it, feel it, feel it in the air?
Love is all around, love is everywhere
You said, who says no to love
If they understand the consequence ask for your permission
Endless rendition
A life without you, forever I’ll be missing
Without you, forever I’ll be missing (repeated)

No to love, no to love
No to love, no to love
No to love
And what were you thinking of?Embed
