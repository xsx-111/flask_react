Running Lyrics
Your words alone
Could drive me to a thousand tears
All the same words
That kept me here for all the years

I’m lost again, it’s happening
When you’re around I just go weak
All I wanna know - is it mutual?
Then I never want to leave
Then I’m ready to run, ready to fall
Think I’m ready to lose it all
And I’m ready to run, ready to fall
Think I’m ready to lose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running

You keep me
Keep me running
Oh, would you hold my hand like the air was so gently here?
Never give up, never give up
Oh, would you pull me close so nobody knows we’re there
No one can find us

I’m lost again, it’s happening
When you’re around I just go weak
All I wanna know - is it mutual?
Then I never want to leave
Then I’m ready to run, ready to fall
Think I’m ready to lose it all
And I’m ready to run, ready to fall
Think I’m ready to lose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running (For your love)
Keep me running, you keep me running (For your love)
Keep me running, you keep me running (For your love)
Keep me running, you keep me running

You keep me
Keep me running
Saw me coming
Keep me running
And I’m lost again, it keeps happening
But when I'm around you, when I'm around you I just go weak
All I wanna know - is it mutual?
Am I ready to run, am I ready to fall?
I think I’m ready just to lose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running

You keep me running
Never give up, never give up

Keep me running, you keep me running (But you never give up)
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running (But you never give up)
Keep me running, you keep me running
You keep me5Embed
