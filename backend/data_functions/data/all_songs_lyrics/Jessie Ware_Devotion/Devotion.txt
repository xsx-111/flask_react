Devotion Lyrics
You used to be so close to me
Everything happened so easily
Life with you is like a dream
Without you, there's no way to be

Need your devotion
Need your devotion

Ready to love - do you want it enough?
Can we find a way to bring you back again?
You say you want to love, but do you want it enough?
The end of us, it never hurt so much

Need your devotion
I need your devotion

Don't leave me in the dark, don't leave me this way
Cause nothing's making sense today
I need you in my heart, I need you to stay
I need your love
Need your devotion
Need your devotion
Need your devotion

Running away, are you running to me?
Running away, are you running to me?
Running away, are you running to me?
Running away, are you running to me?
Running away, are you running to me?
Running away, are you running to me?

Need your devotion
Need your devotion
Need your devotion
Need your devotion
Need your devotion
Need your devotion

Running away, are you running to me, to me?4Embed
