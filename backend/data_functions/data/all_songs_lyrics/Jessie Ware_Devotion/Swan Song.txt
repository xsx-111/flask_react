Swan Song Lyrics
Lose yourself in the glow
Rise and fall, breathe in slow
Left the sky, paint it all
Fall your eyes, fall our souls
Fall our souls

Hear my swan song
Oh oh, it was my mistake
Catch a kiss now, swan song
Help me to escape

You cast your spell
With stories told
Promises
Will they unfold

Hear my swan song
Oh oh, it was my mistake
Catch a kiss now, swan song
Help me to escape

I still hope eyes will fall
Out the line, out the line
Let me go
It’s alright, it’s alright
Hear my swan song
Oh oh, it was my mistake
Catch a kiss now, swan song
Help me to escapeEmbed
