Night Light Lyrics
Here in the dark, it's funny how I never feel alone
Do you?
Here in the shadows, away from the light
This darkness under which we hide
Like a ghost I cannot see
You’re the shadow behind me

You’ll be my night light there when I go to sleep
You’ll be my night light, baby, when I dream
Under the moonlight shining on the sea
You’ll be my night light watching over me

Behind the glass, he’ll never leave
Lets me in when I don’t deserve to be
Strong when I am weak
I wish he caught how this heart soars
Shadow man, will you come for me?
Like a ghost I cannot see
You’re the shadow behind me

You’ll be my night light there when I go to sleep
You’ll be my night light, baby, when I dream
Under the moonlight shining on the sea
You’ll be my night light watching over me
Map the way for us to go
Tell me where to follow
I'm happy to be told, happy to be told
I'm taking it apart for you to see
I could be falling to pieces, so let me fall
Let me fall into your shade

You’ll be my night light there when I go to sleep
You’ll be my night light, baby, when I dream
Under the moonlight shining on the sea
You’ll be my night light watching over me

Watching over me
Watching over meEmbed
