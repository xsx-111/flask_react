Taking In Water Lyrics
I wish I was you, a piece of gold at the bottom of the blue
Too heavy to swim, but too beautiful to lose
Holding my breath, diving down to give you air
I never knew the colors that surround you

(Look up, look up)
Holding on forever to keep you
(Look up, look up)
Keep you from slipping too deep
(Look up, look up)
If you want to escape, you don't need to
(Look up, look up)
Just look for me

I'm taking in water for you, my love
Pulling you, I'll take the blue away
I'm taking water, my brother, remember
I'm taking water for you

You picked up the light, the spectrum begged to turn to white
Too bright to be seen, I wish that beautiful boy was me
Never alone, the sky's a different shade of brave
Making you glow, the colors dance around you
(Look up, look up)
Holding on forever to keep you
(Look up, look up)
Keep you from slipping too deep
(Look up, look up)
If you want to escape, you don't need to
(Look up, look up)
Just look for me

I'm taking in water for you, my love
Pulling you, I'll take the blue away
I'm taking water, my brother, remember
I'm taking water for you

Treasures are lost on the bed
And buried down in your soul
Buried down in your soul

(Look up, look up)
Holding on forever to keep you
(Look up, look up)
Keep you from slipping too deep
(Look up, look up)
If you want to escape, you don't need to
(Look up, look up)
Just look for me
I'm taking in water for you, my love
Pulling you, I'll take the blue away
I'm taking water, my brother, remember
I'm taking water for you1Embed
