Sweet Talk Lyrics
I thought you knew I had to stay away from you
I thought you heard, yeah still you have the power
You can’t be here, how long till you disappear?
Don’t wanna be the last one here

But you give me the sweet talk and it works for me
And it’s the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I’m the weak one and I won’t say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

Don’t keep me with the kisses
There’s never any there when I need
It’s just that you can always make me feel
Like I am slipping in way too deep
And let the shadows hope to hide
Or break the dreaming, dreaming of us
And if I keep slipping in, just keep up with the talking
Know that I’m with you, I’m not about to go

But you give me the sweet talk and it works for me
And it’s the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I’m the weak one and I won’t say no
You give me a reason, so I never go
So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away
So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away
But you give me up
But you give me up
But you give me up
But you give me up

But you give me the sweet talk and it works for me
And it’s the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I’m the weak one and I won’t say no
You give me a reason, so I never go
But you give me the sweet talk and it works for me
And it’s the sweet words that pulls me in
I know I’m the weak one and I won’t say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

Sweet talk
Give me the sweet talk1Embed
