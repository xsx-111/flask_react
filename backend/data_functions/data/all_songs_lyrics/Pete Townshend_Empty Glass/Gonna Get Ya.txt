Gonna Get Ya LyricsI'm walking - Stand still
Not running - Sit tight
Soft talking - I'm thrilled
Not gunning - By your light
Not flying - Lady
I'm falling - This way
I'm not crying - Maybe
I'm calling
And I'm going to get you anyway
I'm gonna get you, yeah
I'm gonna get you anyway, yeah
I'm cooking - Hot me
Not raping - Blue eyes
I'm just looking - You got me
Not gaping - No lies
I'm not chasing - Lady
I'm trailing - This way
I'm not racing - Crazy
I'm wailing
And I'm gonna get you anyway
I'm gonna get you, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna get you anyway, yeah
I'm gonna get you anyway (By sheer persistence)
I'm gonna get you anyway (Break down your resistance)
I'm gonna get you anyway (Babe, I'm gonna woo ya)
I'm gonna get you anyway (Girl, I'm gonna do ya)
I'm gonna get you anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah, woo
I'm gonna get you anyway
I'm gonna get you anyway
I'm gonna get you anyway
I'm gonna get you anyway
I'm gonna get you anyway
I'm gonna get you anyway
Girl, I'm gonna do ya
I'm gonna get you anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Athletic - Boogey down
Hustle - Turn back
Feel pathetic - Sugar town
No muscle - Soul hack
I'm jumping - You move
No dancer - Beside me
I'm thumping - You prove
Don't get no answer
But I'm gonna get you anyway
I'm gonna get you, gonna get you, gonna get you, gonna get you
I'm gonna get you anywayEmbed
