I Am an Animal LyricsI was always here in the silence
But I was never under your eye
Gather up your love in some wiseness
For every memory shall always survive
And you will see me
I am an animal
My teeth are sharp, and my mouth is full
And the passion is so strong
When I'm alone, loneliness will change me
I am a vegetable
I get my body badly pulled
And I'm rooted to the spot
Nothing will rearrange me
I'm looking back, and I can't see the past
Anymore, so hazy
I'm on a track, and I'm travelling so fast
Oh, for sure I'm crazy
I am a human being
And I don't believe all the things I'm seeing
I've got nowhere to hide anymore
I'm losing my way
I am an angel
I booked in here, I came straight from hell
And I don't know how to lie anymore
I'm boozing to pray
I'm looking back, and I can't see the past
Anymore, so hazy
I'm on a track, and I'm travelling so fast
Oh, for sure I'm crazy
I was always here in the silence
But I was never under your eye
Gather up your love in some wiseness
Every memory shall always survive
And you will see me
I will be immersed
Queen of the fucking Universe
And I don't know what I have anymore
Anymore than you do
I am a nothing king
Been right around on a golden ring
I don't know where you are anymore
I've got no clue
I'm looking back, and I can't see the past
Anymore, so hazy
I'm on a track, and I'm travelling so fast
Oh, for sure I'm crazy
I am an animalEmbed
