Peace Beneath the City LyricsHere's a prayer for the body buried by the interstate
Mother of a soldier
A tree in a forest up in flames
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the women hear the washboard rhythm in their bosom when they say
"Give me good legs
And a Japanese car
And show me a road"
Sing a song for the bodies buried by the riverbank
A well-dressed boy
And a pig with a bullet in the brain
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the white girls wander the strip mall, singing all day
"Give me a juggernaut heart
And a Japanese car
And someone to free"
Say something for the body buried like a keepsake
Mother of million mouths with the very same name
Black valley, peace beneath the city
Where the women tell the weather
But never ever tell you what they pray
They pray
"Give me a yellow brick road
And a Japanese car
And benevolent change"Embed
