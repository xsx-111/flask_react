The Devil Never Sleeps Lyrics
Dreamin' again of a train track endin' at the edge of the sea
(Big black cloud was low and rollin' our way)
Dog at the barbed wire barkin' at my buzz cut friends and me
(Sound of a switchblade shinin' in the summer rain)

No one on the corner had a quarter for the telephone (ooh)
Everybody bitchin', there's nothin' on the radio

Dreamin' again of a city full of fathers in their army clothes
(Chatterin' boys and a chicken at the choppin' block)
All of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go
(Didn't find a friend but, boy, I really bought a lot)

Someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming home (ooh)
Everybody bitchin', there's nothin' on the radio

Dreamin' again that it's freezin' and my mother's in her flowerbed
(Long dead rows of daffodil and marigold)
Changin' her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she said
(Blood on my chin still chewin' on a red rose)
No one lives forever and the devil never sleeps alone (ooh)
Everybody bitchin', there's nothin' on the radioEmbed
