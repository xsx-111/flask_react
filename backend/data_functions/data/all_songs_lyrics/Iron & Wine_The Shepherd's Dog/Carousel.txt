Carousel Lyrics
Almost home when I missed the bottom stair
You were braidin' your gray hair
It had grown so long
Since I'd been gone
And the perfect girls by the pool, they would protest
The cross around their necks
But our sons were overseas
And we all know 'bout the hive and the honeybees

Almost home with an olive branch and a dove
You were beating on a Persian rug
With your Bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on the TV stand
When a cruel wind blew every city father fell
Off the county carousel
While the dogs were eating snow
All our sons had sunk in a trunk of Noah's clothes

Almost home and got lost on our new street
While your grievin' girls all died in their sleep
So the dogs all went unfed
A great dream of bones all piled on the bed
And the cops couldn't care when that crackhead built a boat
And said, "Please, before I go
May our only honored bond
Be the kinship of the kids in the riot squad"Embed
