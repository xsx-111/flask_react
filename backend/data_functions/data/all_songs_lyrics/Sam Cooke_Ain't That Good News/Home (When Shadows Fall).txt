Home (When Shadows Fall) LyricsOh, when shadows fall
And trees whisper day is ending
My thoughts are ever wending home
Oh when crickets call
My heart is forever yearning
Someday to be returning home
When the hills conceal the setting sun
Stars begin a-peepin, one by one
Oh night covers all and though fortune may forsake me
My dreams will ever take me oh home
Oh night covers all and though fortune may forsake me
My dreams will ever take me oh homeEmbed
