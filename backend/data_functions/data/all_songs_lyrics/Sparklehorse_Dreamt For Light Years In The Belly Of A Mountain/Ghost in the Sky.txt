Ghost in the Sky LyricsAbide with me from the morning 'til the evening
Abide with me when the night is high
Be my last sight and sweet to rest
Forever on your warm decaying breast
See you blind behold your saviour's come
Dance for death you lame in the morning fires
And be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Grace has purified my blindness
It could be fresh and new and glorious
Will my bleeding ears be rung with joy
Or are they just plain spent and well destroyed
See you blind behold your saviour's come
Dance for death you lame in the morning fires
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
A ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the sky
Be a ghost in the skyEmbed
