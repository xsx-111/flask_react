Some Sweet Day LyricsYou are you are my daisy
You're my lullaby
Come sun up my dogs will fade to
Honeysuckle and clear moonshine
She was she was my black earth
And the fire in my spine
Her magnetic waves gave birth
I was the one who loved you most
But you can't put your arms around a ghost
Some sweet day you will be mine, you'll be mine
Some sweet day you will be mine, you'll be mine
We can we can go home soon
O'er the cold old sea
Her lover is in the old moon
Oh to kiss her knobbly knees
Know she's laughing underwater
Her pain's gone away
We drank whiskey like our fathers
Born to return back to the clay
My love for you girl will never decay
Some sweet day you will be mine, you'll be mine
Some sweet day you will be mine, you'll be mine
Where did you go, up to the sun?
Where are you now, part of the sea in every drop
Or did you simply stop?
Some sweet day you will be mine, you'll be mine
Some sweet day you will be mine, you'll be mine
Some sweet day you will be mine, you'll be mineEmbed
