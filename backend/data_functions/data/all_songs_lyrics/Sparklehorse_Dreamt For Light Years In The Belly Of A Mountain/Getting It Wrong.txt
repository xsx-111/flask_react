Getting It Wrong LyricsSet your woods on fire
Hide up in the spires
The flames kept dancing higher
They're playing our song
They're playing our song
They're getting it wrong
Ophelia in the creek
Caught up in the sticks
Some things can't be fixed
They're playing our song
They're playing our song
They're playing our songEmbed
