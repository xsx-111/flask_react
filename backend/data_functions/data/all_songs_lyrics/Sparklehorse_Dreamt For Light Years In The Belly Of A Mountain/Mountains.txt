Mountains LyricsOnce I was a big old bear
Reigning blows on sparkly snares
In the woods after the snow
The white noise witch her hammer's cold
Rest beneath the pine and rose
In our suits and Sunday clothes
Cheer up my brother
It's gonna be alright
I know your hearts are heavy as mountains
But we're gonna go back home one day
Hang there little winter star
Tell me who you really are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Born with honey in my hair
Once I was a big old bear
Cheer up my brother
It's gonna be alright
I know your hearts are heavy as mountains
But we're gonna go back home one day
Wore my dress up to my knees
There's ghosts of babies in the streamsEmbed
