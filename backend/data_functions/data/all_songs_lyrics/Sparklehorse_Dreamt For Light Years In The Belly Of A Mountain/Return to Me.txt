Return to Me LyricsArise oh brother mountain
Our hooves hammering your coils
The rivers carve out your hollows
With tears from me
Return to me
Return to me my love
Oh my love
Be still oh rusting river
Unlock her name from your grass
Unburden the pressures of fathoms
Of tears from me
Return to me
Return to me my love
O my love
O my love
Return to the clouds
Return in the caves
Return over valleys
O my love
O my love
O my loveEmbed
