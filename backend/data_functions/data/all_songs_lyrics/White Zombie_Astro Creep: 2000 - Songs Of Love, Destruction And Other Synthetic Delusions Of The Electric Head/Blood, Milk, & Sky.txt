Blood, Milk, & Sky LyricsThe siren sings a lonely song
Of all the wants and hungers
The lust of love a brute desire
The ledge of life goes under
Divide the dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes
Empty winds scrape on the soul
But never stop to realize
Animal whisperings
Intoxicate the night
Hypnotize the desperate
Slow motion light
Wash away into the rain
Blood, milk, and sky
Hollow moons illuminate
And beauty never dies
Running wild, running blind
I breathe the body deep
1,000 years beside myself
I do not sleep
Seduce the world it never screams
Dead water lies
Ride the only one who knows
Beauty never dies1Embed
