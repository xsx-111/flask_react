Creature of the Wheel Lyrics
Creature of the wheel trigger wicked way
Tangle like a web beneath me
Ankle-deep in hell through another way
Crucify the sky above me

New God kill machine and man
Say Lord of the engines

Pocket full of dirt frozen in my hands
Hold on to the nameless god
Breathe into the deep and dying light of day
Overdose on bloody wings, yeah...

Splinter in the skin turn your eyes away
Sick and swaggering beneath me
Revolution mind ye of little faith
Rusty and dull -- cut me

("Creature of the wheel"
"NO!!!"
"Lord of the infernal engines")

("And O' brothers and sisters, I ask you to look at him
Does he have the marks? Do you see them?"
"NO!!!")

[Demon-paper clowns stitched across my back
Easygoing dead black eyes, yeah
Microscopic giants on a chicken-run
Everybody dies laughing!]

Thrust into the drag on the edge and wait
Motivate the one inside you
Bastard kicker burn blow the ash away
Heldorado gonna get you
("Creatures of the wheel"
"NO!!!"
"Do we need the creatures of the wheel?"
"NO!!!"
"Lord of the infernal engines")Embed
