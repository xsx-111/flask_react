Real Solution #9 Lyrics("Yeah, I remember her saying, 'I'm already dead.'
...Well today I want you each to stand up and hold your hands in some stupid symbol... You're gonna get up and scream...You're gonna get up and burn an X in your head.")
Who will survive and what will be left of them?
Apocalyptic dreams see the ordinary madness
Who will survive and what will be left of them?
I never lock the dogs when the wolf is in the darkness
Come on - come on the motherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Come on - come on the motherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Who will survive and what will be left of them?
Into another world number nine bring the death in
Who will survive and what will be left of them?
Loser take it all - getting high on the kick in
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Who will survive and what will be left of them?
Got 24 hours of psychoholic magic
Who will survive and what will be left of them?
Illuminate the face and the eye of the serpent
Come on - come on the motherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Come on - come on the motherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

I'm already dead
Come on - come on the motherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Come on - come on the motherfucker's on fire
He cut through the bone, he cut through the wire
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
("I just couldn't make you feel. Oh, yes lord, I can feel, yes lord, yes lord, hallelujah! Oh lord, I feel your victory, lord. I feel you with me lord, hallelujah!")
("Are you hurting anyone? Can you feel my heart beating, now? Do you feel like hurting anybody else? Do you feel like hurting anybody else?")
("Why should I hurt anybody else? Halelujah!")Embed
