Blur the Technicolor Lyrics
Falling down I am a psychoholic
Erratic and sure I cannot fail
Replay slow smooth and automatic
Go easy riding danger
Yeah - two guns west I ride an instamatic
Polaroid rat crucifixion nail
Antenna down cruising in the deep red
Mouth of a demon angel
GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON!
Yeah! Rush of blood burn through my face
And vicious t-bird breed on the whore
Wonder wheel cool and hellamatic
Go easy riding danger
Yeah -- shadowplay I blur the technicolor
Stain a holy bed -- a diamond way
Blackened core clear fuck-o-matic
Mouth of a demon angel
GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON!
Yeah! Straight to the top sadistic or anything
Acid eat the face of night
Strip to the bone release me -- violate
Eye of God, a goddamn, right
GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON!
Yeah! Falling down I am a psychoholic
Erratic and sure I cannot fail
Sit them there and sink into the deep red
E-Z riding danger
Yeah! Shadowplay I blur the technicolor
Keep 'em running-go-demolition way
Going down deep into a hole
Called love of a demon angel
GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON!
GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON! GET IT ON!
("This is the end of your rotten life you motherfucking dope pusher.")Embed
