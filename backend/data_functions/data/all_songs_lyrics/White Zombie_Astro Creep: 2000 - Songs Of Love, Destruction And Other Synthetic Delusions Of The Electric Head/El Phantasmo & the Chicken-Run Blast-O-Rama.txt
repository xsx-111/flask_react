El Phantasmo & the Chicken-Run Blast-O-Rama LyricsYeah! I penetrate the demons
Their teardrops burn away my eyes
I love the paper-thin cry of the locust
Is there any other way to die?
Find me another hell
And the death bird ride
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, the motherfucker
Yeah! I'm down-drifting slowly
Going close enough to the sky
The new world gone slay the devil
Can you show me a better way to die?
Find me another hell
And the death bird ride
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, the motherfucker
New lovers bang the corpses
They eat the rain and don't ask why
I am a plague in an 18-wheeler
So get behind the wheel I'm gonna driveEmbed
