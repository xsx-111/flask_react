Electric Head Pt. 1 (The Agony) Lyrics("Perhaps you'd better start from the beginning....")

We all go down for the sacrificial moment
Crucifixion nails stain the bed of the holy
Space thing blues diamond studded, sugar coated
Well, I am hell a miracle overloading

Turn me on, yeah
Electric head all over
Turn me on, yeah
Electric head all over

We all go down for the God of the moment
Super demon seed running wild and below and
Head trip news turn a trick to the flow and
Sugarland Express what you know and

Get inside, get in there
Evil in your eyes, baby I don't care
Get inside, get in there
See the flesh falling everywhere



We all go down for a piece of the moment
Watch another burn to the death to the core
And the roadshow thrills pack the freaks and the phonies
Sing: now is now, yeah! All I ever wanted
