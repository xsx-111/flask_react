Electric Head Pt. 2 (The Ecstasy) Lyrics(I just said, 'Up yours, baby)
Strip down core violate and paralyze
Flood my soul a coffee dreg -- supersize
Slung low like a whore
Devil want some more
Cupid bought a gun -- he gonna blow the fucker

Yeah - I want it
Yeah - I need it
Yeah - I love it
Yeah - Electric Head
In your head
In your head - in you
Breakneck speed get a violent spinal cracking
Back down to the chrome and feel the death wish attacking
Hubcaps on your eyes
Cannot sympathize
A fistful of hair and a splinter in the mind

Yeah - I want it
Yeah - I need it
Yeah - I love it
Yeah - Electric Head
In your head
In your head - in you
(I'll kill the motherfucker and I'll come looking for you)
(Watch your mouth man, I'll say any damn thing I want)
Too far gone see the freak apologize
Flood my soul a coffee dreg - supersize
Slung low like a whore
Devil want some more
Cupid bought a gun - he gonna blow the fucker

Yeah - I want it
Yeah - I need it
Yeah - I love it
Yeah - Electric Head
In your head
In your head - in youEmbed
