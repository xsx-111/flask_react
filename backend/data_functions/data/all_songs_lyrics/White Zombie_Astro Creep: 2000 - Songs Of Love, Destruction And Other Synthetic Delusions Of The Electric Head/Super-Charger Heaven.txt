Super-Charger Heaven Lyrics("Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.")

Jesus lived his life in a cheap hotel
On the edge of Route 66 yeah
He lived a dark and twisted life and he
Came right back just to do it again
Eye for an eye and a tooth for the truth
I ain't never seen a demon warp deal'n
A ring-a-ding rhythm or jukebox racket
My mind can't clutch the feeling

Devilman, Devilman, calling
Devilman, running in my head yeah
Devilman, Devilman, calling
Devilman, running in my head yeah

Hell hounds lead at the cowardly kings
And carry souls across the river Styx yeah
They see no evil and feel no pain
Sucking juice from a fallen angel
I dreamed I was a super nova fucker nitro-
Burning and fuel injection
Feed the gods a strychnine soul
A motherfucker of invention
Devilman, Devilman, calling
Devilman, running in my head yeah
Devilman, Devilman, calling
Devilman, running in my head yeah
("Insipientia corde suo, non es deus
Non est vita qui adorem, non es usque ad unum
Es excommunicatus, ex unione fidelium.")
("It is not heresy. And I will not recant.")

Inbreed the witches and worship the dogs
Deformed and fuckin' lazy
Damn yourself and choke on my name
I'd love to love ya baby
Deadringer rats swinging in the trees
Immaculate conception
Bury me an angel God
I need some inspiration

Devilman, Devilman, calling
Devilman, running in my head yeah
Devilman, Devilman, calling
Devilman, running in my head yeahEmbed
