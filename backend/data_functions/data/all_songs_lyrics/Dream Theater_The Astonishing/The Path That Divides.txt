The Path That Divides Lyrics
The evening stars shine brightly over Heaven's Cove
As night descends in silence, the fated scene unfolds
Consumed with trepidation, Arhys hears his brother's voice:

"As you're facing the path that divides
I will always be here by your side."

I feel my pulse begin to race
Beads of sweat drip down my face
I have made a grave mistake
What have I done?
My blood for my son?
It's not too late
I won't betray him

I knew the day had come and you could be tempted
To give up the Chosen One and finally end this
Do anything for your son, a terminal weakness
Now you're as good as done

I didn't have a choice and I was defenseless
I didn't believe his voice and fighting was senseless
But now I can see the truth, I've come to my senses
I shouldn't have trusted you
Arhys was never aware
His son had followed him there
Confused and deathly afraid
X watched his hero be brave

On the path that divides, you were there by my side
There will be no betrayal tonight
I found courage and strength, in the words you once sang
Tore the truth from the lies, on the path that divides

You dare defy your prince?
Well you just threw your life away
Along with Xander's dreams
You chose the wrong man to betray!

Two hungry warriors clash in the shadows of the night
But that's the cost with every fight
And Arhys' fight for hope cost him his very life1Embed
