A Savior in the Square LyricsEXT. RAVENSKILL TOWN SQUARE - DAY

We have come to hear him sing
To see this gift your savior brings

A crowd has grown
And all mesmerized
But silence quickly falls
As Lord Nafaryus arrives

Please don't stop on my account
Show us what we heard so much about?

In peace, we gather here today

Don't make him ask again!
Do as my father says!

Brother, worry not today
I will share my music
And they will soon be on their way
They only know the Noise Machines
So I'll treat them all to sonic ecstasy
Never in my dreams could I deserve
To ever see a vision quite like her
Then unexpectedly
I'm taken by surprise
An angel just appeared before my eyesEmbed
