Brother, Can You Hear Me? Lyrics
Brother, can you hear me?
Your life is in my hands!
I will not surrender
Never yield to his demands
If we stand together
We will never fall
Brother we're the answer to your call
Brother, can you hear me?
You must not be afraid
I will march beside you
Have no fear
Be strong
Be brave
We sing the song of freedom
Our voices will resound
Brother we will never let you down

On the road to revolution
We're bound to make mistakes
There's a price that we must pay
For every choice we make
Freedom is the reason
To stand up or give in
But someone has to lose
And someone has to win
Brother, can you hear me?
I am not afraid
I will not forsake you
I'll be strong and I'll be brave
I sing the song of freedom
My courage knows no bounds
Brother now I stand on solid ground
Brother I will never let you down
Never let you down!Embed
