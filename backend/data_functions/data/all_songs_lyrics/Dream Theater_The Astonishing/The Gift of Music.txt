The Gift of Music Lyrics
Far in the distant future
Beyond the pages of our time
Cold-blooded wicked tyrants
Threaten the freedom of mankind
Corruption, lust, and greed
Define the new nobility
Changing the course of history
Across the vast North Empire
Most people struggle to survive
Living a meek existence
While their secluded leader thrives

We are living day-to-day
Forced to bear the lion's share
People just don't have the time for music anymore
And no one seems to care!
My friends, I've seen the chosen one!
A quest for freedom has begun
He will be the answer to our prayers!
There walks a god among us
Who's seen the writing on the wall
He is the revolution
He'll be the one to save us all
My brother Gabriel
Is all the hope we need
Shining like a beacon in the night
Shepherd of Ravenskill
A reason to believe
Music is the gift he brings
The songbird stops and listens when he sings5Embed
