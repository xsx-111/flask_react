Our New World Lyrics
Like your father once said
Life is not what you're given
It is how you decide to live
On the path you have chosen
So together we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

I know you're scared and alone
But we will face this together
Through the innocence in your eyes
They will live on forever
In their memory we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

We'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world
Together we'll build a new world
A wondrous world
We'll build a new world
A bold new worldEmbed
