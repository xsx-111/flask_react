Act of Faythe LyricsRavenskill Town Square. Daytime

I never knew they spent their days in rags
While I enjoy the life they’ll never have
Yet deep within their eyes
Hope still survives
And they don’t seem to think this world’s so bad
Even as they gather in the square
They know a better life exists out there
With unity and pride
Faith stays alive
How can I pretend that I don’t care?
I have always felt alone
Living like a stranger inside of my own home
Maybe now’s the time to greet the winds of change
Could my destiny be right in front of me?
As a child behind the palace walls
Often times I’d search its secret halls
And hope that I would find
A treasure cast aside
I came upon the greatest gift of all
My music player
My private paradise
My music player
A refuge I must hide
Been lost at sea forever
Adrift and far away
Now finally for the first time I know
I’ve found my way
Found my wayEmbed
