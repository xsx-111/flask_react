A New Beginning Lyrics
Father, I implore you
Don't believe a word
He is not the enemy
That is just absurd
You may see his talent
As some kind of threat
But I know we were meant to be
From the day we met
Give us both a chance
For a new beginning
Nothing would mean more to me
He is just a man
Can't you show him mercy?
Sympathy and strength go hand in hand

This man's a fraud and a hoax
He'll only shatter your hopes
Saddest of all is to watch how you fall
For this person who you hardly know

Ignorant and stubborn
You have no respect
Not just for your flesh and blood
But all who you protect
Listen without judgement
Keep an open mind
If you cannot see the truth
You're the one who's blind
We don't stand a chance
That is his opinion
Mother, can you talk to him?

Try to understand
How they must be feeling
Misery's to know what might have been

Why would I ever concede
To listen to this fool
How can you be so naive?
You must be living in a world of make-believe
Do you really think this charlatan is who he claims to be?

Not long ago there was a time and place
You too possessed the same desires as Faythe
You knew how it felt to feel invisible
Music calmed your soul, just like a drug
Remember Bug?
Father, is it true
Bug was always you?
Finally I can reveal
How music makes me feel
Now you understand
Why I was hiding!
This changes everything!
I will grant the chance
For a new beginning
In the end, the final word rests with me
