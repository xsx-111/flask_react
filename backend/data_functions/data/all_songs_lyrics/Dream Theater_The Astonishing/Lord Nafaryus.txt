Lord Nafaryus LyricsEmperor's Palace. Nighttime

How the rumours are spreading like vines
Of a man who has been glorified
News finds its way
To the Empire one day
Where the envious ruler resides

Should I fall for the stories I hear?
Is he really a threat I should fear?
Such a foolish young man
Doesn’t seem to understand
So let me be perfectly clear
He may have them inspired
Eating out of his hands
But he’ll never be ruler of this land
For myself I must see
What the hype is about
I admit I’m intrigued
I’ve heard the whispering of revolution
I know the aim of your plan
You think insurgency is your solution
And put your faith in one man
His decision is made
So his journey begins
Off to the edge of The Realm
To meet the savior
In the coming days
They’ll announce his grace
And he’ll ask to be amazed
As a symbol of power and might
It will make for a breathtaking sight
In a massive display
With his family and guards by his side

Arabelle, who means the world to me
Our loyal son, my heir, your future king
And Faythe, I treasure more than all the diamonds in my crown
It isn’t hard to see
I couldn’t be more proud
Into the far off reaches of the land
To witness this great spectacle first-hand
Is Gabriel the God he claims to be?
I guess we’ll see
Yes, we shall seeEmbed
