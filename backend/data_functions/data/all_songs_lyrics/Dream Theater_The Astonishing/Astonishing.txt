Astonishing Lyrics
Brother, can you hear me?
His life is in your hands!
He is just a child
And still too young to understand
Show him love and courage
That freedom knows no bounds
Tell him he could never let me down

Father
I will make you proud
Rest in peace

I've always had the answer
All this time I held the key
And now that I see the reason to believe
I can be the man who I am meant to be

Because of you I live again
Now I can be a voice for change
And help to build a world that's fair and true
So they can live the life they never knew
On the road to revolution
There are lessons to be learned
All the things you thought that mattered
Are lost at every turn
When the light of my existence
Was slipping through my hands
Pride and ignorance receded
To reveal a humbled man

My prince, my son, you've got lost along the way
In light of this new burden that you face
You are forgiven at this day!

People, can you hear us?
Peace has been restored!
The silence has been broken
Music reigns forever more!
We sing a song of freedom, together we are bound
People, we shall never hold you down!
We will build a world on common ground
And we'll live once more, eternally in harmony
Our lives will be astonishing again!1Embed
