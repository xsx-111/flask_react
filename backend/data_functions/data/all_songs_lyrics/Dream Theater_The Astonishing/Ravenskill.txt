Ravenskill Lyrics
Morning breaks beyond the night
And she's a world away
Through crowded streets
This quiet hooded stranger makes her way

Please, excuse me
Sir, can you help me?
Where can I find this man?

Sorry, can't speak
Someone is waiting

Yes, I understand

As her will
Starts to fade
And all but disappears
Like a ghost
Suddenly a boy is standing there
And all is clear
I'm your friend
Trust me, don't be scared
I am looking for your father
And I promise I can help
Now take my hand
We haven't time to spare

Hopeful and innocent
Sensing no danger
He sees humanity
Behind the stranger's eyes
Her true identity
Will be revealed when she sheds her disguise

My intentions are faithful!
There's a chance we can still end this game
I'd be forever grateful
To see him once again

You dare to stand
Before my eyes!
You're one of them
Why would I trust you?
It's not like that
I can't go back!
Hope fades away
With each passing second
Lost in this moment
Is where I want to stay
This can't be broken
We need to find a way
Gabriel!
I would wait a lifetime
Just to see your face
But all we have is one more day

I remember your father was moved by my song
I know when he sees we're united that he'll understand
We will walk this road together
We will face this hand in hand
With music and love on our side we can't lose this fight
Tomorrow our dream comes aliveEmbed
