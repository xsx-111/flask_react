The Answer LyricsRavenskill Park. Daytime

I don’t pretend to have the answer
Never said I had the key
But somehow they see, a light inside of me
Am I not the man who I was meant to be?
As the people gather ‘round me
I never felt so all alone
Is this the chance to be someone, my moment in the sun?
Why am I afraid of facing the unknown?
They are finding faith in me and they believe I’m the one to set them free3Embed
