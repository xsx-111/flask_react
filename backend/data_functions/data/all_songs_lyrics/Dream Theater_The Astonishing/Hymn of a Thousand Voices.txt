Hymn of a Thousand Voices Lyrics
Out of the shadows
One by one they came
To shed their light upon his moment of doubt and pain
A thousand voices
Rang out through the night
A symphony of mercy for their savior
Too tired to fight
And as the chorus grew
A thousand hearts beat true
Then like a glowing beacon in the dark
Hope came shining through
Amazingly the savior found his voice
And all together they rejoiced...

Glorious sound
Guide her tonight
Out of the darkness
Into the light
Merciful song
Set her soul free
Unbind the chains of endless sleep
Choirs on high
Grant her new life
Make me a vessel of thy boundless grace
Music has shown her the way
She lives today!Embed
