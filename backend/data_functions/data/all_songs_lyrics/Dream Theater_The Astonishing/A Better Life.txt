A Better Life Lyrics

As fearless leader of the Ravenskill militia
The blood of warriors
Flows throughout my veins
My brother’s gift remains my secret ammunition
It is our hope, our pride
A catalyst for change
Still the fires of revolution burn within my eyes
On this perilous road to freedom
He’s our one and only guide
For many years, I've seen our people starve and suffer
How many more will die
Before we stand and fight?
They ask me "Arhys
Could things be any tougher?''
The answer’s no surprise
“Yes, you bet your life!”
Now the fires of revolution won't burn for evermore
I see liberty in our future
And it’s one worth fighting for
We all long for a better life
Like a dream that can't be denied
This is the moment
Now is the time
Freedom, if we live or if we die
I shall give him a better life
I swore this vow to my dying wife
Sure, she would not survive
Peacefully
She slipped away
The meaning in my life
Was born that day
And so I found the strength to carry on with this crusade
It is my fate
Evangeline
You lived a life of misery and pain
Evangeline
I’ll never let your memory die in vain
Evangeline
My heavy heart still bleeds
I dedicate my life to set him free
And I will carry on to plant the seeds
I promise in the name of our new son
This battle won’t be over until it’s won!3Embed
