The Road to Revolution Lyrics
He only sees what he desires to see
It took a while but finally he agreed
Though everything did not turn out as planned
If love's a risk, it's worth a chance

I know where there is faith there's always hope
We'll meet beneath the stars at Heaven's Cove
Where ghosts of yesterday
Once filled the lighted stage
Taking our first step down a new road

Arhys, time is running out!
What will your decision be?
If you still have any doubt
Think about Evangeline

On the road to revolution
Our salvation's never free
There's a price for liberation
When you stand for your beliefs
When the man in the mirror
Takes a long hard look at me
Will the person staring back
Be the man I want to be?

Change my mind?
A waste of time
For soon he will be mine

Open eyes
Help me see which choice is right1Embed
