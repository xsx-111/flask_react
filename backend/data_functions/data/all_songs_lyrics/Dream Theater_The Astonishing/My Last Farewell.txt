My Last Farewell Lyrics
Angels above
Have you deceived my eyes?
Be still, my love
I won't leave your side
All my life
I have walked alone
Now I found my home in you
Only I'm too late
Have I wandered into someone's nightmare?
This is more than any heart can bear
You stole my brother's life!
How many more have to die
Before you will open your eyes?
Don't leave me now
Hold on for one more breath
Stay strong somehow
This can't be the end!
All your life
You have walked alone
Now I am your home
So take my hand and don't let go
Crushing pain and crippling grief
Nothing like I've ever felt
God above and souls beneath
Hear my last farewell!Embed
