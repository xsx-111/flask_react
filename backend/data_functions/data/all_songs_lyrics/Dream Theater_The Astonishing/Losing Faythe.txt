Losing Faythe Lyrics
My foolish pride
My selfish heart
Lost in the dark
Blinded by my arrogance
And now you beg for one last breath
And I'm the one to blame
There's a reason now I see
The reason you have chosen
To find the light inside of me
If only I believed

Here I am
Don't be afraid
I will never let you slip away
Look my way
You must be brave
Find the strength to live for one more day
I will keep from losing Faythe
I will ask for grace
And hope we find a way
Like a candle's dying flame
With forgiving eyes
She starts to drift away

Gabriel, my son!
I see the tide is turning
Can The Chosen One
Keep her fire burning?
I would shed my life
Just for one last moment
Use your gift, I beg!
May life begin again!
May life begin again!Embed
