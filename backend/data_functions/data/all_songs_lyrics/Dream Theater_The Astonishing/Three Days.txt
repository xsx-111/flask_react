Three Days Lyrics
The admiration
The applause and the cheers
I am impressed
You’ve brought us all to tears
To think I didn’t notice
The way you looked at her
Now step down from your throne
And let me bring you back to earth
Need I remind you?
I am the ruler here
Don’t overlook that fact!
Swearing allegiance
To anyone but me
No, I won’t put up with that
Hide and protect him, send him away
I’ll never play this game
Stand by your savior, one thing remains
I’ll find him just the same

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus
Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus
He’ll surrender on his own
If not, there’ll be hell to pay
I’ll tear down the city stone by stone
You only have three days!
Send home the rebels, call off the fight
In no uncertain terms
Should you refuse me, fear for your lives
Ravenskill shall burn!

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus
Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus

With this frightening decree
Nafaryus departs
They’re left to weigh the gravity
Of his threatening remarks
Judgment day will soon arrive
In only three days’ time
Will Gabriel get out of this alive?
This remains the question on their minds!Embed
