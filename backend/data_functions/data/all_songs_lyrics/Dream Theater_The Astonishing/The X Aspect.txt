The X Aspect Lyrics
Betray my blood
To save my son
A hopeless choice to make
But who am I
If not the one
Who's meant to keep him safe?
Is trust and loyalty still justified
If I deny him of a better life?
Gabriel
Has always been
The strength I called upon
But nothing breaks
A father's will
To do what must be done
Should I turn my back on him?
Abandon all our plans for revolution?
Will hope and freedom die by morning light?
Evangeline
I swore to you
To love and guide our son
Destiny
Has shown his face
And now the time has come
Desperation blinds me
And through these bloodstained eyes I see the light
A better life is worth the sacrificeEmbed
