Begin Again Lyrics
I gave up hope
Was dead inside
Stayed lost within a world I chose to hide
Then I found my faith in him
And now I can
Begin again
I once believed
Our fate was sealed
But now at last, the truth has been revealed
In an instant, life could change
And now and then
Begin again
I know that I am meant for something more
That life beyond these walls
Has greater things in store
When I heard his voice, I realized
I'd never be the same
Instantly I knew my life had changed
I dream of peace
Above all else
To share a world where we could be ourselves
We must learn to rise above the past
Before we can at last
Begin againEmbed
