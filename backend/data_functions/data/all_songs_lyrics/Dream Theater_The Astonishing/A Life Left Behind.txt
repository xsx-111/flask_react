A Life Left Behind Lyrics
I never knew
Someone was out there
A long way from nowhere
Who could open my eyes
All of this time
While I was sleeping
The world changed around me
Now I've never felt more alive!
I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up!

Faythe found a way
To bring them together
Once and forever
And won't let them go
Nothing I say
Can keep her from leaving
Her life has new meaning
I lost her a long time ago
I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up!
I'm waking up!
Now that yesterday's gone
Won't close my eyes again
I'm waking up!
I'll plan to return well disguised
Make sure that I'm not recognized
Tomorrow a new sun will rise
And somehow I'll find you
Nothing will stand in my way
Soon I will see you again
I'm waking up
From a life left behind
To see what lies ahead
I'm waking up!
I'm waking up!
(I'm waking up)
Now that yesterday's gone
(Now that yesterday's gone)
I won't close my eyes
(I will never look back)
I'm waking up!
You'll be her shadow as she moves, my son
But she can never know you're there
She is alone and rebel guards are everywhere

I'll keep her safe from all danger
Won't let her out of my sight
Did I fail to mention my honest intentions?
This is the chance I deserve
Heed my words, justice will be servedEmbed
