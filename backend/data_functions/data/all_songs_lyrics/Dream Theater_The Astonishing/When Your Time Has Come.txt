When Your Time Has Come Lyrics
...eyes
EXT. RAVENSKILL TOWN SQUARE - DAY

When your time has come
And you're looking toward the light
All that really matters
Is what you leave behind
So let your heart be free
Keep your spirit burning bright
Set down the stones you carry
Take the weight off your mind
When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know
Which choice is right
In this fleeting life
We can sometimes lose our way
But night is always darkest
Just before the new day
When you're facing the path that divides
Know that I will be there by your side
Find your strength in the sound of my voice
And you'll know
Which choice is right

This very moment
Was always meant to be
I never noticed
But all at once I see
On the worst of days when I felt most alone
With no one to share the secret that I hide
I grew numb to all the emptiness inside
But now I've found my home1Embed
