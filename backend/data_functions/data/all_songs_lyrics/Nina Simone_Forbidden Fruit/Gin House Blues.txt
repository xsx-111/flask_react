Gin House Blues LyricsStay away from me
'Cause I'm in my sin
Stay away from me everybody
'Cause I'm in my sin
If this joint is raided
Somebody give me my gin
Don't try me nobody
'Cause you will never win
Mm, yeah, don't try me nobody
'Cause you will never win
I'll fight the army and navy
Somebody gives me my gin
When I'm feeling high
I don't have nothing to do
Oh, when I'm feeling high
I don't have nothing to do
Just fill me full of good liquor
I'll sure be nice to you
Any bootlegger show him
A pal of mine any old time
Any bootlegger show him
A pal of mine
'Cause a good bottle of gin
Will get it every time
Lord, I don't want no clothes
I don't even want no bed
To lay my head
I don't want no clothes
I don't event want no bed
To lay my head
I don't want no pork chops and green
Just give me gin instead
Oh, oh, stay away from me
'Cause I'm in my sin
Oh, oh, stay away from me yeah
Everybody 'cos I'm in my sin
If this joint is raided
Somebody give me my gin
Somebody give me my ginEmbed
