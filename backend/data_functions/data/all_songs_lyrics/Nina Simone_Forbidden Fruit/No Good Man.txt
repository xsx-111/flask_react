No Good Man Lyrics
No good man
Lovin' on a no good plan
Never treats me as he should
And that ain't good
He's always bringing me down
And he's no saint
Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly, and not on me
I'm the one who gets the run around

I oughta hate him, but still I love him so
'Cause I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find I always get that kind

No good man
Ever since the world began
And there's been other fools like me
Born to be in love with a no good man

I ought to hate him, but still I love him so
'Cause you see I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I'll find always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began
There's been other fools like me
Born to be in love with a no good manEmbed
