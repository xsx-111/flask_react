Just Say I Love Him Lyrics
Just say that I need him
As roses need the rain
Tell him that without him
My dreams are all in vain

Just say I love him
Loved him from the start
And tell him that I'm yearning
To say what's in my heart

Just say that I need him
As roses need the rain
Tell him that without him
My dreams are all in vain

If you should chance to meet him
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
Say I was a fool to leave him
Tell him how much a fool can care
And if he tells you he's lonely now and then
Just won't you tell him that I love him?
And want him back again
If you should see him anytime anyplace anywhere
Tell him I was a fool to leave him
Tell him how much a fool can care
And if he tells you he's lonely now and then
Won't you just say I love him?
And want him back again
Won't you just say I love him?
And want him back againEmbed
