Save My Money & Name Lyrics
Hey diddle do, the cat played the fiddle
And the cow jumped over the moon
No kid, I swear that they did
Couldn't get to you too soon
You know I've got to beg you
Save my money and name
Oh, never leave me

Hot n' dog, then you treat me like a hog
Just about to make me swoon
No kid, you know that you did
Still couldn't get to you too soon
You know I've got to beg you
Save my money and name
Oh, never leave me

Ooh rock-a-bye baby, ooh on the tree top
'Cause when the wind blows
The cradle will rock (the cradle will rock)
Ooh rock-a-bye baby, ooh don't ever stop
'Cause when your love goes (when your love goes)
The cradle will drop (the cradle will drop)

Hey diddle do, the cat played the fiddle
And the cow jumped over the moon
No kid, I swear that they did
And still I couldn't get to you too soon
You know I've got to beg you
Save my money and name
Oh, never leave me

Ooh rock-a-bye baby, ooh on the tree top
'Cause when the wind blows (when the wind blows)
The cradle will rock
Ooh rock-a-bye baby, ooh don't ever stop
'Cause when your love goes (when your love goes)
The cradle will dropEmbed
