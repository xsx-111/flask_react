Bless Your Lucky Stars Lyrics
Hey man, your depressions is the lack of love
So bless your lucky stars...
Hey man, the question is:
Is someone's lack of my love such a burden?


Hey man, your depressions is the lack of love
So bless your lucky stars...
Hey man, your depressions is the lack of love
So bless your lucky stars...
Hey man, the question is:
Is someone's lack of my love such a burden?

Bless your lucky stars...
Bless your lucky stars...
Bless your lucky stars...
Bless your lucky stars...Embed
