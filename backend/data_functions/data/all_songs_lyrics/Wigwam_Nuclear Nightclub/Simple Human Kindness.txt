Simple Human Kindness Lyrics
Oh holy Moses and sweet Madonna
Where's that simple human kindness
My story closes and I'm a goner
Where's the truth in all this blindness
Come so far to find there's still so long to go
Ooh, let it all hang down

Do-do-do-do do-do
Let's just have a touch of that brain there
Do-do-do-do do-do
This rat race pace ain't gonna go nowhere

And I'll shout it and I'll scream it
Where's that simple human kindness
Guided missile, jungle warfare
Disabled babies with no mothers

Do-do-do-do do-do
Let's just have a touch of that brain there
Do-do-do-do do-do
This rat race pace ain't gonna go nowhere
Get yer hair cut, get a crew cut, get a suit
Get a white shirt, get a job, be respectable
Get a good shave, get a shoe shine, manicure
Elocution lessons and be acceptable
Be a success, life and soul of the party
Be educated and popular
 so you can kick the sand right back in their faces!
Get yer hair cut, get a crew cut, get a suit
Get a white shirt, get a job, be respectable
Get a good shave, get a shoe shine, manicure
Elocution lessons and be acceptable
Be a success, play guitar, be happy
Like everybody, everybody will like you
Kick the sand right back in their faces!

Oh holy Moses and sweet Madonna
Where's that simple human kindness
My story closes and I'm a goner
Where's the truth in all this blindness

Where's that simple human kindness
Where's that simple human kindness
Where's that simple human kindness
Where's that simple human kindness
Where's that simple human kindness
Won't you tell me mother
Where's that simple human kindness
Tell me brother
Where's that simple human kindness?Embed
