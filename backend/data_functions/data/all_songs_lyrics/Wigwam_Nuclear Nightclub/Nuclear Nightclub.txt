Nuclear Nightclub Lyrics
That day was bright and sunny, seemed to me
With eagles wheeling overhead
And that train was moving on
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead, is what I said
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I was dead
I'd said goodbye to mama, and goodbye to pa
And packed my bags from under the bed
And that train was moving on
I had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead, is what I said
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I was dead

Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead and gone and old, grey
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead and gone, old, grey

Standing at the station holding you
I remember you were dressed in red
And that train was moving on
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I's dead, that's what I said
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I's dead
Get to say don't worry, I'll work it out
Never really knowin' what I'd said
And that train was moving on
Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead and gone
Get to that Nuclear Nightclub 'fore I was dead

Had to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead and gone and old and grey
Got to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead and gone, old and grey
Got to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead and gone, old, grey
Got to get to that Nuclear Nightclub
'Fore I was dead and gone, old and greyEmbed
