Freddie Are You Ready Lyrics
Taking me home to my loved one's side
Home, oh yeah
And do I ever need her, do I ever need her lovin'?
Do I need it, yes indeed

Ooh, I got a problem, think I know what's wrong
I think I picked it up in old Finnsp√•ng
You take a slice or two, it'll make you sigh
Just a second while I kiss the sky
Inhibition, well, you can fly
Out the window to the clear blue sky, it will
Mess your suit, it will make you cry
It doesn't matter, give me mundane pie
None of my friends treat me mean
Hoping you know to change that scene

Freddie are you ready?
Taking me home to my loved one's side
Home, oh yeah
And do I ever need her, do I ever need her lovin'?
Do I need it, yes indeed

Oh, I got a problem and I don't know why
I think I picked it up in old Shanghai
You take a slice or two, it'll make you sigh
Just a minute while I kiss the sky
Inhibitions, well, you can fly
Out the window to the clear blue sky, it will
Mess your suit, it will make you cry
Doesn't matter, give me mundane pie
I know that I treat my friends so mean
Hoping you know to change that scene

Oh, I got a problem and I don't know why
I think I picked it up in old Shanghai
You take a slice or two, it'll make you sigh
Just a second while I slap this guy
Inhibition, well, you can fly
Out the window to the clear blue sky, it will
Mess your suit, it will make you cry
Doesn't matter, give me mundane pie
I know that I treat my friends so mean
Hoping you know to change that scene

Freddie are you ready?
Taking me home to my loved one's side
Home, oh yeah
And do I ever need her, do I ever need her lovin'?
Do I need it, yes indeed
Do I ever need her, do I ever need her lovin'...?Embed
