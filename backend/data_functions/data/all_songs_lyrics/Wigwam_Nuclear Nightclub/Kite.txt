Kite Lyrics
Pine your so lonesome sighs
As murmured questions rise in line
And weave their voices and entwine
As breezes their disguise
(a-ha-hah ah-hah ah-hah)
Willow cast your silent souls
I see them ride on every beam
Spirit from the forest teem
And reassume their roles
(a-ha-hah ah-hah ah-hah)

No wind, no light, no sun in sight
Love hold me tight, I'll fly my kite
No wind, no light, no sun in sight
Love hold me tight, I'll fly my kite


Spiders roam your jeweless nets
Empty void of morning's haul
Where diamonds hung now missing all
With the thief, that sun who sets
(a-ha-hah ah-hah ah-hah)
Willow cast your silent souls
I see them ride on every beam
And spirits from the forest teem
Reassume your roles
(a-ha-hah ah-hah ah-hah)Embed
