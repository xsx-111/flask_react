Do Or Die Lyrics
You know, my love, you know
I can't wait no longer
Ain't no joke, and I tell you no lie
You know my love for you just
Goes from strong to stronger
Just a case of do or die

It's do or die

You know, my love, you know
I can't wait no longer
Ain't no joke, and I tell you no lie
You know my love just goes
From strong to stronger
Just a case of do or die


It's do or die
It's do or die
It's do or die
You know, my love, you know
I can't wait no longer
Ain't no joke, and I tell you no lie
You know my love for you just
Goes from strong to stronger
Just a case of do or dieEmbed
