Full Measure LyricsThe full measure of your giving
You don't yet understand
A cupful of living
That you hold in your hand
The full weight of your loving
Makes me lighter than air
The tax I'm receiving
Now, I know that it never was there
It started off just sticking around
With that wonderful feeling from you
Now, there's finally someone telling me
I can really give, too
I know you know the feeling
That getting something for nothing is wrong
Getting love is so easy
Giving love takes so long
It started off just stickin' around
With that wonderful feeling from you
Now, there's finally someone telling me
I can really give, too
I've heard them saying at Christmas
Now, I can say it to you
The feeling of giving
It's as good as I'm getting from you
It's as good as I'm getting from you
It's as good as I'm getting from you
It's as good as I'm getting from youEmbed
