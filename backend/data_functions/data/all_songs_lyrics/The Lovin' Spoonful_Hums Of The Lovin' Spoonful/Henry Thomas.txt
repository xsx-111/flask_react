Henry Thomas LyricsMy cat dragged it
Through the door one fine morn
On its back ears hung
Forty pounds of feet and tongue
Ooh wee, my dear Henry
Dig the dog the cat dragged in
Ooh wee, my dear Henry
Dig the dog the cat dragged in
Can't fight, won't bite
Has bugs, eats rugs
Smells flowers, sleeps hours
Growing like a dinosaur
Ooh wee, my dear Henry
Dig the dog the cat dragged in
Ooh wee, my dear Henry
Dig the dog the cat dragged in
Ooh wee, my dear Henry
Dig the dog the cat dragged in
Ooh wee, my dear Henry
Dig the dog the cat dragged inEmbed
