Voodoo in My Basement LyricsVoodoo in my basement
You´ll know that it´s true
All my dirty little people
Are gonna have some fun with you
I could smile like diamonds
And be as harmless as a shmoo
I´ll use the voodoo in my basement
If I set my mind on you
If you wanna know, know you wanna ask for one embrace
If I can I´ll drop, drop a can o´gasoline your face
If I rob and steal your presents
I´ll get them back before I go
It looks like holy giving
But it´s the devil in my soul
I got a banshee on my back porch
And she plays with magic pearls
My father was a warlock
And his son eats little girls
Voodoo in my basement
You´ll know that it´s true
All my dirty little people
Are gonna have some fun with youEmbed
