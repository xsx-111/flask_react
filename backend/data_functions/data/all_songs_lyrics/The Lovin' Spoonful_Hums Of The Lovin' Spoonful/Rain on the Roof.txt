Rain on the Roof LyricsYou and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Dryin' while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waitin' out the sun
You and me, we're gabbin' away
Dreamy conversation, sittin' in the hay
Honey, how long was I laughin' in the rain with you?
'Cause I didn't feel a drop 'til the thunder brought us to
You and me underneath a roof of tin
Pretty comfy feelin', how the rain ain't leakin' in
We can sit and dry just as long as it can pour
'Cause the way it makes you look makes me hope it rains some more
You and me and rain on the roof
Caught up in a summer shower
Dryin' while it soaks the flowers
Maybe we'll be caught for hours
Waitin' out the sunEmbed
