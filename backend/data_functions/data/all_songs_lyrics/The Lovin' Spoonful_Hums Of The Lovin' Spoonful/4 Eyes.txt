4 Eyes Lyrics
Four eyes, what you gonna do now?
Four eyes, and how much do you see now?
How many fingers? Ha, ha, ha

When your kids that see through plastic
With a harness of elastic
So the girls all think you're icky
And the boys all think you're queer
Then the hinges all get rusted
And the seventh pair gets busted
So you graduate to tortoise shell
That makes you look severe

Four eyes, what you gonna do now?
Four eyes, and how much do you see now?
How many fingers? Ha, ha, ha

When you're so blind they call you Batman
You can't even see a fat man
You can't dig just where he's at, man
Without windows on your eyes
But the frames ain't your decision
And they're fitted with precision
And they magnify your eyes
Like they're a pair of cherry pies
Four eyes, what you gonna do now?
What you gonna do?
Four eyes, and how much do you see now?
How many fingers? Ha, ha, ha

Here's a word to all you parents
Give a break to little Clarence
When he says the blackboard's fadin'
And the world's a fuzzy place
Mister Up In Middle Classes
Let your baby choose his glasses
And please recall that after all
He wears them on his face

Four eyes, what you gonna do now?
Four eyes, and how much do you see now?
How many fingers? Ha, ha, ha

(Four eyes)
(Four eyes)
(Four eyes)
