Sick Day LyricsCheck out the girl in the Harbor Tunnel
Crawling to work six feet under
And the day has barely begun
They're all chewing gum
And laughing at the voice on the crackling radio station
Lead us not into Penn Station
Cause the best part's just begun
We're all becoming one again
And she's making the scene
With the coffee and cream
And the copy machine's not working
She's a hell of a girl
She's alone in the world
And she likes to say 'hey good lookin'
She's on her way
She's taking a sick day soon
And here is the man pushing paper past her
Thinks up ways to make the day go faster
But the day goes on and on
He dreams of his lawn
And all about the pretty careerist the next cube over
The fat secretary, the lunchtime lover
Til the PATH train finally comes
The platform's full of bums again
And she's making the scene
With the coffee and cream
And the copy machine's not working
She's a hell of a girl
She's alone in the world
And she likes to say 'hey good lookin'
She's on her way
She's taking a sick day soon
And she's taking her time
As she's tossing a dime
At the man in the cardboard coffin
It doesn't have to be fine
She's ahead of the line
And doesn't have to be here too often
She's making a play
She's taking a sick day soonEmbed
