Radiation Vibe Lyrics
Are you alone now?
Did you lose the monkey?
He gave you backaches
And now you slouch
He didn't mean it
Was just a dumb ape
Reading Playboy
On your couch

And now it's time to say what I forgot to say
Baby, baby, baby
C'mon, what's wrong?
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you wanna get some sun?
Shine on, shine on, shine on

I went to Pittsburgh
And joined a pro team
Talk about a bad dream
I broke a knee
But I can still croon
And make the girls swoon
Isn't that the way life's
Supposed to be?
But now it's time to say what I forgot to say
Baby, baby, baby
C'mon, what's wrong?
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you wanna get some sun?
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on

Do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do

And now it's time to say what I forgot to say
Baby, baby, baby
C'mon, what's wrong?
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you wanna get some sun?
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Baby, baby, baby
C'mon, what's wrong?
It's a radiation vibe I'm groovin' on
Don't it make you wanna get some sun?
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine onEmbed
