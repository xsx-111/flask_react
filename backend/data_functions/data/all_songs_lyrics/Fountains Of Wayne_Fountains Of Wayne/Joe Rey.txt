Joe Rey LyricsJoe Rey
Came from Spain
Across the ocean in the frozen rain
And he loves
Point point pointing the finger
Joe Rey
Stoned all day
With two hairdressers in a Chevrolet
For a while
I think Joe Rey's gonna linger
Joe Rey
He's not so pretty
I can't understand why he's so in demand
He stays out late in the city
Sometimes
Sometimes
Joe Rey
Smokes at three
Barks like a pigeon and watches TV
He's cool
Coo coo cooler than I am
He knows
What I don't know
Got seventeen different words for snow
That he signs
Signs to a deaf girl named Diane
Joe Rey
He's not so pretty
I can't understand why he's so in demand
He stays out late in the city
Sometimes
Sometimes
Joe Rey
He's not so pretty
I can't understand why he's so in demand
He stays out late in the city
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes
Joe Rey
Came from Spain
Across the ocean in the frozen rain
And he loves
Point point pointing the finger
Joe Rey loves
Point point pointing the finger
Joe Rey loves
Point point pointing the fingerEmbed
