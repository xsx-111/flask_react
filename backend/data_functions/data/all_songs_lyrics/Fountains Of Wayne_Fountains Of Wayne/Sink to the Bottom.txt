Sink to the Bottom LyricsI wanna sink to the bottom with you
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
The ocean is big and blue
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
Cars on the highway, planes in the air
Everyone else is going somewhere
But I'm going nowhere, getting there soon
I might as well just sink down with you
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
The ocean is big and blue
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
I just wanna
Out on the highway, up in the air
Everyone else is going somewhere
They're going nowhere and I'll be there too
I might as well go under with you
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
I wanna sink to the bottom with you
The ocean is big and blue
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you (sink to the bottom with you)
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you (sink to the bottom with you)
The ocean is big and blue (sink to the bottom with you)
I just wanna sink to the bottom with you (sink to the bottom with you)
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna (aaah aaaah aaaah)
I just wanna (aaah aaaah aaaah)1Embed
