Leave the Biker LyricsSeems the further from town I go
The more I hate this place
He's got leather and big tattoos
Scars all over his face
And I wonder if he ever has cried
'Cause he couldn't get a date for the prom
He's got his arm around every man's dream
Crumbs in his beard from the seafood special
Oh can't you see my world is falling apart
Baby please leave the biker
Leave the biker
Break his heart
Baby please leave the biker
Leave the biker
Break his heart
Now his friend leans over and says
Looks like we've got us a fag
Wonder if that guy's read one word
That wasn't in a porno mag
And I wonder if he ever has cried
'Cause his kitten got run over and died
He's got his arm around every man's dream
And Crumbs in his beard from the seafood special
Oh can't you see my world is falling apart
Baby please leave the biker
Leave the biker
Break his heart
Baby please leave the biker
Leave the biker
Break his heart
And I wonder if he ever has cried
'Cause he couldn't get a date for the prom
He's got his arm around every man's dream
And crumbs in his beard from the seafood special
Oh can't you see my world is falling apart
Baby please leave the biker
Leave the biker
Break his heart
Baby please leave the biker
Leave the biker
Break his heart
Baby please leave the biker
Leave the biker
Break his heartEmbed
