Son of Your Father Lyrics
"I'll catch the tram line in the morning
With your leave", Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed
Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said, "You'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm"
Van Bushell saw a hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said, "Now calm you down, my brother
Let's discuss this man to man"
It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage

You're the son of your father
You try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you

With blood and water, bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
Well, slowly Joseph barely lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell, he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well
He said, "Now, hey, blind man, that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride"
Well, Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said, "Let me just refresh your mind
Your manners, boy, seem hard to find"



Well there's two men lying dead as nails
On an East Virginia farm
For charity's an argument
That only leads to harm
So be careful when they're kind to you
Don't you end up in the dirt
Just remember what I'm saying to you
And you likely won't get hurt
You're the son of your father
Oh, try a little bit harder
You gotta do for me as he would do for you


You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own, yeahEmbed
