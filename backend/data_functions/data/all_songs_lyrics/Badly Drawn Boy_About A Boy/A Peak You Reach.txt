A Peak You Reach LyricsNo sign of life
Pulsing through these ageing veins
I bet at your age
That's easier for you to say
Forcing answers into questions
And worrying that you might stop breathing
On and on we sift
Through alphabets of life
That never get us anywhere anyway
I'd like you to feel we have the best intentions
I want you to know
That I know it's not easy
I want you to know
That I know it's not easy
Easy, easy
Then there's a peak you reach
Out to somebody
That's never even there
Somebody that you may hope
That they might care
From nearby health
Or distant welfare
I'm pleased to hear
That you're warm cos I'm freezing
Yeah, I'm freezing
Cool
I don't wanna be alone
Is that out of the question
I'd like a happy home
Is that too obvious
Quit being pushed around
Stand on my feet
And kick all these losers
Out of my street
I've been losing confidence
In the heat
Just when I'm feeling the strength
I get weak
I've been losing confidence
In the heat
Just when I'm feeling the strength
I get weak
Then there's a peak you reach
Out to somebody
A peak you reach
That's never even there
A peak you reach
I'd like you to feel we've
Reached our peak
A peak you reachEmbed
