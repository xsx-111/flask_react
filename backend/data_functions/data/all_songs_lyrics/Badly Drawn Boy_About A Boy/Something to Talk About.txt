Something to Talk About LyricsI've been dreaming
Of the things I've learnt
About a boy who's bleeding
Celebrate to elevate
The joy is not the same without the pain
Oooh
Ipso facto
Using up your oxygen
You know I'm shallow
Calling out for extra help
You've got to let me in
Or let me out
Oooh something to talk about
Oooh something to talk about
Oooh Oooh Oooh
I've been dreaming
Of the things I learnt
About a boy who's leaving
Nothing else to chance again
You've got to let me in
Or let me out
Oooh something to talk about
Yeah something to talk about
Oooh Oooh OoohEmbed
