Above You, Below Me LyricsDon't wanna give
Don't wanna steal
Don't wanna be anything I'm not
You take answers
I give questions
Like some rolling monologue
Wanna be the one to say
That today could be the day
A pity to believe in what
You know is what you know
I will take you as you are
Please accept me as I am
Find your lonely life design
Know it's above you, I know it's below me
Don't wanna live life in your shoes
I don't feel I know the way
Feeling you, giving me directions I don't need
Up and up and round we go
First it's fast and then we're slow
Could you connect with my intellect
I won't take you as you are
Please don't take me as I am
Find your lonely life bizarre
You'll see this in love
You'll see this in life
For an all year round reception
For a love with no connection
Knowing you, knowing my
Ignorance to more than life
Know it's above you, I know it's below me
I will take you as you are
Please accept me as I am
Find your lonely life bizarre
Know it's above you, I know it's below me
I will take you as you are
Please accept me as i am
There'll be something in the wind
To show us we're right and tell us we're wrong
I want to move onEmbed
