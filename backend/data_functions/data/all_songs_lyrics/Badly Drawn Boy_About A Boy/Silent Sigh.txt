Silent Sigh LyricsCome see what we all talk about
People moving to the moon
Stop baby don't go stop here
Never stop living here
Till it eats the heart from your soul
Keeps down the sound of your
Silent sigh. Silent sigh, silent sigh
Silent, silent silent
Keeps down all move me down
Cos the way we love each other
Come see what we all talk about
People moving to the moon
Stop baby don't go stop here
Never stop living here
Till it eats the heart from your soul
Keeps down the sound of your
Silent sigh, Silent Sigh, Silent Sigh
Silent sigh silent sigh silent sigh
Keeps down all move me down
But don't love each other
No don't love each other
Never gonna be the sound, get it on
See, si
See, si
See, si
Silent sigh
Silent, silent silent silent silent, sigh
Please don't, all, move me down
Silent, silent, silent silent sigh
Silent sigh
Move me down
We're gonna love, each otherEmbed
