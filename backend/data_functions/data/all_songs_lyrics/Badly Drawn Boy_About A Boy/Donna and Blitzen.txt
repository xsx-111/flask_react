Donna and Blitzen Lyrics
Merry Christmas

Pay for the light
But you may still slide
Baby, it's not your sleigh ride
But this year is ours
And maybe tomorrow
We're gonna see
Things we'd never believe
I'll make you want me, you'll see
The initial warning is free
Only to reindeer
Oh what a sight
As they take their first flight
Oh darling, it's all in time

And I will, I will
I will, I will
I will, I will

I will wait their return
Or make to the sky
Oh what a sight beautiful
And I will, I will
I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will sleep tonight
I will sleep tonightEmbed
