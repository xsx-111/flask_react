The Wizard Lyrics
He was the wizard of a thousand kings
And I chanced to meet him one night wandering
He told me tales and he drank my wine
Me and my magic man, kinda feelin' fine

He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire
And as he spoke, I felt a deep desire
To free the world of its fear and pain
And help the people to feel free again

Why don't we listen to the
Voices in our heart?
Cause then I know we'd find
We're not so far apart
Everybody's got to be happy
Everyone should sing
For we know the joy of life
Peace and love can bring

So spoke the wizard
In his mountain home
The vision of his wisdom
Means we'll never be alone
And I will dream of my magic night
And the million silver stars
That guide me with their light
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ahEmbed
