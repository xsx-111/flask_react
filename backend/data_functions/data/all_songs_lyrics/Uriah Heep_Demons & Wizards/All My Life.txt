All My Life Lyrics
I had a little look
For a minute today
And I told her there was something
That I wanted to say
Just sitting there glowing
With her red light on
So I gotta move fast
And it shouldn't take long

Maybe she will? Maybe she won't?
We can get it together if she doesn't say don't
I never ever thought I was looking for a wife
But I think I can love her for the rest of my life, yeah

I only took one
Cause I couldn't take two
I want to make love
And it's gotta be you
Every little thing
That I ever tried to say
Is coming out right
In my own kind of way
Take it, make it, it really feels fine
She must be Lady Luck if she's gonna be mine
I never ever thought I was looking for a wife
But I think I can love her, huh, the rest of my life
Get it

I will love you all my life
I will love you all my life
I will love you all my life
(I will love you all my life)
I will love you all my life
(I will love you all my life)
I will love you all my life
(I will love you all my life)
I will love you all my life
(I, Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I will love you all my life
(I will love you all)Embed
