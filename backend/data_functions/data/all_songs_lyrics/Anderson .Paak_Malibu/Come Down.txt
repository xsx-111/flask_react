Come Down Lyrics
Y'all niggas got me hot, yuh
Uh, niggas, tell me how, yuh, yuh, say

Hey! Well, that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you throwin' shots from afar
I'ma meet you at your front door
Uh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty
Huh, but don't I make it look easy?
Don't I make it look good?

Hey, now you drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm 'posed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gon' have to back it up, hey
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You might not ever come down
Let me get down
You might not ever come down
Naw, let me get down
You might not ever come down
Let me get down!
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

C'mon, uh
Can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it with a big bat though
Can't see her with these pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll

You drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm 'posed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gon' have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You might not ever come down
Naw, naw, naw, let me get down
You might not ever come down
Now let me get down
You might not never come down
Naw, let me get down!
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

Before Vietnam, when boards were long and hair were short, the center of the surfing world was a place called Malibu27Embed
