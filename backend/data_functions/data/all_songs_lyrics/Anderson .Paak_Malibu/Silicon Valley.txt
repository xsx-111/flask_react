Silicon Valley Lyrics
Yeah, all of that ass you carrying, you gotta be shitting me
All that body that you came with
But where are you mentally?
I know ya hear it all the time
But you ain't gon' hear from me
I just wanna focus on them lovelies
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

They say the heart is underneath
Underneath the guarded insecurities
I finally found the key
Underneath the garments, that's the double D's

Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

I don't mind them little bitty berries
You my Ju-Ju-Be
I don't need nothing to distract me
From this connectivity
You know I see it all the time
The same old shit to me
I just wanna know what's under
That tender titty meat
They say the heart is underneath
Underneath the guarded insecurities
I finally found the key (Yes, I did)
Underneath the garments, that's the double D's

Open your heart, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?

Yeah, before you go and pop that bottom, baby
Before you go and get butt naked, baby
I know you got a little bit of baggage, baby
Never mind, I'ma look past it
Big cans in the cooler, let me handle it, baby
Two jugs, I'ma start grasping you, baby
Separation between truth and the fake
You can get a new rack for $5K
You can get a rapper by Friday
You gon' have to replace being cheapskate, just save it
Can a nigga squeeze or should I just be safe?
(Yeah, for sure) Tell me what it reads on the expiration date
(Well, I just got them, should be good for about ten years or so)
I know you feel the D when a nigga deep in the hole
But do you feel the peace when I'm sucking them, baby doll?
(Can you fuck me already?)
Open your heart, baby, X spots the mark, baby
Don't turn around, make an ass out yourself, baby
Open your heart
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?
Open your heart, baby, X spots the mark, baby
What's behind them tig-ol-bitties?
For me, I can't live in the Northern Hemisphere
I must live back, back into time
Where all these animals, all this sea life, all the oysters, shellfish, crustaceans, everything is part of the smell
Everything has come into the focus of the whole experience11Embed
