Water Fall (Interluuube) Lyrics
Yeah, I can't wait for the moment you can take off
I pray you don't have to cut my time short
I would rather not say much
But if I do, it will be forward
I can't pull no punches, baby doll
The gods have approved
The universe is in tune with me and you
That's why we here involved
I'm too in love
What you do this for?
Your body moves in fluid motion
Hands in two and two, I'm open
Who's it for? Ooh, it's yours
I don't know if I'm the one you want to stay with
But I know that I'm the only one who makes you cum

And as soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall
As soon as I break down the wall
I'm riding the wave of your waterfall

Ooh, don't touch me, baby
Don't touch me, baby
Wait, I'm okay, I'm alright
Give me space, don't touch me, baby3Embed
