Parking Lot Lyrics
Well, you told me your whole life story in a few shorts
All the while, I never knew the tone of your voice
A half an hour, I ramble on way too much (My love)
Alone with my own thoughts (My love)
(1, 2, 3, come on–) Enough is enough

There's a plain way to call it, but it's never that obvious for me
I'm in a communion, I got needs
The combination of all my life's complaints and a few strong drinks
I don't remember the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
(Ooh, my love)
And the song we sang
(My love)

1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on–
(Remember the song–)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
Come on, you feel me (The parking lot)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
1, 2, 3, come on–
Bring the corners from left to right
How many more will it take to get a crossfade?
Coming closer to midnight and I'm wide awake
And ain't you afraid? Was afraid
Couldn't wait to get you naked on the first date
But you made me wait
So it takes one to make one
The compromise we made
Please believe me, I don't recall the parking lot
I just remember the song we sang
And the song we sang
And the song we s–

1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on–

(Ooh, my love)
Come on, you feel me
(My love)
Come on–
(Remember the parking lot)
Come on, you feel me (My love)
Come on, you feel me
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
1, 2, 3, come on–
Come on, you feel me (My love)
Come on, you feel me (The song we sang)
1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me (My love)
1, 2, 3, come on–

1, 2, 3, come on, you feel me
Come on, you f–
1, 2, 3–
Feel me
(Have mercy, baby!
Can you dig it? Can you dig it?)8Embed
