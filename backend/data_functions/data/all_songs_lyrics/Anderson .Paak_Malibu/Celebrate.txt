Celebrate Lyrics
Time never cares, if you're there or not there
All you ever needed was a simple plan
But you're doing well, I mean, you're not dead
So let's celebrate while we still can

I know what they say, I could give or care
They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right
I saw my son today, in the likeness of a full grown man
So I'll celebrate while I still can

Ooh, on a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the motherfucking house
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixing up the tree that farms move
I've came too far

How many others have walked the same ground you have?
You'll be wise to pay attention to your old head
I spent the whole day throwin' records in the deep end
So let's celebrate while we still can
Captivated, the fruits of my family tree
Where would I be without you?
What would you do without me?
It'd be a bad look talkin' 'bout what could've been
So let's celebrate while we still can

Ooh, on a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown
I remember where I couldn't see the point
But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I came to fixin' up the tree that farms move
I've came too far


Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand
What's mine is yours
Thought you knew me better than that
I was under the impression that we all want the best of life
So let's celebrate while we still can

The partnership of the, of the board and the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers
In the fluent directions with the, with this wave is what interests me
Now chaotic surfing, nervous surfing, and uh, uh, surfing power has its, has its merits
And I, uh, I canâ€”it fascinates me. That's just not my direction
I, I can only speak for myself9Embed
