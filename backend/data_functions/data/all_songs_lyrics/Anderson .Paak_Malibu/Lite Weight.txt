Lite Weight Lyrics
(A little surfer music, baby
A blast from your golden past)

You know I see you from afar, right?
Hey, it's alright
Listen, I would've 

There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it

There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight
(You know I see you from afar, right?)
You know I really can't fuss about it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't funk without it
You know I really can't fuss about it

(Thought you might've wanted to say somethin'
So I was comin' up to you
It's cool if I come up to you, right?
)

There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be like that
You don't need me in that light
It's alright with me
Just send it off, and I'll give it right back
Right down to the last phase
There's no reason to be afraid
No time to be lite weight

"Hey, you got a light?"
"Oh, yes, here you are"
"Thanks, you want a toke?"
"No, no thanks"
"This stuff is getting harder to get"
"Johnny"
"Yeah?"6Embed
