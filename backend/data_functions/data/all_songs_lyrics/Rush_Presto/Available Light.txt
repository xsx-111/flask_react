Available Light Lyrics
The restless wind
Has seen all things
In every kind of light
Rising with the full moon
To go howling through the night
The sleepless wind
Has heard all things
Between the sea and sky
In the canyons of the city
You can hear the buildings cry
x2
Oh the wind can carry
All the voices of the sea
Oh the wind can carry
All the echoes home to me

Run with wind and weather
To the music of the sea
All four winds together
Can't bring the world to me
Chase the wind around the world
I want to look at life
In the available light
Play of light
A photograph
The way I used to be
Some half forgotten stranger
Doesn't mean that much to me
Trick of light
Moving picture
Moments caught in flight
Make the shadows darker
Or the colors shine too bright

Oh the light can carry
All the visions of the sea
Oh the light can carry
All the images to me

Run to light from shadow
Sun gives me no rest
Promise offered in the east
Broken in the west
Chase the sun around the world
I want to look at life
In the available light
Oh the wind can carry
All the voices of the sea
Oh the wind can carry
All the echoes home to me

All four winds together
Can't bring the world to me
Shadows hide the play of light
So much I want to see
Chase the light around the world
I want to look at life
In the available light

I'll go with the wind
Oh the wind can carry
(In the available light)
I'll stand in the light
Oh the wind can carry
(In the available light)
I'll go with the wind
Oh the wind can carry
(In the available light)
I'll stand in the light
Oh the wind can carry
(In the available light)
I'll go with the wind...Embed
