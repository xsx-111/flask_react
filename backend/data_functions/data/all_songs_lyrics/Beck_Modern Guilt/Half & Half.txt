Half & Half Lyrics
Half of you doesn't belong here
Half of you feels home
Half of you needs somebody
Half of you wants to be alone

How can I know which one
I'm going to need when I get back home

Half of you doesn't know nothing
And half knows too much
Half of you is reaching for something
The other half can't touch

How can I know which one
I'm supposed to try to love

Half of you feels like it's dying
Half that's just been born
Half of you is tearing out roses
And half is full of thorns
How can I know which one
I'm supposed to try to ignoreEmbed
