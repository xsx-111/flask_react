Chemtrails Lyrics
I can't believe what we've seen outside
You and me watching the jets go by

Down by the sea
So many people falling in time
You and me watching the sea full of people
Try not to drown
So many people
So many people
Where do they go?
You and me watching the sky
For the chemtrails
That's where we belong

All I can take from these skies is fog
And all I can see in this light: a boat sinking

Down by the sea
Swallowed by evil
Already drowned
You and me watching the sea full of people
Already drowned
So many people
So many people
Where do they go?
You and me hit by a cloud
Like an eagle
Watching the jet planes go by
You and me watching
You and me watching
Chemtrails is where we belong
That's what I mean when we talk in this jetstream
We're climbing a hole in the sky5Embed
