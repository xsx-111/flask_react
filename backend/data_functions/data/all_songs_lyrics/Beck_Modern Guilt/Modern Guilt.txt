Modern Guilt Lyrics
I feel uptight when I walk in the city
I feel so cold when I'm at home
Feels like everything's starting to hit me
I lost my bearings ten minutes ago

Modern guilt, I'm stranded with nothing
Modern guilt, I'm under lock and key
Misapprehension
Turning into convention
Don't know what I've done but I feel ashamed

Standing outside the glass on the sidewalk
These people talk about impossible things
And I'm falling out of the conversation
And I'm a pawn piece in a human shield

Modern guilt is all in our hands
Modern guilt won't get me to bed
Say what you will
Smoke your last cigarette
Don't know what I've done but I feel afraid1Embed
