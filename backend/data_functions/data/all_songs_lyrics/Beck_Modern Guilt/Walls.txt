Walls Lyrics
Some days we get a thrill in our brains
Some days it turns into malaise
You see your face in the veneer
Reflected on the surface of fear
Because you know we're better than that
But some days we're worse than you can imagine
And how am I supposed to live with that
With all these train wrecks coming at random

Hey what are you going to do
When those walls are falling down
Falling down on you

You got warheads stacked in the kitchen
You treat distraction like it's a religion
With a rattlesnake step in your rhythm
We do the best with the souls we've been given
Because you know we're nothing special to them
We're going some place they've already been
Trying to make sense of what they call wisdom
And this riffraff ain't laughing with them

Youâ€™re wearing all of the years on your face
You have a tombstone you mourn in the place
And your heart only speaks in a murmur
But your words ringin' out just like murder2Embed
