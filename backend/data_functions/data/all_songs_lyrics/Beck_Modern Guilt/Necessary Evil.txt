Necessary Evil Lyrics
Think I'm brain dead waiting the rain out
In this makeshift mountain home
With my arms crossed, my bare bones
Making the most of meager means

Necessary evil one more time
Necessary evil
Starting to wonder what happens now?
What happens now?

If you're stranded out on a warpath
There's no scapegoat for to ride you home
When you're drifting over the landmines
You keep drifting 'til kingdom-come

Necessary evil, starting to wonder
Necessary evil
Starting to wonder what happens now?
What happens now?

What happens now?Embed
