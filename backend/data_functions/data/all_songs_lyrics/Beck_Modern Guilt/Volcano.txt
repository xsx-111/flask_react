Volcano LyricsI've been walking on these feet so long
I don't know
Where they're gonna lead anymore
But I think I must have seen a ghost
I don't know
If it's my illusions that keep me alive
I don't know what I see
Was it all an illusion?
Or a mirage gone bad?
Oh I'm tired of evil
And all the things that I don't know
And I've been drifting on this wave so long
I don't know
If it's already crashed on the shore
And I've been riding on this train so long
I can't tell
If it's you or me who is driving us into the ground
I don't know if I'm sane
But there's a ghost in my heart
That's trying to see in the dark, oh
I'm tired of people
Who only want to be pleased
But I still want to please you
And I heard of that Japanese girl
Who jumped into the volcano
Was she trying to make it back
Back into the womb of the world?
I've been drinking all these tears so long
All I've got left
Is the taste of salt in my mouth
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I'm going
To that volcano, oh
I don't want to fall in though
Just want to warm my bones on that fire a while2Embed
