Soul of a Man Lyrics
Beat my bones against the wall
Staring down an empty hall
Deep down in a hollow log
Coming home like a letter bomb

Cold was the storm
That covered the night

Call a doctor, call a ghost
Put a fire into your bones
Sic a dog on all you know
Cut it loose before you go


What makes the soul, the soul of a man?

Beat my bones against the wall
Put a fire and throw in your bond
Gris Gris and a goldenrod
Down deep in a hollow log
Cold was the storm
That burned the night
