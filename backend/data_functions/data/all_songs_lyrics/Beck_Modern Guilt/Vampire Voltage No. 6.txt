Vampire Voltage No. 6 Lyrics
I don't know what I want, but I know
All the fear is creeping under my bones
And I know that it's time I go
But it's time that's got its teeth in me
And I want you to fix your eyes
On something that could be beautiful
If you could teach me to lose my soul
It's just one percent of what I know
La la la la la

Vampire voltage in my soul
Vampire voltage rolling, rolling, rollingEmbed
