High On Sunday 51 Lyrics
A monkey knows how you'll react
Creating want by holding back
Some reverse pyromaniac
Let me try, baby, try

I propped my window up and then
I turned my back to lure you in
To rifle through what I might've been
Let me try, baby, try

Baby please, let me begin
Let me be your heroin
Hate the sinner but love the sin
Let me be your heroin

We have crossed the rubicon
The ship awash, our rudder gone
The rats have fled but I'm hanging on
Let me try, baby, try

Baby please, let me begin
Let me be your heroin
Hate the sinner but love the sin
Let me be your heroin
Baby please, let me begin
Let me be your heroin
Hate the sinner but love the sin
Let me be your heroinEmbed
