The Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye LyricsChurchillian legs
Hair barely there
The harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
Because of the strain
Of smiling
The harsh truth of the camera eye
Telling you all
That you never wanted to know
Showing what
You didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
Zooms into
"the inner you"
And it tells the harsh truth
And nothing but
Laugh with us all here
That's if you can
Then take the pictures home
And scream
Telling you all
That you never wanted to know
Showing you what
You didn't want shown
This photographer
He must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
To be judged anymore
I don't want to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
Just blindly loved..."Embed
