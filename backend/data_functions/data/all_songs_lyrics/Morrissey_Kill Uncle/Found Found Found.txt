Found Found Found Lyrics
Found found found
Found found found
Someone who's worth it
In this murkiness
Someone who's never
Seeming scheming
Found found found
Found found found
Someone who's worth it
In this murkiness
Someone who's never
Seeming scheming

Oh, but they were never found
Oh, but they were never found
Oh, but they were never found

I do believe that
The more you give your love
And I do believe that
The more you offer trust
The more you chase
The more you cry
The more you're bound to lose
The more you're bound to lose
Oh, but they were never found
Oh, but they were never found
Somebody
Who wants to be
Who wants to be
With me
All the time1Embed
