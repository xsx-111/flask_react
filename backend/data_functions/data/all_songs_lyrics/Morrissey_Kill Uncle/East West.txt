East West LyricsEast west, over the ocean
Perpetual motion, traveling around
No rest singing and playing
Night out and day in doing the rounds
What a great life this must seem
Swelled joints, every thing classy
Nothing is tacky, only the best
Lush girls, older and dying
Sighing and crying, 'This is success'
What a great life this must seem
But when I hear your voice singing out
The bells of home are ringing out
And I feel all alone
(And I think of my home)
Cold times a wind through the houses
The bleakness arouses a longing to leave
Time flew, I wanted to see you
Somehow I could not do because of success
What a strange life this can be
But when I hear your voice singing out
The bells of home are ringing out
And I feel all alone
(And I think of my home)Embed
