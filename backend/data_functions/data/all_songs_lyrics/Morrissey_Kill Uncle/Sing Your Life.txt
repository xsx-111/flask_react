Sing Your Life LyricsSing your life
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
Many others do
Why don't you?
Do you want to?
Sing your life
Walk right up to the microphone
And name
All the things you love
All the things that you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
Oh sing your life
La la la la
Sing your life
Others sang your life
But now's your chance to shine
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
Have the pleasure of meaning what you sing
Oh make no mistake my friend
All of this will end
So sing it now
All the things you love
All the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your
Oh sing your
La la la la
Sing your life
Don't leave it all unsaid
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
And make no mistake, my friend
Your pointless life will end
But before you go
Can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
A lovely singing voice
And all of those
Who sing on key
They stole the notion
From you and me
So sing your life
Sing your life: (R.I.P cancelled show of DAYBREAK)Embed
