Ascension LyricsIn the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
And the earth was without form, and void;
And darkness was upon the face of the deep
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
And God said
Let there be light
And there was light
And God saw the light
That it was good...
(Extract spoken by Lunar Module Pilot Wiiliam Anders, from the Apollo 8 crew live television broadcast, made when the first manned mission to the moon entered lunar orbit on Christmas Eve, December 24th, 1968)Embed
