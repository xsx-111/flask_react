Special People Lyrics
I've been tryin' for a long time
To understand everything and everyone
So when I look in your eyes
Your weary troubled eyes
That part of you I see is me
Why can't you stop them from cryin'?
I know what you're goin' through, yes I do
That's why I'm gonna be here when you need me
That's why I'm gonna give you all the love I have

'Cause you're one of those special people
Yes you are

I'm gonna keep your here, here, here here
If I can

I've been thinkin' about a lot of things
Things that don't really mean a thing at all
But when I think about you
Torn and tortued you
You look so free, they can't see you chained
By all your knownings
You find yourself so hard to live with sometimes
That's why I'm gonna be here when you need me
That's why I'm gonna give you all the love I have
'Cause you're one of those special people
Yes you are
I'm gonna keep your here, here, here here
Mm, if I can

'Cause you're one of those special people
Yes you are

I'm gonna keep your here, here, here here
Mm, if I can

Special, people
Special people, special people
Special people, special people
Special people, special people
Special people, special peopleEmbed
