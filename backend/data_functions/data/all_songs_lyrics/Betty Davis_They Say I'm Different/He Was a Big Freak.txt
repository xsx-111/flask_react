He Was a Big Freak Lyrics
He was a big freak!
I used to beat him with a turquoise chain, yeah

When I was his woman, I pleased him
I’d lead him to the tip
When I was his mistress, oh, oh
I gave him cheap thrills
When I was his princess, silk and satin and lace
I'd wear for him

He was a big freak!
Flim, flam, floozy, fantasy

When I was his housewife
I’d scrub him, I’d love him, I’d cook his meals
When I was his geisha, oh oh
I got down and hips
When I was his flower
I’d answer to the name of Rosie May

He was a big freak!
I used to say all kinds of dirty thangs
When I was his mother
I’d hold him like a baby in my arms
When I was his lover
Oh, I drive him out of his mind
When I was his daydream
Ain’t no need to tell you what that means
I’d tie him up with my turquoise chain

I used to tie him up
Yeah, he couldn’t get enough
Nah, he’d be on the floor
Oh, begging me for more

He was a big freak!
I used to say all kinds of dirty thangs
He was a big freak!
Film, flam, floozy, fantasy
He was a big freak!
Kept his mind entertained all the time
I’d get him off with my turquoise chain

I used to whip him
I used to beat him
Oh, he used to dig it
Yeah, he used to really dig it
He was a big freak!
Pain was his middle name
He was a big freak!
He used to laugh when I’d make him cry
He was big freak!
A big freak, yes he was!
I used to whip him with my turquoise chain1Embed
