Git in There Lyrics
Music man, wherever when
Grab your ass, don't you stop playin’
Get funky, like a skunk, do you hear what Betty's sayin'?
Play anything that you wanna
Long as you get down, down, down, down, down
Get in there!

(Dance dance dance, all night long) Ah yeah
(Dance dance dance, have a good time) We ’gon do it now
(Dance dance dance, all night long) Go on and do it drummer
(Dance dance dance, time)
Go on Ted, go on, beat those drum!
Get in there!
Ah shit, let's give Cordell some, on that wah-wah pedal now!
(Clap, clap your hands to the rhythm
Clap, clap your hands, ain't it good to you
Clap, clap your hands to the rhythm) Ok Herschel, come on
(Clap, clap your hands, good)
Now move your feet, in time with that beat
Just do your thing, do you know what I mean?
(Go for yourself) Get in there!
I said play that bass, funky Larry!
Go on and play it, Lar

Get right in there, don't nickel bag it) Get down!

Get right in there, and) Get in there!

Fit it, fit it, fit it, ain't it good to you
