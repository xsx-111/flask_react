Shoo-B-Doop And Cop Him Lyrics
Gals, he’s a fine, fine thang
(Ain’t he fine?)
Lord knows, he sure is fine
(Ain’t he fine?)
Gals, I can’t help myself
(She’s gonna do it)
(She’s gonna do it)

I'm going to do it 'til the cows come home
And when my goose gets loose
She's gonna know
I'm still be getting it on
With him around, now
(Move it, move it)
I’m gonna move it slow like a mule
(Go on and move it, gal)
I’m gonna love him funky free and foolish
I’m gonna do my best
And try hard to get him

(Ain’t he fine?)
Just take a look at that child
(Ain’t he fine?)
He’s enough to drive a poor gal wild
(Ain’t he fine?)
Take him in, check him out
I’m gonna!
(She’s gonna love him)
(She’s gonna love him)
I’m gonna shoo-b-doop all night
(Go on and love him, gal
Go on and love him, gal)
I’m gonna try him out until the sunrise
And when clock strikes twelve
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)

(Ain’t he fine?)
Gals, he’s a fine, fine thang
(Ain’t he fine?)
Lord knows, he sure is fine
(Ain’t he fine?)
Gals, I can’t help myself
(She’s gonna do it)
(She’s gonna do it)
(She’s gonna do it)
(She’s gonna do it)

Yes, I’m gonna do it
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
I’m gonna do it 'til the cows come home
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
I’m gonna do it 'til the chicken croaks
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
I’m gonna move it slow like a mule
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
I’m gonna do it yes I’m gonna do it
(Do it, do it!)
(Move it, move it!)
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
(Shoo-b-doop and cop him)
Gals, he’s a fine fine thang
Lord knows, Lord knows
That boy he’s sure enough fineEmbed
