70's Blues Lyrics
I woke up this morning, I was feelin' so bad
I didn't know what was wrong
I had a pain in my head
My mind was so troubled from what I did not know
I took a look at my face in the mirror
And lo and behold, the blues was there
I said the blues was there

I felt like cryin', but the tears would not cry
I felt like talkin' to someone
But no one was there
I started to thinkin'
And the more I thought, the more I dropped
I just kept right on sinkin'
'Cause I could not stop it
The blues had taken over
I said the blues had taken over

I woke up this morning
I shouldn't have never went to sleep
I wish I had-a kept on dreamin'
'Cause reality, it ain't easy
I was dreamin' my life had change
I was dreamin' 'bout peace and mind
And when I started dreamin' 'bout men
You owe, mm, that's when I woke up tired
Tired of the blues, I'm so tired of the blues
The blues are takin' over, I've lost control
The blues are takin' over
And they're runnin' my soul
Every day I've got the blues
Every night, night-night
Night-night-night, I got the blues
Those livin', lovin', tryin' to make it
Oh seven nation can't find their blues
And I got 'em bad
Go on an' play now, go on an' play
The blues have taken over
And I've lost control
The blues have taken over
And they're runnin' my soul
Every day I've got the blues
Every night, night-night
Night-night-night, I got the blues
Those livin', lovin', tryin' to make it
Oh seven nation can't find their blues
And I got 'em bad, I got 'em bad
I got 'em bad
The blues have taken over
The blues are runnin' my soul
The blues have taken over
And I have lost controlEmbed
