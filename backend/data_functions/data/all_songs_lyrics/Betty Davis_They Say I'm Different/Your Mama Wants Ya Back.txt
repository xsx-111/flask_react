Your Mama Wants Ya Back Lyrics
Can ya' hear your mama calling?
Your mama wants ya' back
Can ya' hear your mama crying?
You're the best thing she ever had
What I say?

Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama wants ya'
(Oh, I want ya', baby, I want ya'!)

Can ya' hear your mama singing?
She's singing about her man
Can ya' hear your mama pleadin'?
I'm tryna do the best I can (Without cha)

Your mama needs ya' back
Your mama needs her daddy...
(Oh I need ya', daddy, I need ya'!)

Can ya' hear your mama callin'?
She's calling you on the phone
Can ya' hear your mama cryin'?
A girl just said you weren't home (After dinner)
Your mama's hurtin' bad
Your mama wants her papa
(Aw papa, I want ya', I want ya', I want ya' so bad)

Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama wants ya'
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama loves ya'
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama can't live without cha
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama, well, I need ya'
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama can't do without cha
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama, well, I need ya'
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama can't live without cha
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama, yeah, she loves ya', she loves ya'
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama wants ya'
Your mama wants ya' back
Your mama loves ya'
Your mama wants ya' backEmbed
