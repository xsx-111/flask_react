Dream in Blue LyricsI peaked inside of the open door
Looked around - don't know what for
Way too bright - could hardly see
Oh no - can't believe it
Oh yeah - could almost see it
In a dream in blue
I flew around with shiny things
And when I spoke, I seemed to sing
High above - floating far away
Oh no - can't believe it
Oh yeah - could almost see it
In a dream in blue
In a dream in blue
Sock it to me one time
Woke up laughing in my bed
A silly smile stuck on my head
Am I real or still in a dream
Oh no - can't believe it
Oh yeah - could almost see it
Oh no - can't believe it
Oh yeah - could almost feel it
In a dream in blue
In a dream in blueEmbed
