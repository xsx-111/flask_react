Two Janes LyricsTwo Janes running along the tracks
Saying "We don't want to live this way
Ain't never coming back"
Jane number one looked as happy as can be
Jane number two knew what could set them free
Too many nights hiding under beds
Too many fears to fill their pretty heads
Everyboy knows they must have been insane
So goes the tale of two Janes
Tears falling down behind the bedroom door
"No matter how I try, I just don't know what for
Too many times, I'm banging into walls
Too many times, I cry but no one ever calls"
Everyboy knows they must have been insane
So goes the tale of two Janes
Jane number one is standing at the gate
Jane number two has the key that holds their fate
Too many angels with brand new silken wings
Too many cries for love but no one hears a thing
Everyboy knows they must have been insane
So goes the tale of two Janes
Everyboy knows they must have been insane
So goes the tale of two JanesEmbed
