When the Circus Comes LyricsCould have had a chance to get out of this wreck
The time that you came and the day that you left
Could have had a chance
Could have had a chance
Never thought I could make it this far
With a dent in my soul and a hole in my heart
Never thought I could
Never thought I could
But when the lights are turning 'round
And wheels are rolling on the ground
That day I'll burn this whole place down
When the circus comes to town
You left your name carved on a tree
You scratched mine out right in front of me
Didn't mean that much
Didn't mean that much
But when the lights are turning 'round
And wheels are rolling on the ground
That day I'll burn this whole place down
When the circus comes to town
I'll scratch your name out on that tree
I'll chase your heart right out of me
Doesn't mean that much
Doesn't mean that much
But when the lights are turning 'round
And wheels are rolling on the ground
That day I'll burn this whole place down
When the circus comes to townEmbed
