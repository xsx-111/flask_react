Every Now And Then LyricsDarling, why did I agree to ever let you go?
And why did I promise I'd never try to see you no more?
I thought I could find someone to take your place
Instead I find memories of you so hard to erase
'Cause every now and then
Someone speaks your name
Every now and then
I feel the flame
Same old burning
Burning deep within
To a dream I'm holding on
And all the time I know you're gone
Some times I sit alone and stare into the night
And in my mind I see myself holding you tight
Seems the love I feel is stronger than my will
Trapped in a world of despair
I close my eyes and pretend you're there
'Cause every now and then
I hear your voice calling
Every now and then
Girl, my tears start falling
Darling, beyond my control
I miss the mess of your touch
I miss the love I need so much
Every now and then
Every now and then
I keep remembering
Won't you come back baby
It's so hard living without you
Why don't you come back, baby
I miss everything about you
Why don't you come back
My whole world is crumbling
Why don't you come back
Every step I take without you, I'm stumbling
'Cause every now and then
I feel the hurt inside
Every now and then
I get you on my mind
Of fools of thinking I get over you
And every street I'm coming down
I see you all around
'Cause every now and then
Every now and then
I feel the flame burning
I feel my heart yarning
Every now and then
Oh I miss your touch
Every now and thenEmbed
