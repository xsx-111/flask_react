Tear It on Down LyricsMy...
Oh baby
Listen
Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
'Cause when you think only of yourself
You can't love anyone else
And I need you desperately
But with your head in the clouds you can't see me
So tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
In order to live life
In order to work
You must first come down to Earth
And I want you to give in
'Cause my love is so strong, it can win
So tear it all down
Tear it all down
Let it crumble to the ground
It's just a masquerade
So why don't you let it stay
How can I show what I need
When you got your pride standing in between
Tear it all down, your mountain of pride
'Cause it will strip away one day
But my love is here to stay
We can make it, of that I am sure
But you just got to give a little more
So tear it all down
Tear it all down
Let it crumble to the groundEmbed
