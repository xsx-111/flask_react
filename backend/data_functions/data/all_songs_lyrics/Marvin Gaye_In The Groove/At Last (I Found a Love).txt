At Last (I Found a Love) Lyrics
At last, at last
I found a love for me
At last, at last
I found a love for me

Into my life she came, people
A life full of misery
Bringing with her the sunshine
To warm the very soul of me
[Chorus
At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Do you believe me? At last
Oh, I found a love for me
(One more thing)

I knew right away
As soon as our eyes first met
That her heart and mine would soon entwine
Into a love no one would ever forget

Ah, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
At last, huh, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, yeah
Whoo
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is mine
Listen
She's sweet, so sweet
Lord, she's the apple of my eye
Her lips, yeah, look like two rubies
And she stands about so high
When she kisses me I'm feeling thunder
Oh yeah, yeah
I found a love for me
Oh, everybody needs someone to love
I'm so glad that I found mine
There's someone somewhere for everyone
And it's only a matter of time
Before you say it

At last
Ooh, I found a love for me
Baby, at last, ah
I found a love for meEmbed
