You Lyrics
Ooh, you, you I see
In my mirror in the morning, 'stead of seeing me
I see you, I see your face
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace

In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see, so we never speak
'Til the dark of night, while the moon is new
When we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous

Though it's wrong, I know
Girl, I love you so
Yes, I need you (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a hard-working boy
Oh, you've given your love to me (You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet worlds apart
So we must hide the love we're feeling in our hearts
We meet in shadows (We meet in shadows)
Your friends must never know (Your friends must never know)
That we are lovers, darling (That we are lovers)
Although it hurts me so (Although it hurts me so)

For your sake no one must see
The precious love you're giving me
But you know (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

(You, you, you, you, you, you)
(You, you, you, you, you, you)

Oh, one day I'll make the grade, my lucky star will shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
'Til then we must go on ('Til then we must go on)
The way we have before (The way we have before)
And never let it show (And never let it show)
We love each other so (We love each other so)
Our love's a one-way track
And there's no turning back
Oh (You know, you know, you know)
I need you, baby (I need you, babe)

You (You, you, you)
You I see (You, you, you)
Oh, in my mirror in the morning (You, you, you)
'Stead of seeing me (You, you, you)
I see you (You, you, you)
Seeing your face (You, you, you)Embed
