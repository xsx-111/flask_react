Chained Lyrics
Seems just yesterday you were in my arms
And in a special way you touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone
Oh and I find myself, honey, I'm all alone
And there's no love left to take
Don't know where I fell, for you I've always cared
I did all I know
To win your love and make it so

You'd always stay but you turned away
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you
How could you do me this way?

Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; oh your love's my only direction
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah

I've got to make it right, somehow it's always wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I've lost I've got to find, yeah
But it won't be long
I'm going to make it right, baby
And carry you tenderly back home
Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; every time I hear your name I tremble
I tremble, oh you know, oh you know

Oh baby, oh baby
Well, now I admit that I
Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you
But my heart and soul cries, How do you?
Oh, that's all I need
Oh, going to make it right, baby
If you just stay, stay with me
Because I'm chained
Oh I'm chained to your love and affection
Yes I'm chainedEmbed
