There Goes My Baby Lyrics
There goes my baby, moving on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where, wonder where she is bound?
I broke her heart and I made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do, what can I do?

(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh
(There she goes) Yeah! (There she goes)

I want to know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing me for a fool?

I wanna know why she left me
Why did she leave me so all alone?
So all alone
Hey, oh

I wanna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side, to be my guide

I want to know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Where is my baby (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)?
I want my baby
I need my baby

Yeah, whoa-oh-oh
(There goes my baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh1Embed
