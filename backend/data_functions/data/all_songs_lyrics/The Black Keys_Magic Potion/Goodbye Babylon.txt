Goodbye Babylon Lyrics
Well I came to see
And what I found was not alright with me
Desperation, suffocation
And it'd been the same thing all along

Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon

Now I know times are changing
And the people need rearranging
So now it's written here in song

Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon

Now our boys they're falling
Our leaders are all appalling
And you can bet by God
Good will is gone
Goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon
Oh, goodbye Babylon
Goodbye Babylon, heyEmbed
