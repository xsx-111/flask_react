Your Touch Lyrics
And I want
And you got it
So much
I'm crazy for

Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch

And I'll be good
Like I should
Waiting is such
Misery, I need

Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch

A little louder now
I've got to shout it now
Please rush
I need
Your touch
Your touch
Your touch
