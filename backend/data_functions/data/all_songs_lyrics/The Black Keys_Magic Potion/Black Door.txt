Black Door Lyrics
What's behind your black door?
I want to know, I want to know, yeah
May take a week, honey, it may take more
I want to know, I want to know

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Got to doubt your condition
I want to know, I want to know
It would end my suspicion, yeah
I want to know, I want to know

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

When I see it start to open
Can't you hear me begging please?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahEmbed
