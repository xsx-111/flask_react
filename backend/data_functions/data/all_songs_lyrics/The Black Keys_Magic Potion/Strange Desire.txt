Strange Desire Lyrics
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh

I don't want to go to hell
But if I do it'll be 'cause of you
And a young man's going to make mistakes
'Til he hits the brakes

My heart's on fire
With a strange desire

Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh~oh oh-oh
Oh~ooh~oh, oh-oh

All those birds on the wire
Are going to say I'm a liar
But we all know in the end
They never were my friend
My heart's on fire
With a strange desire1Embed
