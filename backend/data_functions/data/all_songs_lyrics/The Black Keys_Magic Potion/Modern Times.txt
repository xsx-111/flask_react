Modern Times Lyrics
They're going to get to it tomorrow
But they don't care at all
They're going to ease your pain and sorrow
But we heard the same before
All my loving friends taking nothing home
And I can't be the one to lay troubles on
All their homes are broken
And what are they going to do?
There's no magic potion
Their lying days are through
Love and lust go hand-in-hand
Everything turn to dust in our promised land

Take the well-dressed man
And watch him pass you by
Work your life away
Make me want to cry
In these modern times
Oh oh oh

I'm going to scream it on a mountain
To every valley wide
It's all your money they're counting
And to your face they lie
Put on your work boots, mama and your morning gown
Twelve men dead today they're already in the ground
See the well-dressed man
Watch him pass you by
Work your life away
Make me want to cry
In these modern times
In these modern times
In these modern times
