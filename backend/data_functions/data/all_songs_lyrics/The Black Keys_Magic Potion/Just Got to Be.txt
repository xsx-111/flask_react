Just Got to Be Lyrics
When it come to pride
And other sinful matters
You're gonna be mislead
Left there in tatters

I got to go because
Something on my mind
And it won't get better
No matter how hard I try

Whoa
Yeah
You just got to be
The best thing for me

Evil hides
In dark places
But now I find it
In familiar faces

I got to go because
Something on my mind
And it won't get better
No matter how hard I try
Whoa
Yeah
You just got to be
The best thing for meEmbed
