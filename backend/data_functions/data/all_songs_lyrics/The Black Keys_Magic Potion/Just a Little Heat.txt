Just a Little Heat Lyrics
Just a little heat
Now on this cold day
You know it would take my
Worry away, worry away

It's in my head
I can't let go
No matter what you said
'Cause I already know
Leaving this place
'Cause you, you've got it written
All over your face

Oh oh

Why can't trouble
Find a new friend?
'Cause this can't be the way
The story ends
Oh, no

It's in my head now
I can't let go
No matter what you said
'Cause I already know
Leaving this place
'Cause you, you've got it written
All over your face
Oh oh
Oh oh ohEmbed
