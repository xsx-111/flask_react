Velvet Cave LyricsSail over distant waters
Till you reach the honeyed shore
Walk on through purple flowers
Breathe the golden fragrance
You have reached the final island
Where dreams light up the daytime
You are at the end of journey
All is peace
All is peace
Wine trickles down from mountains
Crimson streamers floating
Sweet meats hang from bushes
And ripely cry for plucking
Maidens gather flowers
And feed you with soft fingers
Hours are a song that never ends
Hours are a song that never ends
You can see love waiting inside the velvet cave
She calls you from the meadow
Her eyes are brightly shining
Her breasts are fruits she offers
So you leave the fields behind you
To follow promises she will fulfill
She will fulfill
In the cave there's no tomorrow
Nor any yesterday
Just the hammer of her heartbeat
As she draws you down beside her
And you sink down on the pillow of her body hotly loving
And you pray you'll never waken to the day
And you pray you'll never waken to the day
Never
Never
NeverEmbed
