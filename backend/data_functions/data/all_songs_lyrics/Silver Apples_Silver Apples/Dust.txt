Dust LyricsDust, this day is hash...
A broken bottle's inside
Strewn with rinds of love
And shattered shells of soul
Dust of other days
Crumpled hours of devotion
Washed down gutter streams
To sink within the tide
Dust of love squeezed dry
Hateful fingers strangled joy
Self-made love as bare as bone
Dropped down to dusty morningEmbed
