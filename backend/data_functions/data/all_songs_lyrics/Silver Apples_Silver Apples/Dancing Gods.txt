Dancing Gods LyricsIn the house made of the dawn
In the house made of the evening twilight
In the house made of the dark cloud
Where the zig-zag lightning stands high on top
Where the he-rain stands high on top
O, male divinity
With your moccasins of dark cloud, come to us!
With your leggings of dark cloud, come to us!
With your shirt of dark cloud, come to us!
With your head-dress of dark cloud, come to us!
With the zig-zag lightning flung over your head, come to us, soaring!
With the rainbow hanging high over your head, come to us, soaring!
With the zig-zag lightning flung high on the ends of your wings, come to us, soaring!
With the rainbow hanging high on the ends of your wings, come to us, soaring!
I have made your sacrifice
I have prepared a smoke for you
My feet restored for me
My legs restored for me
My body restored for me
My mind restored for me
My voice restored for me
Today take away your spell from me
Today take away your spell from me
Far off from me it is taken!
Far off from me it is taken!
Far off from me you have done it!
You have done it!
You have done it!
Happily my interior becomes cool
Happily my eyes regain their power
Happily my head becomes cool
Happily my legs regain their power
Happily I hear again!
Happily the spell is taken off
Happily may I walk
Happily may I walk
Happily may I walk
In beauty, I can walk
In beauty, I can walk
In beauty, it is finished
In beauty, it is finishedEmbed
