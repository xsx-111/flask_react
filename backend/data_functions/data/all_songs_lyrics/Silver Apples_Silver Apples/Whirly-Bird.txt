Whirly-Bird LyricsWhirly-bird unzip my mind
So nuts and bolts spill out with
Twisted wires and shattered bulbs and
Bits of glass emotion copper cures
The jangled snarl of every day
Unwound and fixed upon the board
Where parts and wholes together lash
Component dreams and slabs of light
All fused within the silver globe
That swirls on top of my whirly-bird
Unzip my mind so nuts and bolts
Spill out with twisted wires
Shattered bulbs and bits of glass
Emotion copper cures
The jangled snarl of every day
Unwound
And fused atop the globe is my
Whirly-birdEmbed
