Lovefingers Lyrics
Mellow is the yellow sun
Waving sunbeams in the air
Weaving golden spells that run
Magic fingers through my hair
Magic fingers through my hair

Green the sea that unfolds waves
Salty carpets flung on land
Foamy fingers seek out caves
Where lovers lie upon the sand
Where lovers lie upon the sand

Red the lips from which I sup
Rubies from the fleshy bowl
Fingers reach inside to cup
My heart and knead my love to soul
My heart and knead my love to soul

Mellow is the yellow sun
Waving sunbeams in the air
Weaving golden spells that run
Magic fingers through my hair
Magic fingers through my hair
Magic fingers through my hair
Red the lips from which I sup
Rubies from the fleshy bowl
Fingers reach inside to cup
My heart and knead my love to soul
My heart and knead my love to soul
Fingers reach inside to cup
My heart and knead my love to soul
My heart and knead my love to soul
My heart and knead my love to soul
My heart and knead my love to soul2Embed
