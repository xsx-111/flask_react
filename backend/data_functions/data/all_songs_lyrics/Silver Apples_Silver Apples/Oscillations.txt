Oscillations Lyrics
Oscillations, oscillations
Electronic evocations of sound's reality
Spinning, magnetic fluctuations
Waves of wave configurations
That dance between the poles off sound
And bind my world to soul

I walk the streets of moment
Head down to the ground
Cars are stars remotely far
My only world is sound
Passersby are worlds that fly
Far from the dance of time
Time whirls round from pole to pole
And swirls within the sound of...

Oscillations, oscillations
Electronic evocations of sound's reality
Spinning, magnetic fluctuations
Waves of wave configurations
That dance between the poles off sound
And bind my world to soul
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, oscillations
Oscillations, o-4Embed
