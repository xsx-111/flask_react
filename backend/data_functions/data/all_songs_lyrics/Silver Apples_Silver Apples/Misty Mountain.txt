Misty Mountain LyricsAre you are you, here with me upon this misty mountain?
Gold is dripping from your hair as pearls fall in a fountain
Truth is streaming from your eyes, silver strands of smiles
Are you are you, here with me and did you count the miles?
Will you, will you, stay with me upon this heaven's bed?
All that you may ask of me need never to be said
Love dances through my heart and weaves its way to find
If you will, if you will, stay with me
With my love and with my mindEmbed
