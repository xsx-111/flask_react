Nostalgia LyricsVoices heard in fields of green
Their joy their calm and luxury
Are lost within the wanderings of my mind
I'm cutting branches from the trees
Shaped by years of memories
To exorcise their ghosts from inside of me
The sound of waves in a pool of water
I'm drowning in my nostalgia
Nostalgia
My nostalgia
The sound of waves in a pool of water
I'm drowning in my nostalgia
Nostalgia
My nostalgia
