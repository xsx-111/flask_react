Red Guitar LyricsI recognise no method of living that I know
I see only the basic materials I may use
If you ask me, I may tell you
It's been this way for years
I play my red guitar
It's the devil in the flesh
It's the iron in my soul
I understand you're facing problems inside you
A certain difficulty of being that I know too
You may ask me why do I fail
Just when I'm needed
I play my red guitar
It's the devil in the flesh
It's the iron in my soul
If you ask me, I may tell you
It's been this way for yearsEmbed
