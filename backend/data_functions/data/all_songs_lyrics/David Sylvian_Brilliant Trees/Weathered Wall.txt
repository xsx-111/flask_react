Weathered Wall LyricsYou were someone to believe in
A place for hope in a changing world
Feeling every moment
Every one of the years spent in your arms
After a lifetime of living
These soiled hands show no life at all
Working at all hours
Never facing the fears here in my heart
Grieving for the loss of heaven
Weeping for the loss of heaven
By the wailing wall
You were someone to believe in
Giving life where there was a will to learn
But it's the nature of living
To count only the years left in your heartEmbed
