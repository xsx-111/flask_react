Sheena Is a Punk Rocker Lyrics
Two!

Well the kids are all hopped up and ready to go
They're ready to go now
They got their surfboards and they're going to the discotheque-a-go-go
But she just couldn't stay
She had to break away
Well New York City really has it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now

Well she's a punk, punk, a punk rocker
Punk, punk, a punk rocker
Punk, punk, a punk rocker
Punk, punk, a punk rocker
Well the kids are all hopped up and ready to go
They're ready to go now
They got their surfboards and they're going to the discotheque-a-go-go
But she just couldn't stay
She had to break away
Well New York City really has it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now

Well she's a punk, punk, a punk rocker
Punk, punk, a punk rocker
Punk, punk, a punk rocker
Punk, punk, a punk rocker

Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is a punk rocker now
Sheena is a punk rocker
Sheena is...Embed
