I Just Wanna Have Something To Do LyricsHanging out on Second Avenue
Eating chicken vindaloo
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Well allright
Wait-Now
Wait-Now
Hanging out all by myself
'Cause I don't want to be with anybody else
I just want to be with you
I just want to have something to do
TonightEmbed
