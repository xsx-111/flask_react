We Want the Airwaves Lyrics
9 to 5 and 5 to 9
Ain't  gonna to take it
It is our time
We want the world
And we want it now
We are going to take it anyhow

We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is going to stay alive

Oh yeah, well all right
Let's rock, tonight
All night
Oh yeah,well all right
Let's rock, tonight
All night

Where is your guts
And will to survive
And do not you want to
Keep rock n' roll music alive
Mr. Programmer
I got my hammer
And I am going to
Smash my
Smash my
Radio
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves, baby
If rock is going to stay alive

Oh yeah, well all right
Let's rock, tonight
All night
Oh yeah,well all right
Let's rock, tonight
All night

We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves
We want the airwaves, babyEmbed
