Harsh Degrees Lyrics
It's easy, I swear
The less you think, the less you care
And stop wasting my time
All this complaining, you're doing just fine
So simple it's hard
So soft you just want to touch it
You like to mime, a puppeteer
Pull my strings, pull me near
And keep shedding your hair
I want distractions, I want them everywhere
You wanna learn and I wanna teach
A nursing home and a bottle of bleach

Toys
Right beneath your hands
A thousand grains of sand
Sit between my teeth
Taste them as I

You are my puppet master
I am your play toy
This temperature remains
To be the last hope of offending me
Harsh degrees
Harsh degrees
Harsh degrees
Stitch me up, I'm beginning to tear
Fold me up and take me everywhere
You paint your nails, you cut your hair
I wanna look but I don't wanna stare
Stretch my bones, crack my back
This ain't love, it's just a form of attack
You got a handful of string
Fistful of salt and some seasoning
No crime if there's no law
Feet on the ground but I can't feel the floor

Toys
Right beneath your hands
A thousand grains of sand
Sit between my teeth
Taste them as I

You are my puppet master
I am your play toy
A thousand grains of sand
Sit between my teeth
Harsh degrees
Harsh degrees
Harsh degrees
