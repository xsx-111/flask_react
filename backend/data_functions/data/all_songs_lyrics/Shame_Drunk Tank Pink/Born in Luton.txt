Born in Luton LyricsDouble-locked, titanium steel
Curtains closed, the windows are sealed
There’s never anyone in this house
If it brings you a smile
Then it’s worth a tear
I feel both of those things
When you are near
Buzzers broken, I guess I’ll just wait
No umbrella and it’s starting to rain
There’s never anyone in this house
I’ve been waiting outside for all of my life
And now I’ve got to the door there’s no one inside
When are you coming back?
When arе you coming home?
I’ve been kicking the curb, I’vе been chipping the stone
Body heat of a thousand degrees
Letter box open so I can feel the AC
There’s never anyone in this house
And if the body is willing
Then so is the mind
If you can’t trust in either
Prepare to decline
Ring ring, pick up your telephone
Knock knock, there’s nobody home
There’s never anyone in this house
I’ve been waiting outside for all of my life
And now I’ve got to the door there’s no one inside
When are you coming back?
When are you coming home?
I’ve been kicking the curb, I’ve been chipping the stone
I’ve been waiting outside for all of my life
And now I’ve got to the door there’s no one inside
What's going on down there?3Embed
