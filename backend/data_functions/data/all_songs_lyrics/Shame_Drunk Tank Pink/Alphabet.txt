Alphabet Lyrics
Now what you see is what you get
I still don't know the alphabet
Don't forget your P's and Q's
Please smile when we tell you to

Are you waiting
To feel good?
Are you praying
Like you should?

Monkey see and monkey do
Just like me in front of you
Hold my hand, please, don't be shy
Well, you know I'm not the jealous type

Are you waiting
To feel good?
Are you praying
Like you should?

Are you waiting
To feel good?
I'm still waiting
Like I should2Embed
