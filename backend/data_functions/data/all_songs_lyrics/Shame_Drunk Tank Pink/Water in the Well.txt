Water in the Well Lyrics
There is something
In the hills
Well, I hear it lingers
And I've seen it kill
There is water
In the well
I see it flowing on
It's flowing on, it's flowing on for you
For you
I tried to call you late last night
I heard you shiver, I gave you a fright

Hey
Caught in my ways
This is the last time Acid Dad
Look and I see it
The new enemy
I make it heat
I take it, I take it
This
Stiff in the wind
They're just a preacher
Ugh, they're just a saviour
Look and you'll see it
'Cause I never could
This is the last time Acid Dad
I said I'd get it on
I said I'd gеt it on
I said I'd get it on, I get it on, I get it on for you
Wеll, not you
You took my life before
You'll take my life again
I'm not your lover, dear
You're just my spe-spe-spe-spe-special friend
Please, ditch your telephone
Closed curtains no one's home
Detach your internet
The hills see none of that
And which way is heaven, sir?
We all got lost somehow
I tried to find myself but I lost the map and now I'm all burnt out

Crux upon crux
Lux upon lux
Crux upon crux
Lux upon lux
Crux upon crux (This)
Lux upon lux (This is the last time)
Crux upon crux (This)
Lux upon lux (This is the last time)
Hey
Caught in my ways
This is the last time Acid Dad
Look and I see it
The new enemy
I make it heat
I take it, I take it
This
Stiff in the wind
They're just a preacher
Ugh, they're just a saviour
Look and you'll see it
'Cause I never could
This is the last time Acid Dad2Embed
