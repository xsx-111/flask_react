Human, for a Minute Lyrics
Well, just for today
We can wish away fate
And welcome the moment at hand
Whether it is deserved
May it be left undisturbed
Just for a second of peace
And as I count all my foes
Distinguished and closed
Is how I hope they remain
For this life is too long
And this world has been wronged
By sinners and saints and more

Just for today
Just for today
Why don't you stay?
Just for today

I watch my bones dry and shatter
For what purpose do they serve?
I don't feel that I can keep them
I don't feel that I deserve
To feel human for an hour
Or even for a minute
While I'm crying with the saints
And I'm laughing with the sinners
So
Just for today
Just for today
Why don't you stay?
Just for today

And I never felt human
I never felt human before
I never felt human
I never felt human before
And I never felt human before you
I never felt human before you
I never felt human before you
I never felt human before you arrived

Before you arrived
Before you arrived
Before you arrived

And I'm half the man I should be
And I'm half the man I should be
And I'm half the man I should be
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
That I'm half the man I should be
I'm half the man I should be
I'm half the man I should be
You never see1Embed
