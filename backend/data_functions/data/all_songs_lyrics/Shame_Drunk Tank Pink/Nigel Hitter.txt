Nigel Hitter Lyrics
Like the wheels on a bus
It just keeps on turning
And as the cream gets wetter
The udder keeps on churning

It just goes on
It just goes on
It just goes on
It just goes on

I can't see no squares
All I see is circles
Tie the knot on my shoes
Pull the string on my girdle

It just goes on
It just goes on
It just goes on
It just goes

Pop-pop-pop
Pop-pop-pop
Pop-pop-pop
Pop-pop-pop
Pop-pop-pop
Pop-pop-pop
Change the sheets on my bed
I wanna smell fresh linen
Will this day ever end?
I need a new beginning

It just goes on
It just goes on
It just goes on
It just goes on
And on and on and on and on

Take the clothes off of my back
They don't seem to fit
I'm throwing everything at this wall
And hoping something sticks

I never did nothing
I couldn't handle
Burn at both ends
That's my candle

I'm burning at both ends
I'm burning at both ends naturally
I'm burning at both ends
I'm burning at both ends naturally
It just goes round and round
Round and round and round
It just goes round and round
Round and round and round
It just goes round and round
Round and round and roundEmbed
