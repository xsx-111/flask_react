March Day Lyrics
You said, "Please, get up!"
I said, "Can't get up!"
You said, "Please, get up!"
I said, "Can't get up!"
I've been told, "Beauty gets old"
By beggars, knights, and cheats
If true then I woke up for nothing
I should just go back to sleep
In my room, in my womb
Is the only place I find peace
All alone, in my home
Yeah, I still can't get to sleep

I can't get up, I won't get up
I can't get up, I won't get up
I can't get up, I won't get up

Once smitten, twice removed
Don't doubt it, you've got nothing to lose
Raise the flag, now salute
I am right, but I don't want to be rude
Closе my eyes, take thе pills
Now all I do is just lie still (Still)
Strap in, feel the heat
Cousin of death, I want to repeat
Wow!
Wow!
Oh my God!
Get yourself up kid
You're a bit too late
Get yourself up kid
Same old mistake

I can't get up, I won't get up
I can't get up, I won't get up
I can't get up, I won't get up

I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"
I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"
I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"
I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"
I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"
I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"
I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"
I said ten times
"Out of mind, out of my mind!"Embed
