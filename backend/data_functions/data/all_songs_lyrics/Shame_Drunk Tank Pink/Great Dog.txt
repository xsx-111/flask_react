Great Dog Lyrics
Another young girl and another young guy
Another blue shirt and another red tie
A good writer writes, a great writer steals
A good dog sits but a great dog heels

I take another walk with you
I take another walk with you

The morning comes and the evening fades
The shirt is gone but the tie remains
I'm a bit too hot, you're a bit too cold
I'm a bit too young, you're a bit too old

I take another walk with you
I take another walk with you
I take another walk with you
I take another walk with you

(Fuck's sake sorry, heheheheh)

It's another case, of walking absurdity
And i take it, from my head
It's another case, of walking absurdity
And i take it, from my head
It's another case, of walking absurdity
And i take it, from my head
It's another case, of walking absurdity
And i take it, from my head1Embed
