6/1 Lyrics
I represent everything that I hate
Yet I'm the person I always dreamt I could become
Please don't wear this skin
Defined by destruction
A common commodity
Aging younger day by day
And older night by night
Six foot tall
I promise I'm six foot tall

I pray to no god
I am God
I am every thought your mind has ever held
I prevent nothing
And nothing prevented me

I do not seek man
Nor women neither
No, nor women neither
No, nor women neither
No, nor women nеither

I devote all this timе
To a world that's not mine
Then I fade far away
Then I fade far away
As I talk to myself
You emerge ill of health
Let me slip through your hands
I don't care where I land
'Cause I love what I hate
And I hate what I love
And I hate myself but I love myself
And I hate myself but I love myself
And I hate myself but I love myselfEmbed
