Snow Day Lyrics
I'm turning my head from the wind
It's cold but I've been colder
And as the dew seeps slowly through the holes and dampens my skin
I feel the sting of mother nature
I'm going to close my eyes soon
And this is the only place I can do it
At the top of this hill
I sit down

I dismiss everything I see in front of me
All mountains crumble and turn to dust
Colour slips away
Just like it always does
If I can't see you then why should I see?
They say don't live in the past
And I don't
I live deep within myself
Just like everyone else

And then I close my eyes
And then I fall to you

And everything comes together at once
It looks just like the ocean
And you wanna just dive in
It's the most beautiful thing you'll ever see
And yet you walk past it all the time
On your way to work
And I'm not looking for anything
Well not really
You see I know what I need
I just haven't got it yet
Well I just have to close my eyes
And I can almost taste it
The fresh air of freedom
I just have to close my eyes

And then I fall to you
And then I fall to you
And then I fall to you
Yeah, I fall to you
In my mind

And I see something that is new when I fall to you
I see something that is new when I fall to you5Embed
