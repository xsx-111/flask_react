The Letter (Live at the Fillmore East/1970) LyricsGimme a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm comin' home
Oh, my baby, she wrote me a letter
I don't care how much I gotta spend now
Oh, I'm gonna find my way back home again
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm comin' home
Yeah, my baby, she wrote me a letter
Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen to me, mister
Can't you help me see my baby once more?
Anyway
I don't care how much I've got to spend
I'm gonna find my way, way back home again
Lonely days are gone
I'm comin' home
My baby, she wrote me a letter, well
Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she can't live without me no more
Listen to me, mister
Can't you help me go to my baby once more?
Anyway
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm comin' home
My baby, she wrote me a letter
My baby
(My baby wrote me a letter) Wrote me now
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote me a letter) My
(My baby wrote me a letter) My baby wrote me
(My baby wrote me a letter) Baby wrote me a letter
(My baby wrote me a letter) Baby wrote me a letter
(My baby wrote me a letter) Oh, my baby
(My baby wrote me a letter) Ow
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote me a letter)
(My baby wrote me a letter)Embed
