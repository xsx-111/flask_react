Bird on the Wire (LIve at the Fillmore East/1970) LyricsLike a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free
Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from an old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
And if I, if I have been unkind
Well, I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you
Like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
I swear by all that I have done wrong
I will make, I will make it all up to thee
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
Well, he cried out to me, "You must not ask for so much."
And a pretty woman stood by her darkened door
And she said to me, "Why not ask for more?"
Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be freeEmbed
