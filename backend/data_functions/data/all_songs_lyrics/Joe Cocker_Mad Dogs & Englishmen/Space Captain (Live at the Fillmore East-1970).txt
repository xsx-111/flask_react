Space Captain (Live at the Fillmore East/1970) LyricsOnce while traveling across the sky
This lovely planet caught my eye
And being curious I flew close by
And now I'm caught here until I die
Until we die
Until we die
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Till we die
I lost my memory of where I've been
We all forgot we could fly
Someday we'll all change to peaceful men
And we'll return into the sky
Until we die
Until we die
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Till we die
Live together, yeah
Learning to live together
Till we die
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Till we die
Hum... Oh...
Ah... hum...
Until we die
Until we die
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
Learning to live together
To live together...
To live together...
To live togetherEmbed
