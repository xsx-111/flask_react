The Ballad of Mad Dogs and Englishmen LyricsLet me see here
Kids, planes, and runway strikes
Flashy pimps and family fights
Spotted dogs and blood-shot eyes
Our space captain laughs and tries
To understand the scheme of things
But just in time the scene has changed
The bus is here, bring the beer
Sherman's reading Shakespeare
Movie makers, boobie shakers
And sexy airplane ticket takers
Union members
Leo Fender's pride and joy - electric toy
Teachers and learners, incense burners
Religious leaders and chronic bleeders
Thieves and pirates on a ride
It's a hippie commune bona fide
Life and time, war death dealers
Rock pop correspondence fever
But Okies and Limeys, curtain climbers
Stones and future Dominoes
Know which way the wind blows
Stolen cola no one knows
The shadow do
But it's still a shady crew
'Cause I love her, and she loves you
Just myself and forty friends
In the name of Cocker power
Out here on the road again
With Mad Dogs and EnglishmenEmbed
