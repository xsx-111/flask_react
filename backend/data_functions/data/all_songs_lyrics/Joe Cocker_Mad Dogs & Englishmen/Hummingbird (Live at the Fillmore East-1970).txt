Hummingbird (Live at the Fillmore East/1970) Lyrics
Oh, sometimes I get impatient
But she cools me without words
And she comes so sweet and softly
My hummingbird, have you heard
That I thought my life had ended
And I find that it's just begun
'Cause she gets me where I live
I'll give her all I have to give
I'm talking about that hummingbird

She's little and I love her too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
Yeah, she's little and she loves me too, my lucky day
Hummingbird don't fly away
Woah yeah

When I'm feeling wild and lonesome
Sh–µ knows the words to say
She gives me understanding
In her special way and I have to say
In my life I'll love no other
She's more than I deserve
And she gets me where I live
Give her everything I have to give
I'm talking about that hummingbird
She's little and I love her too much for words to say
When I see her in the morning sleeping
Yeah, she's little and she loves me too, my lucky day
Hummingbird don't fly away

(Don't fly away, ooh)
(Don't fly away, ooh)
(Don't fly away, ooh)
(Don't fly away, ooh)
(Don't fly away)Embed
