Cry Me a River (Live at the Fillmore East/1970) LyricsCry me a river?
Now, you said that you love me
After being so untrue
I want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
I want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
Over me
(Cry me a river)
I want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
Over me
(Cry me a river)
Oh yeah
(Cry me a river)
Well, I cried a river over you
Now, you say that you're sorry
Oh, for being so unkind
I want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
Cry for me
(Cry me a river)
Oww
(Cry me a river)
I want you to leave
(Cry me a river)
Want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
Right on me, yeah
(Cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head, never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me
(Cry me a river)
C'mon, love
(Cry me a river)
Want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
Down your head
(Cry me a river)
Oww, cry
(Cry me a river)
Cry me a river
(Cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head, ooh, never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
You were through with me
(Cry me a river)
Yes
(Cry me a river)
I want you to cry
(Cry me a river)
I want you to leave
(Cry me a river)
Ahh
(Cry me a river)
Cry me
(Cry me a river)
Oh, I cried a river over you
Yeah, I cried a river over you
(I cried a river over you)
Over you
(I cried a river over you)
Over you
(I cried a river over you)
Ahh
(I cried a river over you)
River, over
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over youEmbed
