Falling at Your Feet LyricsEvery chip from every cup
Every promise given up
Every reason that's not enough
Is falling, falling at your feet
Every band elastic limit
Every race when there's nothing in it
Every winner that's lost a ticket
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, falling at your feet
Everyone who needs a friend
Every life that has no end
Every knee not ready to bend
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, now I'm falling at your feet
All fall down (All the manic dazed faces that you pull)
All fall down (All the action is not under your control)
All fall down (The graffiti rolling down off of your tongue)
All fall down (And the compromise you make for some)
Every teenager with acne
Every face that's spoiled by beauty
Every adult tamed by duty
They're all falling at your feet
Every foot in every face
Every cop's stop who finds the grace
Every prisoner in the maze
Every hand that needs an ace
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, and I'm falling at your feet
(All fall down) All the books you never read
(All fall down) Just started
(All fall down) All the meals you rushed
(All fall down) Never tasted
Every eye closed by a bruise
Every player who just can't lose
Every pop star howling abuse
Every drunk back on the booze
All falling at your feet
Oh I'm falling at your feet
(All fall down) All the information
(All fall down) All the big ideas
(All fall down) All the radio waves
(All fall down) Electronic seas
(All fall down) How to navigate
(All fall down) How to simply be
(All fall down) To know when to wait
(All fall down) This plain simplicity
(All fall down) In whom shall I trust
(All fall down) How might I be still
(All fall down) Teach me to surrender
(All fall down) Not my will, thy willEmbed
