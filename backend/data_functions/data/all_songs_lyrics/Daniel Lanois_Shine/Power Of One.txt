Power Of One LyricsIn the middle of the night it came to me
A bridge to your ecstasy
Images of a burned out hell
You coming in with your mission bell
Don't sit, waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
Little sister, let's go downtown
And dance to the night sounds
Hear the bass wafting down the hill
From Echo Park, my Jamaica in L.A
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
It's in the shadows, in the sweet scent breeze
In the riding out of a death disease
The prettiness shining into complete
In the bitterness burning up in the heat
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
I was drowning in champagne eyes
Skipping along in compromise
When dignity rattled me on the back
And my rebel mind needed to attack
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
My sweetness, you were with me when
I was sad at an evolution bend
Hiding alone like a rolling stone
Now I want to know the power of your home
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Get a lift, feel the power of one
Don't sit waiting for the thing to come
Laugh in the face of a hundred planet gunsEmbed
