San Juan LyricsMake me see it a whole new way
Make me see the new day, the new day, the new day
Make me be, make me be
Make me be a whole new way
Meet me in San Juan, baby, I’ll be true
Whisper sweet everything to you
Yellow cactus rose, cotton blown by wind
Beaten brown hands, perfect skin, perfect skin, perfect skin
In San Juan, I don't want to know
All the reasons why you got to go
In San Juan, meet me in San Juan
Where nobody has and everybody gives
There's no sad wind where death lives
I see your love, I see your love
Baby, I’ll be true
Yes, I’ll be true
For your love, for your love, for your love, loveEmbed
