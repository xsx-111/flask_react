Shine LyricsI have wandered far and wide
All the way from Paris to Mexico
Till I was gone and didn't know
In the end the thing that keeps me walking is your shine
Your shine in the morning
Your shine in the distance
Your shine inside the laughter and the ghosts
They have spoken of the river
Forever bending inside the fever
Of the saints that walk all night with no domain
In the end the thing that keeps them walking is your shine
Your shine when they wear no coat
Your shine when the feeling’s low
Your shine when it's too late to turn around
I have frozen up my dreams
Thinking I was all alone
Fighting every minute
For each turning stone
I have reached the rocket speed
I have touched the ground that feeds
Scaling fences, looking for the healing sunlight
In the end the thing that keeps me walking is your shine
Your shine in transmissions
Your shine in decisions
Your shine when I labour to the new day
It’s your shine, your shine, your shine, shine, shine onEmbed
