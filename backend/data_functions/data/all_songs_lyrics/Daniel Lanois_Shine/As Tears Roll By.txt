As Tears Roll By LyricsI've been working downtown inside my troubles
I've been working downtown inside my troubles
I've been sleeping under the bridge of Highway One
And I don't know where my saviour is
As tears roll by
Oh dear heart, I know it's been a long time
And the pendulum swings so wide
I've been wrestling with the burning spear
With the burning spear
Don't want to be like this another year
As tears roll by
I could never see your perfect rainbow
Avalanche buried me deep in the snow
Murky smokestack made me fall
Cold ambition written on my wall
I got mixed up and fell down
I got mixed up as years roll by
I could be a patriot if I could see
But the TV talking man make no sense to me
And I don't know where our saviour lives
And I don't know where my saviour is
Building up, building down
As tears roll by
Got to keep my spirit out of trouble
Keep myself out of trouble
But the hands of need are calling me
I feel mortality
Tumble down, tumble down
As years roll by
They were building a building like forever
Heads buried deep inside a fever
The spirit cried out from the ground
Sweet, sweet maternal sounds
Tumble, tumble, tumble down
To the ground
As fears roll by
As tears roll by
As tears roll by
As tears roll by
As tears roll byEmbed
