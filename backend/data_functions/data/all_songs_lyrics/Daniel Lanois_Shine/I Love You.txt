I Love You LyricsA man carried metal
Carried gold
More than he could handle
More than he could hold
It weighed him down
To a sand shallow grave
Where his bones were beaten
By a heat wave
While here it rains all night
And it blows a sweet breeze
I think I'll call you up
And say please, baby, please
I love you
I love you
Yeah, I love you
Yeah, I love you
Ah the dream machine
Makes it hard to see
If I could stand outside myself
And watch it come to me
I'd make the dream
Filter down to my fingers
And rip at the foolâ€™s head
And follow your scent that lingers
'Cause I love you
Yeah, I love you
I love you
Yeah, I love you
Till the crash and
The booming of the white bomb
Come sure, come soon
Come leave just one song
One song, one beat
One dust, one end, one for all
One stone for the marking
For the dream when it falls
When I love you
When I love you
Yeah, I love you
Oh yeah, I love you
I love youEmbed
