Slow Giving LyricsSlow giving, slow coming
Slow giving, slow coming
Joy giving, joy coming
Love giving, love coming
Angel, I’ve seen you in the rocket speed
I've seen you in the ground that feeds
My angel, with me you've crawled through the trenches
Forever scaling my defences
I need you now in my rebel mind
Please lock the door and hang a sign
My heart is open wide but the bleeding's hard to stop
Explain to me what is and what is not
What is, what is, what is
Slow giving, slow coming, you’re my world apart
Slow giving, slow coming, what a fall, what a fall
Joy giving, joy coming
Love giving, love coming
Angel, until the beast in me forever burns
It's hard to know which way to turn
On the guard rail of your twenty five years
I feel the piercing ember of every tear
On a desert plain, on my knees
Broken and ragged, saying please, baby, please, baby, please
Oh angel, I’ve lost so many times
Please, please show me a sign
On a pretty lip, on a broken grip
Don't let me bring the roof down, let me build my spirit sound
I'm standing right back where I started
Please let me stay open hearted
Oh my angel, my sweet angel, angelEmbed
