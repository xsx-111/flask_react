I Like America & America Likes Me Lyrics
I'm scared of dying (Don't go)
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar? Ooh (I can't be quiet)
I'm scared of dying
No gun required, ooh
My skin is fire, it's so desired

Is that designer?
Is that on fire?
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?

I'm scared of dying, it's fine
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something
Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Council, being listed
Man I kinda miss it, hey
I'm a designer, unite pariahs
Am I a liar?
Oh, will this help me lay down?
Kids don't want rifles, they want Supreme
No gun required
Oh, will this help me lay down?

We're scared of dying, it's fine
What's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

Would you please listen?
Would you please listen?
We can see what's missing
When you bleed, say so we know
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something

Gone off designer
It's all on fire
And we're all liars
So won't you help me lay down
My skin is fire, it's so desired
No gun required
Oh, won't you help me lay down?
I'm scared of dying
It's fine
Oh, what's a fiver?
Being young in the city
Belief and saying something
And saying something
And saying something26Embed
