Inside Your Mind Lyrics
I've been watching you walk
I've been learning the way that you talk
The back of your head is at the front of my mind
Soon I'll crack it open just to see what's inside your mind

Inside your mind

Maybe I will wait until you're fast asleep
Dreaming things I have the right to see
Maybe you are dreaming you're in love with me
The only option left is look and see

Inside your mind
Inside your mind

I can show you the photographs of you getting on with life
I've had dreams where there's blood on you
All those dreams where you're my wife

Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind18Embed
