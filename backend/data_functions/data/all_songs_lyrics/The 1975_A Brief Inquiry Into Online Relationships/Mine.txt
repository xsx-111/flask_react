Mine Lyrics
There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know that you are mine

I fight crime online sometimes
Then write rhymes I hide behind
And my switch, her wine, both crying
I'm fine if you are fine

Looking back on 2009
When people said that it was raining all the time
I see sunshine 'cause I know that you are mine

When you say that I'm wasting your time
Then I smile and tell you things will be fine
For some reason, I just can't say "I do"

There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know you are mine10Embed
