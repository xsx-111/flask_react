Be My Mistake Lyrics
And be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like
I don't want to hug
I just want to sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet

So, don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

Save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake

I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak
And don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes

And save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake45Embed
