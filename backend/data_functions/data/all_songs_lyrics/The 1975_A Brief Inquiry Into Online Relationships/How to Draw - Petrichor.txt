How to Draw / Petrichor Lyrics
I've not learned how to draw
I've not learned how to draw
What if you die with all of the cameras?
Take something and then make it brand new
Try and do anything fourteen times
Love yourself like someone you love, one you love
Don't take any of my advice (My advice)
Write a letter to your future self who won't change
Don't let the internet ruin your time
They can take anything as long as it's true
What they can't take is you telling them lies, lies, lies, lies22Embed
