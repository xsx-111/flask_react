Ret Liv Dead LyricsIf you don't care, why are you standing there?
You're all alone with the memory
Thinking about something that will never be
Just get out of here, wait for the airplane
You're all alone and you'll never see
That everybody hated you, apart from me
Don't know what to do
Say you need her
But she don't need you
What's all the fuss? Come on and stay with us
You're all alone with the memory
Thinking about something that you'll never be
Just get out of here, you're running out of air
You're all alone and you'll never see
Everybody hated you, apart from me
Don't know what to do
Say you need her
But she don't need you
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh...Embed
