Tears Are Cool LyricsI wanna talk to you
Don't want something I get for nothing
I wanna talk to you
I know when something isn't worth discussing
You might say I know, but you always knew
I could be unkind, but I can't be cruel
All my lies are false, but your heart is true
When I see you cry, I think tears are cool
I wanna talk to you
I don't want a lover that I take for granted
I wanna talk to you
I wanna say something that you'll find romantic
I don't say my prayers, but I pray for you
I might say who cares, but I know you do
You're the one who knows that my lies aren't true
When I see you cry, I think tears are cool
I don't say my prayers, but I pray for you
I might say who cares, but I know you do
You're the one who knows that my lies aren't true
When I see you cry, I think tears are coolEmbed
