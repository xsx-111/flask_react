Norman 3 Lyrics
Come on over, break some bread
Close the window and we'll lay on the bed
If you're the future, then I'm with you
Looking forward to everything that we do

They are stupid, they don't know
Going nowhere, but we're ready to go
We're together on our way
Are you ready for what I'm going to say?

Yeah, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
And I know that it's you

Yeah, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
And I know that it's you

Yeah, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
And I know that it's you
Yeah, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
And I know that it's you

Yeah, I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
And I know that it's youEmbed
