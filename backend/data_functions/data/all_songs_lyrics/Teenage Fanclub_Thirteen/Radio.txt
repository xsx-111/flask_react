Radio Lyrics
I think I'll kill the radio, don't want to hear this song
Can't relate to yesterday, what we did was wrong, yeah
But now you lighten up my day with your views
Just out of school and you're "that's so cool"

Baby, justify the reason behind your style
Find a craze that fits and stay there for awhile
Love to hear your song
On the AM, on the AM

You can't even get it on
I don't know what all your chances are
And when I try to trip you up, I'm the one who falls
Did you know when I was young, I'd paint my face with the latest craze?

Baby, justify the reason behind your style
Find a craze that fits and stay there for awhile
Love to hear your song
On the radio, on the radio
On the radio, on the radio
You on the radio, on the radio
You on the radio, on the radioEmbed
