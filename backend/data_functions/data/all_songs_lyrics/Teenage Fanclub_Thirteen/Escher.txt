Escher LyricsTell your sins to me
And I'll do 'em all over with you
I know it's speed
So I hope you'll come over
And I don't know if I'm going up or down with you
Don't know if I'm coming going up or down with you
But I don't mind
Change my thoughts of you
When nothing too easy comes true
Wet turns to blue
When my thoughts are all over
And I don't know if I'm going up or down with you
Don't know if I'm coming going up or down with you
But I don't mind
Say my prayers to you
When my fun is all over and through
I always knew
When my fun would be over
And I don't know If I'm going up or down with you
Don't know if I'm coming going up or down with you
But I don't mind
Don't know if I'm going up or down with you
Don't know if I'm coming going up or down with you
But I don't mindEmbed
