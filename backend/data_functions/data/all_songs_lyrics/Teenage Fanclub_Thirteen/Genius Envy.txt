Genius Envy Lyrics(R. McGinley)
I don't care
I don't wanna hear about
What I'm thinking
I wanna hear something new
But I know you always say
What's on my mind
And I know I'll always know
That I'm not mine
So what if you see other people
I only get jealous when I listen
To The Beatles
So go and get someone new
But I know you'll always be the one
Who cares
And I know you'll always be the one
Who's thereEmbed
