120 Mins Lyrics
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be well known
I don't wanna be unsane
I don't wanna love in vain
I don't wanna need a change
I don't wanna be arranged
I don't wanna be amazed

I just wanna see your
Face again
Be my friend

I don't wanna another drink
I don't wanna have to think
I don't wanna stay the same
I don't wanna another name
I don't wanna be defamed
I don't wanna be acclaimed
I don't wanna be amazed

I just wanna see your
Face again
Be my friendEmbed
