Commercial Alternative LyricsI wanna thank you 'cause I'm a mess
I wanna thank you, the way you dress
I wanna thank you for staying here
I wanna thank you, I love you, dear
Now I know you
Like I know you
Like I'm going to
I wanna thank you for staying cool
I wanna thank you 'cause I'm a fool
I wanna thank you, where have you been?
I wanna thank you, I love your scene
Now I know you
Like I know you
Like I'm going to
Now I know you
Like I know you
Like I'm going toEmbed
