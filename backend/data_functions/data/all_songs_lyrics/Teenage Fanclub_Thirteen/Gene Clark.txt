Gene Clark LyricsWhen the circle finally formed, you called me up
The only one making a sound
I can't work out what I want to see
I bury my thoughts in the ground
All the seeds you sow are just looking for a space to grow
So sleep, sleep and lay your white body down
So sleep, sleep and lay your white body down
No matter what you do, it all returns to you
No matter what you say, you'll hear it all someday
No matter what you do, it all returns to you
No matter what you say, you'll hear it all someday
No matter what you do, it all returns to you
No matter what you say, you'll hear it all somedayEmbed
