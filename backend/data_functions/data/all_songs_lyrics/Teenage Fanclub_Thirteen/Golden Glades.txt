Golden Glades Lyrics(B. O'Hare)
Your mind is strong
But your will is weak
And it's no wonder
You can't stand
On your own two feet
The past is gone
You can't call it back
That's no reason
For you to paint it black
All said and done
There is no one
Who can turn your love to hate
Meet him head on
But I'm still around
And it's no wonder
I can't tell if I'm up or down
The feelings gone
I can't get it back
But that's no reason
For you to stab my back
When all is love
There's only one
Who can free your mind of hateEmbed
