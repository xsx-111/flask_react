Weird Horses Lyrics(R. McGinley)
See
See what I wanna find
I can find it by myself
But I feel
I feel like I recognize
What I see in someone else
When I feel like I'm fucked up
I don't know if the stars
Have been stuck up
And somewhere behind
Time has snuck up
Why
Why is a friend of mine
He reminds me of you so
So why
Why should I recognize
What my thoughts are gonna grow
When I feel like I'm fucked up
If I feel like the stars
Have been stuck up
And somewhere behind
Time has snuck up
You call by to say hi
When I'm fucked up
And I don't know if the stars
Have been stuck up
But with you all my fears
Have been sucked upEmbed
