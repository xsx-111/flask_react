Older Guys Lyrics(Gram Parsons)
I don't ever think about tomorrow
What or why, it's all on another day
And I think that it's been said
By somebody up ahead
The older guys tell us what it's all about
The older guys really got it all worked out
Since we've got the older guys to show us how
I don't see why we can't stop right now
It's so costly living down on the ocean
Bed on the beach is where I wanna make my home
And I think that it's been said by somebody up ahead
The older guys get the ladies with their style
The older guys squeeze 'em till it makes them smile
What's the sense of looking like a cop on the beat?
What's the sense of looking like a girl on the street?Embed
