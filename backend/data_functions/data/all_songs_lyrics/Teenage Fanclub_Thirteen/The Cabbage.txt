The Cabbage Lyrics
Goodbye, girl, where did you go?
Woke up this morning and I didn't know
We were together, but now we're not
Asked you for nothing, that's what I got

It's okay, even better this way
That's what they'll tell you
That's what they'll say

Are we together? I guess we're not
Do you still want me? That's what I thought
Look in the mirror and I'm a mess
Open the window, forget about the rest

It's okay, even better this way
That's what they'll tell you
That's what they'll say

It's okay, even better this way
That's what they'll tell you
That's what they'll sayEmbed
