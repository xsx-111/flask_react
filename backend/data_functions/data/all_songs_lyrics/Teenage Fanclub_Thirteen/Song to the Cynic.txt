Song to the Cynic LyricsNo, you won't leave your mark on me
I'm protected by an honesty
And all the dead people in the world
To scare, to give
You won't leave your mark on me
I feel stupid cause I'm lost at sea
And all the dead people in the world
To scare, to live
And if what you said was true
And it all returns to you
Don't need your false impressions
Of the world in you
And if what you said was true
When it all belongs to you
I'll need your sacred blessing
Just to talk to you
And you won't leave your mark on me
I'm protected by an honesty
And all the dead people in the world
Too late, to live
And you won't leave your mark on me
You won't leave your mark on me
Ohhh...Embed
