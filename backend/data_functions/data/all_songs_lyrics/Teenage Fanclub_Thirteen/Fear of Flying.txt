Fear of Flying Lyrics
Hey, I don't look back on all the things I've done
I've never looked for answers in a song
Ain't got no good ideas, I'm staring at the sun
Don't always look for comfort in a song

This is your one-way ticket
So don't fuck it up
Your flight is boarding
And you're running out of luck
Add a new vibration
To the situation
Add a new vibration

I'd love to save the world like nature's only son
I've never looked for answers in a song
Don't have to paint no words the thoughts that don't belong
Don't always look for comfort in a song

This is your one-way ticket
So don't fuck it up
Your flight is boarding
And you're running out of luck
Add a new vibration
To the situation
Add a new vibration
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Add a new vibration
(Hey, hey, hey)
To the situation
(Hey, hey, hey)
To the situation
(Hey, hey, hey)
To my foundation
(Hey, hey, hey)
Add a new vibration
(Hey, hey, hey)
Add a new vibration
(Hey, hey, hey)
To my foundation
(Hey, hey, hey)
Add a new vibration
(Hey, hey, hey)
To the situation
(Hey, hey, hey)
To the situation
(Hey, hey, hey)
Add a new vibration
(Hey, hey, hey)
Add a new vibration
(Hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, heyEmbed
