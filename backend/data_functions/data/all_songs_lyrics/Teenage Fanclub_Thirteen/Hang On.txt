Hang On Lyrics(G. Love)
Been bought and I've been sold
And I've forgot what I've been told
And now I need someone
Of all the stars I've ever seen
You're the sun
Hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
I've not forgotten all the tricks
That you've done
I just need some fun
I'm going underground to reassess
Just what I've found
And all that I can do
Been blinded by the light
Now I can go with a smile
Hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on
I've not forgotten all the tricks
That you've done
I just need someoneEmbed
