Rising Sun Lyrics
She just jumped on a plane and paid no attention to me
Or gave me no notice but her goodbyes sure were sweet

Said she's gonna write, maybe call me up
She checked her bags, and then she broke my heart
She kissed my cheek, and told me not to keep in touch

The rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl
I'm gonna catch a plane and steal her back again
The rising sun just stole my girl away

Now we're apart I think about her everyday
Well the scuffle of little feet all round the bed

I'm gettin' no cards, I'm gettin' no mail
The girl ain't on the telephone
If she don't come home I know that's where I'm gonna go

The rising sun just stole my girl away
I said the rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl
I'm gonna catch a plane and steal her back again
The rising sun just stole my girl away
They're buying our beaches, sellin' transistors
Them little folk look real big
If they think that they can take her away
I'm gonna steal her back again
Shake!
Aww it's lookin' real good
Why don't you call me up babe?
Woo!

I said the rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl
Gonna catch a plane and steal her back again
The rising sun just stole my girl away

Well the rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl
I'm gonna catch a plane and steal her back again
The rising sun just stole my girl away

I said the rising sun just stole my girl away
The rising sun just stole my girl awayEmbed
