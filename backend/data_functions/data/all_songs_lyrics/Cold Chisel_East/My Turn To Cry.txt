My Turn To Cry LyricsWell I was pretty young
She was young and pretty
I was so naive
It was such a pity
I said now baby don't you waste your time
Just cryin' for me
I gotta go away for a while
And you can be free
And baby, baby, it's my turn to cry
Baby, baby, it's my turn to cry
I found a job
And you found a lover
He'd been married before
But you needed the shelter
When I told you to have a good time
I think you took me all wrong
Next thing I know you're engaged
And a kid is coming along
And baby, baby, it's my turn to cry
Baby, baby, it's my turn to cry
(I'm sittin' at home, watchin' the walls
My mouth is parched, my stomach's tight
You said goodbye, you turned you back
I guess you know what's right . . 
I'm sittin' at home, watchin' the walls
Birdcage mouth, I lost the fight
You said goodbye, you turned you back
I guess you know what's right . . .)
I found a job
And you found a lover
He'd been married before
But you needed the shelter
And baby, baby, it's my turn to cry
Baby, baby, it's my turn to cryEmbed
