Four Walls LyricsThey're calling "Time for exercise"
Round Her Majesty's hotel
The maid'll hose the room out when I'm gone
I never knew such luxury
Until my verdict fell
Four walls, wash basin, prison bed
Well the Bathurst riots ended
When they clubbed The Rebels down
And in every congregation there was silence
You can hear the Angels singin'
When Christmas comes around
Four walls, wash basin, prison bed
I love to march while some Nazi calls the time
Who'd wanna go home
I can't see and I can't hear
They've burnt out all the feelings
I've never been so crazy, and it's just my second year
Four walls, wash basin
Four walls, wash basin
Four walls, wash basin, prison bedEmbed
