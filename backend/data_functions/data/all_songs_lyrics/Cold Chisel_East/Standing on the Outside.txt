Standing on the Outside Lyrics
I'm standing on the outside lookin' in
I'm standing on the outside lookin' in
Woh-oh, I never strayed outside the law

I'm standing on the outside lookin' in
A room full of money and the born to win
And no amount of work's gonna get me through the door

When I go walkin' down Bluewater Bay
I surface in the city at the end of the day, woh-oh
I got a bad case of the benz

I'm standing on the sidewalk you can see
Somebody everybody wants to be
A-they got the means to justify every end

I got a friend broke through illegally
Pulled a job on a small-town T.A.B
Five grand down on his own little piece of Eden

And I know
And I know
The first thing I do when I get into town
Is buy a twenty-two and cut the whole thing down
No amount of work's gonna buy my way
To Freedom!

I'm on the outside lookin' in
I'm standing on the outside lookin' in
Woh-oh, woh-oh, oh yeah!

I'm standing on the outside lookin' in
I'm standing on the outside lookin' in

Woh-oh, woh-oh, oh yeah!
Woh-oh, woh-oh, oh yeah!
Woh-oh, woh-oh, oh yeah!Embed
