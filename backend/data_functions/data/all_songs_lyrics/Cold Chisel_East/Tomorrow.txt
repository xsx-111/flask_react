Tomorrow Lyrics
Oh no

Into the nightside, the city rolls
The river of light, a million souls
I'm three days out of Parramatta jail
And city of hearts is out of control

And newspaper men are, are using my name
They hold the power, well I hold the blame

And I know no love runs deep enough to hide you
When military minds are closing in (you're whisperin')

I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
Oh no

Well, all last week I was clutching at straws
Facing the future, and forcing the doors
I got death in the hour, or life on the run
Or twenty more years under the gun
And I know no love runs deep enough to hide you
When military minds are closing in (you're whisperin')

I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
Oh no, oh no
Oh no
Set me free

There's an eighty dollar hooker, she's asleep on the bed
The T.V. weather's on, but the sound is dead

Out in the shadows they've got us in their sights
But I don't wanna know about tomorrow, she set me free tonight
Ow!


I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
Oh no
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
I don't wanna know about tomorrow
Oh no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oEmbed
