Cheap Wine Lyrics
Once I smoked a Dannemann cigar
I drove a foreign car
Baby that was years ago
I left it all behind

I had a friend, I heard she died
Well, on a needle she was crucified
Baby that was years ago
I left it all behind
For my

Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Come-on, come-on, come-on

I don't mind takin' charity
From those that I despise
Baby, I don't need your love
I don't need your love

Baby, you can shout at me
But you can't meet my eyes
I don't really need your love (need your love)
I don't need your love
I got my
Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Cheap wine and a three-day growth
Come-on, come-on, come-on, come-on!

I'm sitting on the beach
Drinkin' rocket fuels, oh yeah!
I spent the whole night
Breakin' all the rules, oh yeah! (oh yeah!)
I'm mending every minute of the day before
Watching the ocean, watchin' the shore
And watchin' the sunrise
And thinkin' there could never be more
Never be more, yeah

Well, anytime you want to find me
I don't have a telephone
I'm another world away
But I always feel at home
With my

Cheap wine and a three-day growth
A-cheap wine and a three-day growth
Well, come-on
Well, come-on
Come-on, come-on, come-on
A-cheap wine and a three-day growth
A-cheap wine and a three-day growth
Come-on
Well, come-on
A-come-on
Come-on! Come-on!

A-cheap wine and a three-day growth
A-cheap wine and a three-day growth
A-come-on
Well, come-on
Well, come-on
I left it for my, my, my

A-cheap wine and a three-day growth
A-cheap wine and a three-day growth
Come-on
Well, come-on
Well, come-onEmbed
