Ita Lyrics
Every night when I go home
I settle down to prime-time limbo
When all the boys are gathered around
Shoutin' "Ita's on T.V."

And though the roaches are thick on the ground
Somebody goes to close our window
Keep the noise of the city down
Get a dose of integrity

Every week, in every home
She's got wholesome news for the family

I believe, I believe in what she says, yes I do
I believe, I believe, at the end of the day
Her magazine 'll get me through

Ita's tongue never touches her lips
She could always be my godmother
And though the desktop hides her hips
My imagination's strong
Well, she's the sweetest thing I've ever seen
I'd like to take her out to dinner
But when I think about the places I've been
I'd probably hold my fork all wrong

Every day and every night
She's the only one we can depend upon

I believe, I believe in what she says, yes I do
I believe, I believe at the end of the day
Her magazine 'll get me through

To every housewife through the land
There is no-one else they can depend upon

How could I not believe what Ita tells me to?

2:12 - 2:46

Every day and every night
She's the only one we can depend upon
How could I not believe what Ita tells me to?
Well, how could I not believe what Ita tells me to?

How could I not believe what Ita tells me to?
How could I not believe what Ita tells me to?

Yes it's true
What Ita tells me toEmbed
