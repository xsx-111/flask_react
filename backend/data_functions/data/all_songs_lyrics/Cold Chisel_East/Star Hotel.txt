Star Hotel LyricsAll last night we were learning
Drank our cheques by the bar
Somewhere bridges were burning
As the walls came down at the Star
Squadcars fanned the insanity
Newsteams fought through the crowd
Spent last night under custody
And the sun found me on the road
At the Star Hotel
At the Star Hotel
They better listen cause we're ringin' a bell
Ain't no deals, we got nothing to sell
Just a taste of things to come at the Star Hotel
(Here lies a local culture
Most nights were good, some were bad
Between school and a shifting future
It was most of all we had)
Those in charge are getting crazier
Job queues grow through the land
An uncontrolled Youth in Asia
Gonna make those fools understandEmbed
