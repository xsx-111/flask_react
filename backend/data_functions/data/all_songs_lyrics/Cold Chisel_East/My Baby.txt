My Baby Lyrics
My baby
My baby
My baby, yeah

I know this little girl she's quite a picture
I do my very best, oh boy, to keep her
She's got what it takes to warm my soul

Well, maybe it's the way she wears no makeup
And doesn't think she's got the legs that shape up
She can't rock, but boy, she can roll, oh

I know I got
My baby
My baby
My baby, yeah

She's all that I need
Hanging around
She's all that I want
She makes my world feel good to me
We turn on in the most peculiar places
Many people turn with bowed red faces
We don't care what they think all the same

'Cause I know I got
My baby
My baby
My baby, now
Yeah

Yeah, yeah

She's all that I need
Hanging around
She's all that I want
She makes my world feel good to me

I got this little girl she's quite a picture
Ain't no-one anywhere ever gonna steal her
She has won my heart, I love her so
I know I got
My baby
My baby (my baby)
My baby, yeah (my baby, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh

Talkin' 'bout my baby
She's my baby
My baby now, now
Oh, oh
My baby
She's my baby
My baby, yeahEmbed
