Never Before Lyrics
Lay down your head and weep mama, lay down next to me
Till you cross the borders of sleep mama lay down next to me

I wish no words of sorrow, nor whisper words of spite
I let the darkness in your heart and melt into this night

(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it break like that
(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it feel so bad

Drink some more of my wine mama and take some more of my bread
There's a million songs to be sung, but not a word to be said

If I call on the angel of mercy, if I call on the angel of light
I'm way outta line but there ain't much time
The storm gonna break tonight

(Woh-oh)
(Woh-oh)

(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it break like that
(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it feel so bad
Yeah
Oh
Woo
Hey


Lay down your head and weep mama, lay down next to me
Till you cross the borders of sleep mama lay down next to me

Send a prayer up above to the pure white dove flying so high
I think the angel of mercy must have heard you cry

(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it break like that
(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it feel so bad

(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it break like that
(Woh-oh) never before babe, never before did it feel so bad

(Woh-oh) never before, never before
(Woh-oh) never before, never before
(Woh-oh) never before, never before
(Woh-oh) never before, never before
(Woh-oh) never before, never before
(Woh-oh) never before, never before
(Woh-oh) woh-oh-ohhEmbed
