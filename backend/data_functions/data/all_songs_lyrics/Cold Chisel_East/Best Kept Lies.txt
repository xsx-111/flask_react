Best Kept Lies Lyrics
I'm losin' myself nightly
'Cause no-one's tellin' me just where you are
You got me like a fever, and movin' like you've gone too far

You used to shine so brightly
All is fadin' now as time goes on
Just when I think I hear ya
I look around and you'll be gone
You'll be gone, oh no

You got this thing for leavin'
Just as I'm about to really know someone
I'd like to help you with your searchin'
Don't you know you're not the only one

Hangin' all alone
With your best kept lies
They say you're comin' home
Give it one more try

You let me know discretely
I ain't nothin' when you're not with me
Once I'd have to call ya
Now all that's left's a mystery
Sayin' goodbyes only
Gonna leave me wonderin' endlessly
Were you really here, or someone I am yet to see?

You got this thing for leavin'
Just as I'm about to really know someone
I'd like to help you with the search
And don't you know you're not the only one, yeah

Hangin' all alone
With your best kept lies
Say you're comin' home
Give it one more try

(Hangin' all alone)
I'm losin' myself nightly
(With your best kept lies)
'Cause no-one's tellin' me just where you are
(Say you're comin' home)
You got me like a fever, and movin' like you've got too far
(Give it one more try)
Ohh yeah
(Hangin' all alone) I'm losin' myself nightly
(With your best kept lies) I'm losin' myself nightly
(Say you're comin' home) I'm losin' myself nightly, ohh-ohEmbed
