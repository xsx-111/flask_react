Choirgirl Lyrics
Lookin' like a choirgirl
She's cryin' like a refugee
Lookin' like a choirgirl
She's cryin' like a refugee

One nurse to hold her
One nurse to wheel her down the corridors of healin'
Well I've been tryin', but she's crying like a refugee

Loves me like a sister
Loves me like an only child
Loves me like a sister
She loves me like an only child

She's my connection, yeah!
I'll hold on, and never, never, never let her down
Cause she's alone, and she loves me like an only child

Suffer little children (suffer little children)
Send that little child to me (send that little child to me)
All day the doctor (all day the doctor)
He handles his responsibility
Lookin' like a choirgirl
Cryin' like a refugee
Lookin' like a choirgirl
Cryin' like a refugee

She's my connection, yeah!
I'll hold on, and never, never, never let her down
Cause she's alone, and she's crying like a refugee

Lookin' like a choirgirl
She's cryin' like a refugee
Lookin' like a choirgirl
She's cryin' like a refugee

Yes she is!Embed
