Tumour LyricsOoh I think I'm getting a tumour
Ooh I feel the tumour coming on
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a tumour that's so hard to bear
(Give me the tumour...)
When you kiss me -
Tumour! When you hold me tight -
Tumour! - Oh yeah
All through the night
Listen to me, baby
Hear ev'ry word I say
No one could love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way
(Give me the tumour...)
When you kiss me -
Tumour! When you hold me tight -
Tumour! - Oh yeah
All through the night
Bless my soul, I love you
Take this heart away
Take these arms I never use -
Just believe in what my lips have to say
(Give me the tumour...)
When you kiss me -
Tumour! When you hold me tight -
Tumour! - Oh yeah
All through the night
(Bless my soul, I love you
Take this heart away
Take these arms I never use -
Just believe in what I have to say)
When you kiss me -
Tumour! When you hold me tight -
Tumour!
All through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I got up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right
(Give me the tumour...)
When you kiss me -
Tumour! When you hold me tight -
Tumour!
All through the night
Oh-oh-uh-oh
Oh-oh-uh-oh
