Fire LyricsFire
I bid you to burn
Fire
I bid you to learn
Burn!
You fought hard and you saved
But it's all going to burn
Got your mind, you turn around
You've been so blind
You fall behind!
Fire
I'll take you to burn
Fire
I'll take you to learn
You're gonna burn
You've been living like a little girl (mommy, moomy)
In the middle of your little world
Got your mind
You turn around
You've been so blind
You fall behind!

Fire
You fought hard and you saved
But it's all going to burn
Got your mind, you turn around
You've been so blind
You fall behind!
Fire
I'll take you to burn
Fire
I'll take you to learn
You're gonna burn
You've been living like a little girl (mommy, moomy)
In the middle of your little world
Got your mind
You turn around
You've been so blind
You fall behind!
