Run and Run LyricsGo on, get Tarzan
Go on, get Jane
Go on, get Superman
Go on, get Lois Lane
Hamburger Mary
She's got a gun
Nothing goes on all the time
And she thinks it's fun
Come on, run, run, run, run away
Come on, run away, come on
Run, run, run, run away
Come on, run away
Doorbell plays Beethoven
I open the door
Yesterday's there
And I fall on the floor
Practicing makeup
She laughs at us all
Hey, look at you
She's seen it all before
Come on, run, run, run, run away
Come on, run away, come on
Run, run, run, run away
Come on, run away, come on
Run, run, run, run away, come on
Run away, come on
Run, run, run, run away
Come on, run away
I'm having this party
So come now please
It's an open house, girl
But no games with keys
No jokes in blank humor
No lines in blank verse
It couldn't get much worse
There's heroes and villains
Ma B. and her boys
Doing the twist
Dancing with toys
I've been waiting all night
For someone like you
But you'll have to do
I've been waiting all nightEmbed
