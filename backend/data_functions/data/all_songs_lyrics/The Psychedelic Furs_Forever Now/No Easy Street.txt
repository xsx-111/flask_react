No Easy Street LyricsNine-nine-nine
The police don't come
Here on Easy Street
All the boys in their blue suits
Are lying in the heat
You got no reaction
Coming down my hall
You had no attraction
For anyone at all
All the dogs are out today
Running in the sun
Back in the litter
The morning never comes
You got no reaction
Knocking on my door
You had no attraction
For anyone at all
The day goes at the factory
I should be happy, look at me
It's definitely no Easy Street
You got no reaction
Coming through my door
You had no attraction
For anyone at all
I can see you in the plastic town
That an actor sees
I can see you stuck inside of this cage with me
You'll cry like a baby
You cry like a bird
You cry like a lady
You cry like a girl
On Easy Street
You'll cry like a baby
You cry like a bird
You cry like a lady
You cry like a girl
On Easy StreetEmbed
