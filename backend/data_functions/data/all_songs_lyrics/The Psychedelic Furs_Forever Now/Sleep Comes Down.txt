Sleep Comes Down LyricsIt's raining in my head
But no tears come down
And I'm dreaming of you
Until sleep comes around
Sleep comes down, sleep comes down
Sleep comes down, sleep comes down
The orchestra's playing
It's so very loud
And I'm biting my nails
Until sleep comes around
Sleep comes down, sleep comes down
Sleep comes down, sleep comes down
The clouds are all running
But no tears come down
And I'm thinking of you
Until sleep comes around
Sleep comes down, sleep comes down
Sleep comes down, sleep comes downEmbed
