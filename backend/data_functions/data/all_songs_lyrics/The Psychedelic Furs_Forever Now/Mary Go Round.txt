Mary Go Round LyricsPass your time away
Its' just another day
And everything you say
Was said yesterday
Won't you come with me
Be who you want to be
You'll get no sympathy
For staying home
Oh, and yeah (I'm... over you)
I want you (I'm over the moon over you)
Oh, and yes (I... sky over you)
I do (I'm over the moon over you)
Oh, and yeah (I'm... over you)
I want you (I'm over the moon over you)
Oh, and yes (I... sky over you)
I do (I'm over the moon over you)
Here isnâ€™t time of day
There is no 'what' they say
Just give yourself away
All to me
Pass your time away
Its' just another day
And everything you say
Is said yesterday
Oh, and yeah (I'm... over you)
We want you (I'm over the moon over you)
Oh, and yes (I... sky over you)
We do (I'm over the moon over you)
Oh, and yeah (I'm... over you)
We want you (I'm over the moon over you)
Oh, and yes (I... sky over you)
We do (I'm over the moon over you)Embed
