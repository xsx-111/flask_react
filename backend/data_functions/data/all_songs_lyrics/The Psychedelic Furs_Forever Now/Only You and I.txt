Only You and I LyricsYeah, I fell in love
Like all good dreamers do
Finally in anger
I gave it all to you
I never shouted it
Like we do in school
And knee-jerk negativity
Just never got me through
And Ma, she said so carefully
"You don't get a vote
This is not a five and ten
This is not a joke," she said
It's only you and only I
Bang bang
Bye bye
Now I got a love
To lose myself inside
U don't need to find a face
That I can hide behind
I never shouted it
Like we do in school
Bleed your negativity
Just never got me through
But Ma, she said so carefully
"You don't get a vote
This is not a five and ten
This is not a joke," she said
It's only you and only I
Bang bang
Bye bye
Lose yourself, lose yourself
Lose yourself, lose yourselfEmbed
