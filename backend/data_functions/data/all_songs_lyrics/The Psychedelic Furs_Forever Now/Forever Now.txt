Forever Now LyricsA banker in a tired suit is counting in his head
He's standing in your overcoat, he's lying on your bed
President Gas is tap dancing for the banker, he's a thief
He isn't very honest but he's obvious at least
You and I are walking past, yeah
Having lost our way
We don't count our money
We are giving it away
Yeah, giving it away
This policeman is just sitting down in sunglasses and dirt
Undercover now at least so nobody gets hurt
They go through this pantomime, they do it every day
They'll be back again tomorrow but they don't play for free
You and I are walking past, yeah
Having lost our way
We don't count our paper
We are giving it away
Yeah, giving it away
Doesn't this remind you of these things we've done before
Like counting all the times we've seen ourselves in other scenes
Everybody's busy listening and pulling blinds
This is all so stupid, we're just shouting "I want you"
You and I are walking past, yeah
Having lost our way
We don't count our money
We are giving it away
Yeah, giving it away
Let it stay forever now
Let it stay forever now
Let it stay forever now
Let it stay forever now1Embed
