Breathing Underwater Lyrics
I'm the blade
You're the knife
I'm the weight
You're the kite
They were right when they said
We were breathing underwater
Out of place, all the time
In a world that wasn't mine to take
I'll wait

Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

I'm the blade
You're the knife
I'm the weight
You're the kite
They were right when they said
We should never meet our heroes
When they bow at their feet, in the end, it wasn't me
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

Nights are days
We'll beat a path through the mirrored maze
I can see the end
But it hasn't happened yet
I can see the end
But it hasn't happened yet

Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?
Is this my life?
Am I breathing underwater?

Am I breathing underwater?
Am I breathing underwater?6Embed
