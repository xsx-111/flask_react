Lost Kitten Lyrics
Don't say yes if you can't say no
Victim of the system, say it isn't so
Squatted on the doorstep, swallowed all the blow
Leaving without you, can't say no
Halfway starts with happiness for me
Halfway house, lost kitten in the street
Hit me where it hurts, I'm coming home to lose
Kitten on the catwalk, high-heeled shoes
No more hot-headed Saturdays
They got it, they want it, they give it away
Tell me one thing you would never do
I was looking for a hooker when I found you

You've got my eyes, you've got my eyes
You'll never be mine, ah, but you've got my eyes

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it up
So pent up, I was coming home to you
Happy in the night time, howlin' at the moon
Sippin' on a cocktail, drinking in the loo
There's something about you I hold on to

You've got my eyes, you've got my eyes
You'll never be mine, ah, but you've got my eyes

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you're blind, I cover it up

When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it up

They got it, they want it, they give it away
They got it, they want it, they give it away
They got it, they want it, they give it away
They got it, they want it, they give it away
When you lie, I cover it up
When you hide, I cover it up
When you cry, I cover it up
When you come undone, I cover it up4Embed
