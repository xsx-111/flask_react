Speed the Collapse Lyrics
All the way from where we came
Built a mansion in a day
Distant lightning, thunder claps
Watched our neighbor's house collapse
Looked the other way
And then, the storm was overhead
All the oceans boiled and rivers bled
We auctioned off our memories
In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains
Scatter what remains

Pushed away, I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted, waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

Fate don't fail me now
And when the days that followed passed
In another mansion built to last
From our window, we could see
Only possibilities down the road and back
But then, the storm returned for more
In a comedown of revolving doors
Auctioned off our memories
In the absence of a breeze
Scatter what remains
Scatter what remains

Pushed away, I'm pulled toward
A comedown of revolving doors
Every warning we ignored
Drifting in from distant shores
The wind presents a change of course
A second reckoning of sorts
We were wasted, waiting for
A comedown of revolving doors

Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now
Fate don't fail me now1Embed
