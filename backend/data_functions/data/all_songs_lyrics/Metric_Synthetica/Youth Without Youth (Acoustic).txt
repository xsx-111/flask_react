Youth Without Youth (Acoustic) LyricsHangman, we played Rubber Soul with a razor blade
Behind the church, hiding place, it was a long joke 'til the punch line came
Can you read my mind? Read my mind
Follow along to the end of the song
Hangman, we played Double Dutch with a hand grenade
Behind the church hiding place, apathetic to the devil's face
Wear the sheriff's badge, put your toys away
They let us go saying, "Let us pray!"
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
Youth without youth
Hangman, we played hide and seek on the fire escape
Through the smoke we saw the flame, it was a long wait til the firetruck came
On the count of three, jump with me
On the count of three, 1-2, 1-2-3, go
Youth without youth
Youth without youth, go, go, go
Youth without youth
Youth without youth, go, go, go, go
Hangman, we played blind man's bluff with the 9th Brigade
Throw the brick through the windowpane
Double dutch til they stop the game, till the cops show up
Hand cuff stunned let us go but we lost one
Hangman we played blind man's bluff til they stopped the game
Youth without youth, born without time
Youth without youth, can you read my mind?
Youth without youth
Youth without youth, my, my, my mind
Youth without youth
Youth without youth, my, my, my mindEmbed
