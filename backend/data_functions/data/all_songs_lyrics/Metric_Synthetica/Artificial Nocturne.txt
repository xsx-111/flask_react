Artificial Nocturne Lyrics
I'm just as fucked up as they say
I can't fake the daytime
I found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
It's an outsider's escape for a broken heart

We hide out in the back
Like shadows in a stranger's dream
Hiding out in the back together
Hiding out in the back forever

I make all that I believe
In dreams so real
Babe, I have to take the call
Fate don't fail me now
I make all that I believe
I set myself free
So take all the time you need
And let yourself be

I'm as fucked up as they say
I can't fake the daytime
I found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
An outsider's escape for a broken heart
I'm as far gone as they say
I can't fake the daytime
I found an entrance to escape into the dark
Got false lights for the sun
It's an artificial nocturne
An outsider's escape for a broken heartEmbed
