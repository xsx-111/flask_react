Clone Lyrics
Call me out
My regret
Only makes me
Stronger yet

Nothing I've ever done right
Happened on the safe side
It's the other way
I'm missing everyone I know now

It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
I was afraid to tell you that

Back to that
Photograph
Can you clone me?
I look like everyone you know now

It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To turn it around or change my mind
It's too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
It's too late in the day
To tell me I'm off the path
We're already in the aftermath
Call me out
My regret
Only makes me
Stronger yet

It's too late in the day, too late in the day
To turn it around or change my mind
It's too late in the day
To take you on all the rides
It's too late in the day
To tell me I'm off the path
We're already in the aftermathEmbed
