The Wanderlust Lyrics
I've been sleepwalking through the railway station
Wake me up when they call my destination
Where I've been, I was bound to leave behind
All device and all disease was mine
(Oh, oh) Speeding out of reach
(Oh, oh) You're the one I had to meet

I never wanted to go home
The wanderlust will carry us on
There was nothing there for me
The wanderlust will carry us on
In a high rise on my own
I've been on the prince of highways for so long
Looking out at a mirror balcony
Wanderlust will carry us on
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
Wanderlust
I'm rolling in for a seven day weekend
Living up again to my old reputation
Can you cover me?
'Cause I got no armor
Keep on moving down the line, keep on going further
(Oh, oh) Speeding out of reach
(Oh, oh) You're the one I had to meet

I never wanted to go home
Wanderlust will carry us on
There was nothing there for me
Wanderlust will carry us on
In a high rise on my own
I've been on the prince of highways for so long
Looking out at a mirror balcony
Wanderlust will carry, carry, carry us on
I don't know where to go now, I got nowhere to hide
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be
I don't know where to go now, I got nowhere to be
Oh, wanderlust will carry us on
Walk fifty city blocks down but they always find us
Wanderlust will carry us on
Will there ever be a place for you and me?
Wanderlust will carry us on
Will there ever be a place for you and me?Embed
