Nothing but Time Lyrics
Steal once, pay twice
Advice to heed
I won't, I might
Advice to heed
Steal once, pay twice
Advice to heed
I won't, I might
Advice to heed

Steal once, pay twice
Advice to heed
I won't, I might
Advice to heed
Steal once, pay twice
Advice to heed
I won't, I might
Advice to heed

We always said that love was not enough
We're always on the move
(Advice to heed)
And even though we longed to shut it off
We could never choose
(Advice to heed)
Now we know there's nothing awaiting us
Better than the truth
(Advice to heed)
I wanted to be part of something
I've got nothing but time
So the future is mine
(Advice to heed)
I wanted to be part of something
I've got nothing but time
So the future is mine
(Advice to heed)
I wanted to be part of something
I've got nothing but time
So the future is mineEmbed
