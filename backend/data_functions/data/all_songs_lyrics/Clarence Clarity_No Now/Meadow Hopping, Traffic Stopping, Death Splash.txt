I was in Hollywood at the Witch House
With the reptiles and the Catholics
You was in Hollywood at the Witch House
With the reptiles and the Catholics
I was in Hollywood at the Witch House
With the reptiles and the Catholics
You was in Hollywood at the Witch House
With the reptiles and the Catholics
Oh, oh, and I’ll make you lap it up, up, up
Oh, oh, and I’ll make you lap it up, up, up
You got that nothing-something violence I could never know, but
You got my vengeance coming

Smooch
Hey koy koy bollie new
Kamar kayu
Kamar bollie new
Kamon eyla
Koy koy bollie new
Kamar kayu
Kamar collie new hey yeah

So I was in Hollywood at the Witch House
With the reptiles and the Catholics
You was in Hollywood at the Witch House
With the reptiles and the Catholics
Have mercy
Give me symmetry
Give me happiness
Give me sanity
Have mercy
Give me symmetry
Give me happiness
Give me clarity

Oh, oh, and I’ll make you lap it up, up, up
Oh, oh, and I’ll make you lap it up, up, up
You got that nothing-something violence I could never know, but
You got my vengeance coming
You got my vengeance coming


Oh, oh, and I’ll make you lap it up, up, up
Oh, oh, and I’ll make you lap it up, up, up
You got that nothing-something violence I could never know, but
You got my vengeance coming
I got that something-something
Judas you could never know but
You got my vengeance coming
You got my vengeance coming2Embed
