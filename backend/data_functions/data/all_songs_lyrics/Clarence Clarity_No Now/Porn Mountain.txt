Porn Mountain Lyrics
HD

I’ll give my legacy the kiss of death, watch me
Split it with a holy sister’s sledge-hammer
Because real villains never die, no
So we can do this all night, girl

So then you spin to me
“If dishonesty’s not the best policy we’re in a fix”
Untruth blinds our way
“If dishonesty’s not the best policy we’re in a fix“

Before you go, can you feel it?
Is it violent?
Ulysses starts to see me
In silence
Before you go, can you feel it?
Is it violent?
Ulysses starts to see me
In silence

HD pictures
HD sound
The High Priest of computations
Has enough of his temptations
He surfs the clouds to porn mountain
So don’t ask me what I’m thinking, please

So then you spin to me
“If dishonesty’s not the best policy we’re in a fix”
Untruth blinds our way
“If dishonesty’s not the best policy we’re in a-”

Before you go, can you feel it?
Is it violent?
Ulysses starts to see me
In silence
Before you go, can you feel it?
Is it violent?
Ulysses can’t unsee me
In silence


Before you go, can you feel it?
Is it violent?
Ulysses starts to see me
In silence
Before you go, can you feel it?
Is it violent?
Ulysses can’t unsee me
In silence
Jumping on my death bed
I won’t fear for anything
Jumping on my death bed
I won’t fear for anything

Suddenly
There’s a stabbing pain in my heart
Lights go out in my head
And it’s over
Oh, ohEmbed
