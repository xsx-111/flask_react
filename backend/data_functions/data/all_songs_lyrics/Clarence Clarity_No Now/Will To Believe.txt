Will To Believe Lyrics
Believe

Just to be seen as honey
Dripping as a pimp spunks money
Just to be cute and heartless
Flicking at a tongue-tied sonnet

(Healers) And healers (Believe in), believe in liars!
Believe in freedom
Heathens (Heathens), dreamers (Dreamers), all liars!
Believe in freedom

I changed, I flaked
Little pink petals off my back like rain
Crazed (Crazed), debased (Debased)
Gold pig peppered, strung up like game

(Healers) And healers (Believe in), believe in liars!
Believe in freedom
Heathens (Heathens), dreamers (Dreamers), all liars!
Believe in freedom
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will


And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
Ooh, 'till you get that feeling
And I will
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will

And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
Ooh, 'till you get that feeling
And I will
And the heart can’t always feel it
But the head can always dream it
And then stop dreaming, be it
And I will

Yeah
Ah, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Uh
And I will
And I will
And I will
And I will
