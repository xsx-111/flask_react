Buck-Toothed Particle Smashers Lyrics
Was it genetic?
Did you catch it?
It hadn’t bled
Until you tapped it
She’s sun bleached
And your lucks in
Whatever gets you off
Incestuous love

You didn’t know you’d get infected
Late night when you crept in
I wouldn’t advocate eugenics but--
Whatever gets you off
Incestuous love

It’s the yin and the yang
And the yang and the yin
Life without sex
Is a life without sin
We’re just buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
It’s the yin and the yang
And the yang and the yin
Life without sex
Is a life without sin
We’re just buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
Buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out


Expect I’ll get what you expected
Its benign but defected
Its the fluoride I ingested
Atoms to dust
Infinite love
I’d quit but I don’t know when to stop
When the tar in my veins begins to clot
Do I sound like I mean it?
Do you mean it?
It’s the yin and the yang
And the yang and the yin
Life without sex
Is a life without sin
We’re just buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
It’s the yin and the yang
And the yang and the yin
Life without sex
Is a life without sin
We’re just buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
Buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
Buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out

It’s whats inside the blister
A good girl and her sister
Love-pus filled confessor
It swells till it blows incestuous love
Pornstruck absolution
Please cure my confusion
I might need that infusion
Padre padre absolvo te

It’s the yin and the yang
And the yang and the yin
Life without sex
Is a life without sin
We’re just buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
It’s the yin and the yang
And the yang and the yin
Life without sex
Is a life without sin
We’re just buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
Buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out
Buck-toothed players
Playing ourselves out5Embed
