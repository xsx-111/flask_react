Off My Grid Lyrics
Talk to me, through a screen
Talk to me, like I’m real
Talk to me, like we are destiny
Waiting
Sinking

Stop me swallowing fires
I’m addicted to myself
Got vindictive desires
I’ve got off my grid
Trapped in death waves beneath the avalanche
Sinking

Slow the panic down
Watching time-lapse ghosts
And you’re watching flowers grow
And die
We’ll scatter ashes where we met you
Throw caution to wind
You have seeds with new arms
Reaching
Stop me swallowing fires
I’m addicted to myself
Got vindictive desires
I’ve got off my grid
Trapped in death waves beneath the avalanche
Sinking
Stop me swallowing fires
I’m disgusted with myself
Got vindictive desires
I’ve got off my grid
Trapped in death waves beneath the avalanche
Sinking

In the mistrust that I lost
In the loss that I trust
In the times I collapse
It drips like dust
And there’s dreams where I’m sleeping
And there’s dreams where I don’t wake up

Can't stop me swallowing fires
I’m addicted to myself
Got vindictive desires
I’ve got off my grid
I’ve got one hand on the Bible
I’ve got voices in my head
I’ve got destructive desires
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid
I fell off my grid4Embed
