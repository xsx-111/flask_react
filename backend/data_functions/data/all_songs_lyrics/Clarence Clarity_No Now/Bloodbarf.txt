Bloodbarf Lyrics
If living this without you is no good
If living this without you is no good
I’ll step through, I’ll step through a wormhole and a bloodbath in the rain, because
Living this without you is no good
If living this without you is no good
If living this without you is no good
I’ll step through, I’ll step through a wormhole and a bloodbath in the rain, because
Living this without you is no good
If living this without you is no good
If living this without you is no good
I’ll step through, I’ll step through a wormhole and a bloodbath in the rain, because
Living this without you is no good
If living this without you is no good
If living this without you is no good
I’ll step through, I’ll step through a wormhole and a bloodbath in the rain, because
Living this without you is no good1Embed
