Alive in the Septic Tank Lyrics
I’ll be your hired gun
The lump between your lungs
I’ll be that hunk of moulded plastic
In Egyptian sun and

I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear

Beyond Mount Zion lies
A Southmere Lake high-rise
Where I wrote ten zillion words of Shakespeare
As they hit my white eyes

I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear
I’m in the falling rain
I’m in your early grave
I’m in the shit between where
Hell and Heaven look the same
I’m on the highest plane
I’ve died a thousand ways
I hang in limbo ’cause your
Saviour looked the other way
Preach

As mortals we can try
And oh good Lord you’ll try
But you can’t ever offend everyone
All at the same time

I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope

I’m in the falling rain
I’m in your early grave
I’m in the shit between where
Hell and Heaven look the same
I’m on the highest plane
I’ve died a thousand ways
I hang in limbo ’cause your
Saviour looked the other way
We all look the same
And we all judge the same
And we are bound to wind up lovers
’Cause we look the same
And we all fuck the same
And we’ll all die the same
And in this finite cosmos
Best believe me when I say:
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope
I am fear
I am hope3Embed
