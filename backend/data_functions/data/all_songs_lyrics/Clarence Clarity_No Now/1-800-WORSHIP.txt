1-800-WORSHIP Lyrics
Hello

My missing fortune must be holed up at the end of time
The slowest tortures kick my thoughts into another line
But if your teachings juxtapose with prose from other rhymes
We’ll write our contradictions, you’ve got yours and good Lord I’ve got mine

But I’ve read a few things about it
So forgive me if I sound sincere
But I’m circling my own self doubt
And I’ll shout when I get the fear

Help me to remember, help me to remorse
Help me to remember, help me to reform
'Cause this won’t do, this won’t do, this won’t do, ever
So help me to help you

Unsung Zen Masters drop like flies blinded in their own light
Unearth my secrets, and I’ll preach it like my second lightning strike

Now I’ve learnt a few things about this
Now she’s harbouring a lump for love
My waters are clear, but I’m
Swimming in a back-stream, choked by fear
Help me to remember, help me to remorse
Help me to remember, help me to reform
'Cause this won’t do, this won’t do, this won’t do, ever
So help me to help you
Help me to remember, help me to remorse
Help me to remember, help me to reform
'Cause this won’t do, this won’t do, this won’t do, ever
So help me to help you


Help me to remember, help me to remorse
Help me to remember, help me to reform
'Cause this won’t do, this won’t do, this won’t do, ever
So help me to help you
Help me to remember, help me to remorse
Help me to remember, help me to reform
'Cause this won’t do, this won’t do, this won’t do, ever
So help me to help you

Help me, help you
Help me, help you
Help me, help you
Help me, help you
Help, help me, help you
Help me, help you
Help me, help you
Help me, help you3Embed
