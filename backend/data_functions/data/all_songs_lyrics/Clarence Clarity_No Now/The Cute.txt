The cute
The cute
The cute
The cute
The cute

I’m channeling a tunnel vision, I panic in a c-collision
I stutter in-in d-d-decision, lie about a premonition
What?
I’m channeling a tunnel vision (Uh)
I panic in a c-collision (What)
I stutter in in-d-d-decision (Yeah)
Lie about a premonition (What, what, what)

What you see ain’t what you got
I got the block, can’t join the dots
Changing colours with my mind
Been too long, gone colourblind
What you see ain’t what you got
I got the block, can’t join the dots
Changing colours with my mind
Been too long, gone colourblind
What you see ain’t-
The cute
The cute
The cute
The cute
The cute

What you see ain’t what you got
What you see ain’t what you got
What you see ain’t what you got
What you see ain’t what you-

Not on my watch
Not on my watch
Not on my-
Not on my watch
Not on my watch
Not on my-
Not on my watch
Not on my watch
Not on my watchEmbed
