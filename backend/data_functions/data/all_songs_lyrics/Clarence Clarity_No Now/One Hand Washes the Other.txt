One Hand Washes the Other Lyrics
One hand washes the other

Conceived and achieved, and I’m bleached and I’m clean
And I eat the spleen fed back to me
I gleam and succeed in-between white sheets
In a dream where I lie next to me
I could bleed, emphysema
Got both feet in a swollen fever
Hear no evil, see no evil
But I could flee and I bleed for you

When you clap, I do it, and I can step into it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it, but if I stop a minute
You’ll ask me to lose
When you clap, I do it, and I can step into it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it, but if I stop a minute
You’ll ask me to lose

With my sides in a vice, I’m concise and contrived
And my imperfections run to me
And there’s flies in a pile, where my hopes go to die
Hear my plier-plucked insecurities
You’re looking godly next to me
You’re looking godly next to me
You’re looking godly next to me
Pull and set us free
When you clap, I do it, and I can step into it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it, but if I stop a minute
You’ll ask me to lose
When you clap, I do it, and I can step into it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it, but if I stop a minute
You’ll ask me to lose

I was born in love
With everything
Exhausted empathy
I got bored
There’s a truth in apathy
Isolated entropy
Let’s get bored
Let’s get born
And feed the sickle down our throats

When you clap, I do it, and I can step into it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it, but if I stop a minute
You’ll ask me to lose
When you clap, I do it, and I can step into it
When you ask me to move you
When you clap, I do it, but if I stop a minute
You’ll ask me to loseEmbed
