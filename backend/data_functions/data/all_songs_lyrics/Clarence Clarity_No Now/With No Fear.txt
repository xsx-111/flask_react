With No Fear Lyrics
Drip like summer rain
Streaming, it beckons me home again
And I’ll leave my faith wide open
Just return me to the sea
They call it Key West
But honest to God, they don’t know my name
I could be anyone or anywhere
As I fade into the tide, it never ends

And with no fear, no
With no fear, no
With no fear, no
With no fear, no
Leave me be where I lie

Am I heavenly?
I promised to call you, but like hell I did
Now that summer rain
Will kill you
And all in its path
Will never learn

And with no fear, no
With no fear, no
With no fear, no
With no fear, no
Leave me be where I lie
For all the hits I swerved round-

For all the loves I walked out on
Leave me be where I lie
Your perfect fit, my imperfect fears
So we never did re-invent the wheel
Leave me be where I lie
Leave me be where I lie to die

And with no fear, no
And with no fear, no
And with no fear, no
And with no fear, no
Leave me be where I lie
