Nothing but the Shell LyricsFinally stashed away the vices
Like a shield against the coming crisis
See what drops and see what rises
Watch out for the falling prices
Ch:
Stripped away so you could hardly tell
Leaving nothing but the shell
Remember when she was a comer
Brighter but a little dumber
Something went down late last summer
I don't suppose you have her number (ch)
Never made it to the coda
The CIA destroyed the folder
Brighter but a little older
A teleprompter and a soda (ch)
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Neil Young and Crazy Horse
A victim of a bad divorce
Take a little from the source (ch)1Embed
