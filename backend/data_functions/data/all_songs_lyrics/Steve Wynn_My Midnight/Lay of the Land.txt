Lay of the Land LyricsI was the king of common sense
I guess you know my name
And then I cracked and you know the rest
It's don't do this
And don't do that
And can't you keep it
Down in the valley
Down with the lay of the land
It smells so bad, it's dark in here
Six by nine by twelve
And nothing left to chance in here (ch)
And then one day I'll rise above
Where the angels sing
Ride around with wings all day (ch)Embed
