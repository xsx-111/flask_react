The Mask of Shame LyricsHello endless night
Hello darkness and pain
I've come to blot out the night
I've come to see you again
Ch:
Broken by my own promise
Haunted by my own name
Hiding from the world
Wearing the mask of shame
I played the '21'
I played the gambling wheel
I guess I had my fun
I guess I made a few deals
Broken my own promise
Cornered by my own game
Hiding from the world
Wearing the mask of shame
The children hold their ground
And stare from across the way
The mothers say 'mark my words
Or you'll end up like him someday' (ch)Embed
