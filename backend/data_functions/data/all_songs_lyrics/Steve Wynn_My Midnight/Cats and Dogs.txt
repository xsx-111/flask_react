Cats and Dogs LyricsI don't know
Where does it go
What's left to show
I don't know
I don't mind
There's nothing to find
No kind of sign
I don't mind
I know they say the evidence is real
Anyway it's not the way I feel
It's no big deal
Cats and dogs
Cats and dogs
Cats and dogs
Cats and dogs
Are you sad
To feel you've been
Is it so bad
Are you sad
All of the fears
And all of the tears
And then it appears
They fade into years
I know they say it fades into the night
Anyway, we fight and fight and never get it right
Cats and dogs
Cats and dogs
Cats and dogs
Cats and dogs
Don't wanna know
Where will you go
Don't wanna know
Don't wanna know
What can I say?
So many days
And then just haze
Sometimes I'm amazedEmbed
