My Midnight LyricsMy midnight's never just and never fair
It haunts me like a ghost when it's not there
Andwhen I think I've learned to know its call
My midnight shakes me down to nothing at all
My midnight's never late and always slow
A smile and a nod and it's time to go
And when I start to think that I'm wasting my time
My midnight strikes me down with a single chime
My midnight's never brave and never strong
It just waits patiently 'til I come along
And when I think I've found a place and a time
That's when my midnight comes and leaves me blind
My midnight laughs at me when I run away
Shades of blue and gold and white and grey
And when I see my chance and I think I can run
My midnight strikes me down before I've begun
My midnight hates me much like I hate myself
Always steps between me and someone else
And when i start to fear I'm growing too old
That's when my midnight comes and releases its hold
My midnight comes in ways I can't explain
Blotting out the sun with the wind and rain
And when I start to learn to love the night
My Midnight blinds me with its flashing lightEmbed
