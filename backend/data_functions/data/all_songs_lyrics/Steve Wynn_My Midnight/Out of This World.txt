Out of This World LyricsYou, are so hypnotic
You, so metronomic
You do something to me
You know how to play me
You can't help but slay me
You do something to me
Ch:
You take me out of this world
Oh, so high above this world
You do something to me
You have elevated
You, what God created
You do something to me
You are levitation
You are my sensation
You do something to me (ch)Embed
