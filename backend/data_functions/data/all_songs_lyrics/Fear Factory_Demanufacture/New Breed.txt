New Breed LyricsWe are the new breed, we are the future
We are the new breed, we are the future
We are immune to life itself
Cold rules are reality
We are immune to life itself
Cold rules are reality
Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten
We have control of destiny
We have control of what's to be
We have control of destiny
We have control of what's to be
Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten
New breed, new breed
New breed, new breed
We are immune to life itself
Cold rules are reality
We have control of destiny
We have control of what's to be
Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten
Born, bred, beaten
New breed, new breed
New breed, new breed
New breed, we are the new breed
New breed, we are the future
New breed, we are the new breed
New breed, we are the future
New breed
New breed
New breed
