Your Mistake LyricsWe're here to be the ones to succeed
No need for you to tell us how to be
Can't seem to find your reasons why
You tell us lies and think you're wise
Why can't you think before you sink
Why can't you see, then come to me
Tell us lies and ask us why
We hate society
And we're here to fight
I won't shake their hands
Cause they're not our friends
Won't talk to you 'cause you can't be true
You've got problems, yet you keep hiding them
You entered their gate but now it's too late
It's your mistakeEmbed
