Demanufacture LyricsDesensitized by the values of life
Maligned and despaired by government lies
Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy
Dislocated by the eyes of disdain
Abused beyond recognition
I can't cope with
The madness abounding
Blasts in my head
Of gunfire resounding
Firing relentless
Killing the senses
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
I am the thorn
In your eye
Am the thorn
In your eye
I am the thorn
In your eye
Am the thorn
In your eye
Revenge is so strong
I taste it on my tongue
My gun will be
Your angel of mercy
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
I've got no more goddamn regrets
I've got no more goddamn respect
Regret respect
Regret respect
Regret respect
Regret respect2Embed
