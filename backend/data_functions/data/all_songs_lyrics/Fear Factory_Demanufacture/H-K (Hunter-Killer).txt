H-K (Hunter-Killer) Lyrics

The conscious man is dead
And I buried him
Beneath this scarred tissue
Armored skeleton
The machine is now alive
Desensitized with open eyes
Powered by an angry mind
And is refuelled by those I despise
Despise
I've become what they detest
A delinquent survivalist
Without fear and no regrets
They fucking say

I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal

I must steal to survive
I must kill to moralize
Leaving people victimized
Fuels my angst inside
I'm your judge and your jury
You don't get an attorney
With my verdict of guilty
An execution in fury

The machine is now alive
To wreak havoc in your lives
There's no use to hold me back
I am ready to attack

I've become what they detest
A delinquent survivalist
Without fear and no regrets
They fucking say

I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
I am a criminal
