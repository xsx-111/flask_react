Body Hammer LyricsI clench my teeth and realize
My world is so near its demise
A dying sun in a poisonous sky
Stinging my eyes
Burning with contempt and conflict
As of now
I am a tool
Of severe impact
I clench my fist and visualize
The blood that is spilled is our own
I open wide my bloodshot eyes
Count the dead
A result of dysfunction
As of now
I am a tool
Of severe impact
Hammer down
Cause and effect
And create a new world
Pound, drive, swing, strike
Break down, smash down
Pound and drive, swing and strike
Break it down
I am a tool
As of now
I am a tool
Of severe impact
Hammer down
Cause and effect
And create a new world
I am a tool...
I am a tool to break down
Break it down and smash it all awayEmbed
