Dog Day Sunrise LyricsDog day sunrise
Every day of my life
I'm working on a scheme
Working overtime underground
Girls work under floors
The failures tend the moors
But once the seam is cut
They find out what is learned
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Drag your feet through hollow streets
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Valentine has shining eyes
Valentine has shining eyes
My valentine has shining eyes
Valentine has shining eyes
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Valentine has shining eyes
Valentine has shining eyes
My valentine has shining eyes
Valentine has shining eyes
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunrise
Dog day sunriseEmbed
