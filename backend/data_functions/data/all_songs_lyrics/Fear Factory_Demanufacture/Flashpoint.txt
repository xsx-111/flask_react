Flashpoint LyricsI lied
Right to your face
And I'll burn internally
In flames
In flames
In flames
In flames
Instinct
Have failed me now
Enslaved
By my mistakes
Lies sink in like gasoline
Saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty
And that will be death of me
Damned in flames
Damned in flames
Damned in flames
Damned in flames
Lies engulf me
Lies burn me
Lies purge me
Lies free me
Lies sink in like gasoline
Saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty
And that will be death of me
Damned in flames
Damned in flames
Damned in flames
Damned in flamesEmbed
