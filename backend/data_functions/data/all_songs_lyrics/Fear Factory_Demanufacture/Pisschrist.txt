Pisschrist LyricsWhere are we now?
When we are blind
Abandoned faith
You left behind
Were you betrayed?
Or did you lie?
Our common fate
Our common demise
Where is the sun?
To light the way
Along this path
Of our dismay
Look to the sky
On judgment day
A human God
That was man-made
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
And so we rise
Just to fall down
In reality
You're never found
I'm reaching out
With sealed eyes
I grab for light
Visions decried
Look to the sky
On judgment day
A human God
That was man-made
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
So we lie
Face down, arms out
Nailed to the cross of doubt
Blood runs like rain
Drowning for this world in vain
Crown of blackthorns
Human skin, ripped and torn
Crown of blackthorns
Human skin, ripped and torn
Where is your saviour now?
Where is your saviour now?
Where is your saviour now?
Where is your saviour now?Embed
