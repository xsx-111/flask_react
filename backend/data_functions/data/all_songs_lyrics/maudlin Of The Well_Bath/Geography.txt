Geography LyricsListening reveals his wounds
Voiceless, he kneels to you
Like a glinting dagger, one quick look
And he spills you
Sheets surrender you
And I expect trauma
Breath is real, anger's real
Sleep on your birthday and cry
Cry, my baby
Let me wash you
I have no ears for my lady...
Listen to me
You're called a silhouette
You're playful with a sin
But you see me
Speak, or stop, or kiss me
Your art is like your grin
It delivers meEmbed
