Heaven and Weak LyricsI am a swan's wing, bloodied at the joint
And pasted to a boy's back, like in that story
You waved to me from a mountain as I slipped away
Dimming into rust-lit winters with a burning apple branch
Who are you that darkness my shade? You burned my door down
Don't wait for me, because you're a liar
And each time you dream in colour, I'll be holding your head under
Who took my time away? I know you'll hear me now
I know you'll hear me now...You missed your way out!
I thought I had it all
When I was left in shame, I gained even more!
You will welter on your hurried path with me as a prince to the world
All the beauty that is all of Life shall walk with me
And you shall walk alone...in shame!
Dry as a bone withered and cold stuck with a dagger again behold me for I am centuries old cut on the lips by secretive men
Terror I watch you nervous slowly insert the dagger again twisting the furnace walls gripping my breast writhing in want
Smothered within your heavenly haunt cut on the lips by secretive men slowly insert the dagger againEmbed
