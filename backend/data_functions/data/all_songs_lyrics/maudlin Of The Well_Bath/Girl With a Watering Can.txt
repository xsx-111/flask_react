Girl With a Watering Can LyricsI squandered my youth for a wither'd (bitter) hour;
All I ever wanted was a simple you
Real love is dying for a phantasy
I held all of Heaven dead in my arms
And in one moment, I knew all of Hell
Nothing but a body, naked, beaten
The wreck of a soul, amidst thorns bleeding
Bitterness is all God hath created;
A proud king among the failures of dreams
I believe one love could be worth a life
For life I would have burn'd myself away--
For nothing, life hath left me burning alone
Girl, know that time leaves dust on my scars;
When the moment has pass'd, thousands will die
I will remember when ghosts were mighty
And I will laugh and catch my own tears
In a perfect garden, all flowers flourish
In this real garden, my flower knows thirst
I don't think I can lift my face to the sun again
I don't think I can look at your face again
And feel
You were my everything, and you took
It all awayEmbed
