Not Myself Lyrics
Suppose I said
I am on my best behavior
There are times
I lose my worried mind

Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

Suppose I said
Colors change for no good reason
And words will go
From poetry to prose

Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

And I, in time, will come around
I always do for you

Suppose I said
You're my saving grace
Would you want me when I'm not myself
(My grace, myself, not myself, when I'm someone else)
Wait it out while I am someone else
(When I'm someone else, when I'm someone else, when I'm not myself)
Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else5Embed
