83 Lyrics
I've these dreams I'm walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling
Hearing "Wrapped Around Your Finger" on the radio

And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

Thinking about my brother, Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother, John
But on an 18 month delay
Here I stand, 6 feet small
And smiling because I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed, oh well
And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

And most my memories have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?4Embed
