3x5 Lyrics
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s
I guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me

Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say

But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s4Embed
