Love Song for No One Lyrics
Staying home alone on a Friday
Flat on the floor looking back on old love
Or lack thereof
After all the crushes are faded
And all my wishful thinking was wrong
I'm jaded, I hate it

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here (get here)

Searching all my days just to find you
I'm not sure who I'm looking for
I'll know it when I see you
Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom
Staying up all night just to write
A love song for no one

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here, oh yeah

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

You'll be so good
You'll be so good for meEmbed
