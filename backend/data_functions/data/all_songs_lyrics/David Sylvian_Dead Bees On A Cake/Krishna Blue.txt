Krishna Blue LyricsShe's here in the snowfall
At dead of night
The mood is of courtship
The final fight
She's all that I need
All that I am
The voice of compassion inside the man
If you open the gates
The madness begins
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you back in
She's here in the lifelines
In every curve
Suspended in silence
Between each word
It's all in the way that she moves
The grace and the light that will see me through
It's coming true
She's prising the rope from my hands
The fear and the hopes that I held onto
It's coming true
Colour the river I swim back to you
Krishna blue
Waist deep in water
She starts to sing
The voice is familiar
And draws me in
She's lighting the fires
I dowsed by hand
Erasing the figure drawn in sand
You open the gates
The madness begins
I follow you down
I follow you back in
And here in the darkness
The boundary gone
The flame is alive
And burning strong
It's all in the way that she moves
The grace and the light that will see me through
It's coming true
Colour the river I swim back to you
Krishna blue
In the softest belly
And the warmest heart
In your open hands
I lay my head
In the never ending
I fall apart
In the silent forest
And the brilliant red
And through the stream of words
There comes a sound
And I listen
Child like
To her voice
Spellbound
It's all in the way that she moves
The grace and the light that will see me through
It's coming true
She's prising the rope from my hands
The fear and the hopes that I held onto
It's coming true
Colour the river I swim back to you
