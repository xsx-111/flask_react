The Shining of Things LyricsTake my word for it this never should've happened
What in the world do you think got into me?
We fire at will and as we watch the pieces shatter
We find we're closer than we've ever been
She calls my name and I come running
I have lost the voice I listened to
And in the blindness as my world stops turning
There's a sadness like I never knew
But I still see the shining of things
As the morning breaks it hardly seems to matter
I hear a shallowness in everything I say
We've played the night out in all too familiar fashion
To wear the heartache through another day
She calls my name and I come running
I have lost the voice I listened to
And there's a stillness now the rain stopped falling
There's a sadness like I never knew
But I see the shining of thingsEmbed
