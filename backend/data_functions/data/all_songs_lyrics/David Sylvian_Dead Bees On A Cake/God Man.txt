God Man LyricsWelcome to Sun State
The language of light
The energy's impulse
The loud, dark, iron
The purpose of history
The Eurasian Steppes
From threshold to threshold
Astonishment
You've misunderstood the place where you stand
God Man
From different maps
Dead bees on a cake
You're sweeping the forest
Man, it's getting late
The milkweed is growing
Through cotton grass
You borrowed the car
But you didn't ask
You've misunderstood the place where you stand
God Man
Then everything's dark
You're wrapped up
Born into brightness
You've misunderstood the place where you standEmbed
