Midnight Sun Lyrics
They've stolen the moon
The magic is gone
And there in its place
A black midnight sun
The darkness is frightening
And love is denied
They've stolen the moon
God only knows why

The stars have lost their daughter
The devil's thieves have won
And there in her place
A black midnight sun

They've stolen the moon
The magic is gone
And there in its place
A black midnight sun
The darkness is frightening
And love is denied
They've stolen the moon
God only knows why
The stars have lost their daughter
The devil's thieves have won
And there in her place
A black midnight sunEmbed
