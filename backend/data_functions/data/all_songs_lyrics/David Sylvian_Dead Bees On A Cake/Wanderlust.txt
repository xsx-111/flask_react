Wanderlust LyricsHelp me
I feel like I'm weightless
Floating right out of your hands
And there's only so much I aspire to
Taking one day at a time
And deliverance has many faces
But grace is an acquaintance of mine
Tell me how could it have happened?
You know that we're not the marrying kind
Travel light, don't think twice
We're leaving the shadows behind
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
I don't doubt it, I feel it
Help me
This waterboy's wasted
Falling right out of your sky
And there's nothing I could do without you here
Loving the state that I'm in
Between no longer and not yet
On the threshold of some brighter thing
The match was struck and I was fire
The embers of a drowning man
Tell me why won't I listen
Or acknowledge that I don't understand?
Losing light, a selfish kind
And we're out on the road again
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
I don't doubt it, I feel it
Turn the headlights on full
I want to take in it all
And let it wash over me
The bridge looked so high
From the banks that we climbed
But we climbed them so that we could be free
Give me no dreams of what the future brings
I need to know when I have gone too far
Repeated lightning strikes
Up and down the spine
They search us out wherever we are
In a world full of lies
That tug at the truth
I'm taking no sides
Now I recognise you
Wanderlust, wanderlust
It's given us this wonderful wanderlust
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wanderlust
I don't doubt it, noEmbed
