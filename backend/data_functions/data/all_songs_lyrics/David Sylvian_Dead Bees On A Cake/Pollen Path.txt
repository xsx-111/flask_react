Pollen Path LyricsWelcome me father
On the North shores of Lapland
Welcome me father
Who knows no name
Welcome me mother
The earth here is yawning
My body is shaking
For want of a flame
Down here
Got to laugh
The kickback is lightening
Drowning
Got to laugh
This whole mess is frightening
I follow the pollen path
Welcome me father
The lava is rising
Welcome me mother
And give me your name
We've drunk from this wellspring
Too long, too long
Dividing the hours
To measure the time
We've lived with this heartache
Too long, too long
Numbering
What's yours, what's mine
We've harboured this sadness
So long
Nursing a voice
To sing us our songs
Raising a voice
To sing us our songsEmbed
