Thalheim LyricsCouldn't leave you if I tried
Couldn't weather this alone
And through the darkness you still provide
The sweetest love I've ever known
Take the shadow from the road I walk upon
Be my sunshine, sunshine
And in the emptiness
You look and find someone
The damage is undone
And love has made you strong
And heaven gave me mine, Thalheim
The saddest words have come undone
Changing the very air I breathe
And miracles have just begun
In which only you and I believe
Take the shadow from the road I walk upon
Be my sunshine, sunshine
And in the weightlessness
You look and find someone
The damage is undone
And love has made you strong
Heaven gave me mine, Thalheim
When I'm all the sea
You never let me down
I'll just keep coming back to you
â€˜Til I walk on solid ground
From the foothills to the mountains
On the waters of the Rhine
Face to face in Shahbagh gardens
In communion, out of time
Thalheim, Thalheim
From the lilies of the valley
To the grapes upon the vine
The well of speculation
Is it his or hers or mine ?
Thalheim, Thalheim
In the everything and nothing
In disharmony and rhyme
In the sound of shot and echo
Who's the victim, what's the crime ?
What's the crime ?
Be my, be my sunshine
In the keening cries of evening
Unforgotten, underlined
We slipped into the water
Out of focus, out of time1Embed
