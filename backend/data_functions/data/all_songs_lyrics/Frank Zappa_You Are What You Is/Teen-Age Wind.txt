Teen-Age Wind LyricsIt's a miserable Friday night
I'm so lonely
And nobody'll give me a ride
To the Grateful Dead concert . . . Oh rats!
I got to be free
Free as the wind
Free is the way
I got to be
Maybe I'm lost
Maybe I've sinned
I got to be
Totally free
(Par-par-par-par . . . )
Our parents don't love us
(Parents, parents . . . )
Our teachers they say
(Parents, parents . . . )
Things that are boring
(Parents, parents . . . )
So we're running away
(Parents, parents . . . )
And we will be free
(Parents, parents . . . )
And people will see
(Parents, parents . . . )
That when we are free
(Parents, parents . . . )
That's the way we should be
(PARENTS . . . )
(Parents, parents . . . FRANCE . . . )
Nothing left to do but get out the 'ol glue
(Parents, parents . . . )
(Sniff it good now . . . )
(Parents, parents . . . FRANCE . . . )
(Parents, parents . . . )
I got to be free
Free as the wind
Free is the way
I got to be
Maybe I'm lost
Maybe I've sinned
I got to be
Totally free
(Dip-dip-dip-dip . . . )
Our parents don't love us
(Dipshit, dipshit . . . )
Our teachers they say
(Dipshit, dipshit . . . )
Things that are boring
(Dipshit, dipshit . . . )
So we're running away
(Dipshit, dipshit . . . )
And we will be free
(Dipshit, dipshit . . . )
And people will see
(Dipshit, dipshit . . . )
That when we are free
(Dipshit, dipshit . . . )
That's the way we should be
(DIPSHIT . . . )
(WE MUST BE FREE!)
The glue! I can't find the glue!
(WE MUST BE FREE AS THE WIND)
If I was at the concert now, I'd be RIPPED!
(WE WERE FREE WHEN WE WERE BORN!)
I could tighten my headband for an extra rush
During Jerry's guitar solo
Then I could go to a midnite show of 200 MOTELS!
(WE WERE BORN FREE, BUT, NOW WE ARE NOT FREE ANYMORE!)
BUT WE WANNA BE FREE
"Opal, you hot little bitch!"
SO WE'RE GONNA BE FREE
"You can take this pin 'n hang it in yer ass!"
AN' WE WANNA BE FREE
"You ain't the devil!"
SO WE'RE GONNA BE FREE
"Where's my waitress?"
. . . did you know that
FREE IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR NOTHING
OR DO NOTHING
WE WANT TO BE FREE
FREE AS THE WIND
FREE IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR NOTHING
OR DO NOTHING
WE WANT TO BE FREE
FREE AS THE WIND
FREE IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR NOTHING
OR DO NOTHING
WE WANT TO BE FREE
FREE AS THE WIND
FREE IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR NOTHING
OR DO NOTHING
WE WANNA . . . YEAH
WE WANNA . . . YEAH
WE WANNA . . . YEAH
WE WANNA BE FREE
WE'RE GONNA . . . YEAH
