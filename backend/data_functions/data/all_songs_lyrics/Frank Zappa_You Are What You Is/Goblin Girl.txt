Wit de goblin
De Goblin Girl
From da mystery world
Hob-noblin
Wit de goblin
She's black 'n green
'Cause it's Halloween
Raggedy black
Is the way she dress
Little green shoes
'N her hair's a mess
On Halloween night
At de costume ball
She's a Goblin Girl
An' she can gobble it all
She's a goblin
A Goblin Girl
She's a goblin
A Goblin Girl
I been hobblin'
'Cause of the Goblin
Goblin Girl . . . Goblin Girl
Some girls like
To dress like a witch
Some girls like to dress like a queen
Best way a girl
Can dress for me
Is in a Goblin Suit
(They look so cute . . . )
When they're a goblin
There ain't a problin
When they're a goblin
I start a-wobblin'
Pink all over
Some is tan
Goblin Girls
From every land
They look good
From any which-a-way
Every Halloween
You can hear me say:
"Goblin Girl, take it away . . . "

Let me gobble tonight
(Poo-ahh! How 'bout you?)
An' it'll be awright (whooo!)
(Poo-ahh! Sweetheart . . . )

Is burning with love
And it wants you tonight
(Got nothin' fer yer honey? Poo-ahh!)

Talkin' 'bout the bad girls
(How 'bout yer . . . )
All the Goblin Girls
(Are you . . . POO-AHH!)
Talkin' 'bout the bad, bad girls
(Sweetheart)
The little Goblin Girls
(Come on, Roy, right here)
Oh, the bad girls
Some are called Doreen
(How 'bout you?)
Some are dressed in green
They're tricking your treat
But they're bad girls
They're very bad girls
(LEPRECHAUN LIGHT)
(Ay!)
They make your face look like you got scales on it
But that's okay . . 
(LEPRECHAUN LIGHT)
(POO-AHH!)
When the green light shines down
(Ay!)
On the black guys in the band
(LEPRECHAUN LIGHT)
(POO-AHH!)
Everybody in the audience
Thinks they're seeing something
That looks like it's made out of
Fish skin
(Ay!)
(LEPRECHAUN LIGHT)
(POO-AHH!)
But Coy leaves the green gels in the truss
Because he knows the guys in the front
Really enjoy looking like they have
Scales all over their body . . Embed
