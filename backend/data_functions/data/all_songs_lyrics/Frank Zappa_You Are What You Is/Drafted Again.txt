Roller skates 'n disco
It's a lot of fun
I'm too young 'n stupid
To operate a gun
LaCelia Jackson! Come on down!
I DON'T WANNA GET DRAFTED
Nancy Butterworth! Come on down!
You're the next contestants on
SOOOOO WHAT!
I DON'T WANNA GET DRAFTED
And, but, also...
I DON'T WANNA GET DRAFTED
A new car!
I DON'T WANNA GET DRAFTED
But that's not all...
My-y-y sister don't wanna get drafted
She don't wanna go
My sister don't wanna get drafted
My-y-y sister don't wanna get drafted
She don't wanna go
My sister don't wanna get drafted
Wars are really ugly
They're dirty and they're cold
I don't want nobody
To shoot me in the fox hole... fox hole
I don't wanna get drafted
I don't wanna get drafted
I don't wanna get drafted
I don't wanna get drafted
Wars are really ugly
They're dirty and they're cold
I don't want nobody
To shoot me in the fox hole ... fox hole
Aiieeeeeeeee... shot in the fox hole
Aiieeeeeeeee... shot in the fox hole
Aiieeeeeeeee... shot in the fox hole
Aiieeeeeeeee... shot in the fox hole
"Leave my nose alone, please..."Embed
