Any Downers? LyricsAnd all around
At the side of the grave
Stood Charlie's friends
Who could not save
This stupid girl
From the way she behaved
But among the mourners
And the frowners
A cry were heard . . . (aaaargh!)
ANY DOWNERS? (Oh, no!)
ANY DOWNERS? (Oh, no!)
ANY DOWNERS? (Oh, no!)
ANY DOWNERS? (Oh, no!)
No I ain't got any more
No I ain't got any more
No I ain't got any more
No I ain't got any more
Your downers is gone
They was all you could get
To ease your mind
And your deep regret
Over Charlie's mouth
So enormous 'n wet
Now all you got
Is your T.V. set
You turn it on
You watch and dream
A dream of love
On your tiny screeen
But what do you see
As you lay in bed?
It's a bald kinda girl
With a pointed head
Oh no . . 1Embed
