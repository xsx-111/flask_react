Mudd Club LyricsHey, they're really dancin'
They're on auto-destruct
On the floor
On the pipe
Bouncin' off-a the wall
Hey, the people here are really
Tearin' it up
On the side
In the back
By the front of the stage
They ain't really crazy
You can take it from me
I should know
Cause I go
Every time I'm in town
If you never tried it
Lemme straighten you out
It's the best kinda place
To unfasten yerself
MUDD CLUB
All the way downtown
MUDD CLUB
They ain't messin' around
Just turn to the left 'n look around
Because it's there somewhere
If you ain't found it, better
Hurry up
The folks down there's on auto-destruct
And so can you be too
(Fact of the matter
It's made for you...)
Try it on a Saturday 'bout four o'clock in
The mornin'
Or even on a Monday at midnight
When there's just a few of those
Fabulous Poodles
Doin' the Peppermint Twist for real
In black sack dresses with nine inch heels
And then a guy with a blue mohawk comes in
In Serious Leather...
And all the rest of whom for which
To whensonever of partially
Indeterminate
Bio-chemical degradation
Seek the path to the sudsy yellow nozzle
Of their foaming nocturnal
Parametric digital whole-wheat
Inter-faith
Geothermal terpsichorean ejectamenta
In Serious Leather...Serious Chains
Then they work the wall
'N work the floor
'N work the pipe
'N work the wall some more
In Serious Leather
In Serious Chains
In Serious Clothing
From when they come downtown
From the ruins of Studio 54
To twist 'n frugg
In an arrogant gesture
To the best of what the 20th Century has
To offer, at the
MUDD CLUB
Al Malkin's down there right now
Looking for a Virgin with nice breath...
(Why, maybe it's you...
And you don't even know it!)
Hey, they're really dancin'
They're on auto-destruct
On the floor
On the pipe
Bouncin' off-a the wall
Hey, the people here are really
Tearin' it up
On the side
In the back
By the front of the stage
They ain't really crazy
You can take it from me
I should know
Cause I go
Every time I'm in town
If you never tried it
Lemme straighten you out
It's the best kinda place
To unfasten yerself
WORK THE WALL
WORK THE FLOOR
WORK THE PIPE
IN SERIOUS PAINEmbed
