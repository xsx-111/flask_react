Harder Than Your Husband Lyrics
We must say good-bye
There's no need for you to cry
It's better that I tell you this tonight
Our affair has been quite heated
You thought I was what you needed
But the time has come, my darlin'
To set things right

I'll be harder than yer husband
To get along with
Harder than yer husband every night
I'll be harder than yer husband
Harder than yer husband
An' I don't want our love affair
To end with a fight

You been like a little angel
How you loved me
An' I appreciate the warmth of your embrace
Well, the world don't need to know
How I adored you
But the time has come, my darlin'
T' tell you this face to face
I'll be harder than yer husband
To get along with
Harder than yer husband every night
I'll be harder than yer husband
Harder than yer husband
An' I don't want our love affair
To end with a fight

So it's adios, adios, my little darlin'
(Adios my little darlin' . . . )
Keep that hankie that I gave you for when you cry
There are things that trouble me
And I'm sure that you must see
That it breaks my heart the same as yours
When we say good-bye

Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer– much, much, much
Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer– much, much, much
Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer– much, much, much
Harder than yer husband
Harder than yer–1Embed
