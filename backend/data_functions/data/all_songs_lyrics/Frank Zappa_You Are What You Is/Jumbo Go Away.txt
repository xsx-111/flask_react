Jumbo Go Away LyricsJumbo, go away
Jumbo, go away
Jumbo, go away
Jumbo leave me alone
Get your head off my bone
I wanna go home
(I'm hungry . . . )
Jumbo lighten up
Jumbo lighten up
Jumbo lighten up
Jumbo give me a break
Lighten up on my snake
That's all I can take
(Feed me!)
It seems I can't explain
The way I feel about you
(Robbie, take me to Greek Town!)
You just don't understand
You're from Kalamazoo . . 
(Blow!)
You got to realize
Our little romance deal
Will not materialize
Into a thing that you'd call REAL
(I think I have worms . . . )
Jumbo gotta go
Jumbo gotta go
Jumbo gotta go
Jumbo better get back
Or your eye will get black
When I give you a smack
(No, Denny, don't hit me!)
Jumbo don't you cry
(Boo-hoo-hoo . . . )
Jumbo don't you cry
Jumbo don't you cry
Jumbo this is goodbye
I ain't gonna lie
So wash up your pie
Wash up your pie
(There are three things that smell like fish!)
(Really, what are they?)
Wash up your pie
(One of them is fish . . . )
(Oh!)
Wash up your pie
(The other two . . . )
(What d'you mean the other two?)
Wash up your pie
(Are growing on you . . . )Embed
