Been There All The Time Lyrics
Can I fix it and still care?
Can I run and you'll be there?
Wish that I could run and hide
Juggling messages inside
Stalling, trying to buy more time

Can I be a part of you?
How to get there? What to do?
Can I get there from inside?
Of all the ways I could have tried
Can I be there all the time?

Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?
Is it all me?

Can I feel another way?
Can I bring it out to stay?
Can you capture what I've done?
Play it back so I don't run
Now I'm walking on the sun


It's not mine
Take me fine
With a smile you know
You've been there all the time
