Almost Ready Lyrics
I've been asking 'round if you were there
Asking but I'm always scared
Asking 'cause I want to care again

Come on, life
I'm almost ready
But not right
I'm almost ready

I've been wondering if the message sent
Wondering if I made a dent
Wondering what it is you meant again


Can you see me there 'cause I'm not sure?
See me 'cause I lost my nerve
See me there 'cause I feel worse again


Let me find the truth, I will attack
Find the truth, I won't go back
Find the truth, I'm way off track again


Come on, life
I'm almost ready
But not right
I'm almost ready
I'm almost ready
I'm almost readyEmbed
