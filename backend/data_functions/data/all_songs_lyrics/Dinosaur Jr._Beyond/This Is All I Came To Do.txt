This Is All I Came To Do Lyrics
Take my problems, take me any place
Take my, my, my mind as well
I've been trying like I've nothing left
It's down to you as you can tell
And it bothers me, I'm open wide
And I needed more than I had time

This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do, you know, do, you know
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do, you know, do, you know

I need much more than I had before
And give me my, my mind as well
And I've been waiting here, got nothing done
I've been lonely, you can tell
And I wanted to every day
And I wanted what she gave away
I'm afraid I'll get it

Hate to say it but you told me so
I tricked my, my mind, it's true
And I thought all 'bout what I could be
Please just tell me what to do now, do now


This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do, you know, do, you knowEmbed
