Crumble Lyrics
I got nothing where I've been
Will you bring me there again?
No one ever understands
You won't change to help them

I got lost inside a lie
With a smile you made it die
I'm not real and you know why
And I'll run to get some more, more

Can I be there all the time?
Can I stop to wonder why?
Will I crumble, will I fly?
And I've got to make it

Will I be in time to see?
Will it run all over me?
Can I fake out just to be?
You know I can't take any more, more

Held a picture yesterday
Held a picture of a moment
That I want, I want
I want, I want
You have time for me again
But you flatten me instead
Tried to hear the things you said
Like I almost had it

But I don't have it at all
And I'm sweating, trying to stall
Till I think I heard a call
I look, you're just laughing on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on

Held a picture yesterday
Held a picture of a moment
That I want, I want
I want, I wantEmbed
