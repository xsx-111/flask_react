I Got Lost Lyrics
And I know the way I feel it
All the way, all the way now
Feels the same to me but I mean it
I've been cold, I've been cold now

And I know the way and I leave it
It's been done, it's been done now
I got lost again, didn't feel it
Call me back, call me back now

And I have a place, can I keep it?
For a while, for a while now
I got lost again but I mean it
Pull me back, pull me back now

All the way, all the way now
Can we be the same again?
Can we be the same again?
Can we be the same again?
Can we be the same now?Embed
