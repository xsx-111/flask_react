Back To Your Heart Lyrics
Breathe your air, cut my teeth
Bones of a hypocrite that looks like me
Ashes stained window sill
Hong Kong dream in a dimebag world

Free your family, use your mind
Think about the valley from time to time
Bittersweet things, I've never been
Happy that we left but I would leave again for you

Back to your heart
Back to your heart
Back to your heart

You are the only one sharing some
I'll wait for you

To breathe your air, tend to me
Tell me what you want and I will try to be
Everywhere, all the time
Think about the future, let the past unwind
Cause you are the shining sun
The summer comes, I leave again for you
Back to your heart
Back to your heart
Back to your heartEmbed
