Lightning Bulb Lyrics
You know I will not leave
I'm happy left behind
Stare in disbelief
Truth can strike me blind

Truth is no one knows
How the garden grows
Be gone, mistaken weeds
That's something we don't need

You know what they would say
They'd say it all day long
Someone should strike them dead
Can't we all get along?
I'm blooming on the vine
Open up your mind

We are all outlaws under the law
Trying to find a way

Well, I don't look the part
So I don't play the role
And wave the Savior's net
Complain about my soul
I've seen a wall of death
With poison on my breath
Looming on the vine
Open like your mind
