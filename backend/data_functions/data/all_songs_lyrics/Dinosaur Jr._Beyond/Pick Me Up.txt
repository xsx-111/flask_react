Pick Me Up Lyrics
Later on, I will find you
Not too strong, not inspired

I've been holding off so long
Can't admit that I was wrong
I've been stung when I've been weak
In the end, I disappear

But I've gone
All along

Pick me up, cut me out and
I'm in luck, you're still smiling

I've been wasting all these years
Still you haven't disappeared
I've been lifted, I've been wrong
And I don't think I belong

Am I wrong
All along?
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Can't hold on, well I smile
Could I reach you all the while?
I can't stop, it's always been awfully useless
You just smile

And can I scream? Am I hurt?
I still miss you, I still burn
Can I bend to your will?
Know I need to, have to learnEmbed
