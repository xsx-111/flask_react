What If I Knew Lyrics
I go deep and wonder why I'm full of doubt
All this thinkin's stoppin' me from helping out
I can't say I wasn't warned
I've been trying but I'm torn

Is it you? Is it me? You want to, too?
Is it three? What if I knew?
If you could find another way now
If you could go back a few more days

Waiting, fading, contemplating all my love
Penetrated by the wasteland I've become
I don't wanna go through more
I don't know what to try for


Take it back, you're on the way
Take it back, you're on the way
Take it back, you're on the wayEmbed
