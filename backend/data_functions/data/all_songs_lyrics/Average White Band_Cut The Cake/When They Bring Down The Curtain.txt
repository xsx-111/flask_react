When They Bring Down The Curtain LyricsBall-Gorrie
When they bring down the curtain
Everybody's gonna think it's over
In the back of my mind I know
It's only the start of the show
When they bring down the curtain
That's when my troubles begin
When it gets to you, girl
That's the hardest part to win
Sitting here in my room backstage
With only my thoughts to keep me company
Read the script again from an empty page
Still I see your face in front of me
But I can't let this feeling take over
I've got to go out and play my part
No one else realises
I'm doing it all with an aching heart tonight
The houselights dim and the show has begun
All the lines seem to flow so easily
People laugh but I can't join the fun
All my words just echo back at me
Still I go through the motions
Tell a joke, pull a funny face
No one else has a notion
I've lost someting that I can't replace tonight
When they bring down the curtain
Everybody's gonna think it's over
In the back of my mind I know
It's only the start of the show
When they bring down the curtain
That's when my troubles begin
When it gets to you, girl
That's the hardest part to winEmbed
