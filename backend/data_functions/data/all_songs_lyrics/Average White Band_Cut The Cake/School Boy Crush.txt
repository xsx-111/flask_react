School Boy Crush Lyrics
Meet me in the playground at a quarter to four
Wait 'til everybody's long gone
There must be so many things that we could explore
Hey baby, maybe I can walk you home
Now, if it starts to rain (If it starts to rain)
We can take some shelter
I'd like to hold your little hand
My head is spinning like a helter-skelter
We'll get to know each other if we can

She said, hey - wait a minute - hold on
She said, hey - just a little bit - hold on
Whenever I try to think of what it feels like
To feel it for the first time, wasn't she such a thrill?
She said, look, boy - but don't you touch
That ain't much - it's only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret - I can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
We should take it nice and slow
If we play it cool (If we play it cool), it'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we can be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'
She said, hey - just wait a minute - hold on
She said, hey - just a little bit - hold on
Whenever I try to think of what it feels like
To feel it for the first time, isn't she such a thrill?
She said, look, boy - but don't you touch
That ain't much - it's only a school boy crush
She said, look, boy - don't you touch
That ain't much - it's only a school boy crush

A-B-C-D-E-F-G - know that you're the one for me
Only a school boy crush
Only a school boy crush
2-3-4-5-6-7 - all good children go to heaven
Only a school boy crush
Only a school boy crushEmbed
