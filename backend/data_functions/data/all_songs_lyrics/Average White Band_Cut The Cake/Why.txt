Why LyricsBall-Gorrie-Stuart
Why did love bring us together
I wonder if it was real or
Whether it was something out of time
A situation we could not explain
Could it be your love was just like
Sunshine turned to rain
Try as hard as I may, girl
I can find nothing to say, cause
Yesterday you walked right out on me
An I can't find the reason why
Still I can't decide if it was really my
Mistake that made you break away from me
All I have left is the memory
Chorus
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
You made me believe
I needed something more than what I had
Then you had to leave
And all it did was make me sad
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you
You made me believe
I needed something more than what I had
Then you had to leave
And all it did was make me sad
Why do you wanna go
Why do you wanna go and make me love you, etcEmbed
