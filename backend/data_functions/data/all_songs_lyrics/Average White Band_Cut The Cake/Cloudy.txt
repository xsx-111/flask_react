Cloudy LyricsCloudy, use to be so easy to love you
Now babe, you seem to have a million problems on your mind, at the one time
Cloudy don't you drift away, ooh
Cloudy don't you drift away
Feel like I'm losing you, slowly but surely ( slowly but surely, oh babe)
Oh baby, maybe I could be the one to help you solve, all those things
Just try all you have to do is open up that door, ooh
What are you waiting for
Cloudy don't you drift away ( don't you drift away)
Cloudy, don't you drift away, no, no
Feel like I'm losing you, slowly but surely (slowly but surely oh babe)
Oh baby, oh baby, ooh
What you trying to prove, by turning me away
Your killing my love, ooh
What we had, ooh, is it real again, is it real again,ooh
Cloudy don't you drift away ( don't you drift away)
Cloudy, don't you drift away, yeah
Feel like I'm losing you, slowly but surely (slowly but surely oh babe)
Oh baby, oh baby, yeah
Cloudy, don't you drift away, yeah
Cloudy, Oh you seem so far away
Feel like I'm losing you slowly but surely, oh baby
Cloudy, don't you drift away
Cloudy, don't you drift awayEmbed
