Look Over Yonders Wall LyricsLook over yonders wall and hand me down my walking cane
Well, I got myself a woman, yonder come your man
I'm in love with you pretty baby, you don't treat me right
You take all my money and walk the streets at night
Look over yonders wall, ah, hand me down my walking cane
Well, I got myself a woman, yonder come your man
Your man went to the wall
I know that he was rough
I don't know how many men he killed
I know he killed enough
Look over yonders wall and hand me down my walking cane
Well, I got myself a woman, yonder come your manEmbed
