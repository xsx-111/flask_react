I Got My Mojo Working Lyrics
Got my mojo working, just don't work on you
Got my mojo working, just don't work on you
I wanna love you so bad but I, don't know what to do

I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna have all you women right under my command

I got a gypsy woman, given me advice
I got a gypsy woman, given me advice
I've gotta whole lots of tricks, keeping it on ice

Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Just don't work for you


I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna have all you women right under my command
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Just don't work for you

Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Got my mojo working
Got my mojo working, Just don't work for youEmbed
