Last Night LyricsLast night I lost the best friend I ever had
Last night I lost the best friend I ever had
Well, she gone off and left me, oh, make me feel so bad
Well, it's early in the morning when my love come falling down for you
Well, it's early in the morning, baby, when my love come falling down for you
I want you to tell me, baby, tell me what are we gonna do
Well, I'll wait till tomorrow, they tell me every day brings some bottle of change
Well, I'll wait till tomorrow, they tell me every day brings some bottle of change
Well, I love you, love you baby, honey, ain't it a crying shame
Last night I lost the best friend I ever had
Last night I lost the best friend I ever had
Well, she gone off and left me, oh, make me feel so badEmbed
