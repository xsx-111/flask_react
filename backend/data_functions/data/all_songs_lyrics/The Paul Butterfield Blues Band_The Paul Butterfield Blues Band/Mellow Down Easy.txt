Mellow Down Easy LyricsYou jump, jump here
You jump, jump there
You jump, jump, jump everywhere
And you mellow down easy
Mellow down easy
You mellow down easy
But you really wanna blow your top
You shake, shake here
You shake, shake there
You shake, shake, shake everywhere
And you mellow down easy
Mellow down easy
You mellow down easy
But you really wanna blow your top
You wiggle, wiggle here
You wiggle, you wiggle there
You wiggle, wiggle, wiggle everywhere
And you mellow down easy
Mellow down easy
You mellow down easy
But you really wanna blow your top
Oh you do, goEmbed
