Mystery Train LyricsTrain I ride is sixteen coaches long
Train I ride is sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train take my baby and gone
Mystery train rolling down the track
Mystery train rolling down the track
Well, it took my baby, feel they won't be coming back
Train, train, rolling round the bend
Train, train, rolling round the bend
Well, it took my baby, feel they won't be back again
Train I ride is sixteen coaches long
Train I ride is sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train take my baby and goneEmbed
