Our Love Is Drifting LyricsOur love is drifting, baby, I can see it day by day
Our love is drifting, baby, I can see it day by day
I know you don't care now, little baby, but I let you have your way
If you leave, my baby, you know the pain won't last too long
If you leave, my baby, you know the pain won't last too long
It's not the first time little girl your old man been messed around
I love you, baby, you know I tell the whole world I do
Yes, I love you, baby, I'll tell the whole wide world I do
You know there ain't nothing, ain't nothing little girl
Yes, that I wouldn't do for you
Yes, I worked hard all my life, baby, I gave you everything I had
I worked hard all my life, baby, I gave you everything I had
It's too late, it's too late now, baby, you know our good love's gone bad1Embed
