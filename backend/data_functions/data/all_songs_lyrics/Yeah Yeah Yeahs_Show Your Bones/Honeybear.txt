Honeybear Lyrics
Turn yourself around
You weren't invited
Turn yourself around
You weren't invited
Good, good things
Happen in bad towns
Good, good things
Happen in bad towns

Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, any way you want it
Run away, run away, you want it

What, what did you do to your back?
Kept soft thoughts, cut lips, can't get 'em back
Junk, jump off, too much talk
Old hope breeds
Cold needs
Undress old keys

Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, any way you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
Gone, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all his honey, honey
Gone, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all his honey, honey
Gone, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all his honey, honey
Gone, all alone
I've got a call from the bear
Gonna take all his honey, honey

Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
Run away, any way you want it
Run away, run away, you want it
What, what, what, what1Embed
