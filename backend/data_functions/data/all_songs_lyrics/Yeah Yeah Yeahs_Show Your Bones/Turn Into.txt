Turn Into Lyrics
I know what I know
I know on the car ride down
I hear it in my head real low

Turn into
The only thing I ever
Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

I know what I know
Well, I know that girl you found
Keeps that kind of window closed

She'll turn into
The only thing you ever
Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

Can't say why I kept this from you
My, those quiet eyes become you
Leave it where it can't remind us
Turn this all around behind us, oh
Well, I know
Well, I'll fall right in to keep you out
I'd like to tell you all about it
I know what I know
I know this last time 'round
I'll hear it in my head real low

Turn into
The only thing you ever know
The only thing you ever know

I know what I know
Well, I know
Ah, yes2Embed
