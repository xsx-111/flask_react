Fancy Lyrics
I find it in an atlas
Or flipping over old news
Check what's in the trash bag

Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

Blame me for where you are
Well, tell me what I gotta lose
About to get fancy

Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
We went over it
Like a perfect fit
Didn't need eyes
Didn't need eyes
Watching from the nooks, ah
We went over it
Like a perfect fit
Didn't need eyes
Didn't need eyes
Watching from the nooks, ah

Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
Well, just another part of you
I beg your pardon, beg your pardon, beg your pardon

We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days
We read it
For three days1Embed
