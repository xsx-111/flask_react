The Sweets Lyrics
Green shadow, water weight all o-, all over me
The end will shelter me away from me
Can we meet again, meet and meet and meet and meet again?
Can you fill the can, if you can't fill me?

Who you following?
Who you starting to move like?
Who you falling for?
Who you falling for?
Whose lies?
Who you following?
Who you falling for?
This sound's on your side

Secret blue, purple, pink and green right over it
Well, hold on 'cause the coldest hasn't thawed yet
Well, if we meet again, meet and meet and meet and meet again
Can you catch the can, if you can't will it?

How will you want something to hit with?
Spinning again and again and again
What's your crime?
What's your crime?
Well, how will you want?
How will she sin?
We're spinning again and again and again
What's your crime?
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your
What's your crime?
Crime, crime
What's your, what's your, what's your, what's your
What's your crime?Embed
