Rumours of Glory Lyrics
Above the dark town
After the sun's gone down
Two vapour trails cross the sky
Catching the day's last slow goodbye
Black skyline looks rich as velvet
Something is shining
Like gold but better

Rumours of glory
Rumours of glory

Smiles mixed with curses
The crowd disperses
About whom no details are known
Each one alone yet not alone
Behind the pain / fear
Etched on the faces
Something is shining
Like gold but better

Rumours of glory
Rumours of glory, glory, glory, glory
You see the extremes
Of what humans can be?
In that distance some tension's born
Energy surging like a storm
You plunge your hand in
You draw it back scorched
Beneath it's shining
Like gold but better

Rumours of glory
Rumours of glory, glory, glory, glory

Rumours of glory
Yeah
Rumours of glory
Rumours of glory
Rumours of glory
Rumours of gloryEmbed
