What About the Bond Lyrics
Disharmony
Gives way to mute helplessness
Not enough communication
Too much not expressed
It's all too easy
To let go of hope
To think there's nothing worth saving
And let it all go up in smoke

What about the the bond? (What about the bond?)
What about the mystical unity?
What about the bond (What about the bond)
Sealed in the loving presence of the Father?

Dysfunction
Of the institutions
That should give a frame to work in
Got to find our own solutions
Confusion
Pressure from all sides
Got to head right down the centre
In the love that will abide
What about the the bond? (What about the bond?)
What about the mystical unity?
What about the bond (What about the bond)
Sealed in the loving presence of the Father?

Man and a woman
Made to be one flesh
Nobody said it would be easy
But can we let go now and fail the test?
Now you could say
Life is full of moving on
But do you want the pain that's already been spent
To all be wasted? Come on!

What about the the bond? (What about the bond?)
What about the mystical unity?
What about the bond (What about the bond)
Sealed in the loving presence of the Father?

What about the bond?
What about the bond?
What about the bond?
What about the bond?
What about the bond?
What about the bond?Embed
