If You Need Me Lyrics
If you need me, why don't you call me
Said if you need me, why don't you call me
Don't wait too long when things go wrong
I'll be there, yeah, where I belong

Said if you want me, why don't you send for me?
Said if you want, want, want
All you got to do is send for me
Don't wait too long, just a pick up your phone
I'll be there
Right there, where I belong

People always told me, darling
That you didn't mean me no good
But I know deep down in my heart, I done the best I could
And one of these days, darling, it won't be long
You're going to come walking through that door
And I know in my mind these are the very words
You're going to say to me

I still love you, always thinking of you
I still love, love, love, always thinking of you
Don't wait too long when things go wrong
I'll be there, right there
Where I belongEmbed
