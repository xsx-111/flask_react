Empty Heart Lyrics
An empty heart is like an empty life
I said an empty heart is like an empty life
Well, it makes you feel like you want to cry
Like you want to cry
Like you want to cry

Well you've been my lover for a long long time
Well you've been my lover for a long long time
Well you left me all alone, and end my time
I want my love again
I want my love again
I want my love again
I want it back again

Yeah, a little stick
Yeah, a little bit darling
Take it down
Yeah, take it down
Yeah, come on back to me, baby
Come on back to me, baby
Come on back to me
And I'll show you, I'll show it
That a empty heart means a empty life
Yeah an empty heart like a empty life
Oh, it makes you feel like you want to die
Like I want to die
Like I want to die
(I want to die)
Well I want to die yeah
YeahEmbed
