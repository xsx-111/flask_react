21st Century (Digital Boy) Lyrics
I can't believe it
The way you look sometimes
Like a trampled flag on a city street, oh yeah
And I don't want it
The things you're offering me
Symbolized bar code, quick ID, oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st Century Digital Boy
I don't know how to live, but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah?

I can't explain it
The things you're saying to me
It's going ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, oh yeah

'Cause I'm a 21st Century Digital Boy
I don't know how to read, but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual
Ain't life a mystery, yeah?
Tried to tell you about No Control
But now I really don't know
And then you told me how bad you had to Suffer
Is that really all you have to offer?


See, I'm a 21st Century Digital Boy
I don't know how to read but I've got a lot of toys
My daddy's a lazy middle class intellectual
My mommy's on Valium, so ineffectual

Cat's foot, iron claw
(21st century digital boy)
Neurosurgeon, scream for more
(21st century digital boy)
Innocence raped with napalm fire
(21st century digital boy)
Everything I want, I really need

21st century schizoid boy
21st century video boy
21st century digital boy
21st century sofa boy...4Embed
