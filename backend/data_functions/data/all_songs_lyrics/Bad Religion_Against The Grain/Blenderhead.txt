Blenderhead Lyrics
Flying through a dark prismatic tunnel on a carousel
The earth is turning and you know it very well
Your mind is reeling like ten helicopters wheeling
And you're gonna hit the ceiling like a mallet on a bell

Hey, Blenderhead, they're starting to ask questions
Your transgressions are a danger flashing sign
Challenge conventions and radiate your splendor
And feel those flywheels churn your blender head, yeah

Tally up the gleaming tender ventured on a wishing well
Each shining trinket has a story it can tell
Your moments pining like those tales all intertwining
Can become the rusted lining of a deep neglected shell

Hey, Blenderhead, you ask so many questions
Your confusion's a life-affirming sign
Break from tradition and carry on with valor
And feel those flywheels churn your blender head, yeah1Embed
