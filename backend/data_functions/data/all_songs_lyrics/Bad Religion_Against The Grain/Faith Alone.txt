Faith Alone Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

Heard a sermon from a creaky pulpit with no one in the nave
I paid a visit to the synagogue and I left there feeling blame
No one could tell me what to do
They had not the capacity to answer me

What the world needs now
Is some answers to our problems
We can't buy more time
'Cause our tender isn't valid
If your soul needs love
You can get consoled by pity
But it looks as though faith alone
Won't sustain us no more

Watched the scientists throw up their hands, conceding progress will resolve it all
Saw the manufacturers of Earth's debris ignore another Green Peace call
No one could tell me what to do
No one had the ability to answer me

What the world needs now
Is some accountability
We can't buy more time
'Cause time won't accept our money
If your soul needs love
You can always have my pity
But it looks as though faith alone
Won't sustain us no more

What the world needs now
Is some answers to our problems
We can't buy more time
'Cause our tender isn't valid
What the world needs now
Is some accountability
If your soul needs love
You can get consoled by pity
But faith alone
Won't sustain us anymore

Faith alone won't sustain us anymore
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore)
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore)
Faith alone won't sustain us anymore
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore)
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore)
Faith alone won't sustain us anymore
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore)
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore)
Faith alone won't sustain us anymore
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore)
(Faith alone won't sustain us anymore...)1Embed
