Walk Away LyricsShut off the TV and peel off those Sunday gloves
And I'll stain the clean that you've been counting
Old Mr. Fletcher passed by here today
After 40 years of toil, he just stood up and walked away
Fantastic the panic that showed in his eyes
He shrugged when I asked him about it
He said, "Young man, pay heed, you listen well to what I say
Now there comes a time for a man to walk away
Walk away, I'll be a parade
And I'll be determined that no one shall dissuade
On my way, I'll sure take some time
And burn all the bridges that I'm leaving behind
He passed by again and he was shivering from the cold
I'm not sure but I think that he was trying
He told me about the weather and something old to pay
"But tomorrow," he said, "I'm gonna surely walk away."
Walk away, I'll be a parade
And I'll be determined that no one shall dissuade
On my way, I'll take my sweet time
And burn all the bridges that I'm leaving behind
Walk away, I'll be a parade
And I'll be determined that no one shall dissuadeEmbed
