Misery and Famine Lyrics
So proud a history, replete with sanctity
Orbs in their harmony, they sing their code to me
Have you ever heard yourself, the orbit that you're in?
The terse, oppressive blanket that's instilled here by our spin

It's misery and famine, it's a force we cannot see
Misery and famine, it compels us naturally
Misery and famine, great ellipse, we bend to thee
Misery and famine, just accept your vagrancy

Others who bear no name, who feel that life's a game
My verse they will defame, we suffer all the same
They pay no regard to their position or their speed
The firmament still covers them with its malevolent seed

It's misery and famine, it's a force we cannot see
Misery and famine, it compels us naturally
Misery and famine, great ellipse, we bend to thee
Misery and famine, just accept your vagrancy

You look for meaning in things no one comprehends
You feel no affinity to the rabble we're in
Sources of inquiry have nothing to portend
They will perplex us all until the coming end
Until the coming end
A feeling of despair, hungry and full of care
We resent everywhere the fortune that we share
This earth could be a better place is a concept I condone
Given our pathetic course, our destiny is known

It's misery and famine, it's a force we cannot see
Misery and famine, it compels us naturally
Misery and famine, great ellipse, we bend to thee
Misery and famine, just accept your vagrancy

Misery and famine
Misery and famine
Misery and famine
