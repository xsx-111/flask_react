Operation Rescue Lyrics
It is an S.O.S sent out telepathically
Signs of our distress don't allow complacency
We need restoration now of our integrity and
A drastic bold reminder of our morality,

The rectifying troop is here
The ones we have needed all these years
To stop the heinous wrongdoings
And verify our moral benevolence as a people

Operation
Operation rescue
They're here to right our fall
They have heard a troubled call
Operation
Operation rescue
You may wonder where they come from
But I just wonder why they're here at all

Life ever-after it's what they're in the business for
See them brandish the key to our kingdoms door
It's pervasive, a part of, part of you and me
But not overwhelming as they wish it to be
If no one believed in fairy tales
There's nothing they could do but fail
Yet everywhere we look someone is
Trying to reassure our moral benevolence as a people

Operation
Operation rescue
They're here to right our fall
They have heard a troubled call
Operation
Operation rescue
You may wonder where they come from
But I just wonder what compels them all


Operation, operation rescue (x2)
You may wonder where they come from
But I just wonder what compels them allEmbed
