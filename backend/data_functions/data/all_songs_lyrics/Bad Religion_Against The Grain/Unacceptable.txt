Unacceptable Lyrics
Irreducible is the word for today
Plastic compounds and nuclear waste,
What the hell is the matter with the people on this planet, have we all gone insane?
The stigma of industrial progress killing us over and over again

One part per trillion, unacceptable!
One part per billion, unacceptable!
One part per million, unacceptable!
This mammoth pogrom set upon us courtesy of the U.S.A

Inexcusable are the men before our time
I'd like to kick their ass for what they left behind
Cancer-causing chemicals, ozone-depleting aerosols, we're all going to fry
So put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye

One part per trillion, unacceptable!
On part per billion, unacceptable!
One part per million, unacceptable!

(ad infinitum)
One part per trillion, unacceptable!
On part per billion, unacceptable!
One part per million, unacceptable!1Embed
