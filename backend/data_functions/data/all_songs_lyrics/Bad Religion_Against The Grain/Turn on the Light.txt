Turn on the Light Lyrics
I had a friend who kept a candle in his pocket
He used to touch it when the wind was blowing high
I guess it made him feel like he could buck the system
And when it flickered out, we laid him down to die

Turn on the light
Turn on a million blinding brilliant white incendiary lights
Yeah, a beacon in the night
I'll burn relentlessly until my juice runs dry

And I'll construct a rack of tempered beams and trusses
And equip it with just a million tiny suns
I'll install upon the roof on my compartment
And place tinfoil on my floor and on my walls

Then I'll turn on the light
Turn on a million blinding brilliant white incendiary lights
A beacon in the night
I'll burn relentlessly until my juice runs dry

And I'll burn like a roman fucking candle
Burn like a chasm in the night
Burn for a minuscule duration
Ecstatic immolation, incorrigible delight2Embed
