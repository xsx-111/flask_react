Quality or Quantity Lyrics
Offer me eternity, and I'll trade a cup of coffee and a dime, looking
For a handout on behalf of those who have so little time, but who
Wants to live on just 70 cents a day? padding your pockets doesn't
Make this a better place, "cereal and water" is a feast for some you
Say, your price-tag on existence can't cover your double face

Quality or quantity a choice you have to make

Dipping in the icing, bringing home the largest turkey from the field
Breaking all the piggy banks scooping up the booty, licking all the right holes
Bolstering the payroll, why reduce life to a dollar amount per day? and why let the
World think this is the American way? your uneaten greens are a feast
For some you say, survival and living are concepts you can't equate

Quality or quantity don't tell me they're the sameEmbed
