Entropy Lyrics
Random blobs of power expressed as that which we all disregard
Ordered states of nature on a scale which no one thinks about,
Don't speak to me of anarchy or peace of calm revolt, man
You're in a play of slow decay orchestrated by Boltzmann

It's entropy, it's not a human issue
Entropy, it's matter of course
Entropy, energy at all levels
Entropy, from it you can not divorce
And your pathetic moans of suffrage tend to lose all significance

Extinction, degradation, the natural outcome of our ordered lives
Power, motivation, temporary fixtures for which we strive
Something in our synapses assures us we're okay
But in our disequilibrium we simply cannot stay

It's entropy, it's not a human issue
Entropy, it's matter of course
Entropy, energy at all levels
Entropy, from it you can not divorce
A stolid proposition from a man unkempt as I
My affectatious nature I can't rectify
But we are out of equilibrium unnaturally
A pang of consciousness at death and then you will agree


It's entropy, it's not a human issue
Entropy, it's matter of course
Entropy, energy at all levels
Entropy, from it you can not divorce
