Get Off LyricsLascivious
It's all that I can think of
As I drag my feet searching like Diogenes
Dangerous
The adjective of the decade
And of your alluring intricacies
Yes, I see your green-screen mentality
And I feel the sting of its consequence
And I know I shouldn't but it's too much too ignore
An emotion I deplore
Every time I look at you, I just want to do it
I can clench my fist right through it
But I just want to get off
Rectilinear
The direction we've been heading
Never realizing we are on a runaway machine
Angular
The momentum that does turn us one step further on our ladder
One more turn toward the east
I realize your green-screen mentality
And I know it is shared by many more
I know it is quite impossible but I am damned to find a way
To revolve the other way
Every time I scrutinize I just say, "Screw it!"
On a ride down a blind conduit
And I just want to get off1Embed
