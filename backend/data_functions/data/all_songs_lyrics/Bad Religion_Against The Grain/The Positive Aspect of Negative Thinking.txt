The Positive Aspect of Negative Thinking LyricsLet's gather 'round the carcass of the old deflated beast
We have seen it through the accolades and rested in its lea
Syntactic is our elegance, incisive our disease
The swath endogenous of ourselves will be our quandary
We've nestled in its hollow and we've suckled at its breast
Grandiloquent in our attitude, impassioned yet inept
Frivolous gavel our design and ludicrous our threat
Excursive expeditions leave us holding less and less
So what does it mean
When we tell ourselves, "it's only for a while we've been deceived"
And it's only for a moment that the treasures of our day
Make life easier to complicate, the treasure thrown away
I'm so tired of all the fucked up minds
Of all the terrorist religions and their bullshit lies
Of all the hand-me-downs from all industrial crimes
And the weeping mothers and those who are led so blind
From the plastic protests and the hands of time
And the pursuit of mirth and all hating kindEmbed
