God Song LyricsAnd did those feet in ancient times
Trod on America's pastures of green?
And did that anthropocentric God
Wane with their thoughts and beliefs all unseen?
I don't think so
He's up there with the others laying low
Vying with those
Who you've traded your life to bless your soul
And have they told you how to think
Cleansed your mind of sepsis and autonomy?
Or have you escaped from scrutiny
And regaled yourself with depravity?
Now we all see
Religion is just synthetic frippery
Unnecessary
In our expanding global culture efficiency
And now we all fear this impasse
We have built to our future
Ever so near
And oh so austere3Embed
