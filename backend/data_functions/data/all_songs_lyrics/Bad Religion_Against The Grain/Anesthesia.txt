Anesthesia Lyrics
Everybody's talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery man
But she looks so kind and gentle it just doesn't stand to reason
I saw her right there just the other night as stately as a slot machine
When she looked my way, something mad as hell came over me

Anesthesia, Mona Lisa
I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion
I never loved you, how did you find me?
The cops will never prove complicity
Now Anna...
(1 ,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
All good children go to heaven!

I remember your face that August night when we lied about the beautiful time to come
And that crazy old man who came much too late and caused a chain reaction
I've been hanging out here for eleven long years like a church mouse wondering where the cat as gone
And looking at you now is driving me to distraction

Anesthesia, Mona Lisa
I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion
I never loved you, how did you find me?
The cops will never prove complicity
Now Anna...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to heaven!1Embed
