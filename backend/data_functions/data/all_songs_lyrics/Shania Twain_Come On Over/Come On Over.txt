Come On Over Lyrics
Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control
Take advice from someone you know, oh

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind

Make a wish, make a move
Make up your mind, you can choose
When you're up, when you're down
When you need a laugh, come around

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Be a winner, be a star
Yeah, be happy to be who you are
Got to be yourself, gotta make a plan
Got to go for it while you can

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind
Oh-oh, yeah
Uh-huh
Come on in

Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control
Take advice from someone you know, oh

Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind, yeah
(Come on over, come on in) Come on over, come on in
Come on, come on in (Oh, oh, oh)
And I say yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
No, no, no (Oh, oh, oh)
Come on over, come on in1Embed
