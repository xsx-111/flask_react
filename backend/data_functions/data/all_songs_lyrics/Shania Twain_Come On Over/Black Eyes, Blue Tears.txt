Black Eyes, Blue Tears Lyrics
Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Oh, yeah
Oh

Positively never goin' back
I won't live where things are so out of whack
No more rollin' with the punches
No more usin' or abusin'

I'd rather die standin'
Than live on my knees
Begging please, no more

Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Black eyes, all behind me
Blue tears will never find me now

Definitely found my self esteem
Finally I'm forever free to dream
No more crying in the corner
No excuses, no more bruises
I'd rather die standin'
Than live on my knees
Begging please, no more

Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Black eyes, all behind me
Blue tears will never find me now


I'd rather die standin'
Than live on my knees
Begging please, no more

Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, give me freedom
Black eyes, all behind me
Blue tears will never find me now

Oh, never find me now
It's all behind me, they'll never find me now
Find your self-esteem and be forever free to dreamEmbed
