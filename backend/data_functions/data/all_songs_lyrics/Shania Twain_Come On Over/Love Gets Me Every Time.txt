Love Gets Me Every Time Lyrics
Oww!

Life was goin' great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry
Had no worries
Staying single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered
'Til I discovered

That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it

Gone and done it (Gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)
Or the sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
I guess I, gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it

I was quite content
Just a-paying my own rent
It was my place
I needed my space
I was free to shop around
In no rush to settle down
I had it covered
'Til I discovered
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it

Gone and done it (Gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)
Or the sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
I guess I, gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it

Ah, ow
Ooh!
Hmmm, mmmm

Well, love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it

Gone and done it (Gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)
Ooh, oooh, or his sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
It's in the way he calls my name (Gone and done it)
And I know I'll never be the same (Gone and done it)
Don't cha know that...

Love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it

Woo
Thought I had it covered, uh-huh
Life was going great
Well, I gol' darn gone and done itEmbed
