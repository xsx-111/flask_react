Crumble LyricsDo not speak of withered trees, of lichen strangled coverings
And life just barely in the leaves, it will not be undone
Do not speak of what we've seen, of water choking algae
And dust where fountains used to be, it will not be undone
A wilderness unraveling, we've only just begun
Do not speak of ice retreat, of islands eaten by the sea
And industrial economy, we've only just begun
It will not be undone
Do not speak, oh do not speak, your tongue is dry your voice is weak
The time has passed for words to seek, it will not be undoneEmbed
