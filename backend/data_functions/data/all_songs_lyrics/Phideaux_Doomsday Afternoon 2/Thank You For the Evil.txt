Thank You For the Evil LyricsOver hill and over dale, the poison pollen's blowing happy trail
By the side of fetid pools they sat and talked of following the rules
It's been gutting them to know it never ends - obedience and sin
Lock down in the safety net, opiated by the television set
Remember that you had a choice, opened up your mouth and had a voice
All you need to know is what you've done, set aside a future for no one
She began to question her conditioning, she ate the apple hungrily
He was a less inclined to see his subjugation under the authorities
They know you - they know you
She became what they would say was just an agitator in the way
He'd become what was to some an enemy of the state
All we want to know is what you've done, set about the future for no one
I said all you've got to do is what you've done, set about the future for no one
By the side of all we knew
We knew
I was separated from youEmbed
