Between a Man and a Woman Lyrics
With her hand in his hand
We were both happy again
You started taking sides
They started arguing
He said it was her fault
She said it wasn't at all
But the truth lies
Somewhere in the middle

Where angels fear to tread
You go rushing in
Well, I had to tell you then
And now I'm telling you again:

Stay out of this
You must not interfere
Don't you see this is
Between a man and a woman?

Every day and night I pray
Pray that you will stay away forever
It's so hard for love to stay together
With the modern Western pressures
I don't want to say it
But I had to tell you then
And now I'm telling you again:
Stay out of this
Oh, I know you mean to help me
And I know you've good intentions
But stay out of this
This isn't your problem
Do not interfere - you are not needed here
Let the pendulum swing
Between a man and a woman
Don't you see you're in the way?
Between a man and a woman

Every day and night I pray
Let the pendulum swing
Between a man and a woman
Between a man and a woman1Embed
