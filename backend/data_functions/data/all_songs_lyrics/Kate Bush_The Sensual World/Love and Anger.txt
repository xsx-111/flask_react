Love and Anger Lyrics
It lay buried here
It lay deep inside me
It's so deep I don't think that I can speak about it
It could take me all of my life
But it would only take a moment to
Tell you what I'm feeling, but I don't know if I'm ready yet
You come walking into this room
Like you're walking into my arms
And what would I do without you?

Take away the love and the anger
And a little piece of hope holding us together
Looking for a moment that'll never happen
Living in the gap between past and future
Take away the stone and the timber
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together

If you can't tell your sister
If you can't tell a priest
'Cause it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it to anyone
Can you tell it to your heart?
Can you find it in your heart
To let go of these feelings like a bell to a southerly wind?
We could be like two strings beating
Speaking in sympathy
"What would we do without you?"
Two strings speak in sympathy
"What would we do without you?"
Take away the love and the anger
And a little piece of hope holding us together
Looking for a moment that'll never happen
Living in the gap between past and future
Take away the stone and the timber
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together
We're building a house of the future together
"What would we do without you?"

Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, if it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it
Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future
Well, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it
Don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future
Mmh, yeah
"What would we do without you?"

You might not
Not think so now
But just you wait and see
Someone will come to help you
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, mmh, mmh, yeah1Embed
