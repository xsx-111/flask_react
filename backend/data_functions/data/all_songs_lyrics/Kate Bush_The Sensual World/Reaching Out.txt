Reaching Out Lyrics
See how the child reaches out instinctively
To feel how fire will feel
See how the man reaches out instinctively
For what he cannot have

The pull and the push of it all

Reaching out for the hand
Reaching out for the hand that smacked
Reaching out for that hand to hold
Reaching out for the star
Reaching out for the star that explodes
Reaching out for Mama

See how the flower leans instinctively
Toward the light
See how the heart reaches out instinctively
For no reason but to touch

The pull and the push of it all
Reaching out for the hand
Reaching out for the hand that smacked
Reaching out for that hand to hold
Reaching out for the star
Reaching out for the star that explodes
Reaching out for Mama

Can't we see...

Reaching out for Mama2Embed
