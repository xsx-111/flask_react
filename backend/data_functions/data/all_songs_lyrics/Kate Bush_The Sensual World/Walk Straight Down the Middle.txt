Walk Straight Down the Middle Lyrics
Can't move my arms, can't move my legs
Can't say, "No," I can't say, "Yes"
Can't help myself
I need your help

We go
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do
Now we just can't move?"
We're calling out for Middle Street
We go
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do
Now we just can't move?"
We hang on to every line
And walk straight down the middle of it

Well, he thought he was gonna die, but he didn't
She thought she just couldn't cope, but she did
We thought it would be so hard, but it wasn't
It wasn't easy, though

Can't say, "Yes," I can't say, "No"
Can't begin, can't let go
Help me now
We go
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do
Now we just can't move?"
We're calling out for Middle Street
We go
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do
Now we just can't move?"
We hang on to every line
And walk straight down the middle of it

Well, he thought he was gonna die, but he didn't
She thought she could never cope, but she did
And we thought it was all over, but it wasn't
It hadn't started yet, no

Walk straight down the middle of it
Walk straight down the middle of it
We're calling out for Middle Street
We're calling out for Middle Street
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm walking straight down the middle of it1Embed
