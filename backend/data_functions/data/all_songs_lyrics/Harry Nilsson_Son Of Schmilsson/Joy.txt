Joy Lyrics
The other day I met a girl named Joy
She said come here
I'm gonna make you my joy boy
Well, things went good and things went bad
Now everytime I think of Joy
It makes me sad
It makes me... sad

The other day I met a girl named Joy
She said, Roy!
I'm gonna make you my joy boy
Well, she took me for a ride
Sort of a joy ride
Now everytime I think of Joy
I get all weird inside

Oh, Joy to the world
Was a beautiful girl
But to me, Joy meant only sorrow

Now--if you haven't got an answer
Then you haven't got a question
And if you never had a question
Then you'd never have a problem
But if you never had a problem
Well, everyone would be happy
But if everyone was happy
There'd never be a love song
Joy was a beautiful girl
But to me, Joy meant only sorrow

The other day I met a girl named Joy
She said, Come here
I wanna make you feel all clammy inside
Things went good good and things went bad
Things went good... things went bad
Good, bad, good, bad, good, bad

Joy to the world
Was a beautiful girl
But to me, Joy meant only sorrow
Oh, Joy to the world
Was a beautiful girl
But to me, Joy meant only sorrow

Joy, I know you're out there
I want you to turn on your radio and listen to my songEmbed
