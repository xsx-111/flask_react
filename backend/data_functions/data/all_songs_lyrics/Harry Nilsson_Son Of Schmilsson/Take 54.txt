Take 54 Lyrics
It was take 54
When she walked through the door
With the red light on it
I knew in a minute
If I wanted to get in it
Then I'd have to get on it

I sang my balls off for you, baby
I worked my fingers to the bone
I closed my eyes to get the high note
But when I woke up I was alone

Baby, baby come back
I need you to make a good track
Baby, baby come back
Baby, baby come back

Well I saw her today
Back in studio A
We were just gettin' started
I sang for a minute
She couldn't get in it
I felt brokenhearted
I sang my balls off for you, baby
I almost broke the microphone
I even sang the song that you wrote
But when I woke up I was alone

Oh! Baby, baby, come back
I need you to make a good track
Baby, baby come back
Baby, baby come back

High note
But when I woke up I was alone

Baby, baby come back
I need you to make a good track
Baby, baby come back
B-b-b-baby come back

Son of Schmilsson!
Huh? Hey, what's going on, man? Hey, who said that?
Harry? Is that you?
Son of Schmilsson!
Hey, that's not funny, man!
What is this, some kind of-- where did you get all those sound effects from?
RCA Records and Tapes! Mwahahahahahaha!Embed
