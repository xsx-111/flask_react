Campo de Encino LyricsIt was take 54 when she walked through the door
With the red light on it, I knew in a minute
If I wanted to get in it then I'd have to get on it
I sang my balls off for you, baby
I worked my fingers to the bone
I closed my eyes to get the high note
But when I woke up I was alone
Baby, baby come back
I need you to make a good track
Baby, baby come back
Baby, baby come back
Well, I saw her today back in studio A
We were just gettin' started
I sang for a minute, she couldn't get in it
I felt broken hearted
I sang my balls off for you, baby
I almost broke the microphone
I even sang the song that you wrote
But when I woke up I was alone
Oh, baby, baby, come back
I need you to make a good track
Baby, baby, come back
Baby, baby, come back
High note
But when I woke up I was alone
Baby, baby, come back
I need you to make a good track
Baby, baby, come back
B-b-b-baby, come backEmbed
