Ambush Lyrics
The lamp that lights the way
Is a light from yesterday
The drum which leads the way
Is a sound from yesterday

The road is filled with shadows
Of a million living leaves
Darkness all around us
And not a friend in sight

We sang a song together
To help us through the night
The song was sung with spirit
But soft, and like a choir

And as the others sang along
Our voices lifted higher
We sang until we reached the bridge
We crossed, then saw the wire
But by the time we stopped the song
The enemy opened fire
Now, we ain't gonna sing that song no more
Ain't gonna sing that song no more
Just don't pay to sing no more
Especially when you're in a war
A war

Now, this time through, we want everybody to listen to the punchline!
All right!
All right!
All right!
All right!

The song was sung with spirit
But soft and like a choir
But by the time we stopped the song
The enemy opened fire

Now, we ain't gonna sing that song no more
Ain't gonna sing that song no more
Just don't pay to sing no more
Especially when you're in a war
WarEmbed
