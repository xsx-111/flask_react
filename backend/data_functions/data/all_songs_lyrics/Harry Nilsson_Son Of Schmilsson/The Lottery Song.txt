The Lottery Song Lyrics
You could do the laundry
I'll come by on Monday
You give me the money
I will buy a ticket
On the local lottery
We could win the lottery
We could go to Vegas
And be very happy

Ooh loo loo loo loo loo
Ooh loo loo loo loo loo
Ooh loo loo loo loo loo loo
Ooh loo loo loo loo loo
Ooh loo loo loo loo loo
Ooh loo loo loo loo loo loo

I could be a plumber
We could wait till summer
We could save our money
Have a fine vacation
We could buy a trailer
If we bought a trailer
We could go to Vegas
And be very happy
Ooh loo loo loo loo if life is just a gamble
Gamble if you want to win
Ooh loo loo loo loo life can be so easy
Let the wheel of fortune spin

We could make a record
Sell a lot of copies
We could play Las Vegas
And be very happy

Ooh loo loo loo loo if life is just a gamble
Gamble if you want to win
Ooh loo loo loo loo life can be so easy
Let the wheel of fortune spinEmbed
