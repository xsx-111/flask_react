At My Front Door Lyrics
Long ago, far away--
 Excuse me. 


Crazy little momma come a-knockin'
Come a-knockin' at my front door-door-door
Crazy little momma come a-knockin'
Come a-knockin' at my front door
Crazy little momma come a-knock-knock-knockin'
Just like she did before

I woke up this mornin' with a feelin' of despair
Just lookin' for my baby but she wasn't there
Heard someone knockin' and much to my surprise
There stood my baby lookin' in my eyes
Crazy little momma come a-knock-knock-knockin'
Just like she did before

Yeah, if you got a little momma and you wanna keep her neat
Keep your little momma off my street
Same thing will happen like it did before
She comin' a-knock-knock-knockin' at my door
Crazy little momma come a-knock-knock-knockin'
Just like she did before
Just like she did before
Just like she did before

I woke up this mornin' with a feelin' of despair
Just lookin' for my baby but she wasn't there
Heard someone knockin' and much to my surprise
There stood my baby lookin' in my eyes
Crazy little momma come a-knock-knock-knockin'
Just like she did beforeEmbed
