The Most Beautiful World in the World Lyrics
You come to the end
And the light there is dimmer
The chances are slimmer
Of finding your way
You find that you stay out
Of trouble and danger
'Cause everything's stranger
Than it used to be

You're a scary old place out there, world
But I couldn't be happy without you
And I swear all my thoughts are about you
The most beautiful world in the world

Well, the light can be bright there
And everything right there
The end of the night there
Might be a big band
Or a heavenly choir
Or it might be the fire
But no matter what happens
I bet it's O.K
You're a scary old place out there, world
But I couldn't be happy without you
And I swear all my thoughts are about you
The most beautiful world in the world

Your mountains when you're mad
Your rivers when you're sad
And those deep blue seas
I love you for your snow
Your deserts down below
I love the way you wear your trees

The most beautiful world in the world
And though there are times when I doubt you
I just couldn't stay here without you
So when you get older
And over your shoulder
You look back to see if it's real
Tell her she's beautiful
Roll the world over
And give her a kiss
And a feel
So long, folks!
Goodbye, Harry!
See ya next album, Richard!
Bye bye!Embed
