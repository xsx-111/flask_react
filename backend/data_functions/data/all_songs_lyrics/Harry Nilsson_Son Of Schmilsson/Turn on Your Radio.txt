Turn on Your Radio Lyrics
I don't know where I'm goin'
Now that I am gone
I hope the wind that's blowin'
Helps me carry on

Turn on your radio, baby
Listen to my song
Turn on your night light, baby
Baby I'm gone

I don't know how it happened
Now that I am gone
I hope I never hear it, baby
Just in case I'm wrong

Turn on your record player
Listen to my song
Turn on your night light, baby
Baby I'm gone

I don't know where life's goin'
But soon it will be gone
I hope the wind that's blowin'
Helps me carry on
Turn on your radio, baby
Baby, listen to my song
Turn on your night light, baby
Baby I'm...Embed
