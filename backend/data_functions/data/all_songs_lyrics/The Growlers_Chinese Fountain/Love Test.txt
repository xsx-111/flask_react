Love Test LyricsSince I don't know how you find love in LA
They don't make 'em like they do in the country
The city moves too fast to appreciate all the time it takes for sweet loving

Listen for fate's whisper
It'll try and warn you
Telling your heart to be cautious of a lover trying to harm you
All the girls in LA look like they're fadin' away
A woman should be strong with thick legs and big arms
The stars in the sky, they put em on the street
With the bums and the tramps, that nobody needs

Listen for fate's whisper
It'll try and warn you
Telling your heart to be cautious of a lover trying to harm you

You know they say it ain't easy lovin' the same woman forever
Wish you luck on finding the good one on your heart's endeavor
Nothing is easy
Love isn't easy as it seems
You can test a woman for honesty
You can go and test her for goodness
But it's a wicked game and a crying shame
There's no way to give her a love test
Listen for fate's whisper
It'll try and warn you
Telling your heart to be cautious of a lover trying to harm you
You know they say it ain't easy lovin' the same woman forever
Wish you luck on finding the good one on your heart's endeavor
Nothing is easy
Love isn't easy as it seems3Embed
