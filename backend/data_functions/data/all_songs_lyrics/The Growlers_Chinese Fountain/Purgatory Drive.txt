Purgatory Drive LyricsBeen staring at the big hand
Waiting for the big hi-five
Only looking forward
To the Purgatory Drive
Between work and his low life
He don't want to be at home
So he drinks and takes his time
Under the fate of the road
Now he's taking a ride
Though he'd rather be dead
Lonely Sunset Drive's the only thing that's left
His memories of her won't blur
Without that little mixture
Afraid of thoughts becoming words
He don't wanna be cured
Gotta leave him alone
He's on his own
Now he's taking a ride
Though he'd rather be dead
Lonely Sunset Drive's the only thing that's left
Do you know that feeling of your heart suddenly sinking?
Love replaced with smoke, like your soul's getting choked
Now he's taking a ride
Though he'd rather be dead
Lonely Sunset Drive's the only thing that's left
Now he's taking a ride on the lonely, lonely Sunset DriveEmbed
