Dull Boy LyricsLost in the valley of malls
The kids are all eating themselves
Living on capsules and balls
Thinking that there’s nowhere else at all
Flicking a match in the sky
Turning my back on my own
Finally the bottle’s bone dry
With a message inside
That says that I’m gone
I'm a dull boy with a dead dream
Searching for a pulse in any given scene
This city’s shrinking down
I think it’s time to leave this town
Pulling out while there’s still time
Littered all my memories behind
The statues win so let them have it
Let them keep their squeaky clean
Whatever was now is in ashes
There isn’t anymore room here for me
Cause I’m a dull boy with a dead dream
Searching for a pulse in any given scene
This city’s shrinking down
I think it’s time to leave this town
Pulling out while there’s still time
Littered all my memories behind
This city’s shrinking down
I think it’s time to leave this town
Pulling out while there’s still time
Littered all my memories behindEmbed
