Big Toe Lyrics
I'm a dealer  with an infinite tab
A gentleman in some of a sense
She acts like I'm ripping up scabs
No wonder she has no friends at all

She's a lost cause so count your losses

How's I supposed to know she'd ruin me?
Beauty strong enough to trick me
Quick clouds a storm so moody
Got me looking around in the Forbidden City

She's the coldest, she's turning me silver
She's got me on the bridge looking down at the old cold river

She can hex like a crow
She howls harder than the wind can blow
Her love so uncomfortable
She strikes down like a hammer on your,  big toe

She's a lost cause so count your losses
Wasting her window of beauty
The only thing she has to offer
The grace of her face is a terrible waste, behind it something awful

She's a lost cause so count your losses

She's a cold bitch, she's turning me silver
She's got me on the bridge looking down at the old cold river2Embed
