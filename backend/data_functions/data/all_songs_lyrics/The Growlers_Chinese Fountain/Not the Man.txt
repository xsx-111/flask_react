Not the Man Lyrics
Can I ever get tired of asking for things
Well everybody else does
I'm not the only one suffering
But I wish I was
All they want is a pat on the back
For putting up with me for so long
So many imaginary reasons
For treating everybody so wrong

Stringing them along
Could I have been more wrong

When my friends are no longer around
Reality won't hold me
All of my buddies feel run down
I'm not the man I used to be

Somebody please help me get a grip
Before it's too late
The smoke's revealed a glimpse of the cliff
And the floor is slipping away
And I can't blame it on the match
Doesn't have to act tough
Cause there ain't no reason to act
If I lose everybody I love
Stringing them along
Could I have been more wrong

When my friends are no longer around
Reality won't hold me
All of my buddies feel run down
I'm not the man I used to be

When my friends are no longer around
Reality won't hold me
All of my buddies feel run down
I'm not the man I used to be
When my friends are no longer around
Reality won't hold me
All of my buddies feel run down
I'm not the man I used to be1Embed
