Rare Hearts LyricsCould be under an old oak tree
Over the canyon so wild
All I see is her obsidian eyes
They black out all of my sight
So give the stars to the lonely city
Give the ocean to the country
Ain’t seen anything so pretty
As the girl who gives me all her loving
Been so since the beginning
She stopped my world from spinning

Is it too much to dream
That we can forever be
Rare hearts that never disagree

Is it too much to dream
That we can forever be
Rare hearts that never disagree
In case this is just a dream
I let my tired eyes loose
Lord help me float downstream
Sliding down the river of fools
So let our rare hearts float together
And disappear into the night
Live or die in here forever
Lost in obsidian eyes
Where I don’t care about living
So let the world start spinning

Is it too much to dream
That we can forever be
Rare hearts that never disagree

Is it too much to dream
That we can forever be
Rare hearts that never disagree

Is it too much to dream
That we can forever be
Rare hearts that never disagree
Is it too much to dream
That we can forever be
Rare hearts that never
Rare hearts that never
Rare hearts that never disagree1Embed
