Good Advice Lyrics
You think that you know more
About being, being lonely
But I get so lonely
No one’s allowed to hold me, hold me

Funny I can’t help me
I know that that sounds ugly

Throw me a bone
Gimme, gimme something I can use
Or leave me alone
If you can’t let me, let me get loose
I’m thinking too hard
Or not, not at all

There’s nothing as depressing as good advice
Nobody wants to hear how to live their life
There’s nothing as depressing as good advice
Nobody wants to hear how to live their life
You think that you know more
About being, being lonely
But I get so lonely
No one’s around to hold me, hold me
Funny I can’t help me
I know that that sound’s ugly

Sleep talking letting secrets out
Blacked out and walking through the cop crowds
Laughing when the times they call for crying,
But you’re thinking too hard

There’s nothing as depressing as good advice
Nobody wants to hear how to live their life
There’s nothing as depressing as good advice
Nobody wants to hear how to live their life2Embed
