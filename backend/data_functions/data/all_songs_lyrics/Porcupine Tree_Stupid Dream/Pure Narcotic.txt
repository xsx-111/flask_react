Pure Narcotic LyricsYou keep me waiting
You keep me alone in a room full of friends
You keep me hating
You keep me listening to The Bends
No amount of pointless days
Can make this go away
You have me on my knees
You have me listless and deranged
You have me in your pocket
You have me distant and estranged
No narcotics in my brain
Can make this go away
I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that I'm not like you
I worry that I don't act the way you'd want me to
I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that I'm not like you
You find me wanting
You find me bloodless but inspired
You find me out
You find me hallucinating fire
No narcotics in my brain
Can make this go away
Have we ever been here before?
Running headlong at the floor
Leave me dreaming on a railway track
Wrap me up and send me back
I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that I'm not like you
I worry that I don't act the way you'd like me to
I'm sorry that, I'm sorry that I'm not like you2Embed
