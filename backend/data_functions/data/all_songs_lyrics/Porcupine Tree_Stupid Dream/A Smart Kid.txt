A Smart Kid LyricsStranded here on planet Earth
It's not much but it could be worse
Everything's free here, there's no crowds
Winter lasted five long years
No sun will come again, I fear
Chemical harvest was sown
And I will wait for you
Until the sky is blue
And I will wait for you
What else can I do?
A spaceship from another star
They ask me where all the people are
What can I tell them?
I tell them I'm the only one
There was a war but I must've won
Please, take me with you
And I will wait for you
Until the sky is blue
And I will wait for you
What else can I do?Embed
