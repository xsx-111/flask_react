Slave Called Shiver LyricsI need you more than you can know
And if I hurt myself, it's just for show
I found a better way to curb the pain
You put a trigger here inside my brain
Mother, I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother, I need her
And it's only the start
I may be nothing now but I will rise
I'll have more followers than Jesus Christ
Mother, I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother, I need her
And it's only the start
Through all the smashing things and crashing cars
I love the ground you walk with all my heart
Mother, I need her
I'm falling apart
Mother, I need her
And it's only the start
Mother, I need her1Embed
