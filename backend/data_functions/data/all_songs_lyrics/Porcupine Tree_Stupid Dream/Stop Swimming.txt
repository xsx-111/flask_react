Stop Swimming LyricsThis song leaks out onto the pavement
It could be a joke, it could be a statement
The more that I fake it and pretend I don't care
The more you can read into what isn't there
Maybe it's time to stop swimming
Maybe it's time to find out where I'm at
What I should do, where I should be
But no one will give me a map
I'll leave now, this can't continue
But I forget which door I came through
And I know that the lift can be painfully slow
So I think I'll leave by the window2Embed
