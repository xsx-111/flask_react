Stranger by the Minute LyricsGhosts in the park
Appear just after dark
Killers, children
But no one has a harp
They look like tourists
It makes me want to laugh
Under floorboards
It's hard to fly a kite
Underwater
My cigarettes won't light
Standing in the shade
I'm getting frostbite
Strange as I seem
I'm getting stranger by the minute
Look in my dreams
It's getting stranger by the minute
When I'm drowning
You drag me up to you
Rings in the water
My only residue
But you're just fiction
And I'm a twisted boy
Strange as I seem
I'm getting stranger by the minute
Look in my dreams
It's getting stranger by the minute
Strange as I seem
I'm getting stranger by the minute
Look in my dreams
It's getting stranger by the minute
Strange as I seem
I'm getting stranger by the minute
Look in my dreams
It's getting stranger by the minute2Embed
