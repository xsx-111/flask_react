This Is No Rehearsal LyricsHow many children
Did I bring to the world?
How many did I lose
In the shopping arcade?
This is no rehearsal
Play it back and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal
Somebody interpret this for me
Still I remember
How I dressed him this morning
And then he was gone
Stolen, my only one
This is no rehearsal
Play it back and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal
Somebody interpret this for me
This is no rehearsal
Play it back and throw things at the screen
This is no rehearsal
Somebody interpret this for me1Embed
