Baby Dream in Cellophane LyricsI am in my pram
Look, you, I'm so new
Oh, I'm sleeping there
Underneath the stairs
If you wanted to
You'd find inside my mind
Things so surreal
In the rain in cellophane, pale dogs and demigods
They won't bring me down, the clocks go round, they never stop
I've been in limousines
I've seen inside your dreams
It's raining there
Try not to stare
(Cellophane)
In the rain in cellophane, pale dogs and demigods
They won't bring me down, the clocks go round, they never stop
(Cellophane)
In the rain in cellophane, pale dogs and demigods
They won't bring me down, the clocks go round, they never stopEmbed
