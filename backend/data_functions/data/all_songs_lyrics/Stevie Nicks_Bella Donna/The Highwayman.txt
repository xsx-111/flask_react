The Highwayman Lyrics
Alas he was the highwayman
The one that comes and goes
And only the highway-woman
Keeps up with the likes of those
And she in all her magic
With hands as quick as light
Took him to be a challenge
And went into the night

And he in all his glory
Was far ahead of her
But she was never sorry
For wishes that would burn
Enter competition
She chases beneath the moon
Her horse is like a dragonfly
She is just a fool

And she wonders is this real
Or does she just want to be Queen
And he fights the way he feels
Is this the end of a dream
And then he sees her coming
Heartbeats on the wind
Considers slowing down
But then he could never win
And she out in the distance
Sees him against the sky
A pale and violent rider
A dream begun in wine

And she wonders is this real
Or does she just want to be Queen
And he fights the way he feels
Is this the end of a dream

A dream as the thunder wakes her
And her highwayman disappears
On a life already lived before
In eyes welled with tears
Today and still today they ride
Will they ever win

He the glory
She the love
And still they try again
He the glory
She the love
And still they try again
He the glory
She the love
And still they try againEmbed
