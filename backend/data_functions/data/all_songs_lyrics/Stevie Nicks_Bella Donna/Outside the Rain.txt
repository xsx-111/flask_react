Outside the Rain LyricsOutside the rain
And the heart skips a beat
Are you lonely?
Creature of the night
It's been almost a week
Could you love me only?
Look at me, for a very long time
Long enough to know
Love is a word I've been trying to find
Words don't matter
They don't matter at all
So you're still lonely
You say that it's been forever
Maybe you never knew me
Maybe you thought that
I'd never change
But you know I'm changing
You're wrong
And it's been like dying
No love's that hard to find
And I'm tired of
And I'm tired of trying
And I'm tired of trying
(It's only a dream)
Maybe it's only a dream
(It's only a dream)
I don't want to feel that
(It's only a dream)
Well it's one more link in the chain, I know
(It's only a dream)
I don't believe that
(It's only a dream)
(It's only a dream)
Outside the rain
And the heart skips a beat
So you're lonely
Creature of the night
It's been almost a week
Would you love me only?
Look in my eyes
Touch my face
Baby, there's no one
That can take my place
Look in my eyes
Touch my face
Baby, there's no one that
Can ever replace that heartache
Take away that heartache
Love is a word that some entertain
If you find it
You have won the game
Somebody said
"Outside the rain"Embed
