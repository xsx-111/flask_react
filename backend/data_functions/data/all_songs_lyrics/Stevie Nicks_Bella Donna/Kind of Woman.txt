Kind of Woman Lyrics
Temptation falls in your path
"No hesitation, why?" you ask
You have another waiting at home

And, yes, she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you

You didn't mean to meet her you cry
Oh, but the sun goes down every night
She came to you when you were alone

And, yes, she matters to you
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Oh, kind of woman that'll haunt you
She matters to you

I promised myself a long time ago
No, it would be difficult to let you go
If not at least within
The touch of my fingers
It was close to being
In heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
Heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
To being in heaven
Kind of woman that'll haunt you
To be
Heaven
I know, I know3Embed
