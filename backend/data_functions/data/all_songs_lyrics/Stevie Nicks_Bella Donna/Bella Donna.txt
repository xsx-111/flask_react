Bella Donna LyricsYou can ride high atop your pony
I know you won't fall
'Cause the whole thing's phoney
You can fly, swingin' from your trapeze
Scaring all the people
But you never scare me
Bella donna
And we fight for the northern star
No speed limit
This is the fast lane
It's just the way that it is here
And you say
"I never thought it could"
Bella donna
We fight for the northern star
And the lady's feeling
Like the moon that she loved
Don't you know that the stars are
A part of us
And the lady's feeling
Just like the moon that she loved
And you say
"I never thought it could"
Bella donna
Come in out of the darkness
You are in love with
And I'm ready to sail
It's just a feeling
Sort of captures your soul
Bella donna
And the woman may be awestruck
And the woman may truly care
But the woman is so tired
So the woman disappears
Come in out of the darkness
Bella donna, my soul
Don't change, baby, please don't change
And you say
And your face becomes thin
You never thought it could
Come in out of the darkness
Bella donna
You are a love wind
And I'm ready to sail
It's just a feeling4Embed
