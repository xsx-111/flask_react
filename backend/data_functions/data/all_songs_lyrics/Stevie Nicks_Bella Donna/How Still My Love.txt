How Still My Love Lyrics
Still the same old story
What price glory
You make it easy

In the still of the night
In the still of the night
How still my love
In the still of the night
How still my

Doing all you can for me
They say you're not the man for me
Don't make it easy

In the still of the night
In the still of the night
How still my love
In the still of the night
How still my love

Standing in the doorway
Watching out to sea
Calling out to me
You go your way
Go on, go on
But you don't forget me
Oh no, you don't forget me
Oh no, my lonely one
You're doing all you can for me
They say you're not the man for me
Don't I make it easy
In the still of the night
It's me, talking to you
How still my love

In the still of the night
How still my love
In the still of the night
It's me that's talkin' to you
In the still of the night
It's me that's talkin' to you
In the still of the night
AlwaysEmbed
