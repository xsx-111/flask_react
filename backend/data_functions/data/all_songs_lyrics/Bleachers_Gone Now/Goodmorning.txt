Goodmorning Lyrics
Woke up, I’m in the in-between honey
One foot out and I know the weight is coming
Because I left it by the bed last night
Open my eyes and I stare and pray for light (dream far away)
Always one foot out when you say goodbye to the one that you love
One dream away from the ones above
That’s such a rhythm in my life these days
So I hold on tight and I learn to behave

Because I lied to you (I lied to you)
I lied to your face in the summer (your face in the summer)
You had long hair then (you had long hair then)
(I’m coming back from the dead)

I'm singing out back:
Good morning to the cops (oh)
Good morning to my upstairs neighbor
And to the kids at 42
Anyone who lent me a favor
I wish that I could stop (oh)
Now I wish that I could live a little safer
I’m watching all of the nights go blue
Somebody lend me a favor soon (dream far away)
Woke up in the corner store, someone saying my name
Everybody moving around, acting like nothing had changed
But something had changed in me (yeah, she touched me)
Yeah, she touched me said I know you’re not to blame (dream far away)
What a weight to live under
What a lie that’s been covered
I’m talking about (I'm a comedian) rolling thunder
I know I left you on the street last night
So I’m holding on, grabbing at a light

How come I lied to you? (I lied to you)
I lied to your face in the summer (your face in the summer)
I had my hair short then (I had my hair short then)
(I’m coming back from the dead)

I'm singing out back:
Good morning to the cops (oh)
Good morning to my upstairs neighbor
And to the kids at 42
Anyone who lent me a favor
I wish that I could stop (oh)
Now I wish that I could live a little safer
I’m watching all of the nights go blue
Somebody lend me a favor soon (dream far away)
I know it's always been you
You just gotta get home soon
I'm coming for you, ooh
It's always been you
I just gotta get home soon, ooh8Embed
