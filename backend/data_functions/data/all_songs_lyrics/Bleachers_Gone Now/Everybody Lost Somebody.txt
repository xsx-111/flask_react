Everybody Lost Somebody Lyrics
The pain of waiting alone at the corner
Trying to get myself back home
I gotta get myself back home soon
I gotta get myself back home soon

I guess it's true
The only reason that I called you last night
It's the reason I been standing on a wire
It's this dream I keep having where I'm begging

Just to give myself a break (Hey)
But there's nothing I wouldn't do to wake up and remember it
I wanna wake up and remember
So take my clothes, that's better

I think pain is waiting alone at the corner
Tryna get myself back home, yeah
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody
I'm standing here in the cold and
I gotta get myself back home soon
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody
Everybody lost somebody
Everybody lost somebody
I waited 'til the night was over
Cursed the sun for coming up all over
Cashed the checks I had, I didn't own
Standing on the corner, God I wonder when

I'll give myself a break (Hey)
But there's nothing I wouldn't do to settle up with Heaven
It's a debt I gotta settle in Heaven
Take my clothes, I'm begging

I think pain is waiting alone at the corner
Tryna get myself back home, yeah
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody
I'm standing here in the cold and
I gotta get myself back home soon
Looking like everybody
Knowing everybody lost somebody

I'm lost
I know that I'm lost
Lost in a world without you
I know that I'm lost
I know that I'm lost
Lost in a world without you
And there's a reason I wake up alone in strange places
A reason I see myself in a million faces
A reason I can't stop it all from changing
So come on, motherfucker, you survive

You gotta give yourself a break (Hey)
But there's nothing I wouldn't do to settle up with Heaven
It's a debt I gotta settle in Heaven
Take my clothes, I'm begging

Everybody lost somebody
Everybody lost somebody
Everybody lost somebody
Everybody lost somebody

I gotta get myself back home soon
I gotta get myself back home soon3Embed
