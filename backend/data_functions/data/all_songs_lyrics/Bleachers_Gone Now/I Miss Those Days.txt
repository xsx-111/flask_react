I Miss Those Days Lyrics
Yeah, we talk about getting older
But there's so much we haven't done yet
Some days, I'm not here, I don't get dressed
And I curse my bedroom but I left it all alone
'Cause all this time I'm runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway, gone

And everyone is changing
And storefront's rearranging
I picked up a quarter and I just saw my face
But it's all coming back now
Like the feeling isn't over
Hey, I know I was lost but I miss those days

I said la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
Well I'm talking, la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
Yeah!

Those days when I'd sit on my sister's rooftop
Watching our city burn into the night
I'm not sure that we were meant to survive
I was sixteen in a van driving myself to Florida
Part of me never left that seat 'cause
Nights and weekends still looking for a dream
Well, everyone is changing
And the storefronts carry weight now
I'm sorry that you saw me when I lost my way
But it's all coming back, yeah
Like the feeling isn't over
Hey, I know I was lost but I miss those days

I said la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
Well I'm talking, la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days

It feels like everyone is changin'
And the storefront's rearrangin'
I picked up a quarter and I just saw my face
But it's all coming back now
Like the feeling isn't over
Hey, I know I was lost but I miss those days
I know I was lost but I miss those, come on
Hey, I know I was lost but I miss those days

I said la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
Well I'm talking, la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
Yeah
I said la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
Well I'm talking, la-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
La-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
La-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days
La-la-la-la-la-la-lost, but I miss those days3Embed
