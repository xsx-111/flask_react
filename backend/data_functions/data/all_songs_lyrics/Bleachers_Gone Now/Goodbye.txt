Goodbye Lyrics
Goodbye to the friends I've had

Goodbye, goodbye to the friends I've had
Goodbye, goodbye to my upstairs neighbor
Goodbye, goodbye to the kids downstairs and
Anybody who lent me a favor
Goodbye, goodbye to the friends I've had
Goodbye, goodbye to my upstairs neighbor
Goodbye, goodbye to the kids downstairs and
Anybody who lent me a favor

Lent me a favor
Lent me a favor
Lent me a favor
Lent me, anybody who lent me
Hmm, anybody who lent me

Goodbye to the friends I've had
(Prepare yourself)
And I finally found my stride when I walked in the background
(A radical and beautiful act, but I haven't taught myself that so I can't teach it)
Everybody used to ball with the war, with the pain
(In growing up with all these fears, and I hope you don't mind I'm just saying all this)
Got my song and I feel like giving up rainbows and crying
Everybody lost somebody, hmm
(Just all these fears and all this pain. I never trusted any of my own feelings and I just thought everything was like)
Tearing it all off and the war and the whoa-oh-whoa-oh-whoa
(Well I'm just inventing this. So I caused myself so much pain)
Two dollar singing in my song in the fan like whoa
(But now it's dignified. I needed this experience but I'm scared I don't deserve it because I didn't give my honest fears)
Only wanna rhythm in the side when I'm at your window
Every night I walk past your window
Goodbye to the friends I've had
Goodbye to my upstairs neighbor
Goodbye to the kids downstairs and
Anybody who lent me a favor
Goodbye to the friends I've had
Goodbye to my upstairs neighbor
Goodbye to the kids downstairs and
Anybody who lent me a favor

Goodbye, goodbye to the friends I've had
Goodbye, goodbye to my upstairs neighbor
Goodbye, goodbye to the kids downstairs and
Anybody who lent me a favor
Goodbye, goodbye to the friends I've had
Goodbye, goodbye to my upstairs neighbor
Goodbye, goodbye to the kids downstairs and
Anybody who lent me a favor

Lent me a favor
Lent me a favor
Lent me a favor
(Goodbye to the friends I had)
Lent me, anybody who lent me
Hmm, anybody who lent me1Embed
