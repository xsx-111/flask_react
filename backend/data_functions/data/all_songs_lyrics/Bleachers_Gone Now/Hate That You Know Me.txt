Hate That You Know Me Lyrics
I've been talking to strangers
Acting like I'm a stranger
Look like I've been up all night
And you know what? I hate it
I put my things into boxes
Carry all of my old lies
Rubber band in my past time
And you know what? I hate it

Oo-oo-ooh
Long way down
You're such a heart attack
But it feels like oo-oo-ooh
Pressure points
They pressure you right back
Come on, think about it

Sometimes I hate that you know me so well (so well)
Sometimes I, I hate that you know me so well
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself
No luck!
And I hate that you know me so well
Washed the fear from my hands off
Caught mistakes in the sidewalk
Act like I've been up all night
And you know what? I hate it
So I keep talking about eighteen
'Cause I can't let go of the same dream
Rubber band in my past time
And you know what? I hate it!

Oo-oo-ooh
Long way down
You're such a heart attack
But it feels like oo-oo-ooh
Pressure points
They pressure you right back
Come on, think about it

Sometimes I hate that you know me so well (so well)
Sometimes I, I hate that you know me so well (and I hate ya)
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (No)
No luck! (No)
And I hate that you know me so well
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well (I hate that you know me)
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (myself)
No luck! (No!)
And I hate that you know me so well
And I hate that you know me so well (yeah)
And I hate that you know me so well

Sometimes I hate that you know me so well (so well)
Sometimes I, I hate that you know me so well (and I hate ya)
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (No)
No luck! (No)
And I hate that you know me so well
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well (I hate that you know me)
Sometimes (Sometimes) I hate that you know me so well
Some days I, I wish that I wasn't myself (myself)
No luck!
And I hate that you know me so well5Embed
