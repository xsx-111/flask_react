Foreign Girls Lyrics
Gone now
Thinking what's gone now
Like a part of me walked out, oh
And I know I’ve been a stranger lately, ohh
I walk to the pawn shop
Now I’m at the pawn shop
Got you a ring and a wristwatch, oh
'Cause I know I’ve been a stranger lately, yeahh

I’ve been walking circles
Lost on Sunday morning
Tryna find my way back home
‘Cause I know I’ve been a stranger lately
I’ve been a stranger lately
I know I’ve been a stranger lately
Everybody passing
Can’t make out their faces
Tryna find a way back home
‘Cause I know I’ve been a stranger lately
I’ve been a stranger lately
I know I’ve been a stranger lately

We’re gonna fight tonight
We’re gonna fight tonight, oh
But you can be a stranger sometimes, yeahh
You, know, you know it’s true
I’m at the carwash
Oh, I’m at the carwash
Gonna get cleaned off, oh
‘Cause I've been so wasted lately, ohh
I’ve been walking circles
Lost on Sunday morning
Tryna find my way back home
‘Cause I know I’ve been a stranger lately
I’ve been a stranger lately
I know I’ve been a stranger lately
Everybody passing
Can’t make out their faces
Tryna find a way back home
‘Cause I know I’ve been a stranger lately
I’ve been a stranger lately
I know I’ve been a stranger lately

Goodbye to the friends I had
Goodbye to my upstairs neighbor
Goodbye to the dream downstairs and
Anybody who lent me a favor
Goodbye to the way we talk
Goodbye to the things we bought, yeah
You should know that
I loved you all
I loved you all
I loved you all
I loved you all
I loved you all
I loved you all2Embed
