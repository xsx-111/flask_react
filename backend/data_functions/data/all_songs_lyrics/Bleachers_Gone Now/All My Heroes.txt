All My Heroes Lyrics
I don't think I can talk about that
1, 2, 3
Waiting alone at the corner
Trying to get myself back home
I don't think I can talk about that

All my heroes got tired
And all the days, they got short
And a love that I dreamt of
Came to me at my worst

Yeah, all the nights I don't remember
Are the ones I can't forget
When all your heroes get tired
I'll be something better yet

I remember driving out of this state
No, nothing dies
Until somebody's soul does
Somebody sold us all kinds of lies

Hey, all the nights I don't remember
Are the ones I can't forget
When all your heroes get tired
I'll be something better yet
Into focus I'll be coming
Into focus I'll be waiting
Into focus I'll be dreaming
Into focus I'll be something better yet
Into focus I'll be coming
Into focus I'll be waiting
Into focus I'll be dreaming
Into focus I'll be something better yet
Into focus I'll be coming
Into focus I'll be waiting
Into focus I'll be dreaming
Into focus I'll be something better yet
