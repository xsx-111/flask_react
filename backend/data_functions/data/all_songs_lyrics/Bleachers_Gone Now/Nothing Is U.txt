Nothing Is U Lyrics
She puts on a black dress
I clean my glasses and phone
Frankie says it’s worthless
To stop and build a home

But as for me I’ve waited
Longer than I’ve been clear
And I can’t keep it clean anymore
Since nothing has changed me quite like you
No, nothing has changed me quite like you

I left my house on Friday
Sunday, begging please
Challenged all my best friends
I’ve challenged them to leave

But as for me I’ve waited
Longer than I’ve been clear
And I can’t be alone anymore
Since nothing has changed me quite like you
No, nothing has changed me quite like you
Will it feel like thunder
When the long drive's over?
I will walk in silence with you
Yes, I will wander in silence with you
Yes, I will wander in silence with you
'Cause nothing's really changed me
Nothing like you
No, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing is you6Embed
