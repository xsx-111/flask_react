Dream of Mickey Mantle Lyrics
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I feel like I'm missing more and more and more every time
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I wanna be grateful
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I wanna be grateful
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
I don't think I can talk about that

All the hope I had when I was young, I hope I wasn't wrong
I miss those days so I sing a don't take the money song
That's why I'm up in my room tonight whistling wind out my teeth
'Cause somebody didn't fix them nice (no)
Well some things just don't turn out right (no)

Kim's Video closed and a war goes on and on
All the hope I had when I was young, I hope I wasn't wrong
That's why I'm out in the street tonight whistling wind out my teeth
'Cause somebody didn't fix them nice (no)
You know some things just don't turn out right

Rolling thunder had cursed my bedroom
Heard from your mother, she don't recognize you
Now Mickey Mantle left on a Sunday
And all of the neighborhood rushes home to pray
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
We're rushing home to pray (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)
Rolling thunder (yeah) cursed my bedroom (yeah)

Rolling thunder had cursed my bedroom
Heard from your mother, she don't recognize you
Now Mickey Mantle left on a Sunday
And all of the neighborhood rushes home to pray

Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
Woke up, I'm in the in-between honey
One foot out and I know the weight is coming
Because I left it by the bed last night
Open my eyes and I stare and pray for light
Always one foot out when you say goodbye to the one that you love2Embed
