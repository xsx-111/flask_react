Alibi Lyrics
No warning sign, no alibi
We faded faster than the speed of light
Took our chance, crashed and burned
No we'll never ever learn

I fell apart, but got back up again
And then I fell apart, but got back up again, yeah

We both could see crystal clear
That the inevitable end was near
Made our choice, a trial by fire
To battle is the only way we feel... alive

I fell apart, but got back up again
And then I fell apart, but got back up again
And then I fell apart, but got back up again
Way, oh, way, oh
Way, oh, way, oh
Way, oh

So here we are, the witching hour
The quickest tongue to divide and devour
Divide and devour
If I could end the quest for fire
For truth, for love, for my desire
My desire

And I fell apart, but got back up again
Way, oh, way, oh
Way, oh, way, oh
Way, oh, way, oh
Way, oh, way, oh
Way, oh
I fell apart, I fell apart
I fell apart, I fell apart
I fell apart

But got back up again13Embed
