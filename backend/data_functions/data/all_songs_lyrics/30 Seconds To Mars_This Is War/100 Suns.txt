100 Suns Lyrics
I believe in nothing
Not the end and not the start
I believe in nothing
Not the Earth and not the stars

I believe in nothing
Not the day and not the dark
I believe in nothing
But the beating of our hearts
(Oh-oh-oh)

I believe in nothing
(Oh-oh-oh) One hundred suns until we part (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
I believe in nothing (Oh-oh-oh)
Not in sin and not in God (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)

I believe in nothing
(Oh-oh-oh) Not in peace and not in war (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
I believe in nothing (Oh-oh-oh)
But the truth in who we are (Oh-oh-oh)6Embed
