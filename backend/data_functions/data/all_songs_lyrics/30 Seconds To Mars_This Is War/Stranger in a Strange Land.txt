Stranger in a Strange Land Lyrics
Enemy of mine
I'll fuck you like the devil
Violent inside
Beautiful and evil
I'm a ghost, you're an angel
One and the same
Just remains of an age

Lost in a daydream
What do you see?
If you're looking for Jesus
Then get on your knees

Enemy of mine
I'm just a stranger in a strange land
Running out of time
Better go, go, go
Angel or demon
I gave up my soul
I'm guilty of treason
I've abandoned control
Tonight

The end is coming, everybody run
Now we're gonna live forever, gonna live forever
Tonight, tonight, tonight
The end is coming, everybody run
Now we're gonna live forever, gonna live forever
Tonight, tonight, tonight
The end is coming, everybody run
Now we're gonna live forever, gonna live forever
Tonight, tonight, tonight
The end is coming, everybody run
Now we're gonna live forever, gonna live forever
Tonight, tonight, tonight
The end is coming, everybody run
Now we're gonna live forever, gonna live forever
Tonight

Lost in a daydream
What do you see?
If you're looking for Jesus
Then get on your knees

Angel or demon
I gave up my soul
I'm guilty of treason
I've abandoned control
Your soul3Embed
