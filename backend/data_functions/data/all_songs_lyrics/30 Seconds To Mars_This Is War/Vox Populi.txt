Vox Populi Lyrics
This is a call to arms
Gather soldiers
Time to go to war
This is a battle song
Brothers and sisters
Time to go to war

Did you ever believe?
Were you ever a dreamer?
Ever imagine heart open and free?
Did you ever deny?
Were you ever a traitor?
Ever in love with your blood, lust and need?

This is a call to arms
Gather soldiers
Time to go to war
This is a battle song
Brothers and sisters
Time to go to war

Ever want to be free?
Do you even remember?
Wanna beguile the devil like me?
Ever want to just stop?
Do you want to surrender?
Or fight for victory?
Here we are at the start
I can feel the beating of our hearts
Here we are at the start
Darkness falls, here comes the rain
To wash away the past and the names
Darkness falls, here comes the rain
To end it all, the blood and the game
Far, far away
In a land that time can't change
Long, long ago
In a place of hearts and ghosts

This is a call to arms
Gather soldiers
Time to go to war
This is a battle song
Brothers and sisters
Time to go to war

This is a call to arms
Gather soldiers
Time to go to war
This is a battle song
Brothers and sisters
Time to go to war
This is a call to arms
We own the night
This is a battle song
We own the night
Here we are at the start7Embed
