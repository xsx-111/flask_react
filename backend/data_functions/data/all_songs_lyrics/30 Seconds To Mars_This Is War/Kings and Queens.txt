Kings and Queens Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Into the night, desperate and broken
The sound of a fight, father has spoken

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell, heaven and hell

Into your eyes, hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives through blood and name
In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams
We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell, heaven and hell

The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we've learned here
Have only just begun

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between heaven and hell

We are the kings
We are the queens
We are the kings
We are the queens19Embed
