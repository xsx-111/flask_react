Breakdown (A Long Way From Home) LyricsThe clubs are all closed and the ladies are leavin'
There's nobody nobody knows on the street
A few stranded souls standin' cold at the station
And nowhere to go but to bed and to sleep
Lord would you look at you
Now that you're here ain't you
Proud of your peers
And the long way you've come
All alone all the way
On your own, who's to say
That you've thrown it away for a song
Boy you've sure come a long way from home
So it's so long so many so far behind you
Fair-weather friends that you no longer know
You still got the same lonely songs to remind you
Of someone you seemed to be, so long ago
Lord would you look at you
Now that you're here ain't you
Proud of your peers
And the long way you've come
All alone all the way
On your own, who's to say
That you've thrown it away for a song
Boy you've sure come a long way from homeEmbed
