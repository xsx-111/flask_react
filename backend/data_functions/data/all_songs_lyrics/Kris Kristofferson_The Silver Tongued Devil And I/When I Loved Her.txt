When I Loved Her LyricsWell, she didn't look as pretty as some others I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of makin' me believe that I belonged
And it felt like comin' home, when I found her
'Cause she seemed to be so proud of me just walkin' holdin' hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feelin' warm, when I loved her
'Cause she brightened up the day like the early mornin' sun
And she made what I was doin' seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to livin' that I guess I've ever known
And it made me want to smile, when I loved her
I know some of us were born to cast our fortune to the winds
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand, why I lost herEmbed
