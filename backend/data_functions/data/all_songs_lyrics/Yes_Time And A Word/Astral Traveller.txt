Astral Traveller LyricsAnd in the ruins of the balloon
Stood a man with glasses held high
Wondering when to do it again
Have another fly into the sky
Somewhere flying high
Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wandering where lights go
Leave out the body load
Once in the air, people who dare
Get a great respect in being (astral traveller)
Heavenly flight, wondrous night
And all the sights worth seeing
Just believe in
Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wandering where lights go
Leave out the body load
Once in the air, people who dare
Get a great respect in being (astral traveller)
Heavenly flight, wondrous night
And all the sights worth seeing
Just believe in
Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wandering where lights go
Leave out the body loadEmbed
