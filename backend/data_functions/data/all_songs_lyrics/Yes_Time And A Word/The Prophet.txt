The Prophet LyricsLong ago a tall man told a tale of yesterday
Searching for the truth to life and not for just a way
Finding pleasure from the sounds his ears they did obey
In his life a moment's pleasure never to delay
He was lost and in his trust he found a new meaning
Seeing the things in different lights his life was redeeming
Words of peace would fill his mind and change his way of life
Peaceful meetings with his heart have made him more alive
Meeting wise old women on the cliffs of life itself
Asking not for just meaning, more for just himself
Soon we'll be as he proclaimed in a new way of living
Take the things you need in life but remember the giving
Prophesy within your mind and you will work it out
Prophesy that some will die but only those who doubt
Then you'll never worry as sometimes you used to do
Just remember when you're gone there's someone after you, youEmbed
