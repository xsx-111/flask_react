Sweet Dreams LyricsSweet dreams can solve the future
Sweet dreams provide the past
Sweet things within your makeup
These things will always last
These things will make
Sweet dreams of conversation
Sweet dreams of love affection
Sweet words within your makeup
Sweet words of things to
Come on and write your letter
You know it will be better anyhow
You're gonna laugh again
You're gonna smile again
You're gonna love again
Sweet dreams are born inside you
Sweet dreams are born to last
Sweet thoughts within your makeup
These thoughts will always last
These thoughts will always last
Come on and write your letter
You know it will be better anyhow
You're gonna laugh again
You're gonna smile again
You're gonna love again
Sweet dreams can solve the future
Sweet dreams provide the past
Sweet dreams can solve the future
Sweet dreams provide the past1Embed
