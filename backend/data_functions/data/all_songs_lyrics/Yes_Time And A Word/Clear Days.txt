Clear Days LyricsI once knew a sweet young girl
Her body was her world and love
Her laughter was as happiness is
Of all the times I treasure this
That on a day I will remember
On a clear day we once loved forever
I once knew a sweet young dream
That if life itself were all we had
And who are we to expect so much more
Let's not be sad, let's all be sure
And on a day we will remember
On a clear day we'll all be together
