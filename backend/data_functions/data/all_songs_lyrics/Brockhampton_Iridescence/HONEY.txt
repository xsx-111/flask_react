HONEY Lyrics
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?

I need to step out with no frustration
I need a permanent getaway vacation
They got a permanent hit list, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right

I could've been homeless
I thought I moved to orphanage for the summer
I could've been homeless
Before I had a goal, I had a course

A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
My people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
That's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
Take flight, never leaned to the left, or the right
'Cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
When our women start to die, when our children start to die
I don't feel their empathy, we been displaced too many times
Every summer in the city start to feel like Columbine
'Cause you gotta get yours, and I gotta get mine
One time for the paragons of the paradigm
When you underground, they gon' only try to undermine
Use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
You couldn't match my alien, I'm glowing like uranium

One time for the— one time—
One time— nigga, one time— nigga
One time— nigga, one t—
Nigga (Yes) nigga, nigga (Yes)
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right, 50 did it right (Yes)
Wish I could call every successful black rapper for advice
How the fuck do I make this shit last my whole life? (Yes)
What if they don't want to come to the concert tonight? (Yes)
 (Yes)
Nigga (Yes) nigga, nigga (Yes) nigga
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
(Just give me what I need)
(Oh) Tuggin' on my pinky ring (Yes)
Smelling like chrysanthemum
(Honestly, I just want that) (Yes)
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
All my jewelry, and all my niggas (Yes)
All my jewelry, and all my niggas got that, yeah  (Yes, yes)

Ooh, ooh (Yes, yes)
And you know I got it (Yes)
Just give me what I need (Yes, yes)23Embed
