So Doggone Lonesome Lyrics
I do my best to hide this lowdown feeling
I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
But they're always asking me about you darling
And it hurts me so to tell them that you're gone

If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denying
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it crying:
"Where's my darling, when's she coming home?"

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
And that I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're awaiting
Sometimes I think my heart is stopping too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you

But I guess I'll keep waiting till you're with me
Cause I believe that loving you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight
Well I know, I'll keep on loving you cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
