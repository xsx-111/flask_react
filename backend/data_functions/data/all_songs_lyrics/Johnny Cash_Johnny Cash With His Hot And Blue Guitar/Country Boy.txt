Country Boy Lyrics
Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day
While you're wanting to play
In the sun and the sand
With a face that's tan
But at the end of the day
When your work is done
You ain't got nothing but fun

Country boy, ain't got no ills
Country boy, don't owe no bills

You get a wiggly worm
And then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook
And you drop him in a brook
And if everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight

Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you was me
Country boy, got work to do
Country boy, in the morning dew
You got to cut the weeds
You got to plant the seeds
There's many a row
You know you gotta hoe
But when it's quittin' time
And your work is through
There's a lot of life in you

Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run
When you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two
And your dog and you
When you get your rabbit
You'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried

Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoesEmbed
