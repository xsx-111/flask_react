(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle Lyrics
I was riding Number 9
Heading south from Caroline
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
I got in trouble, had to roam
I left my gal and left my home
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off the Georgia Main
Locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry
When that evening train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I'll be locked here in this cell
Till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine
I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lonesome whistle blowEmbed
