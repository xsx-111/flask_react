The Hill Lyrics
Here we will stand
Holding the strand
Walking upon the frill
Open our hands
Upon the sand
We are the children still
Still

Come take a walk to the streets
Then the hill, to the top
Looking left to the city
Looking right onto the gates
To the lights, to the moon-mance
To the lights that are thundering down
Down, down, down
They are thundering down

Here we will stand
Knowing we can't
Climb upon the hill
Open our hands
Upon the sands
We are the children still
Still
And when you're here, take my hand
And we'll go into the gate
To disappear from this land
For all we know, it is our fear

Here we will stand
Knowing we can't
Climb upon the hill
Open our hands
Look on the sands
We are the children still
Still
Here we will stand
Knowing we can't
Climb upon the hill
Open our hands
Upon the sands
We are the children still
StillEmbed
