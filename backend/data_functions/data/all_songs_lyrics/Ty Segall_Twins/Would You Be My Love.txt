Would You Be My Love LyricsIf I was seventeen
Would you think of me meanly?
Would you, would you be happier?
Ice froze incompletely
On the coast, we are ghosts
Living in our heads
Waiting for the notice
That we are dead
Dead
Would you, would you be my love?
Would you, would you be my girl?
Would you, would you be my love?
Would you, would you be my love?
On the coast, we are ghosts
Living in our heads
Waiting for the notice
That we are dead
Dead
Would you, would you be my love?
Would you, would you be my girl?
Would you, would you be my love?
Would you, would you be my girl?
Would you, would you be my love?
Would you, would you be my girl?Embed
