Gold on the Shore LyricsA kiss in the wind to my girl
This is the rose that I gave you before
A sweet summer breeze is out there
These are the showers that wash on your door
And these are the plains in our hearts
Made in the sun and of gold on the shore
And this is the grain in our hands
That fall like the sands and they fly evermore
A kiss in the wind to my girl
This is the rose that I gave you before
A sweet summer breeze is out there
These are the showers that wash on your door
And these are the plains in our hearts
Made in the sun and of gold on the shore
And this is the grain in our hands
Fall like the sands and they fly evermore
So follow me into the sun
And let the minds of all eyes run
Don't fear change
Let's runEmbed
