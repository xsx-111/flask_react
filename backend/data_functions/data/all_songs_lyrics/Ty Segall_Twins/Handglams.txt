Handglams LyricsHere I sit, guns in my hands, upon the glass we make our plans
She is my body, my forbidden glam
And here I sit upon the hill and in my hand I love it still
She is my body, my forbidden pill, oh yeah
Here I sit, guns in my hands, upon the glass we make our plans
She is my body, my forbidden glam
Oh
