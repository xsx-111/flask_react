Love Fuzz LyricsYou're a pretty, pretty one
You're lovely, lovelier than the sun
Now won't you help me, help me see
How lovely your love can be?
Why don't you help me, help me see
How lovely your love can be?
You're a pretty, pretty one
You're lovely, lovelier than the sun
Why don't you help me, help me see
How lovely your love can be?
Why don't you help me, help me see
How lovely love can be?
How lovely your love can be
Why don't you help me, help me see
How lovely your love can be?
You're a pretty, pretty one
You're a pretty, pretty oneEmbed
