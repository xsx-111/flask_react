Who Are You LyricsI see your number, it's a flashing sign
It says "Hello, man, take up my time"
I hear you now, there in your mouth
It says "Hello, that's the... But what I really wanna know you..."
Who are you?
Welcome in my country, come inside
You are invited to (?), oh
Who are you? Who are you?Embed
