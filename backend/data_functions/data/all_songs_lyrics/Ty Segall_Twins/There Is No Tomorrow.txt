There Is No Tomorrow LyricsWon't you come? Come away with me?
Won't you come? Come away with me?
If you say you'll always stay
Won't you come, won't you come, come away?
There is no tomorrow, we're all gonna' fry
You know it's true, I love you
Won't you stay? Stay away with me?
Won't you stay? Stay away with me?
If you say you'll always stay
Won't you come, won't you come, come away?
There is no tomorrow, we're all gonna' fry
You know it's true, I love you
There is no tomorrow, we're all gonna' fry
You know it's true, I love you
Won't you come? Come away with me?Embed
