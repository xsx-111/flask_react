Thank God for Sinners Lyrics
I'm out on the streets, you know
I'm looking for you
You give me the sweets, you know
You know I'm not through so

Thank God for the sinners
Thank God for your love
In the morning
I'll rise above

There's a hole in my heart, you know
And you know what to do
Won't you please just stop, you know
So I can make it through

Thank God for the sinners
Thank God for your love
In the morning
I'll rise above
Thank God for the sinners
Thank God for your love
'Cause in the morning
I'll rise aboveEmbed
