Ghost LyricsI don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be a ghost
In California, near the coast
The sun, it shines here
And I am dying tonight
Took twenty-two years to die
Twenty-two years to lose my mind
Shrivel up now, like a bug
We are leaving, we are leaving you all
I don't wanna be a ghost
I don't wanna be a ghost
In California, near the coast
The sun, it shines here
And I am dying tonightEmbed
