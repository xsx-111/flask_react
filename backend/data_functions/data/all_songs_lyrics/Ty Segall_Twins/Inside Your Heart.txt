Inside Your Heart Lyrics
Oh, doctor, won't you tell me please?
Is it living inside of me?
It was alive
When it climbed inside

I hope I am not wrong
So we can get along
I was alive
When it climbed inside

Inside your heart
Inside your heart
Inside your heart
Inside your heart
Inside your heart
Inside your heart
Inside your heart
Inside your heartEmbed
