The Great Deceiver Lyrics
Health-food faggot with a bartered bride
Likes to comb his hair with a dipper ride
Once had a friend with a cloven foot
Once he called the tune in a chequered suit

Great Deceiver!

In the door on the floor in a paper bag
There's a shoe-shine boy with a gin-shop slag
She raised him up and she called him son
And she canonised the ground that he walked upon

Great Deceiver!

Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary
Cigarettes, ice cream
Cadillacs, blue jeans

In the night he's a star in the Milky Way
He's a man of the world by the light of day
A golden smile and a proposition
And the breath of God smells of sweet sedition
Great Deceiver!

Sing hymns, make love, get high, fall dead
He'll bring his perfume to your bed
He'll charm your life 'til the cold wind blows
Then he'll sell your dreams to a picture show

Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary
Cadillacs, blue jeans, Dixieland playing on the ferry
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary
Cadillacs, blue jeans, Dixieland playing on the ferry
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary
Cadillacs, blue jeans, Dixieland playing on the ferry
Cigarettes, ice cream, figurines of the Virgin Mary
Camel hair, Brylcreem, drop a glass full of antique sherryEmbed
