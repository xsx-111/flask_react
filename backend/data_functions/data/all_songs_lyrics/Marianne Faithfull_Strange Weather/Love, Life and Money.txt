Love, Life and Money LyricsLove you made me pay an awful price
I tried to gamble with you, but you were using crooked dice
Somebody's gotta suffer, somebody's gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on me
Money you made me some very good friends
Just like you make them, you're gonna break them in the end
Somebody's gotta suffer, somebody's gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on me
I've had my share of love, life and money
I lost it all three ways and i'm here to tell ya it sure ain't funny
Me and my money parted, so did my love and i
Life don't mean a thing, and i wish that i could die
In life you make a whole lotta fools
'cause you're always teaching something that they never teach in schools
Somebody's gotta suffer, somebody's gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on me
Love, you made me pay an awful price
I tried to gamble with you, but you were using crooked dice
Somebody's gotta suffer, somebody's gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on me
If it's gonna rain down misery, why it's all gotta fall on meEmbed
