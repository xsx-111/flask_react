Yesterdays LyricsYesterdays, yesterdays
Days i knew as happy sweet sequestered days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Then truth was mine
Sad am i, glad am i
For today i'm dreaming of
Yesterdays
Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days i knew as happy sweet sequestered days
Golden days, olden days
Days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Then truth was mine
Sad am i, glad am i
For today i'm dreaming of
