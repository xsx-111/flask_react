Sleepwalk Lyrics
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)

Rolling and falling
I'm choking and calling
Name after name after name

(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)

Naked and bleeding
The streetlights stray by me
Hurting my eyes with their glare

(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)

Helplessly breaking
Exchanging my faces
Destined, we had to collide
Sleepwalk!

Caught on the outside
I'm crumpling and crawling
Watching the day drag away
Spiralling deeper
I can't feel my fingers
Grip 'round my throat as I dream
(Dream, dream, dream dream)

(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
(Sleepwalk)
