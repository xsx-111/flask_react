Asking for Favours LyricsTake it or leave it
I'll always be there
Take it or leave it
Grant me a reason
Always come asking
You'll never be mine
I'll ask how much
But you'll say I'll mind
You want to say
Do you understand
You wanna say
Take it or leave
You're all by the phone
Take it or leave it
How much do I care
I try to learn a lesson
Not very sure
You always ask me
How much did I hurt
You want to say
Do you understand
You wanna say
You want to say
Do you understand
You wanna sayEmbed
