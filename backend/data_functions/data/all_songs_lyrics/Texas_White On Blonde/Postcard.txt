Postcard LyricsI'll send you a postcard from heaven's ocean
I feel like staying here in heaven's ocean
I've been dreaming
For days now
Jump in the sea
I do that easily
The sounds drowning
What I'm seeing
Count everyone for questions I have not known
I'll send you a postcard from heaven's ocean
I feel like staying here in heaven's ocean
There's a storm
In my thoughts now
Come wash me clean
Beneath the waves with me
Now we're smiling
See me smiling
Silence is what I need
It's only in the sea
I'll send you a postcard from heaven's ocean
I feel like staying here in heaven's ocean
I'll send you a postcard from heaven's ocean
I feel like staying here in heaven's ocean
I'll send you a postcard from heaven's ocean
I feel like staying here in heaven's ocean
I'll send you a postcard from heaven's ocean
I feel like staying here in heaven's ocean
I'll send you a postcard from heaven's ocean
I feel like staying here in heaven's oceanEmbed
