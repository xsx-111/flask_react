Good Advice LyricsOpen the window I need some air
So many people and there's such disorder here
Familiar faces, found out lies
And to distract I watch the passers-by
I wonder what they'd recognize
And what they'd recommend to fill my days
Possessions start to wear me down
I need some good advice some good advice to wear my crown
I'm nervous can you help me
I'm nervous can you help me
I'm nervous can you help me
Yeah I'm nervous can you help me
Inside they harbour secret thoughts
They peek through windows that have twice been locked
I have to walk to wear me out
I need some good advice some good advice to wear my crown
I'm nervous can you help me
I'm nervous can you help me
I'm nervous can you help me
Yeah I'm nervous can you help me
I fold my arms and pray to leave
I've got a head full of ideas inside of me
My lips pressed tight so as not to drown
I need some good advice some good advice to wear my crown
I'm nervous can you help me
I'm nervous can you help me
I'm nervous can you help me
Yeah I'm nervous can you help me
Giving me some good advice
Can never be wrong
If I know it's you
Give me some good advice
Can never be wrong
If I know it's true
Give me some good advice
Can never be wrong
If I know it's youEmbed
