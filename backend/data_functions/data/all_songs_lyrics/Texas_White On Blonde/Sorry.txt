Sorry LyricsI used to walk upon the sea
Then I didn't need no company
Now I'd even pay a fair
For the sound of your wave has come and drowned me
You make me feel so wrong
You make my days, you make my days so long
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild that wall
Sorry
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild that wall
Sorry
What I am is not what you see
You will find it when you're dreaming
Things aren't always what they seem
But I know you'll get the meaning
You make me feel so wrong
You make my days, you make my days so long
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild that wall
Sorry
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild the wall
Sorry
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild that wall
Sorry
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild the wall
Sorry
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild that wall
Sorry
I never can tell and if you'll fall
Never will I rebuild the wallEmbed
