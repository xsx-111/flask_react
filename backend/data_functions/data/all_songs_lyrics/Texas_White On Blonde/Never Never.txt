Never Never LyricsI knew I never call me down and silent
Someone like you, I know I can not hide
There was no pain that I can not explain
I swallowed down like I was supposed to
So tonight
I can never never
No I'd never never
So tonight
No I've never never
I can never never
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbye
I used to jump to find you with a smile
I know I saw the goal after a while
I know you're life is catching up with you
So swallow down like you were supposed to
So tonight
No I'd never never
I can never never
So tonight
I can never never
No I've never never
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbye
So tonight
I can never never
No I'd never never
So tonight
No I've never never
I can never never
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbye
So I'll say goodbyeEmbed
