Cold Day Dream LyricsWalk away, no I won't compromise
Take a pill for the pain
It's not deep inside
I will die for you
Would you be there for me
Don't ask for the reasons
If you can't see them
It's too late to call my name
Yeah, it's too late to call me again
Sunshine city
Yes it's where you belong
I thought you were deeper
I guess I was wrong
No I don't want to kiss you
I don't wanna make up
I've had too much of nothing
You've run out of luck
It's too late to call my name
Yes it's too late to call me again
It's too late to call my nameEmbed
