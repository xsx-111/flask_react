Black Eyed Boy Lyrics
No I don't lack ambition
Can't you see what I hate
That it's you who is sinking
Locked behind iron gates

You should know, you're falling into fiction
I can tell you're on some foolish mission

Your black eyed soul, you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy, you will find
Your own space and time

You call me superstitious
Tie me up with your deceit
I can never be malicious
Though I seem so bittersweet

You should know, you're falling into fiction
I can tell you're on some foolish mission
Your black eyed soul, you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy, you will find
Your own space and time

Black eyed soul, you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy, you will find
Your own space and
Tiiiiiiiime

You should know, you're falling into fiction
I can tell you're on some foolish mission

Your black eyed soul, you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy you will find
Your own space and time

Black eyed soul, you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy, you will find
Your own space and time
Black eyed soul, you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy, you will find
Your own space and timeEmbed
