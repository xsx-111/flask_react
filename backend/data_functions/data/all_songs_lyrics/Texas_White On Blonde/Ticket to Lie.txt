Ticket to Lie LyricsAttention annoys me
I could disappoint
So just take a walk
And try to avoid
The cars in the street now
They could knock you down
So just take a bus
It's a long long way down
There's a ticket in my hand
If you want I don't know what you think
Tell me where you wanna go
Take a breath when I ask you to just try
Close your eyes I'll take you there
I could take you anywhere
Come fly
Yeah tell me what you wanna do
I can make it up for you and lie
Laughter annoys me
Makes me feel sad
Yeah I wrote that book
Can I have it back
There's black all around me
And I'm lost in this crowd
There's no coming back
Cause I'm on my way down
There's a ticket in my hand
I can't use it without you
So tell me where you wanna go
Take a breath when I ask you to just try
Close your eyes I'll take you there
I could take you anywhere
Come fly
Yeah, tell me what you wanna do
I can make it up for you and lie
So tell me where you wanna go
Take a breath when I ask you to just try
Close your eyes I'll take you there
I could take you anywhere
Come fly
So tell me where you wanna go
Take a breath when I ask you to just try
Yeah tell me what you wanna do
I can make it up for you and lie
So tell me where you wanna go
I will put that ticket in your hand
In your handEmbed
