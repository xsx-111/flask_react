Tear It Up LyricsDidn't you find in this small town
Climb the height, so divine
Yes we did
And now you're part of everything
That makes my days warm from within
Yes it is
So won't you please hurry home now
There is nothing more for me to say
So won't you please hurry home now
There is nothing more for me to say
You're forever, forever in my mind
You're forever, forever, forever in my mind
Something's tearing up your mind
It's in your eyes froze out of time
Yes it is
It's in the way you can't disguise
In order to make a women cry
Yes I have
So won't you please hurry home now
There is nothing more for me to say
Oh won't you please hurry home now
There is nothing more that I can say
Cause you're forever, forever in my mind
You're forever, forever, forever on my mind
Oh won't you please hurry home now
There is nothing more that I can say
So won't you please hurry home now
There is nothing more for me to say
But you're forever, forever on my mind
Yeah you're forever, forever, forever on my mind
You're forever, forever on my mindEmbed
