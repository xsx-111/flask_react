Sunday Is the Saddest Day LyricsSunday is the saddest day
When we're apart everything I say
Gets in the way, gets into place
Of how I feel standing face to face
Sunday is the saddest day
All you want, all you breathe
You won't need to find another
Tell me what is wrong, tell me where we belong
And what we said, tell me it's only in my head
Show me who's to blame, show me we're the same
And where we go, show me something I don't know
Sunday is the saddest day
Don't give me legends, they're far too late
Your sweet crusader he got away
I know that's hard to take
Sunday is the saddest day
You don't want you don't need
Cause it's hard to pull together
Tell me what is wrong, tell me where we belong
And what we said, tell me it's only in my head
Show me who's to blame, show me we're the same
And where we go, yeah show me something I don't know
Sunday is the saddest day
You pick apart everything I say
Sunday is the saddest day
All you want, all you breathe
You won't need to find another
Tell me what is wrong, tell me where we belong
And what we said, tell me it's only in my head
Show me who's to blame, show me we're the same
And where we go, yeah show me something I don't know
Tell me what is wrong, tell me where we belong
And what we said, tell me it's only in my head
Show me who's to blame, show me we're the same
And where we go, yeah show me something I don't know
Sunday is the saddest day
Sunday is the saddest day
Sunday is the saddest day
Sunday is the saddest dayEmbed
