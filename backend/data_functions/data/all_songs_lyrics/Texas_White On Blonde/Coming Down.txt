Coming Down LyricsI never meant to hurt you babe
I never meant to hurt you babe
Now's my chance to breathe
Coming down you are too slow
Not to know about us
Listen now cause you're too near
To this maddening crowd without us
I never meant to hurt you babe
I never meant to hurt you babe
Now's my chance to breathe
Feeling down before you go
You should know about us
Listen now before you hear
From this maddening crowd about us
I never meant to hurt you babe
I never meant to hurt you babe
Now's my chance to breatheEmbed
