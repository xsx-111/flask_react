Holly Wants to Go to California LyricsHolly wants to go to California
Holly would if only Holly could
Holly she belongs in California
Holly would if only Holly could
Holly's got a heavenly body
Which all stars need to shine
Holly, she's a star
Holly's got a beautiful mind
Holly wants to go to California
Holly would if only Holly could
Holly she belongs in California
Holly would if only Holly could
Holly's got a heavenly body
Which all stars need to shine
Holly, she's a star
Holly's got a beautiful mind
If Holly want to go to California
Holly would, if only Holly could
And she'd shine
Like the Hollywood sign
On Sunset and Vine
In nighttime, in the nighttime
Holly wants to go to California
Holly would, and if Holly ever should
Holly's got a heavenly body
Which all stars they need to shine
Holly, she's a star
Holly, she's got a beautiful mind
Let Holly go
To California
Cause Holly would if only Holly
Holly wants to go to California
Holly would, if only Holly could
And she'd shine
Like the Hollywood sign
On Sunset and Vine
In nighttime, in the nighttime
Holly wants to go to California
Yeah
She'll make itEmbed
