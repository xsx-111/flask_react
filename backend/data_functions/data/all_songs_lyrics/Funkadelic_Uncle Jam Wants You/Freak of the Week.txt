Freak of the Week LyricsYeah, gotta be gotta be freak of the week
Ooh, gotta be gotta be freak of the week
Yeah, gotta be gotta be freak of the week
She's a big freak, going to be freak of the week
She's a disco lovin' mama, at the disco's where you'll find her
She's a big freak, tell by the company she keeps
She's a disco lovin' mama, at the disco's where you'll find her
Gotta be, she got to be freak of the week, yeah
Gotta be, got to be freak of the week, ooh
Gotta be, got to be freak of the week, yeah
Gotta be, she got to be freak of the week
She's a big freak, going to be freak of the week
She's a dancing interpretation of the meaning of syncopation
She's a big freak, going to be freak of the week
Don't give her that one move groovalistic
That disco sadistic
That one beat up and down it just won't do
Don't give her that forever and ever foreplay
She's not looking for the short way
She's got to reach a point where she gets off
She's a big freak, going to be freak of the week
She's a disco lovin' mama, at the disco's where you'll find her
She's a big freak, (great big freak) going to be freak of the week
Gotta be, gotta be freak of the week, yeah
Gotta be, got to be freak of the week, ooh (x4)
She's a big freak, going to be freak of the week
She's a disco lovin' mama, at the disco's where you'll find her
She's a big freak, going to be freak of the week
Don't give her that one move groovalistic
That disco sadistic
That one beat up and down it just won't do
Don't give her that forever and ever foreplay
She's not looking for the short way
She's got to reach a point where she gets off
Great big freak, she got to be freak of the week
She's a dancing interpretation of the meaning of syncopation
