Love LyricsC'mon now
Wanna dig the scene?
Love, obviously, very soon, everybody
Love, obviously, very soon, everybody
Oh, oh won't you love that sweet time?
Oh, oh don't you love that sweet time?
Spent a long time on this road
Spent a long time in this town
Spent a long time in the wrong road
Spent a long time in this town
Gonna drive away in a big fast car
Gonna drive away, won't get too far
Gonna drive away, don't know how far
Gonna drive away in a big fast car
Love, obviously, very soon, everybody
Love, obviously, very soon, everybody
Oh, oh don't you love that sweet time?
Oh, don't you love that sweet time?
C'mon now
Spent a long time in your hole
Spent a long time in the wrong hole
Spent a long time in this town
I spent a long time in my town
Gonna drive away in a big fast car
Gonna drive away, won't get too far
Gonna drive away, won't get too far
Gonna drive away, don't know how far
How far
Oh yeah
In this town
In my town
In my town
That's just my fee
Love
Love
Love
I look for the grand conditions near her heart
Love...Embed
