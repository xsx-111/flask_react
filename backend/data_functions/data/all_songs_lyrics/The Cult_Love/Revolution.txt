Revolution LyricsPictures of never ending dreams
I can't see what these images mean
Locked inside me
Can't set the rainbows free
Like perishing flowers
They sag and twist and die
There's a revolution
There's a revolution, yeah
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
Sorrow
What does revolution mean to you?
To save today's like wishing in the wind
All my beautiful friends have all gone away
Like the waves
They flow and ebb and die
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a, there's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution, yeah
Joy or sorrow
What does revolution mean to you?
To save today's like wishing in the wind
All my beautiful friends have all gone away
Like the waves
They flow and ebb and die
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
There's a revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution
Revolution, yeahEmbed
