Brother Wolf; Sister Moon LyricsEmbrace the wind with both arms
Stop the clouds dead in the sky
Hang your head no more
And beg no more
Brother wolf and sister moon
Your time has come
Brother wolf and sister moon
Your time has come
And the wind will blow my fears away
Will dry my tears away
And dry my tears away
And blow my fears away
Embrace the wind with both arms
Stop the clouds dead in the sky
Hang your head no more
And beg no more
Brother wolf and sister moon
Your time has come
Brother wolf and sister moon
Your time has come
And the wind will blow my fears away
Will dry my tears away
And blow my fears away
And dry my tears away
And the wind will blow my fears away
Will dry my tears away
And blow my fears away
And dry my, dry my tears away, yeah
Dry my tears away, yeah
And blow my, blow my fears away, yeah
And blow my, blow my, blow my
And blow my fears awayEmbed
