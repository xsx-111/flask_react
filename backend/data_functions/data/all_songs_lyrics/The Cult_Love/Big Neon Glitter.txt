Big Neon Glitter LyricsDrag me back
And drag you back
And drag you back
Drag you back
Drag me back
Through the revolution without solution
And the wall gets taller
While you get smaller
While we get smaller
The fear is getting taller
A big neon glitter pushes into you
Sex from the hip at the crack of a whip
The wall gets taller
While you get smaller
Push against the big neon glitter
Pushes unto you
Drag me back
And drag you back
And drag you back
Drag you back
Drag me back
Through the revolution without solution
And the wall gets taller
While you get smaller
While we get smaller
The fear is getting taller
A big neon glitter unto you
Sex from the hip at the crack of a whip
The wall gets taller
While you get smaller
Push against the big neon glitter
Pushes unto you
A big neon
A big neon
A big neon glitter
A big neon glitter
A big neon
A big neon
A big neon glitter
A big neon glitter
A big neon glitterEmbed
