Phoenix LyricsYeah
Oh, dig this
Like the heat from a thousand suns that burns on
Rising ever higher
A phoenix from a pyre
My eternal desire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Like a kiss from the lips of Ra that burns on
The pleasures getting wilder
Circling ever higher
A servant of desire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Like the heat from a thousand suns that burns on
Rising ever higher
A phoenix from a pyre
My eternal desire
Like a kiss from the lips of Ra that burns on
The pleasures getting wilder
Circling ever higher
A servant of desire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Like the heat from a thousand suns that burns on
Rising ever higher
A phoenix from a pyre
My eternal desire
My eternal desire
My eternal desire
My eternal desire
