Black Angel LyricsA fugitive has been away so long
A thousand years, and now he thinks of home
The long men are waiting in the wings
To put him in chains upon his return
Emptyness, his bitterness is gone
Journey on to the eternal reward
It's a long way to go
A black angel at your side
It's a long way to go
A black angel at your side
The sirens call a sailor to die
Enchanted by the sound, his desires have been found
In his mind, his life is rushing by
All this while, the storm it rages on
He's turning old, he shall never return
Sail on to the eternal reward
It's a long way to go
A black angel at your side
It's a long way to go
With that angel at your side
It's a long way to go
With the reaper at your side
It's a long way to go
A black angel at your side
The fugitive has been away so long
A thousand years, and now he thinks of home
The long men are waiting in the wings
To put him in chains upon his return
Emptyness, his bitterness is gone
Journey on to the eternal reward
Oh, no, never
Oh, no, never
Oh, no, no
It's a long way to go
A black angel at your side
It's a long way to go
With that angel at your side
It's a long way to go
With the reaper at your side
It's a long way to go
With that angel at your side
At your side
It's a long
It's a long, long, long goodbye
It's a long, long, long goodbyeEmbed
