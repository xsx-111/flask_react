Rain LyricsHot sticky scenes, you know what I mean
Like a desert sun that burns my skin
I've been waiting for her for so long
Open the sky and let her come down
Here comes the rain
Here comes the rain
Here she comes again
Here comes the rain
Hot sticky scenes, you know what I mean
Like a desert sun that burns my skin
I've been waiting for her for so long
Open the sky and let her come down
Here comes the rain
Here comes the rain
Here she comes again
Here comes the rain
I love the rain
I love the rain
Here she comes again
Here comes the rain
Oh, rain
Rain
Rain
Oh, here comes the rain
I love the rain
Well, I love the rain
Here she comes again
I love the rain
Rain
