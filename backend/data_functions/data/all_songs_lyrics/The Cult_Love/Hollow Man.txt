Hollow Man LyricsIt's so nice to get away
Get away, for a day
I see a hollow man, gun in hand
Gun in hand, it points my way
Y'know he follows me everywhere and everyday
I got to get away
I won't miss him if he goes away and stays away
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man
Hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man
Hollow man
It's so nice to get away
Get away, for a day
I see a hollow man, gun in hand
Gun in hand, it points my way
You know he follows me everywhere and everyday
I got to get away
I won't miss him if he goes away and stays away
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man
Hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man
Hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man
Hollow man
Just a hunter for the devil
Hollow man
Hollow man
Hollow man
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah...Embed
