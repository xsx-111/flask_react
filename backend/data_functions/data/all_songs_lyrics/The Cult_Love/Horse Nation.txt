Horse Nation LyricsAnd they come
And they come
See them prancing
They come neighing, they come
A horse nation
See them prancin', they neighing come
See them prancin'
They come neighing and they neighing come
The whole world is coming
From the four directions
Scream and shout
See them prancing
They come neighing and they come
A horse nation
See them prancing, they neighing came
See them prancing
Proudly they came
The whole world is coming
From the four directions
And I scream and shout
The whole world is coming
From the four directions
Scream and shoutEmbed
