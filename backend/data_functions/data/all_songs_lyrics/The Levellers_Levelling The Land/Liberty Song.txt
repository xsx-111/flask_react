Liberty Song LyricsThere's one too many, two too many holes
Getting bigger in the garden wall
And the people looking in are getting busy, they're getting bad
They're trying to suss it all
They're trying to get to me, to take my liberty
Got to go go, get out of here, away-way, you don't want me here
Got to go go, get out of here, go home
I said this means nothing to me
They way we were is the way I wanna be
This means nothing to me
The way we were is the way I wanna be
They're sending in the elite, complete with guns
To advertise the way to go
Faxing through the fax to make it clear
That they're the ones who know
They're trying to get to me, to take my liberty
Got to go go, get out of here, away-way, you don't want me here
Got to go go, get out of here, go home
I said this means nothing to me
They way we were is the way I wanna be
This means nothing to me
The way we were is the way I wanna beEmbed
