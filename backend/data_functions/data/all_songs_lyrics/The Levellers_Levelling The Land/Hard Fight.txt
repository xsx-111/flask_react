Hard Fight LyricsPushed from the start
Do it right and maybe you'll take a part
Call a spade a spade
Put on your blinkers maybe then you'll be made
To walk the streets
Head full of false facts you can't get back
But you wake up one day
You wake up one day
Can't see the world the same way
All the lights have changed
Your routine's down the drain
Things will never be the same
Some call it art
But it's hard to start
When you don't know the game
But if feels so good
To be understood
By yourself again
Now you've got to fight
You ain't got no wage so you ain't got no rights
Call a spade a spade
Put on your blinkers maybe then you'll be madeEmbed
