Plastic Jeezus LyricsI don't care if it rains or freezes
As long as I've got my plastic Jeezus
Riding on the dashboard of my car
I'm afraid, He'll have to go
He clashes with my radio
Plastic Jeezus, You won't get me far
Plastic Jeezus, plastic Jeezus
Riding on the dashboard of my car
I'm afraid, He'll have to go
He clashes with my radio
Plastic Jeezus, You won't get me far
I don't want kisses and I don't want hugs
Just want lots of sex and drugs
Knowing You won't get me far
Don't like walking, don't like strolling
Just like good old rock and rolling
Plastic Jeezus, You don't get me far
Plastic Jeezus, plastic Jeezus
Riding on the dashboard of my car
I'm afraid, He'll have to go
He clashes with my radio
Plastic Jeezus, You don't get me farEmbed
