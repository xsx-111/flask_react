Far from Home LyricsIt's warm by the river, the weir keeps us cleen
The woodsmoke and cigarettes are all that we need
Marking the dirt with twigs and simple words spoke
Kicking the dust so that we can just
Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play inspired
You said you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever
It's cool by the sea when the pavement is hot
We take a walk down there to see what we've got
An old man collecting fifty beautiful words
Cleaning the beach so that he can teach us to
Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play inspired
You said you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever
It's cool by the pane glass on the high street we played
But there's always a penny in the music we made
So far from home, and no means of return
Burning the bridges, so we always
Dance the dance that plays with fire
Play guitar and play inspired
You said you would leave not ever
Underneath the sky forever
We're so far from home
No means of return
There's so much that we have done
And so much we have learned

We're so far from home
No ways to return
There's so much that we have done
And so much we have learnedEmbed
