Last Days of Winter LyricsI spy with my little eye
The sun shining brightly
The clouds rolling by
The last days of winter
Now seem so far away
And everything looks green
When it used to be grey
And I've watched the change
Like the changing in my mind
And I chased the leaves
Like the words I never find
Like the people I knew
Who I sometimes see today
Some still bright like fire
And some faded away
I turn on the radio
And someone's playing a song
I turn on the news
Hear what's going on
I turn on my back
When I'm full of beer
And I turn off the news
When I don't want to hear
And I've seen a girl who looks so very sad
Nothing left but a memory of all the times she's had
And I've seen a man who looks so sad inside
Nothing left but the memories from which he cannot hide
So I learned to fight
With a Weapon Called The Word
And I learned to rise my voice
So that I'd be heard
And I learned to fight
With a weapon called the word
And I learned to raise my voice
But I've never been heardEmbed
