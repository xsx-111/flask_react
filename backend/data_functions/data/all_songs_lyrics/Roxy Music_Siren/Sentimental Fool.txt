Sentimental Fool LyricsSurely you cannot be leading me on?
Well if that's so, oh, never again will I love
How could I believe again?
How can I hold on?
Sentimental fool, knowing the fate is cruel
You ought to forget it
Yes, I know it's true
I've seen what love can do but I don't regret it
Oh you silly thing, can't you see what's happening?
You're better without it
No, that's not the case
If you were into my place then you wouldn't doubt it
Sentimental fool, who broke the golden rule?
You couldn't resist it
Though it's all in vain
I'd do it all again, just to relive one minute
A woman in love can make you feel good
You'll know what you're living for
She'll give you so much and keep you in touch
With all that's worth living for
Oh once she gets in
Through thick and through thin
She'll show you what living's for
The rhythm of love, it must go on
Can't stop
The beat of your heart is like a drum
Will it stop?Embed
