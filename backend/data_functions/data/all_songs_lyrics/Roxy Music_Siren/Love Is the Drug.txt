Love Is the Drug Lyrics
T'ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
T'ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

Aggravated
I spare for days
I troll downtown
The red light place
I jump up, bubble up
What's in store?
Love is the drug
And I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl
Where the beat goes on

Stitched up tight
Can't shake free
Love is the drug
Got a hook on me

Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Late that night
I parked my car
Staked my place
In the singles bar
Face to face
Toe to toe
Heart to heart
As we hit the floor

Lumbered up, limbo down
The locked embrace
The stumble round
I say "go," she say "yes"
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug
Got a hook in me

Oh, get that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, oh, ohh
Ohh, oh, ohh, oh
Love is, love is
Love is the drugEmbed
