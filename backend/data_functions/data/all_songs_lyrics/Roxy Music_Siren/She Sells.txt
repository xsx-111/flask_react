She Sells LyricsNow you're talking in headlines
Up to the minute and free
Stop, press, hold the front page
Up as a mirror
Are you reading me?
Watch you walking in waltz time
A jigsaw puzzle in tune
Or are you faking a straight line?
To suit yourself too soon
Rather nouveau than never
Contemporary ideal
Some natural kind of poet might slow it
But she sells more my speed
She sells country and modern
Ancient western song
Of oriental confusion
You so right, me so wrong
Now, you're fixing to fly me
Auto-erotic, please
Of the break that you're gliding
Your lingerie's a gift-wrap
Slip it to me
Nine till five
The daily grind
Made-up lies
Make up my mind
Same machine
Consuming me
Consuming you
Oh, why? Oh, why?
She sells, I need
Oh why? Love why?
She sells, I need
Oh, why? Oh, why?
She sells, I need
Oh I see why
She sells, I need
Oh, why? Oh, why?
She sells, I needEmbed
