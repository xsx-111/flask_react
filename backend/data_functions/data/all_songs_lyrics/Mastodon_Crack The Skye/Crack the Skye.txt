Crack the Skye Lyrics
Blessed visionary cut me with your sun
The rivers ran in blood
Spark fueled to fire

Deep within this endless void
Searching for a sign

The vessel forged inside of me
Watches over
Like the death of the moon

Strike the shepherd, sheep will scatter
Mountains of despair

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face

The screaming arrows tear through my soul
In the dawn your face is haunting
White ghostly dreams of old
Weight of world is on your shoulder
Hear the voice of gold

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face


Violent soul under my control
Violent soul takes its final toll
Violent soul under my control
Violent soul takes its final toll


Desperate heathens flock to sirens
Guard your heartache well

Momma don't let them take her
Don't let them take her down
At least alone
Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one
Her spirit's too strong

I can see the pain
It's written all over your face
I can see the pain
You can make it all go away5Embed
