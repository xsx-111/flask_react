Quintessence Lyrics
The demon skin is covered in fine mist
Opened his hand in my hand
Holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
The space time paradigm

Omnipresence
Primal instincts

Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go

Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go

Letting me free the quintessence
In fine mist
Opened his hand in center
Holding my eyes to the future
Hovering above myself
Letting loose the guided
Punching these holes in my head
Losing my skin to the landslide

Omnipresence
Primal instincts

Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Calling reason
Finding you
These wild hearts run
Even deeper
Burning through
These wild hearts run

Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go
Letting go

Shield failure
Speed farewell
Shield failure
Speed farewell2Embed
