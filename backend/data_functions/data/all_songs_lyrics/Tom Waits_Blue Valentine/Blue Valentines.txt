Blue Valentines LyricsShe sends me blue valentines all the way from Philadelphia
To mark the anniversary of someone that I used to be
And it feels like a warrant is out for my arrest
Baby, you got me checkin in my rearview mirror
That's why I'm always on the run
It's why I changed my name
And I didn't think you'd ever find me here
To send me blue valentines like half-forgotten dreams
Like a pebble in my shoe as I walk these streets
And the ghost of your memory, baby, it's the thistle in the kiss
It's the burglar that can break a rose's neck
It's the tattooed broken promise I gotta hide beneath my sleeve
I'm gonna see you every time I turn my back, ohh
Oh you send me blue valentines though I try to remain at large
They're insisting that our love must have a eulogy
Why do I save all this madness here in the nightstand drawer?
There to haunt upon my shoulders
Baby, I know I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
With this blind and broken heart that sleeps beneath my lapel
Instead these blue valentines remind me of my cardinal sin
I can never wash the guilt or get these bloodstains off my hands
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey to make these nightmares go away
And I cut my bleedin' heart out every night
And I'm gonna die just a little more on each St. Valentine's Day
Don't you remember I promised I would write you?
These blue valentines
Blue valentines
