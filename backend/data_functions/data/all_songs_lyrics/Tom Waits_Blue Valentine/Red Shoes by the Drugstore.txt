Red Shoes by the Drugstore LyricsShe wore red shoes by the newsstand
As the rain splashed the nickel
And spilled like chablis all along the midway
There's a little blue jay
In a red dress on a sad night
One straw in a root beer
A compact with a cracked mirror
A bottle of evening in Paris perfume
What's this sad tune
He told her to wait in by the magazines
To take care of some business it seems
Bring a raincoat
Bring a suitcase
Bring your dark eyes
And wear those red shoes
There's a dark huddle at the bus stop
Umbrellas arranged in a sad bouquet
Lil Caesar got caught
He was going down to second
He was cooled
Changing stations on the chamber
To steal a diamond ring
From a jewelry store for his baby
He loved the way she looked
In those red shoes
She waited by the drugstore
Caesar had never been this late before
The dogs bayed the moon
And rattled their chain
And the cold jingle of taps in a puddle
Was the burglar alarm
Snitchin' on Caesar
The rain washes memories from the sidewalks
And the hounds splash the nickel full of soldiers
And Santa Claus is drunk
In the ski room
And it's Christmas Eve
In a sad caf√©
When the moon gets its way
There's a little blue jay by the newsstand
Red shoes
Red shoes
So meet me tonight by the drugstore
Meet me tonight by the drugstore
Meet me tonight by the drugstore
Goin out tonight
Goin out tonight
Goin out tonight
Wear your red shoes
Red shoes
Red shoes
Red shoes
Red shoesEmbed
