Wrong Side of the Road LyricsPut a dead cat on the railroad tracks
When the wolf-bane's blooming by the tressel
And get the eyeball of a rooster
And the stones from a ditch
And wash 'em down with bilge water
And say you'll never snitch
Take the buttons from a yellow jacket
The feather from a buzzard
The blood from a bounty hunter's cold black heart
Catch the tears of a widow in a thimble made of glass
Tell your mama and your papa they can kiss your ass
Poison all the water in the wishin' well
And hang all them scarecrows from a Sycamore tree
Burn down all them honeymoons, put 'em in a pillow case
Wait next to the switchblades at the amusement park for me
Strangle all the Christmas carols, scratch out all the prayers
Tie 'em up with barbed wire and push 'em down the stairs
And I'll whittle you a pistol for keepin' nightmares off your blinds
Them sons of bitches always seem to sneak up from behind
Siphon all the gas from your daddy's pickup truck
Fill up Johnny's T-bird, I got a couple bucks
Put on a little perfume and wear a ribbon in your hair
Careful that you don't wake up the hounds
Tear a bolt of lightning from the side of the sky
Throw it in the cedar chest, if you want, I'll tell you why
Bring me the gear shift knob from a '49 Merc
Lie down here beside me, let me hold you in the dirt
You're gonna tremble
Tear the throat out of the night
Sink your teeth into my shoulder
Dig your nails into my back
Tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve
You'll be a woman when I catch you
Come, baby, fall in love with me
With my double-barrel shotgun and a whole box of shells
We'll celebrate the Fourth of July
We'll do 100 miles an hour spending someone else's dough
Drive all the way to Reno on the wrong side of the road
The wrong side of the road
On the wrong side of the road
The wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
Wrong side of the road
