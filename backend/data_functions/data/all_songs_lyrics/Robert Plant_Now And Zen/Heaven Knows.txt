Heaven Knows LyricsA brand new human being, razor sharp, all firm and tan
All clean, all pure with a thirty-second attention span
As the clock strikes twelve, and we're ready for party games
You play blind man's bluff, and I'll play out charades
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) why you take an eye for an eye
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
You were pumping iron while I was pumping irony
Now, I find myself fully occupied and half alive
With your head, heart, arms and legs wrapped around my family pride, oh
See the whites of their eyes, then shoot
With all the romance of the Tonton Macoute
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) why you take an eye for an eye
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
You were pumping iron while I was pumping irony
Nothing will show as we're shedding our clothes
But then, I suppose anything goes, anything goes, mm
But then, I suppose that anything, anything goes
(Heaven knows)
(Heaven knows)
(Heaven knows)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah (Heaven knows)
(Heaven knows) oo
(Heaven knows)
Oo, yeah (Heaven knows)
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
Tell me, please, please, please
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool, fool, fool, fool, fool, fool
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
(Heaven knows) what comes over me
(Heaven knows) what kind of fool am I
Tell me, ooEmbed
