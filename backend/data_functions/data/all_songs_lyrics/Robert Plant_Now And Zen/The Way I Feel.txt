The Way I Feel LyricsSee what I'm driving at, and I'm back behind the wheel
I'm just a little nervous, it's something to do with the way I feel
Mm, with the way I feel, with the way I feel
Trouble understanding, nothing too out of hand
A little overloaded, some kinda storm in the heart of the man
Oh, mm, in the heart of the man
I must have heard it somewhere
I can't quite remember, mm
Look what I've turned into, and I'm back inside the car
We traveled in luxury, a little celebration went a touch too far
Mm, just a touch too far, just a touch too far
I must have passed it somewhere
Mm, now, I can't quite remember, oh
Oh, but here it comes again
The mirror tries to please me
The image wouldn't stay
The stranger is too perfect
Take my breath away
The future rides beside me
Tomorrow in his hand
The stranger turns to greet me
And take me by the hand
Shame, oo
Oo, look what I've turned into, and I'm back inside the car
We traveled in luxury, a little celebration went a touch too far
Mm, just a touch too far, just a touch
It's something to do with the way I feel, with the way I feel, oh, oo
The mirror tries to please me
The image wouldn't stay
The stranger is too perfect
Take my breath away
The future rides beside me
Tomorrow in his hand
The stranger turns to greet me
And take me by the hand
The mirror tries to please me
The image wouldn't stay
The stranger is too perfect
Take my breath awayEmbed
