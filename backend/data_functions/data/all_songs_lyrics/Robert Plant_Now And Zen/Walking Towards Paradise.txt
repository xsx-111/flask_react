Walking Towards Paradise Lyrics(Ah)
(Ah)
Heart's on fire
Mm, burning fast
Love, desire
Oh, make sweet love last
This one we'll sing now
Soon, you'll finally see
All this mystery
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Oo, wouldn't it be nice?
Walking towards paradise (ah)
Walking towards paradise
On days like this
Nights confirm
You know so much
So much to learn
Soon you'll finally see
All this mystery
Now, wouldn't it, wouldn't it, wouldn't it be nice?
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Let's go, walking towards paradise (ah)
Walking towards paradise (ah)
Walking towards paradise (ah) when I'm six-six-six-six-sixteen
Walking towards paradise (ah), oh, now come on, come on, come on
(Let's take a walk)
()
Walking towards paradise, come with me, now, come with me, now come with me
Walking towards paradise, we've started
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
Walking towards paradise (ah)
Walking towards paradise, oh, yeah (ah)
Walking towards paradise (ah)
Walking towards paradise, ah-haEmbed
