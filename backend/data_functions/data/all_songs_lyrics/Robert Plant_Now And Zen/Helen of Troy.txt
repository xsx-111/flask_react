Helen of Troy LyricsOh, yeah
She walks like a gunslinger
Laughs through the shots
Got some lead from the hips
She's so hot she can't stop
Oh, yeah
Oh, she loves like a steam train
Out all the time
She fights like a bobcat
Got some fame on her mind
Tell me why
Oh, tell me why
Oh, yeah
Oo, yeah
Fire where the heart is
Sweet home on the range
Call of the wild
See the beast with no name
Tell me why
Oh, tell me why
The world is waiting here for you
Can't you see them anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Can't you see them anymore, anymore, anymore?

The world is waiting there for you
Don't you just hear it anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Don't you feel them anymore, anymore, anymore?
She's tall in the saddle
Got a rose in her teeth
She's Hell incarnate
Just walkin' down your street
Oh, oh, yeah
Now, you've seen the line on the glory
From the heart of the flame
From the, I don't know a story
But your song never changed
Tell me why
Oh, tell me why
The world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel it anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel it anymore, anymore, anymore?
My world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel him anymore?
The world is waiting there for you
Can't you feel him anymore, anymore, anymore?
Yes, oh, yes, oh, yeah
Oo, yeah, yeah
Shoot, shoot
She walks like a gunslinger
Shoot, shoot
Oh, will I see your shots?
Shoot, shoot
Mm, she walks like a gunslinger
Shoot, shoot
Oh, she laughs, laughs, laughs
Oo, no love from the hips now
Oo, she got lead from the hips now
Now, lead, hot lead, hot leadEmbed
