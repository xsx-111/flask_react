Dance on My Own LyricsOh, yeah
Oh, yeah
There's a girl lives on my block
Mm, there's a girl lives on my block
There's a girl lives on my block
She's drivin' me mad, she's drivin' me mad, she's drivin' me
And I don't know what to do
No, I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
'Cause I want her so bad, yes, I want her so bad, yes, I want her so
(Oh) I'm happy dancin', dancin', dance on my own
(Oh) I'm happy dancin', dancin', dance on my own
Oh, yes, no, no, no, no
Gonna dance until I drop
Oh, I'm gonna dance until I drop
Oh, gonna move until I stop
Gonna twist and shout, go spin it around, gonna do it once more
(Oh) I'm happy dancin', dancin', dance on my own
(Oh) I'm happy dancin', dancin', dance on my own
And I don't care if I die
Oh, I don't care if I die, no
And I don't care if I die
Oh, gonna have my fun, gonna do it again, gonna do it once more
(Oh) I'm happy dancin', baby, I dance on my own
(Oh) I'm happy dancin', I'm dancin', I dance on my own
(Oh) Hey, I'm happy dancin', I'm dancin', I dance on my own
(Oh) I'm happy dancin', I'm dancin', I dance, dance, dance
(Ha ha ha ha)
Na na na na

Move me, move me, move me, move me, yeah
Yeah, that's right
Oo, yeah, oo, yeah
