Tall Cool One LyricsOoh
I'm like a strange cat runnin' in the heat of the night
I've got a fire in my eyes, got a date with delight
Some kinda moaning in the heart of the storm
I'm gonna love you so hard, you'll want your loving done
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Uh, with my one hand loose, I aim to satisfy
You like my loving machine, I like your bloodshot eye
Real gone girl, jumping back with the beat
Oh, yeah, I'm your tall cool one with the crazy feet
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so tall, and you're so cute
Let's play wild like the wildcats do
You're gonna rock your tall cool one
I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that I
You stroll, you jump, you're hot, and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one, and I'm built to please
You stroll, you jump, you're hot, and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one, and I'm built to please
Ooh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Oh

No, no, no
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Move over, mister, step on back in the crowd
Oh, yeah, she's a whole lotta sister, 'bout to drive 'em wild
Lotta places I've been, lotta names, lotta words
No one compares to my real gone girl
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so tall, and you're so cute
Let's play wild like wildcats do
You're gonna rock your tall cool one
I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that, I'm gonna say that I
You stroll, you jump, you're hot, and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one, and I'm built to please
You stroll, you jump, you're hot, and you tease
'Cause I'm your tall cool one, and I'm built to please
Oh, yeah
Now, baby
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ooh
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
(I'll be your tall cool one)
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Hey, hey, mama
Going down, I'm going down, going, going, going
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Hey, hey, mama, hey, hey, mama, ooh
I'll be your tall cool one
Lighten up, lighten up (Hey, hey, mama)
Lighten up, lighten up
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up, baby, I'm in love with you
Lighten up
Hey, hey, mama
Lighten upEmbed
