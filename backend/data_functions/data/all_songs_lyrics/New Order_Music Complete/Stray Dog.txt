Stray Dog Lyrics
The secret of our happiness is unconditional love
I just wanted to make her smile
And make it last for a while
Do all the things you can do at home
Maybe once in a while get away somewhere special
Create a memory that would last forever
In those days we spent together
They say the secret of our happiness is unconditional love
And brotherhood and trying to be good and trying not to drink
But I can't stop drinking, it's in my blood
In and out of trouble, while keeping yourself alive
Not giving cold down in the wastes of the grim and mire
In the dark and the sun of the mire
Not getting wasted, not being a cheat, a killer or a liar
Not getting pulled down in the wastes of the mire
In the darkness of the mire, in the darkness of the mire
I'd rather be a lover than a liar
I'd rather be a lover than a supplier
If the secret of happiness is unconditional love
Why don't you miss me?
Well, sometimes I do, like when you're away
And I feel a need for you
I feel it like the day we met all those years ago
Those times were hard to hold on to
But nothing stays the same
We are forever moving, like the dancing of the flame
Life is so unstable, always changing, it never stays the same
Like the atom and that bomb that causes so much pain
So I came in from the cold with nowhere left to go
And I gave away my freedom and the calling of the wild
So that I could be with you, I chose to be with you
So I came in from the cold and I chose to be with you
I chose
To be (growls)
With you
(Growls, hisses, snarls)
Chose to be with youEmbed
