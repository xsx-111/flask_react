Tutti Frutti Lyrics
Tutti frutti
Amore mio
Tutti frutti
No
Non è ancora il momento di entrare
Non è ancora il momento di…

Life is so crazy these days
I don't know how to adjust
Are we the master or slave?
Do we need passion or lust?
Are we just caught in a daze?
So many words in a phrase
Life is so crazy these days
Life is so crazy these days


You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low
I'm paper in your hand
I'm under your command
And I'll never let you go
'Cause you're that girl
Tutti Frutti


I had a beautiful dream
For a picture so serene
But I don't know what it means - love
I just want your love
Generations lost in space
Trying to find the human race
We're living in a state of grace
Where every scholar means a dollar

And sometimes I just can't go on
I feel like I'm a setting sun
I know my eyes are burning bright
I just need you to make it right

You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low
I'm paper in your hand
I'm under your command
And I'll never let you go
'Cause you're that girl
Tutti Frutti

You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low

You've got me where it hurts
But I don't really care
'Cause I know I'm OK
Whenever you are there
You take me to a place
I always wanna go
You always make me high
Whenever I feel low
Whenever I feel low
Whenever I feel low
Whenever I feel low
'Cause you're that girl
Tutti Frutti

Non mi interessa il nome vero
Non mi interessa la vita reale
Quella canzone
E tu? Sei tutti fruttiEmbed
