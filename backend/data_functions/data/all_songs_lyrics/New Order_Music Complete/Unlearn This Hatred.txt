Unlearn This Hatred LyricsHeartache (x16)

Two steps forward, one step back
Two steps forward, one step back


Unlearn this hatred, you've got to keep it true
Let’s not back date it, but let's not pretend it's new
Girl, we’ve got to take it
When I remember you undo this hatred
Cause I’m a fan of you

Two steps forward, one step back, Waiting for your will to crack
Make a sign that I can see, tune into my frequency
Take me to another place, help me win this human race
Maybe it's time if you got faith, for your healing I can't wait


You're the prey and I'm the hunter, every day I think of you
I'm your automatic lover, show me what I have to do
And now Heart ache
Is it for I am?
And it's your fate, to make me your man
Two steps forward, one step back, Waiting for your will to crack
Make a sign that I can see, tune into my frequency
Take me to another place, help me win this human race
Maybe it's time if you got faith, for your healing I can't wait


Unlearn this hatred, you've got to keep it true
Let's not back date it, but let's not pretend it's new
Girl, we've got to take it
When I remember you undo this hatred
Cause I’m a fan of you

Two steps forward, one step back, Waiting for your will to crack
Make a sign that I can see, tune into my frequency
Take me to another place, help me win this human race
Maybe it's time if you got faith, for your healing I can't waitEmbed
