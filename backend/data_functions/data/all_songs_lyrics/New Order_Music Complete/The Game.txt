The Game Lyrics

How much we tried, but are we hurt?
In this empty space, in which we live
We will not bend, we will not give
We're waging war, while raising kids


It's so clear, but we can't see it
It's in the air that we're breathing
It's so near, yet we can't touch it
But it is here and we love it
For life is good and it's forever
It's in our blood and our endeavor


Higher than the sky, taller than a man can reach
And if we break up, we are not here
These are the times in which we live
These are the times in which we live
These are the times in which we live

It's so clear, but we can't see it
It's in the air that we're breathing
It's so near, yet we can't touch it
But it is here and we love it
For life is pure and it is special
I want more precious metal
It's not over and it's not hopeful
For this is life and it's immortal
