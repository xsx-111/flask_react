California Saga (California) Lyrics
On my way to sunny California
On my way to spend another sunny day

Water, water
Get yourself in the cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
(The sun shines brightly down on the bay)
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away
(Take your mind away, take your mind away)

Have you ever been south of Monterey?
Barrancas carve the coast line
And the chaparral flows to the sea
'Neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay?
The south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed
They don't need electricity

Water, water
Cool cascades of clear, clear water
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze
(Get yourself in that water)
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way
(Up the mountain's way, up the mountain's way)
Have you ever been down Salinas way
Where Steinbeck found the valley?
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be?
There, the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept cyprus tree

Water, water (Get, get yourself in that)
Get yourself in that cool, clear, water
(Get yourself in that, get yourself in that water)
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
(Get yourself in that water)
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
(Take your mind away, take your mind away)

Have you ever been to a festival
The Big Sur congregation?
Where Country Joe will do his show
And he'll sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air are one big family
Yeah, the people there love to sing and share
Their new found libertyEmbed
