Better Get Back In Bed Lyrics
Pied piper, I'd better get back in bed
I hope I'll see you again
Pied piper, I'd better get back in bed
I hope I'll see you again
Pied piper, I'd better get back in bed
Hope I'll see you again
Pied piper, you saw me running along

30 seconds after he was in bed, he fell back to sleep. The next morning he had forgotten all about what had happened the night before. But when night time came once again, his thoughts somehow found their way back to remembering the fascinating episode of the night before
He turned out his bedroom light and sat in his favorite chair. Thoughts danced in his head for a while. "Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there," he said. "I wonder what would happen."Embed
