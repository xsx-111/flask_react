Only With You Lyrics
Love is so many things that I feel
I have only felt with you
Only with you

And then there are the things that we do
That I've only done with you
Only with you

Before, love, it had always had its up and downs
Until the love I finally found

I know one thing for sure I wanna do
I wanna spend this life with you
Only with you

Yes, it's true
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with you, ooh
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with you, ooh
Yes, it's true, ooh
I wanna spend my life with you
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with you, ooh
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with youEmbed
