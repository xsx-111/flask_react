Magic Transistor Radio Lyrics
He sat up in his open window
Looking quietly down at the path
A firefly flew in his room and flew right out again
Down jumped the prince
And he went again to find his radio
(Magic transistor radio)
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
As he made his way he could hear something once again
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
There was that transistor up on the same tree
Then from inside of it came a strange voice

(Hello I'm the Pied Piper from the far away land of Night)
(Nobody knows anything about my existence)
(I only want to know kids)
(Late at night when people are sleeping)
(I go into their old radios and turn them into magic transistors)
(And fly outside with them)
(I come from such a far away land of Night)
(That I'm fascinated with the funny music I hear on your radios)
(You are the first to know of me)
(You can't see me I'm hidden)
(But you can see the green glow I make)
(I heard you laugh last night)
(I figured that you would be amused by me)
(Listen to this)Embed
