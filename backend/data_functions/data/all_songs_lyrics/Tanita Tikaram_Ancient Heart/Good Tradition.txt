Good Tradition Lyrics
There's a good tradition of love and hate
Staying by the fireside
There's a good tradition of love and hate
Staying by the fireside
And though the rain may fall
Your father's calling you
You still feel safe inside
And though your ma's too proud
Your brother's ignoring you
You still feel safe inside

Oh, was this solo?
Was this yesterday?
Was this true for you?
'Cos while all the rest have taken time
This didn't do a lot for you

And the corners laced with memories
Tell you how it used to be
Your mother smiles
The children play
And all the bad things happen
Miles away
And strong feelings
Never bother you
You hold your head up
While the rest of us try to

Oh, call the stations
Call the people
We all want to know
'Cause while all the rest have taken time
You don't wanna know

Well, there's a good tradition of love and hate
Staying by the fireside
There's a good tradition of love and hate
Staying by the fireside
And though the rain may fall
Your father's calling you
You still feel safe inside
And though your ma's too proud
Your brother's ignoring you
You still feel safe inside

Oh, was this solo?
Was this yesterday?
Was this true for you?
'Cause of all the choices you have made
This didn't do a lot for you2Embed
