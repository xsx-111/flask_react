Sighing Innocents LyricsGive me a stand
A standing ovation, baby
Give me a road
Which I can tail
You don't know nothing, baby
So don't pretend
Or you might pay
Cost
It's costing me nothing, baby
I might feel some shame
But I don't care
And if you won't mind
Just moving the fireside, baby
I'd rather be cold
Than lying over there
No, this ain't sighing innocents
This ain't sighing innocents
No this ain't sighing innocents
I'm just trying to follow you
And if you walk
I might just tag along
It only be shop talk, some
Well that's something to do
Or I might take a walk down
By the river, baby
But no I won't
No I won't be waiting for you
No, this ain't sighing innocents
This ain't sighing innocents
No this ain't sighing innocents
I'm just trying to follow you
Sorry but sense
That (no one will miss you)
That no one will miss you
If you die
They might send a wreath
They might send a reason
They might send a reason
But us, we know
Join in the sus
It's always the same man
He's taking a stroll
And then they tie him to his ghost
I know it's sad
But you never listen
No, you never listen
You just drive homeEmbed
