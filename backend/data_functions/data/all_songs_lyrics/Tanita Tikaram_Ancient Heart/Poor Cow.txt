Poor Cow Lyrics
Today is my birthday
I stay outside the hall
Inside sit the butterflies
For the butterfly ball
All the boys are graded now
They come in their white socks, flat tops
And somehow
They find a place
All the boys are winning now
They play all the tricks with smiles
And a sorry past
For poor cow

Their own room and winter trees
Never touched these girls before
They hear the car stereo
And they know what life is for
All the boys are weary now
Listening to the family sing-song
Family say-so
Must carve, must carve poor cow
Slice her up, slice her up, slice her up
Poor cow
Slice her up, slice her up, slice her up
Poor cow
Yup

Today is my birthday
I stay outside the hall
Inside sit the butterflies
For the butterfly ballEmbed
