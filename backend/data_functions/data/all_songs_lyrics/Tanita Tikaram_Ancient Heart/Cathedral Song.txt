Cathedral Song Lyrics
I saw
From the cathedral
You were watching me
Yes, I saw
From the cathedral
What I should be
So, take my time
And take my lies
'Cause all the others
They want to take my life

And I watch with an intentâ€”basic
Well, it's the same for you
You hold your hand
And it's all fine-laced and
What would you make me do?

So, take my time
And take my lies
'Cause all the others
They want to take my life
Serious for the winter time
To wrench my soul
Whole cotton, whole cotton ears
But I know there must be
Yes, I know there must be
Yes, I know there must be a place to go

And you saw me
From the cathedral
Well, I'm an ancient heart
Yes, you saw me
From the cathedral
And here we are just falling apart
You catch me
I am tired
I want all that you are


And I saw
From the cathedral
You were leaving me
Yes, I saw
From the cathedral
You could not see to see
So, take my time
And take my lies
'Cause all the others
They want to take my lifeEmbed
