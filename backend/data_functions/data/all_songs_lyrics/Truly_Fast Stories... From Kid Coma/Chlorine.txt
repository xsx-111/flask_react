Chlorine LyricsEveryone loves the sun
Any other person would be having fun
I need no one since we came undone
I need no one
The sirens scream on an empty page
The people sleep with a distant rage
It's such a drag to set her free
Feels like there ain't no one in this world for me
A blackened sky in the days ahead
In the days ahead, in the days ahead
We'll be only
Lonely, Chlorine
Are you lonеly
Like a bad dream?
Shoot it straight right through my brain
Memoriеs crash and burst into flames
I don't know how I ever thought of you
I closed my eyes and you were coming right through
With your deadly songs, with your deadly songs
With your deadly songs
You're standing there with your long black hair
With your long black hair
With your long black hair
And we're only
Lonely, Chlorine
Are you lonely
Like a bad dream?
Is your love open?
No other person could make me remember
This whole summer the way you do
Tell it to me true, are you lonely too?
You're lonely too, and the siren screams
And you're little sister screams, 'cause she's lonely too
You're lonely too
And we're only
Lonely, Chlorine
Are you lonely
Like a bad dream?
Make a wish
Is your love open, open, open, open?Embed
