Hot Summer 1991 LyricsLied too long in the sun
Came undone in the sun
Take a little walk into the hot summer sun
Take a little ride and now the whole summer's gone
Rip your match and let's run
Lonely days in the sun
Take a little walk into the hot summer sun
You used to tag along and now the whole summer's gone
Annette looks ready for inspection
Dying to the radio station
In love with a stranger's face
Summer's gone
Summer's gone
Summer's goneEmbed
