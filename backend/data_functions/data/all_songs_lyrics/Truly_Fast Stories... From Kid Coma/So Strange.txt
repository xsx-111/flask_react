So Strange LyricsIn your room, on your floor under the moon
In the rain, in your hair, in my brain
I'm reeling, this feeling is strange
I'm reeling in your violet ray
So strange
In your car, under the melting stars
On the way, from the gutter to the bar
I'm reeling, this feeling is strange
This season our treason is sane
So strange, it's very strange
I'm reeling, your mouth is strange
Jeweled eyes, warm thighs, sweet face
So strange, it's very strange
I'm reeling, this feeling is strange
This season I'm feeling the change
So strangeEmbed
