Blue Flame Ford Lyrics
I realize...this night, realize...what's mine
Watching the ground... watching the ground
You're turning around... you're turning around
I realize...this night, realize...what's mine
Watching the ground... watching the ground
You're turning around... you're turning around

In a Blue Flame Ford, spinning on all fours
In a Blue Flame Ford, you look like 2024

I realize...this night, realize... it's a lie
Henry had a plan, beyond his factories man
"Pin em to the ground", he wanted to pin em to the ground

In a Blue Flame Ford, walking cross the road
In a Blue Flame Ford, headlights blind a pregnant doe
Pedal to the floor, impact felt slow

Headlights
Headlights
Headlights
Look into your headlights
Will the stars still show, will the moon still glow?
Realize this night, Realize nothing's mine
You're turning around, you're turning around
You slay me now, you slay me now

In a Blue Flame Ford, spinning on all fours
In a Blue Flame Ford, you look like 2024
In a Blue Flame Ford, slant six is rolling on all fours
In a Blue Flame Ford, you look like you never need a home

You dominate the road, you look like an emaculate whore
It's lying in the road, it's lying in the road
Look into your eyes, look into your eyesEmbed
