Strangling LyricsTwirling little girls pull the roof to the ground
Exploding little boys blow the walls straight down
It's just strange, it's strangling
That is why I'm tangled now
It's strange, that is why
Warming, wondering what would you want?
What will you want?
There you are, the angel of Mars
The whispering stars said you're the fairest one by far
We were hanging out with Ice Cream Sandy
This is where I want to be right now
It's just strange, I'm tangled madly
But the war is always on in her field of screams
Warming, wondering what would you want?
What will you want?
There you are, the angel of Mars
The whispering stars said you'rе the fairest one by far
Strangling, that is why
Insidе the violence of a lightning beam
Ripping through the clouds over two cities
Love strikes thee with a rainy day kiss
Electricity sends a rainy day wish
Thunderstorm keeps you warm
Warm and calm for the early morning
There you are, the angel of Mars
The whispering stars said you're the fairest one by far
Strangling, that is whyEmbed
