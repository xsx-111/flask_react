Tragic Telepathic (Soul Slasher) LyricsWho tears with jagged nails
Licking red lips moves with committed hips
In the twilight gleaming out!
Right now!
Soul Slasher
In the twilight gleaming out!
Call him out!
Kid Coma, x-ray
Hospital, neglected rainy days
When his thoughts shoot out
To the other side of town
His thoughts shoot out!
Call him out!
Soul Slasher
Twisting the sheets, sweat in my bed
Shivering underneath, in the twilight gleaming out!
Slide, slide
Gleaming out!
Out!
Soul Slasher
