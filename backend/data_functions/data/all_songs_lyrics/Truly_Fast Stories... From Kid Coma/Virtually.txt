Virtually LyricsI have the power
To wish you away
I have the power
To wish you to stay
Sometimes I have the power
To make wishes come true
The starlight knows it if
I'm wishing for you
Virtually, virtually
Now your emotions choking you
Now your oceans capsized thee
Love is a holograph till you cry
Feels like the moon shaking
In the sky
Twin suns shining on the planets around
Come call the rain
That makes the lovers drown
Virtually, virtually
Now I have the power
To wish you away
Now I have the power
To wish you to stay
Sometimes I have the power
To make wishеs come true
The starlight knows it if
I'm wishing for you
Lovе is a holography till you cry
Feels like the moon shaking
In the sky
Twins suns shining on the planets around
Come call the rain
That makes the lover's drown
Virtually, virtually
Virtually, virtuallyEmbed
