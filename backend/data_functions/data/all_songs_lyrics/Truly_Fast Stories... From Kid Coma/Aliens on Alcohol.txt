Aliens on Alcohol LyricsWell I'm on the road
With a lonely ghost
Sipping rum spilling coke
Come over to tonight
Don't call
We're tipping the bottle over
Aliens on alcohol
Glitter at the ball
They don't know who to call
I took em downtown
Where's Margaret tonight?
Don't know
We're tipping the bottle over
Aliens on alcohol
Glitter at the ball
They don't know who to call
I took em downtown
I took em downtown
I took em downtown
I took em downtownEmbed
