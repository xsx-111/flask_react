Blue Lights LyricsIt's years from you, it's all that we can do
Undressing in a daze, hit by the future blues
As far as mercury, sand whistling pier
Farewell sighs, orgasmic highs
Remember me from 1983
It felt so hard to find a girl in a right-wing world
You drag the poems out of me, I put it right into you
We laugh and scream; it's all that we can do
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
In the winter of constellations
Engage in listless observation
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights are turning us on
The blue lights areEmbed
