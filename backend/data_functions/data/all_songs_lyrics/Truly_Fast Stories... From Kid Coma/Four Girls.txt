Four Girls Lyrics(Listen, September is rolling her eyes
Listen, antennas with low level lies.)
One thousand clowns rode into town
Came here and said "give me something now"
Four girls, four worlds, four more
My boyfriend is broken shells hang from her neck
My girl's friend is loaded she burns Martian Red
(Roses & roses & gasoline wine
Listen when summer is glowing on time)
Jackrabbit was cooking in the kitchen there
Onе thousand clowns walked in without a care
Four girls, four worlds, four more
To makе it all worthwhile
Smoking on my couch blood dripping
From their mouth
One thousand clowns traveled north, east, west & south
Four girls, four worlds, four more
To make it all worthwhile
To make it all worthwhileEmbed
