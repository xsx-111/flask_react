Angelhead LyricsIndelible are the next few days
Jupiter is penetrated Jupiter got laid
Little Leslie what did you dream?
"I dreamt of Cindy & her thorazine screams
& her perma teen light
& I've seen her loose her mind."
Howl... rolling on the floor
Howl... rolling on the floor
All systems fail angels, get out of jail
(spells for dreams, perma teens, endlessly entwined)
Leslie & Cindy? what do you think?
Should we try? should we die?
Should wе do anything?
All I want in this desperate night
Is your hoop of hovеring light
Howl... rolling on the floor
Howl... rolling on the floor
Howl... rolling on the floor
Howl... rolling on the floorEmbed
