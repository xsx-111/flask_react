Once Burned Lyrics
So few and far between
Here's a mood I've never seen you in
I should have known not to ask you why
And set myself up for one big, long cry

Once burned and twice removed
Thought I made it now but nothing's proved
Set in my mind not to push too hard
And now I wind up back in your backyard, whoa

No one cares about the loser
No one gets a second chance
Even you, even me, if it's through
Don't you see that it's one thing if I should lose again
But to walk away twice is a crying shame, oh

Once burned and twice removed
Thought I made it now but...Embed
