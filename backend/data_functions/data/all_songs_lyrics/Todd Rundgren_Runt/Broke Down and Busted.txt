Broke Down and Busted Lyrics
Look at this empty face
Look at this broken frame
I have been no other place
And you know I've heard no other name

How can you keep me so?
How can I let it go?

I look the worst that you've ever seen
Is it too much to ask what that's supposed to mean?
You've been playin' around and I played the part
Of a broke down man with a busted heart

Reach out a hand and see
What you have made of me
Take a good hard look and then
Close your eyes and ask yourself again

How can you keep me so?
How can I let it go?
You know that I would go anywhere
That I could go in my old wheelchair
Though I wouldn't get far 'til it fell apart
I'm a broke down man with a busted heart


How can you keep me so?
How can I let it go?

You know my state as you hear my song
You'll change your mind if I live that long
Couldn't start it again, nothing's left to start
But a busted man with a broke-down heartEmbed
