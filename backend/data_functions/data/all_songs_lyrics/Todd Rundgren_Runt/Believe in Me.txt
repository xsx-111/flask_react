Believe in Me Lyrics
Please don't look at me that way
I can hardly say what I have to say
There is nothing that I haven't told to you
That I didn't believe you knew

I am thinking of another time
I could feel you thinking that you were mine
Now I hold out my hands 'til my arms get tired
And you wait on the other side

You and me, we're both the same
Don't let me take all the blame
I promise that I will do all it takes
To make up for my mistakes

So, I'm trying hard to be the man
And it's not a hard thing to understand
For I think that my being would cease to be
If you didn't believe in me

If you didn't believe in meEmbed
