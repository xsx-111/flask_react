Numb LyricsYou put a hole through me
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
I put a hole through you
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
You put a hole through me
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
You put a hole through me
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
You put a hole through me
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
I put a hole through you
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
You put a hole through me
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
I put a hole through you
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
I put a hole through you
I put a hole through you
You put a hole through me
(Numb, numb, numb, numb)
Numb, numb, numb, numb
'Cause I'm numb (x16)1Embed
