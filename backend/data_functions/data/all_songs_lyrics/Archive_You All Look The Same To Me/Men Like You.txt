Men Like You LyricsIt’s men like you
That make me sick
Start me off
So Come on
It’s men like you
I’d like to crack
Your head wide open
And leave you smokin
So come on
It’s men like you
Who think you feature
A god like creature
A world class teacher
Spineless Fool
Retarded Mule
Backward Dog
Philistine Hog
Backward Dog
Philistine Hog
So come on
It’s men like you
A low life loser
Second rate user
Your mother tried to lose you
On the back of a bus
On the back of a bus
She tried to save us
So come onEmbed
