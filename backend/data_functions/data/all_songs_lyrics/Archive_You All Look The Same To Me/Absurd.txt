Absurd LyricsWithout you
I haven’t a clue
What to make of my daze
Oh my lord
It’s so absurd
I hardly noticed you
Without you
My eyes are as blue
As a night in a jail
Oh my lord
I can’t pretend
I hardly noticed you
Without you
There’s no arms around my world
Although words weren’t always spoken
I’m left here broken
But oh my lord
I hardly noticed youEmbed
