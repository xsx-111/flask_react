Diana LyricsGive me love for goodness' sake
Make me feel the love we make
I wonder while we're standing here
All the questions answered here
Love is one big mystery
Different kind of fantasy
Ahead there lies a past for us
Kisses we can trust
Diana, I love you - you opened up my heart
Diana, I love you - you gave my life a start
I adore you, I should have said it long ago
I adore you, I think it's time I let you know
I adore you, yes I do, you're my time of day
And I'm here to say
Give me love for goodness' sake
Make me feel the love we make
I wonder while we're standing here
All the questions answered here
Love is one big mystery
Different kind of fantasy
Ahead there lies a past for us
Kisses we can trust
Diana, I love you - you opened up my heart
Diana, I love you - you gave my life a start
I adore you, I should have said it long ago
I adore you, I think it's time I let you know
I adore you, yes I do, you're my time of day
And I'm here to say
Love..... (pa, pa, pa, pa, pa)
I'm singing love... love...
Ah, ah, ah... (pa, pa, pa, pa, pa)
I'm singing love...ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh...
I adore you and I'm here to say...
Oh, I'm talkin' about love
Ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh...
Diana, you are the kind
To bring true love into my mind
Baby... oh, oh, ooh, ooh, baby
You are my time of day
Yes, I've been here to say
Wow, wow... oh, I'm singing... oh, ooh, oh...Embed
