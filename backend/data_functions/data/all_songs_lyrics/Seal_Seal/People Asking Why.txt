People Asking Why Lyrics
Why, am I changing?
Why do people, get complacent with the things they're told?

World disasters, they come and go
I'd give anything just to be back home
'Cause there are people, asking why
There are people, who believe in

And life, gets confusing but I don't know why
But I've made my plans already
Had this trouble with it all my life

Well world disasters, they come and go
I'd give all my strength to be back home
Cause there are people, asking why
There are people asking...

How do I get to where I've come from, now?
How will I paint this garden I've destroyed, green?
Can I get back to where I've come from?
'Cause there are people, who believe in life
Well how do we get to where we come from?
Peace and love ain't enough these days
Evolution says time is running out
We've been here too long
'Cause there are people, asking why
There are people, asking
