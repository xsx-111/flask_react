Bring it On Lyrics
Bring it on

At first, I didn't have the will to carry on
Illusions in my mind
Like that picture when you feel you can't go on
Like you've been left behind

Life goes on now
Take me to that funky place where you and I were born
Carry on now
Psychedlic tendencies of love will bring it on

Bring it on
Bring it on, bring it on
Don't wait until tomorrow
Bring it on
Bring it on
Bring it on

Give me something for the dream that I am in
You know I love the way you save me
A broken pawn I depended on
Was only life, I was feeling
It goes on now
Take me to that funky place where you and I were born
Carry on now
Ain't no reason you should feel ?
Unconditioned love will bring it on


Unconditioned love will bring it on

So what lies under
Is your kingdom come?
Chase it way, down low
It's only life

Don't wait until tomorrow
Don't wait until tomorrow
Don't wait until tomorrow
Don't wait until
Wait until tomorrow
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Bring it onEmbed
