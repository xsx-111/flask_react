If I Could Lyrics
There's no reason
For you to lose your mind
'Cause I've seen something
That's gonna change our time

If I could, I'd make you understand
If I could, I'd make you understand

There's no hurry
It's gonna come for sure
'Cause I know that someday
We're gonna end our war


If I could I would now
