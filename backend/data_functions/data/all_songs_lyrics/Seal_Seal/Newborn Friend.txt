Newborn Friend Lyrics
I wash my faith in dirty water
'Cause it gives my mind a little order
And I play that game, just like I should do
But my whole world, slips away
I live my life, I live it slowly
And I take my time, I'm in no hurry (I'm living)
And when I go then I would surely
I would dance with a total stranger
And hold them in my arms
Hell, there could be no danger
If I open up, 'cause when the crying starts so

If I chant for happiness, maybe that will make me feel better
I can't change my ideals, I can't lose my desire
If I chant for happiness, maybe that will make me feel better
I'd be a newborn friend for the world

Well I wash my face in dirty water
For life I have no order
'Cause I, know that feeling when you've tried so hard to make your way out
Nothing mends
So you search for the breed of the problems there lying
Deep down in the soul
Even if, they never end
There's a whole bunch of reasons, trying to get out
But they can't make it out of the door
I know the reason
I'm not enough
There's nothing more, But

If I chant for happiness, maybe that will make me feel better
I can't changes my ideals, I can't put out the fire
If I chant for happiness, maybe that will bring us together, for the better
I can't changes my ideals, I can't lose my desire
I'm just a newborn friend for the world
Just a newborn friend for the world
I'll be your newborn friend and I'll...

Sing loud, sing loud Sing loud, my friend
Gonna sing louder, sing loud, sing loud, my friend
To my friend, my friend, and I
I'll sing love, sing loud, sing a little louder of my friend
My darling friend, my friend, my friendEmbed
