Fast Changes Lyrics
Maybe if I search my mind a little
I'd come across the reason why you're gone
Maybe if I searched a little while
And if I try to reconcile a little
Then maybe I will know for how long
This time

Well here we are in separate rooms
I can hear you sighing
Saying "No way out," or so it seems
Dry our tears, we're flying straight on through that window

Fast changes arriving
Slow changes are moving out
Here we are

Now maybe if I took the time a little
Then maybe I would know for how long
This time
