Chain Link Fence LyricsWell she's sitting right there on the chain link fence
She's down at the park with the rest of her friends
And she looks so pretty but she's only sixteen
Didn't know that when she smiled at me
Now the boys are hunched over their electric guitars
I'm lying in the grass out beside my car
I followed her down to the Dixie Freeze
Hold on, hold on, hold on to me
Sweet girl
Don't let go for the world
Cause I'm not from here
And I'm afraid that I might never see you again
Now it's the end of the summer and I'm just twenty-one
I been in California for the last two months
And there weren't no girls like her out there
Her boyfriend don't like me and I think that's fair
Cause I'm sitting right here on the chain link fence
And when she smiles at me gonna take my chance
Say I know the show's over but I wish you wouldn't leave
Hold on, hold on, hold on to me
Sweet girl
Don't let go for the world
Cause I'm not from here
And I'm afraid that I might never see you againEmbed
