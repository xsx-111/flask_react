The Last Song LyricsLittle Mara Lee always sings so sweet
On the banks of the river running through downtown
A show tonight with sweet sweet sounds
Crossed to Tennessee
But it's sweet sweet Mara Lee
Whose voice is calling me back home
To the banks of the river where I belong
And all there is is one last song
Now the band is giving it their all
She says these are the best of days
Won't you stay and dance with me awhile
Little Mara Lee always sings so sweet
The pain in your heart is rock and roll
The tears in your eyes is rock and roll
Little Mara Lee always sings so sweet
The kiss of your lips is rock and roll
The blood in your veins is rock and roll
And all there is is one last song
Now the band is giving it their all
She says these are the best of days
Won't you stay and dance with me awhile
She says these are the best of days
She says these are the best of days
She says these are the best of daysEmbed
