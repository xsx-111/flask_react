Into Your Eyes LyricsWell i'm not supposed to see you looking
I'm not supposed to stare straight into your eyes
Into your eyes
Well i'm not supposed to kiss your lips
But you smile so sweet
I can't resist those eyes
Now you say you might have eyes for me
And i can only wish that you were mine
That you were mine
Well i'm not supposed to be here with you
But how can i leave if you look at me with those eyes
Into your eyes
Well i'm not supposed to kiss your lips
But you smile so sweet
I can't resist those eyesEmbed
