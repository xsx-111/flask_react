Sweet Little Thing LyricsSweet little thing
A constant in my thoughts
Sweet little thing
Somehow we both got lost
And you tell me that I can't change
And you say I'm such a boy
Sweet little thing
Your friends say I'm no good
Sweet little thing
They never understood
The way I'd stay up all night
The way I'd tremble in your arms
A kiss'll make you close your eyes
A kiss won't make you stay
Please don't walk away
I like to know you're there
Though there's nothing left to say
Please don't walk away
Please don't walk away
Sweet little thing
Maybe I ain't no good
Sweet little thing
I ain't done what I should
I let' em think what they want
But all I want is you
A kiss'll make you close your eyes
A kiss won't make you stay
Please don't walk away
I like to know you're there
Though there's nothing left to say
Please don't walk away
Please don't walk away
A kiss'll make you close your eyes
A kiss won't make you stay
