Fistful of Tears LyricsWell I'm sorry my dear
Never thought the end was so near
A heart full of snakes and a belly full of rage
Has left me with a fistful of tears
Wave the ocean and wave the sea
After I'm gone won't you remember me sometimes
The water's deep dark and blue
There ain't nothing left to do
So darling be strong I'll cross before long
And I'll wait on the far shores for you
Wave the ocean and wave the sea
One day those waters will bring you back to me
Never done one thing right now I'm saying goodbye
Please darling don't cryEmbed
