Slow Dancing LyricsSmoking the cigarettes more than I should
My hands won't stop shaking and that can't be good
I would forget you if only I could
Think about anything else
Slow dance at the end of the night
Everyone's looking who cares if it's right
Your head on my chest I held you so tight
I don't care what they have to say
Our feet were too drunk to keep step in time
But we held fast and we made it just fine
Hell you smiled a lot you smile a lot
Chairs on the tables they're mopping the floors
We were still dancing just like before
You held me tight you held me tight
The light from the disco ball surrounds us with starrs
And I looked like trouble right from the start
You told me so hell you told me so
And that slow dance didn't last very long
So now I guess I'll be moving on
But it was nice
God damn it was niceEmbed
