Seed (Intro) Lyrics
You gotta plant your seed
To watch it grow
I got the secrets locked inside of my mind
The stories I never told
I got the deepest devotion
In the mistiest ocean
Oh, lover, I'm coming home to you
And I'll see it through
I see it through

But when the cold game down the line
I heard that the waiting feel was fine
Why don't we step into the light?
'Cause it's going on and on
Until the break of dawn
And every time I call
Nobody's ever really home

But I follow
But I follow
But I follow
Follow my soul
Follow my soul
'Cause I'm always gonna know
The right way to go
Because the feeling always shows
The way back home3Embed
