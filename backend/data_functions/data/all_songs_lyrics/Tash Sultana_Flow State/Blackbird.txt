Blackbird LyricsHave you seen that blackbird?
Coming down the line
Can't you hear that whistle blowing?
Part is blowing out of time
Have you seen that blackbird?
I guess it's long gone now
Like the wind, it carries me away
And like the lightning, it slowly thunders
When it rains down on me
When it rains down
When it rains down on me
Watch as it clears
Watch 'til it clears1Embed
