Salvation Lyrics
I guess I'm just changing with the wind
Turning in a different direction again and again and again
No, I'm sorry, I don't have to spell it out for you, my friend
'Cause I just got a few things I gotta get off my chest
I know it's hard to digest
Why don't you come inside and pull up a chair?
Turn the music up loud and sit over there
Don't you see I got myself into a bit of a pickle over here?
Why don't you invite the devil inside
To dance around my living room?
Only got a table for two
I put my face inside my hands
'Cause I fucking hate the things you do

I said the road is long
Keep carrying on
I don't need your loving for my salvation
I found myself between the dirt and desperation
I don't need you for my own validation
I said the road is long
Keep carrying on
I don't need your loving for my salvation
I found myself between the dirt and desperation
I don't need you for my own validation
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, yeah
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, yeah

Picture a perfect memory
I put it in your pocket
Oh no, I guess you forgot it
Cut your hair it all feels the same
Burning the clothes you wear
It doesn't change the game
Staring deep into the dancing flame
Let the fire fuel your soul, it doesn't hide the shame
And oh the things that I would do
To give away the pain
'Cause everytime I call I'm getting to the message tone
And I've been sitting here waiting by the telephone
Calculating reason in my mind
All night long
I guess it goes on and on
And I thought that you might get the picture that
Iâ€™m moving forward with my life
When I left nothing for you to get by
I said the road is long
Keep carrying on
I don't need your loving for my salvation
I found myself between the dirt and desperation
I don't need you for my own validation
I said the road is long
Keep carrying on
I don't need your loving for my salvation
I found myself between the dirt and desperation
I don't need you for my own validation

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, yeah
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, yeah

I said the road is long
Keep carrying on
I don't need your loving for my salvation
I found myself between the dirt and desperation
I don't need you for my own validation
I said the road is long
Keep carrying on
I don't need your loving for my salvation
I found myself between the dirt and desperation
I don't need you for my own validation2Embed
