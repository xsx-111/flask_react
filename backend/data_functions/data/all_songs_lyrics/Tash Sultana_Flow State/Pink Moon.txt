Pink Moon Lyrics
Pink moon
Light the darkest room
So I'll find my way
Put the records on
Play my favourite song
Wipe the dust away

Carry that weight
I miss the motion
Bury your heart
In the deepest ocean
And I will tremble
Quivering hands
I sink like quicksand, oh

Blinded by the light
Putting up one hell of a fight
Weightless in the water
Don't care what they taught ya
No, I don't care
No I don't
No I
I don't care
No, I don't care
'Cause I'm going crazy, again
'Cause I'm going crazy, again

Pink moon
Light the darkest room
So I'll unhinge my brain
Send me on a soul train
Kiss away the pain
It all feels the same
Put the kettle on
Coffee high for fun
Cut the noose, run away
You're running with the wind
Winter soon ends
I'm buckling in my shins

Blinded by the light
Put up one hell of a fight
Weightless in the water
Don't care what they taught ya
No, I don't care
No I don't
No I don't
No no no

'Cause I don't care
No, I don't care
And no, I don't care
No, I don't care
'Cause I'm going crazy
'Cause I'm going crazy
'Cause I'm going crazy
'Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
'Cause I'm going crazy
Again, again, again2Embed
