Murder to the Mind Lyrics
Tell me
Do you feel?
Are you real
Do you seem satisfied within yourself? No
'Cause there was some times in my life
Where I had to cut the strings loose
I didn't know what to do
Couldn't see the beautiful world
That was in front of you
I was begging for forgiveness
But I couldn't forgive myself
I was screaming out for help

It was murder to the mind
There was blood on my hands
Fire in my soul
It was murder to the mind
There was blood on my hands
Fire in my soul
It was murder to the mind
There was blood on my hands
Fire in my soul

So tell me where'd the time go?
And where it stops, nobody really knows
And I throw my hands up I surrender to the night
Kiss the pain away
And no, I never wanna see your face again
But I was picking apart, picking apart, picking apart the good days
Trying to find myself I emerge from a fog-haze
Six months strong, I don't know where the time has gone
But I tell my mama do you think she'd be proud
Tell my father put two feet on the ground
'Cause I was only screaming out for help
It was murder to the mind
There was blood on my hands
Fire in my soul
It was murder to the mind
There was blood on my hands
Fire in my soul
It was murder to the mind
There was blood on my hands
Fire in my soul

Murder to the mind
Blood on my hands
Fire in my soul
It was murder to the mind
Fire in my soul1Embed
