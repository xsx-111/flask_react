Free Mind Lyrics
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed again
Can somebody tell me what day this is?
You got your blue jeans with that white shirt and your glasses on
And you don't seem yourself, no
Don't bother calling the doctor , the doctor for this kind of disease
Unscrew my mind I walk with ease
'Cause I can feel it crawling underneath my skin
But you wrap me in your cinnamon
Honeysuckle, suck it in
Tuck me in your warmth, I wanna feel you breathe it in

When will my mind be free?
From all the chains that hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me down
When will my mind be free?
From all the chains that hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me down

Leaving my brain in the sixth dimension
Sacrifice the pain I forgot to mention
Turn out the lights, the dark fills the night
I can see through your eyes
The smell of vanilla, oh it lingers
Like honey coated marmalade on the tips of your fingers
Turn out the lights, the dark fills the night
I can see through your eyes
There I was just rolling in the deep
Coming up for air, why don't you suffocate my dreams?
The bird with the word, why don't you carry me?
Carry me
When will my mind be free?
From all the chains that hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me down
When will my mind be free?
From all the chains that hold me
Hold me, hold me, hold me down4Embed
