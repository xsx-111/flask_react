So Many Things to Say LyricsYou want me to go and steal a million dollars
You make me fight an army, win and get away
I've got so many things to tell you
So many things to say
You expect me to lay down the crown jewels at your feet
Pour upon you gold and silver too
I've got so many things to tell you
So many things to say
Nasty things that you ran away from
Will catch you up again
Heroes that you try to be like
Will make you feel your pain
There'll you sit alone and lonely
Everything'll turn gray
You try to figure how the high life came and made you insane
You want me to go and steal a million dollars
You make me fight an army, win and get away
I've got so many things to tell you
So many things to say

You want me to go and steal a million dollars
You make me fight an army, win and get away
I've got so many things to tell you
So many things to say
You expect me to lay down the crown jewels at your feet
Pour upon you gold and silver too
I've got so many things to tell you
So many things to sayEmbed
