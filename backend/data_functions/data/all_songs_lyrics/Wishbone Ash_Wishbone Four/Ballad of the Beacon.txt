Ballad of the Beacon LyricsWe'll be leaving this town in the morning
Tomorrow we'll be able to see
I've had me enough of the city
And she's had enough out of me
Say if I climbed to the mountains
Would you still follow me there
Steal me away in an echo
The mountains will always be there

Well I'm turning my sights on the country
I've sold everything that I own
I'm heading away from the bright lights
Looking for where the wind blows
Say if I climbed to the mountains
Would you still follow me there
Steal me away in an echo
The mountains will always be there

We'll be leaving this town in the morning
Tomorrow we'll be able to see
I've had me enough of the city
And she's had enough out of me
Say if I climbed to the mountains
Would you still follow me there
Steal me away in an echo
The mountains will always be thereEmbed
