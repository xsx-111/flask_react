Sing Out the Song LyricsRemember the bar garden
Glass filled with beer
Nothing to lose, only good times to gain
A friend to help along
When the words wouldn't come
Sing out the song brother
Sing it loud and clear
Then we'll laugh together
Like the old days (so dear)
The rusty guitar
Its sound filled the air
Out of tune choruses
That didn't sound quite there
How about the joker
He got his laugh and then he said
Sing out the song brother
Sing it loud and clear
Then we'll laugh together
Like the old days (so dear)
The way the things are now
It's not the same anymore
And I sometimes wish that
We could all sit down together
And sing it all again

Remember the bar garden
Glass filled with beer
Nothing to lose, only good times to gain
A friend to help along
When the words wouldn't come
Sing out the song brother
Sing it loud and clear
Then we'll laugh together
Like the old days (so dear)Embed
