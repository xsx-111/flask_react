No Easy Road LyricsRock 'n' roll keeps draggin' me
Where I don't know and you can't see
Cities rollin' by and by
Twist my arm and sting my eye
Walk me in the right direction
Stamp your feet and shout
We can laugh and play around
And be best friends right now
Watch me join the circus
Watch me steal the show
There ain't no easy money
There ain't no easy road
There ain't no easy road
Buy me, pay me, wonder why
We stumble across the land
Can't fail for you, you can't fail for me
We start to understand
Rock 'n' roll keeps draggin' me
Where I don't know and you can't see
Cities rollin' by and by
Twist my arm and sting my eye
Watch me join the circus
Watch me steal the show
There ain't no easy money
There ain't no easy road
Watch me join the circus
Watch me steal the show
There ain't no easy money
There ain't no easy road
There ain't no easy road
There ain't no easy road
Road, road, road, easy road
No easy road, no easy money
No easy road, no easy money
No easy road, no easy road
No easy road, no easy road
No easy road, no easy road
No easy road, no, no easy roadEmbed
