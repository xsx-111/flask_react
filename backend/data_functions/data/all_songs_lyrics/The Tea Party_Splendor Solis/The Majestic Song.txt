The Majestic Song LyricsWith a thought you could change what you've never really known
With a lie you could take from the love they never showed
Come along, come along now, it's not too far away
And the streams, they are running to an ocean that is dry
And the sands of the ocean are the prophets in the eye
Of the sage who has chosen to forfeit all he knows, I know
And you know, and you know now that some things never change
In a world, in a world that seems bound by human pain
Come along, come along now, it's not too far away
And beyond you will see how the ever-changing glow
It surrounds all the feelings you never thought you'd know
Come along, come along now, it's not too far away
And you know, and you know now that some things never change
In a world, in a world that seems bound by human pain
Come along, come along now, it's not too far away, I know
And the streams, they are running to an ocean that is dry
And the sands of the ocean are the prophets in the eye
Of the sage who has chosen to forfeit all he knows, I know
And you know, and you know now that some things never change
In a world, in a world that seems bound by human pain
Come along, come along now, it's not too far away, I know
And you know, and you know now that some things never change
In a world, in a world that seems bound by human pain
Come along, come along now, it's not too far away, I know, I know, I knowEmbed
