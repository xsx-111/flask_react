Raven Skies LyricsI am walking on
To the place of the light
And the things I see
With the starlight sight
In the dance of the fires
In the flames I see
Under raven skies
She will sleep with me
And I need her now
And I need you
Welcome to my garden
And what do you see?
Welcome to my garden
Do you still see me?
I am looking through
Through the dance of the trees
I experience
What a shaman sees
And I've returned within
I've returned with sight
Under raven skies
I will sleep tonight
And I need her now
And I need you
Welcome to my garden
And what do you see?
Welcome to my garden
Do you still see me?
And I need her now
Welcome to my garden
And what do you see?
Welcome to my garden
Do you still see me?
Welcome to my garden
And what do you see?
Welcome to my garden
Do you still see me?
Do you still see me?
And I need her now
And I need her now
And I need her now
And I need her nowEmbed
