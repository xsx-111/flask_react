Dreams Of Reason LyricsOh, how the paths change
When the wisdom fades away
Something's going to change these times
And we'll watch them fade away
Never going to get it back
Never going to get it back
And that's what they say
When I've promised to change my ways
And we've all had these days
Oh, I can feel her
In the inside of these rooms
And something's going to change these times
And we'll watch them fade away
Never going to get it back
Never going to get it back
And that's what they say
When I've promised to change my ways
And we've all had these days
Baby, I really need your love
I've got to have all your love
It's cold outside
I'm trying to hide
I really need your love
I really need your love
I really need your love
I really need your love
I really need your loveEmbed
