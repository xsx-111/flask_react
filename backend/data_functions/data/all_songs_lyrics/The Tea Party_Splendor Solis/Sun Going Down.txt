Sun Going Down LyricsI woke up this morning, someone was knocking at my door
I woke up this morning, someone was knocking at my door
And I said, "Hello, sweet Satan, I believe it's time to go"
Thirteenth apostle knocking at my door
Telling me that I can't play with you no more
I guess the wages of sin now, couldn't buy my meals
Screaming out your name, babe, how does that feel?
Feeling through the out door, all throughout the night
Waiting for the doctor to come and make me right
Fading from the bedside, I've lost all appeal
To stay with you, baby, baby, how does that, baby, how does that feel?
Sun's going down, sun's going down
Sun's going down, sun's going down
Oh, go down
Sing throughout the streets, babe, and you sing throughout the night
You go and tell the people, people, my soul is aflight
I guess the wages of sin now, yeah, they couldn't buy my meals
I'm screaming out your name, baby, how does that feel? It feels good
Thirteenth apostle knocking at my door
Telling me that I can't, I can't play with you no more, mama
I guess the wages of sin now, yeah, they couldn't buy my meals
I'm screaming out your name, girl, baby, how does that, now, honey, how does that feel?
Yeah, sun's going down, sun's going down
Oh, yeah, sun's going down, sun's going down
Oh, come on, baby, sun's going down, sun's going down
Going down, you're going out
Ooh, baby, come on in my kitchen, come on in my room
Looked at the heavens above and I said a little prayer
As if the heavens above would even care
Looked at the heavens above and I said a little prayer
As if the heavens above would even care, care
I said, Jesus, won't you meet me in the middle of the air?
I think my wings are falling below, Jesus, I need another pair
Jesus, won't you meet me in the middle of the air?
I think my wings are falling below, I need another pair
Saint Peter at the gates of heaven, baby, won't you let me in, let me in
Saint Peter at the gates of heaven, honey, won't you let me in, let me in
Saint Peter at the gates of heaven, baby, won't you let me in, let me in
I said, now, Peter, listen, Peter, come on, Peter, won't you let me in
Right now, right now, no, no, now, now, yeah
I said sun was going down, sun was going down
Sun was going down, it's going down, it's going down, it's going down
I said it's going, going, going, going, going
You know, you know, oh yeah, all right
Oh, the sun was going downEmbed
