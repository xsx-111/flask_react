In This Time LyricsHey, hey, lady
Looks like I'm under your spell once again
And, hey, hey, lady
There just now ain't no denying these things
I will always be here
Always be with you
And I know she said
Let the leaves fall wherever they may
But I find it hard
Hard to find people like she is today
I will always be here
Always be with you
In this time
In this time
In this time
When you lay to sleep
Tell me the visions you see in the night
When you turn around
What kind of shadow is cast by the light?
She will always be here
Always be here
I will always be here
I will always be with you
In this time
In this time
In this time
In this timeEmbed
