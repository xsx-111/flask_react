Midsummer Day LyricsWhen you've decided
To hold on to all that you've lost
When you've decided
To hold on to all that you've lost
All this is nothing
If she comes and tears you apart
All this is nothing
If you hold the key to her heart
If you've decided
To change what you thought was your way
This new way will take you
To her and to midsummer day
All this is nothing
If she comes and tears you apart
All this is nothing
If you hold the key to her heart
And I'm crying in the night
And I'm waiting for her call
Won't you help me, girl, tonight
'Cause I'm waiting for her call
And I'm crying in the night
And she's flowing from my mind
And the sky is turning black
And I'm running out of time
You'll shed a last tear
If you miss what you thought was your way
This new way will take you
To her and to midsummer day
All this is nothing
If she comes and tears you apart
All this is nothing
If you hold the key to my heart
All you are is in you
All you are is in you
All you are is in you
All you are is in you
In you
In you
In youEmbed
