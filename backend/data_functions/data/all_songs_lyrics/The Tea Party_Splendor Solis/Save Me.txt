Save Me LyricsI must leave you tonight, my love, remain so faithfully
I must go off to war, my dear, the kings await me
I will go so far away
I will always love you, but you knew it
I regret to tell you, your man has died tonight
He was a brave man, he fought a brave fight
He was killed by the other side
He was killed by the other men's knives
She said save me
Save me
Why must you love this man? He is your brother
This is easy to understand, my son, there is no other
I cannot pretend to love this man like my father
I cannot pretend, mother, there is no other
She said save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
When there is no truth, let's end this lie tonight
This is easy to understand, without your best eyes
But I see a new sun rising in the east
But I see a new sun rising in the east
She said save me
Save me
Save me
Save youEmbed
