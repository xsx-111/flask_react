The River LyricsSailing down
Down the Styx again
Without you, my love
I want to return but then
I see all my friends
They want me to join but then
They all melt away
Without you, alone
And the river's running through my veins
Lately she don't seem the same
And the blood keeps calling out my name
I pass by the sins
Left by a different man
The tides brought them here
Cast by a different hand
And the wisps of the winds
Blow with the Styx again
Pushing me on
Without you, alone
And the river's running through my veins
Lately she don't seem the same
And the blood keeps calling out my name
And the river running down
And the river running down
And the river running down
And the river
My will must be strong
To rise with a different light
My will must belong
I'm still pushing for different heights
And the wisps of the winds
Blow with the Styx again
The river runs red
And I'm left alone
And the river's running through my veins
Lately she don't seem the same
And the blood keeps calling out my name
And the river's running, yeah
Help me, baby
Help me, baby
Help me, baby
Help me, baby, ooh, yeah
Help me, baby
Help me, baby
Help me, baby
