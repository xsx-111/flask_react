Honeymoon Croon Lyrics
Honeymoon croon tonight
Sew my sock tonight
I say who's on the towels tonight
Lookin' lipstick pickle fickle
Marilyn's on
Send her by airmail, par avion
Certificate ecstasy in my head
Hire Sibyl Vane for my bed

Croon, croon tonight
Honeymoon tonight
Sew my sock tonight, tonight

Miss Vane arrives, the gun's still warm
Twenty of you could fit in here, asking use through form
Turns up turning her own trick during her
Seedier service
Seedier service

She insists on tying down
After the soldier sailor curfew
All alone in the cathedral bar
She preys in dockland
He asks to see her hidden side
She, the colour of his money
Colour of his money
Honeymoon croon tonight
Sew my sock tonight, I say
Who's on the towels tonight, I say
Honeymoon

Marilyn's fading fast, better get straight
The catch from the sidewalk's in a state
The sound of footsteps, mummy's here
I'll be a good boy, I'll never fear
Better fix her drink tonight, bedtime's come
Must blot out this urge to use my gun

Honeymoon tonight
Croon croon tonight
Honeymoon croon tonight (honeymoon)
Sew my sock tonight, I say (honeymoon)
Who's on the towels tonight, (honeymoon) I say
Honeymoon (honeymoon)
Honeymoon (honeymoon)
Honeymoon tonightEmbed
