Lagartija Nick Lyrics
Move his way, nice and slow
Paint it all black, let the humorous glow
He feels like Sacher-Masoch
And the fire below is licking at his lips

Crack the whip
Mmm, come on, crack
Oh oh oh, crack the whip
Oh whip
Ooh whip
Ooh

Swallowing flames sinking in the snow
He enjoys feeling pain, he enjoys peeling slow
Lagartija Nick, it's no dumb show
Your name's on his whip

Crack the whip
Ooh, come on, crack

A code of play, the nocturne rites
In the cruel garden of dark delights
Sixteen cages crawl in line
Desire is a heady wine
Come and crack
Come and crack
Crack the
Oh!
Ooh, ooh!
Whoa!

All in pain, it's no dumb show
Fire below is licking at his lips
Swallowing flameEmbed
