Fall Asleep LyricsFall asleep
And slip away
What night will keep
From light of day
Sailing cloud
And drifting wave
My dreams allow
The right of way
Something I'll even dare to know
Let that be my name
Open like I'm alone
Empty my eyes
From stories I'm in
Brake me from being myself
Day so cruel
And night so fair
The tales I knew
Are true somewhereEmbed
