Hourglass LyricsHold
Let the hour of our glasses stain
Let our ashes be the same
Let a minute pose
The pendulum sway
Stay
Let a second beat in vain
Time is never up nor straight
It turns around and bites
Its tail in the end
And when you close your eyes
You're bound to look inside
To find the one
You've always claimed to miss
And of course you do
What difference does it make
Placebo charms a praise?
I know what's on my mind
Where else to draw the line?
Wait
Only 'til you're half awake
Keep your head
Your mind forsake
Take it in
A voice will lead you the way
And let go
Of all the words you know
An empty fall will fade them slow
When space unfolds
The void ahead
Is inside of you
When I count to three
You're back to where we meet
You'll be the one you've
Always claimed to see
And of course you do
What difference does it make
Placebo charms a praise?
I know what's on my mind
Where else to draw the line?
What difference does it make
A spell a pill a praise?
You know what's on your mind
Who else will draw the line?Embed
