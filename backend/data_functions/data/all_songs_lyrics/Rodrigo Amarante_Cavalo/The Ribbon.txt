The Ribbon LyricsThe ribbon is cut
Now cameras are gone
The news are all one
The party goes on
Done, it’s been said
And up goes the flag
An ox has been killed
In display the head
Then he came to me
Born with a heart
He poured me the one
Fixed me up straight
Son, he said
I knew you would
Hell can only do you good
You’ll be where you should
So I kissed the ring
I missed the hand
Ask who you must
Faith it is trust
And justice be made
For numbers we pray
A woman made blind
With angels at guard
Servants of lords
With a scale and a sword
She’s looking at me
She sees through the night
A hit and run
No one in sight
Boy, she said
You oughta know
Classifieds will never show
What the aces do
To the queen of hearts
I knowEmbed
