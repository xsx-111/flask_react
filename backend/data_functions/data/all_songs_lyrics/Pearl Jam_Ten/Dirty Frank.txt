Dirty Frank Lyrics
Ragh woo eats meat eats meat hahaha look out

Dirty Frank Dahmer he's a gourmet cook, yeah
I got a recipe for anglo-saxin soup, yeah
Wanted a pass. So she relaxed. Now the little groupie's getting chopped up in the back
I got a cupboard full of fleshy fresh ingredients
A very careful at the same time quite expedient
Eats meat. A release
Bus driving's harder on your head than on your feet

Dirty frank. A Dirty frank yeah
A Dirty frank ooh
A Dirty frank yea oh

Keeps it clean. a keeps it copaseptic
A little boys and girls their heads are all collected
A not crazy. a per se
Just a little strange when he gets hungry
City state your town he will continue
A stadiums tiny clubs every venue
A his bus a your trust
There goes another turned into crust
Dirty frank a Dirty Frank yeah. A Dirty frank. oh a Dirty Frank

Why that dirty Frank was a bad mother
Shut your mouth! Hey man, I'm just talking about dirty Frank

Oh wa-ha a yea cookoo there fucking crazy these kids are driving me crazy
Oh, middle of the night we're stopped the freeway shoulder
A frank's shoveling to bury the leftovers
A they're sunk. He's drunk
Now he's gonna drive I'm hiding in my bunk. Oh

A Don't want to be part of Frank's luncheon
A lose weight. A be safe. Where's Mike McCready? My god he's been ate!
