Wash Lyrics
Oh please let it rain today. This city's so filthy. Like my mind in ways
Oh it was the time. Like a clean new taste
Smiling eyes before me, inches from my face

Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love

Sin for sale. Buying just a need. Just who planted all the devils seeds?
And what's the truth? And the truth that lies at home
It's on the inside and I can't get it off. Yeah

Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love

What's clean is pure. But hey, I'm white on the outside. Though I stray
What she don't know today might kill us both tomorrow. Bring it back someday
Bring it back, bring it back. Back to, to the clean form. To the pure form

Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my love
Wash my loveEmbed
