Hot Head Lyrics
She can burn you up in bed just like she said
Cause she's a hot head, hot head, hot head
She can throw a pot a' sho, she can start a fire to go
Cause she's a hot head, hot head, hot head

She puts her head into the fire, makes you red hot perspire
She's a hot head, hot head, hot head
She was burnt before she was born, burnin' up a storm
She's a hot head, hot head, hot head

Lick out like a flame n' burn you to a shame
Bite a burnin' flame

Things are burnin' big, she's a red hot pig
She's a hobo wire toaster, she's a circle on a spit, tsssssst
She's a hot head, hot head, hot head
She can stitch you to a wheel take you to her fire
N' spin you round 'n' round, boy, you take you down
Fire, fire, fire
She's a hot head, hot head, hot head

Burn you up in bed just like she said
Cause she's a hot head, hot head, hot head
She can lick out like a flame, burn you to a shame
Yeah, bite a burnin' flame
She can burn you up in bed or coil you up instead
Cause she's a hot head, hot head, hot head
She can throw a pot a' sho, she can start a fire to goEmbed
