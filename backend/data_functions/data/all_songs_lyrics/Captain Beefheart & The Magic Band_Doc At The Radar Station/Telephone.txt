Telephone Lyrics
Paper and wire killed my brother and my sister too
And if you don't watch out
You know they're going to get you too
And if I don't watch out
You know they're going to get me too
Telephone, telephone
Telephone, telephone

Well I strangled the cord
Ripped it off of the phone
And I saw the bone
And I saw the twinkling lights
And it must have been rats
'Cause it sure was a drone
Sure was a drag

Paper and wire killed my brother and my sister too
And if you don't watch out
You know they're going to get you
And if I don't watch out
You know they're going to get me too
Telephone, telephone, telephone
And I strangled
And I ripped the cord
And I saw the bone
And I heard these tweetin' things
'n twinkling lights
'n there was nobody home
Where are all those nerve endings
Coming out of the bone?

Telephone, telephone

Well I ripped the cord right out of the phone
And I saw the bone
There the gleaming white bone
Telephone

Paper and wire killed my brother and my sister too
And if you don't watch out
You know they're going to get you
And if I don't watch out
You know they're going to get me too
Telephone, telephone
And I can’t get away
And I can’t get away
It’s like a grey adder at the end of the hall
It’s like a plastic horned devilEmbed
