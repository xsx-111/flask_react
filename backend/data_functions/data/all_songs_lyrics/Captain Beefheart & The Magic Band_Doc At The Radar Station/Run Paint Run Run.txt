Run Paint Run Run Lyrics
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run

Paint hears this and he begin to run
Electric black shadow runs 'cross the sun
Run paint run run
Run paint run run

Hold holes in the world
The sun goes down, we'll be done
You hoped and you hopped
And you hopped and you swung
There's my baby standing at the gate
Waving, "Come, come."
Paint hears this and he begin to run
Run paint run run
You got hot paint, and you're havin' fun
There's my baby standing at the gate
Waving, "Come, come."

Run paint run run
Paint hears this and he begin to run
Electric black shadow runs 'cross the sun
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
When the sun goes down, we'll be done paint done
Run paint run run
Electric black shadow runs 'cross the sun
Run paint run run
You hoped and you hopped
And you hopped then you won
Run paint run run
You gold plated monkey
You're a hot devil sun

Run paint run run
Run paint run run

You better go by and you run and you run
You got hot paint and you swung and you swung
Run paint run run
And you hoped and you hopped
And you hopped and you swung
Run paint run run
You're a hot devil's sun
You're a mean monkey
You stuck out your tongue
Hope you have the winning ticket
When the race is done
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run run
Run paint run runEmbed
