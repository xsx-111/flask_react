Sue Egypt Lyrics
Chills quick you, voices pick you
Crows hex you
Elexum postum avion
Wizard kiss and all be gone
Seams, dreams, boats to forever
Bolted ether creep the ether feather

Sue Egypt
Sue Egypt

Boing pong
Hocus pocus avion
I think of all those people that ride on my bones
I think of all those people that ride on my bones
That nobody hears, that nobody sees, that nobody knows

Sue Egypt
Sue Egypt

I think of all, I think of all
I think of all those people that ride on my bones
That nobody sees, that nobody dares
That nobody hears, that nobody cares
I think of the dust that collects on the chairs
And under her eyes, and through her eyes
And out her body, and in her body
And in her hearse
Big smoke fingers wave
Come here, come here
Bring me my scissors and those on waters
The moon was a
Wisdomatic pristocratic vagabond
Bad fuggum
A pitcher of red hot juice
A picture of red garnet juice

Chills quick you, voices pick you
Crows hex you
Elexum postum avion
Wizard kiss and all be gone
Seams, dreams, boats to forever
Bolted ether creep the ether feather
