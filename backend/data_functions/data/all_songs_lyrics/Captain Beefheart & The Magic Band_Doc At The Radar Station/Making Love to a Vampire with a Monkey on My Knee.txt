Making Love to a Vampire with a Monkey on My Knee Lyrics
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee

The pond shined dry like a ladies' compact
Lilies leaped like flat green hearts with white hearts
Squirting yellow pollen cocks
Ferns ran like cool spades, fossils away from rocks
Bees echoed dark carbon hums that dashed in nothing
Gnats fucked my ears 'n nostrils
Hit my brain like hones 'n numbed to nothing
Wings stuck on liquid bones
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee
The moon poured hollow down my milky leg
Splashed still ‘n moved
The wind peed down the willows 'n pricked the needle vine
The monkey moved a fur shadow, its soot tail curled in twos
Its lips smiled needles, its eyes rolled loose
Her throat broke open glistened in the dew
Red berries dangled like a dream of rubies too
Snot muscles ran down her ivory chin 'n tooth within
A locket, a pin held fast to then, my love, my pocket deep within
'N senses dangled the chain that clasped me to her then
The messenger spoke the wind that blows between our time
I sensed you then 'n whispers spin 'n flow
In silver dust around the pointed pin
Sent to nothing
God, please fuck my mind for good
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee
Oh fuck that thing, fuck that poem
Eyes crawl out with maggots
White cloth bones pile up light thrown blades
Rags ‘n skull, scoops soil cracks, drain screams
Please take my hand 'n join me, too soon its clutches gleams
Making love to a vampire with a monkey on my knee
Death be damned, life!Embed
