Sheriff of Hong Kong Lyrics
She always shows up when I'm up
But she never shows up when I'm down
But she's under arrest
'cause I might guess
The Sheriff of Hong Kong
Then she goes up in a flash
I bite the end of her sash

Then I'm long gone
To Hong Kong Kong

She never makes a taste mistake
She's the Sheriff of Hong Kong
Now I'm the Sheriff of Hong Kong
Now she's the Sheriff of Hong Kong

We're long gone gone
To Hong Kong Kong
Whoa I'm long gone
To Hong Kong Kong
Long gone gone
To Hong Kong Kong
Ad hu
And uh xing hu
I don't know who I am

Ohhh ahhh oooh

There's a string and bat dangle
Black and white bat and cat panda
And uh
She's the Sheriff of Hong Kong and uh
Ad hu

I don't know who I am
Do youuuu?
Now she's the Sheriff of Hong Kong gone
I bite the end of her sash
And she's off in a flash

And we're long gone gone
To Hong Kong Kong

There's a string and bat dangle
Black and white bat and cat panda
And uh
She's the Sheriff of Hong Kong and uh
