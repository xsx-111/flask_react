Ashtray Heart Lyrics
You used me like an ashtray heart
Case of the punks, right from the start
I feel like a glass shrimp
In a pink panty with a saccharine chaperone
Make invalids out of supermen
Call in a "shrink"
And pick you up in a girdle
You used me like an ashtray heart
Right from the start, case of the punks

Another day, another way
Somebody's had too much to think
Open up another case of the punks
Each pillow is touted like a rock
The mother/father figure
Somebody's had too much to think
Send your mother home your navel
Case of the punks

New hearts to the dining rooms
Violet heart cake
Dissolve in new cards, boards, throats, underwear
Ashtray heart
You picked me out, brushed me off
Crushed me while I was burning out
Then you picked me out like an ashtray heart
Hid behind the curtain, waited for me to go out
A man on a porcupine fence
Used me for an ashtray heart
Hit me where the lover hangs out
Stood behind the curtain
While they crushed me out
You used me for an ashtray heart

You looked in the window when I went out
You used me like an ashtray heartEmbed
