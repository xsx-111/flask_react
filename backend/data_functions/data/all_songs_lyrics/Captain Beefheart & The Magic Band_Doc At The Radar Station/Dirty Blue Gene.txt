Dirty Blue Gene Lyrics
The shiny beast of thought
If you got ears, you gotta listen
Old woman sweat
Young girls glisten
The extract you thought
Is the extract you got

Pop in a thought
Ex-extract
D'you hear me?

Hope these are hard drops
Grooves you right
Drop by drop
Light by bright
Night by light
There ain't no good
'n' there ain't no blame
Not hip
Ain't no aim
You make the fault
You cause the blame
Devil the same
Pop in a thought
Ex-extract
Shiny beast of thought
You hang up
Now you' caught
If you got ears
You gotta listen
Old woman sweat
Young girls glisten
There's more than what you thought
Pop in a thought
The shiny beast of thought
Stand there bubblin' like an open cola in the sun
Back is achin'
Work is never done
She's swinging a sponge on the end of a string
Right on the brink
She spills the ink down the sink

She's not bad
She's just genetically mean
She's not bad
She's just genetically mean
Don't you wish you never met her?
Don't you wish you never met her?
Don't you wish you never met Dirty Blue Gene?
She's swinging a sponge on the end of a string
Don't you wish you never met her?
Don't you wish you never met her?
Ah, don't you wish you never met her?
Don't you wish you never met her?
She's not bad
She's just genetically mean
Ah, fuck
Dirty Blue Gene
Dirty, dirty
Dirty Blue Gene
She's not bad!Embed
