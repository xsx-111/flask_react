Best Batch Yet Lyrics
We don't have to suffer, we're the best batch yet
Baked in special
White flesh waves to black

You might think this is the finest pearl
But it's only cardboard balls
Seamed in glue
Overwhelming technique
Done t' diligence
It's all happening from the inside, you say?
Done from the inside
Where it barely shows on the outside
It's remarkable

I think this is the best batch yet
We don't have to suffer, we're the best batch yet
Baked in special, we're the best batch yet
White flesh waves to black

You might think this is the finest pearl
But it's only cardboard balls
Seamed in glue
Overwhelming technique
Done through diligence
It's all happening from the inside, you say?
Done from the inside
Where it barely shows on the outside
It's remarkable
I sayâ€¦
I think this is the best batch yet
We're baked in special, we're the best batch yet
We don't have to suffer, we're the best batch yetEmbed
