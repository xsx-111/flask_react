Do It Now Lyrics
Got the time, the inclination
I have answered your invitation
I'll be leaving in the morning
Watch me go

I don't know where the wind is blowing
Got directions to where I'm going
Nothing's certain
That's the only thing I know

Do it now, do it now while the vision is clear
Do it now while the feeling is here
If you leave it too late, it could all disappear
Do it now while your vision is clear

Do-do-doo, do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-do
Do-do-doo-ooh, doo-ooh

I don't regret the steps I'm taking
The decision that I'm making
Is the right one
Or I'm never going to know
Got the time, the inclination (It's not too late, late, late)
I have answered your invitation (You've still got time, time, time)
I'll be leaving in the morning (Follow the beat of)
Watch me go (Your heart, heart, heart)

So do it now, do it now while your vision is clear
Do it now while the feeling is here
If you leave it too late, it could all disappear
Do it now while your vision is clear

Do-do-doo, do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-do-do-doo
Do-do-doo, do-do-doo, do-do-doo1Embed
