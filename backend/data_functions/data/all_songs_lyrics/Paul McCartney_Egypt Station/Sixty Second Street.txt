Sixty Second Street Lyrics
Well, you can make my life complete
If you say that we could meet
For a minute on the sixty second street
Oh yeah

The city's melting in the heat
Iâ€™ve got my flip-flops on my feet
You see me walking down sixty second street

Well, time is flying by so fast
Each day quicker than the last
It means I must be having fun
I hope it carries on and on and on

Sixty seconds of your day is all I ask of you
I only need a little time to show what I can do
Do, do-do-do-do-do
Do, do, do, do-do-do-do
Da, da, do-do-do-da-da
Da, da, da, do-do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do, do, do, do-do-do-do
Da, da, da, da
We can grab a bite to eat (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh)
Sit and listen to the beat (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh)
Of the traffic on sixty second street

Well, time is flying by so fast (Do, do-do, do)
Each day quicker than the last (Do, do-do, do)
It means I must be having fun (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh)
I hope it carries on and on and on

Sixty seconds of your day is all I ask of you
I only need a little time to show what I can do
Do, do-do-do-do-do
Do, do, do, do-do-do-do
Do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do, do, do, do-do-do-do
Ba, bop, ba-ba-ja-boo-ba
Bop, bop, bop, bop-ba-ja-boo
Ba, ba, ba, ba

Well, you can make my life complete
If you say that we could meet
For a minute on the sixty second street
Just a minute on the sixty second street
Just a minute on the sixty second street
Sixty second streetEmbed
