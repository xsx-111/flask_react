Happy with You Lyrics
I sat around all day
I used to get stoned
I liked to get wasted
But these days, I don't
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

I walked around angry
I used to feel bad
But nowadays, my days
Don't have to be sad
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah

Like hear the high clear robin sing
Walk a bluebell carpet
Watch the children playing games
Catch a moon and drop it
Hear the gentle mantle roll
On a frosty morning
See the mighty ocean break
Like a sailor's warning
I used to drink too much
Forgot to come home
I lied to my doctor
But these days, I don't
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, oh yeah

Throw a pocketful of coins in the Trevi Fountain
See an ice-cold running stream
Rushing down the mountain
Hear a newborn baby lamb
Calling for its mother
Watching reunited friends
Loving one another

I sat around all day
I liked to get stoned
I used to get wasted
But these days, I don't
'Cause I'm happy with you
I got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah

Mmm, happy with you
I'm happy with you
Happy with you3Embed
