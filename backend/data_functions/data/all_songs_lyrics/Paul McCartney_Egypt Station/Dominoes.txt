Dominoes Lyrics
In time, we'll know it's all a show
It's been a blast
As time goes by, we'll laugh and cry
It's in the past

We can start to begin
Living in the world we're in

From day to day, we'll fight and play
For what we need
We'll soon forget we ever met
And disagreed

We can start to begin (To begin)
Living in the world we're in (World we're in)
This is it (This is it), here and now (Here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow

And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones are calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
And soon we'll see that you and me
We're really friends
We broke the code and walked the road
That never ends

We can start to begin (To begin)
Living in the world we're in (World we're in)
This is it (This is it), here and now (Here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow

And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, hey-hey

We'll take our turn and try to learn
To sing and dance
We'll hedge our bets with no regrets
And take a chance
We can start to begin (To begin)
Living in the world we're in (World we're in)
This is it (This is it), here and now (Here and now)
We can find our way
Somehow

And lines of dominoes are falling
Into place, ignoring everything in their way
And all the telephones keep calling
Constantly, imploring us to come out and play
Hey-hey, yay-yay

In time, we'll know it's all a show
It's been a blast2Embed
