People Want Peace Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm standing before you with something important to say
With some trepidation I crave your attention but
I'm not gonna let anything get in my way

The message is simple, it's straight from my heart
And I know that you've heard it before
But what does it matter, we're in it together
And I'm not quitting while people are crying for more

People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace

Nothing in life is as sad as the lonely soul
Searching for peace
Only to find disappointment is waiting
Behind every door that we open
Every catch, we release
A-brothers and sisters, I beg you to listen
I know that it isn't too late
For we as the people, the voices of freedom
And we're all perfectly clear that we don't wanna wait

People want peace
People want peace
A simple release from their suffering
People want peace
People want peace

People want peace
People want peace
Yes, we want peace!
People want peace (Yeah, yeah!)
