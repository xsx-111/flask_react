Caesar Rock Lyrics
She's a rock
She's a rock
She's a rock

If I could find the words to talk about my woman
Well, I would surely shout them out
But every time I feel my inspiration coming
It's all too much to talk about

'Cause she breaks me up, she takes me down
She sends me sideways
She's with me every way I turn
If I'm back to school
She gotta be my favourite teacher
There's such a lot for me to learn

'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)

Somehow she always knows exactly what is needed
When I've been running 'round and 'round
And if she wants me, but I know that I've succeeded
I'll be heading back to town
'Cause she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
Yes, she's a rock (Yeah!)
She's a rock (Yeah!)

Caesar rock, he's a rock
He's a rock, he's a rock
She's a rock

(Hey) She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's a
Yeah, now she's a rock (She's a rock)
Woo-hoo-hoo
She's got loyalty like the royalty
She's got symmetry, anonymity
She's got all the looks
She got all the books
She got matching teeth
She got matching teeth2Embed
