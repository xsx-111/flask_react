Get Enough Lyrics
There was a time when we walked by the docks
And I told you, "I need you all of my life"
And watching the tugs rolling by together
Do you remember?
Do you remember the lights on the shore?
How they reflected the rain on the road?
I believed that you love me alone
It was real, do you remember?
Now and then, I see your face
I've been wanting a lovin’ embrace
I've been looking for love, but it gets me nowhere
Oh yeah, yeah (Uh)

Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love, uh)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of, of you
It was a time we were all full of hope
Saw the future burning bright
As we watched the moon rollin’ out to sea
Do you remember?
But those days are erased from my mind
Yeah, I've left all those old days behind
But still I remember your face forever, forever
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love, uh)
Get enough, get enough, get enough of (Your love)
I can't get enough of, of you

Ooh
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
I think maybe I should go back to nature, traditional
And reexamine the art that you've ever seen, tried and traditional
I think it's time we all go together
We all want more

Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
Get enough, get enough, get enough, girl
I can't get enough, enough of you4Embed
