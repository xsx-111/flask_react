Hunt You Down/Naked/C-Link Lyrics
I can't find my love
No matter how hard I try
She's giving me the runaround
And makes me wanna lay down and cry

Come on back to me right now
'Cause you don't have to stay away
I won't play no hide-and-seek
It's not a game I wanna play

Travelling around the world
Trying to find a perfect mate
I found myself a little girl
But now she's started running away

Come on back to me right now
Don't wait 'til they unleash the hounds
If you don't get back today
They'll follow your trail and hunt you down

I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket, but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked since I was born
Born to follow you wherever you go
But my problem is I never do know
Where you're taking me, I don't have a clue
I've been naked since I was born

Save my soul and set it free
Free to fly home
There's a place I'm meant to be
Back, back home

I've been broken in so many places
Put together by a sea of faces
What to make of them
I don't hardly know
I've been naked for so long, so long


I've been taken for my younger brother
Life's a basket, but I have no other
I keep waking up when I'm trying to sleep
I've been naked for so long
I've been naked for so long
So long, so long, now
