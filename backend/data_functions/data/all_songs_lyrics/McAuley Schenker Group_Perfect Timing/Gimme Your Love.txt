Gimme Your Love LyricsBet you're getting the wrong idea about me
Bet you're thinking there's more than the eye can see
I'll tell you something, then maybe again I won't
Now you see me
And who knows maybe you don't
Time after time, you had your chances
And you threw them away oh! no!
Don't waste my time
I don't need the glory
That's all I want to say
Gimme your love
You know what it does to me
Drives me crazy, ain't telling no lies
Gimme your love
With you I feel satisfied
When you're by my side
I tell you no lies
It's on the line, can't think about nothing else
Suits me fine, 'cause I know we're two of a kind
To trust myself is something I just can't do
So how the hell girl am I gonna trust you
Night after night two crazy people
Getting high on their love, crazy love
Don't stop me now
I got a one way ticket
Straight through your heart oh! no!
Gimme your love
You know what it does to me
Drives me crazy, ain't telling no lies
Gimme your love
With you I feel satisfied
When you're by my side
I tell you no lies
Bet you're getting the wrong idea about me
Bet you're thinking there's more than the eye can see
You should talk, 'cause I know quite a bit about you
Don't look so worried
Just do what we both want to do
'Cause time after time, you had your chances
And you threw away all away!
You cut it so fine with your advances honey
Now I know just what to sayEmbed
