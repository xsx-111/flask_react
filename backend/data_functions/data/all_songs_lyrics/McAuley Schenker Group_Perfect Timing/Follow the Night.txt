Follow the Night LyricsFunny you understand so much
Where do you always find the time
The explanations I found
Are all based on solid ground
Can nobody get inside
I tried but I can't find
There must be a door somewhere
All I need is the key and I'm there
Better to leave it alone
Some things you do disturb me
Better to weather the storm
My thoughts so deep I cannot see
Follow the night, follow your dreams
Follow the signs
And all the things you've seen
Follow the night
Yeah' Find your fantasy
Follow the road that leads you straight to me
Confusion inside your head
You never know where to turn
Look for the space instead
Wonder how you can carry on
Patience is a lonely word
We never can have enough
The problems you can't ignore
Especially from the start
Better to leave it alone
Some things you do disturb me
Better to weather the storm
My thoughts so deep I cannot see
Follow the night, follow your dreams
Follow the signs
And all the things you've seen
Follow the night
Never, never a moment lost
While the work is done
Time flies quickly past
Even for the most eager ones
The pain we must endure
It's not an easy task
To end what you're looking for
You simply have to askEmbed
