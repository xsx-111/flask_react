Here Today - Gone Tomorrow LyricsSuch a strange obsession coming over me
Seems like I can't face that stark reality
Need to find the answer
Need to find a way
I don't know what I'm doing here
From day to day
As far as I can see now
The reason's very clear
Is there nothing left for me

Here today, gone tomorrow
I hear you say
No more joy only sorrow, no other way
Here today you're gone tomorrow
I hear you say
One last time before you walk away
Bent on self destruction
I can feel the pain
This advice you've given me
Is all in vain
As far as I can see now
The reason's very clear
Is there nothing left for me
Did I hear you whisper...
Almost reached that point now
The point of no return
Getting closer to that edge, ooh I'll never learn
As far as I can see now
The reason's very clear
Is there nothing left for meEmbed
