Get Out LyricsShe said I come from a broken home
Most of my life, I've been so all alone
Can't give you the love you need
That's the way it's got to be
You never know if time will change
You'll have to wait and see
I'm working hard just to get some money
This kind of job you can't do in a hurry
So much paid when the day is through
I'm not quite sure if I can spend it with you
Get out! get out! get out!
You're not welcome here
Get out! get out! get out!
Am I making myself clear
Like a dog without a bone
I was trying to hide my shame
Dignity a fading memory, only got myself to blame
How many times and how many changes
Keep asking myself why
I'm working hard just to get some money
This kind of job you can't do in a hurry
So much pain when the day is through
I'm not quite sure if I can spend it with you
Get out! get out! get out!
You're not welcome here
Get out! get out! get out!
Am I making myself clear
So tired I feel I'm dead
Can't remember what I had
Rejection I don't want to know
But you always let it show
The kind of loving you are trying to sell me
In no kind of love at allEmbed
