... A Psychopath LyricsA baseball bat, a baseball bat
Beside my bed
I'll wait around and wait around
And wait
I hear a noise, I hear a noise
Well I hear something
I am alone, you win again
I'm paralyzed
I drift away, I'll drift away
Am I asleep yet?
I hear a scream, I see me scream
Is it from memory?
Am I awake? Am I alone?
When is it sunrise?
A baseball bat, a thing of mace
Where did I leave it?
That thing of mace, that thing of mace
Where did I leave it?
A psychopath, a psychopath
He says he loves me
And I'm alone and I am cold
And paralyzed
I can't moveEmbed
