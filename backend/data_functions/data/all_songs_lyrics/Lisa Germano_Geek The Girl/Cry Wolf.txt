Cry Wolf LyricsLove is weird, love
She's overdone it
Can't go on
She caused it all
Cry, cry wolf
She didn't know
She didn't want it
She does a lot of things and regrets it
Love can hurt
Love is weird
A girl who wants it
But has no clue
She's says she'll give it
Cry, cry wolf
A change of mind
In that back seat or that dirty room
They say she got just what she wanted
Love can be bad
Love is weird
You should have known better
You should have known better
You should have known
It's all your fault
You should have known better
You should know better
Didn't they tell you
Didn't they tell you
