Geek the Girl Lyrics
Perfect and dull, decorate, perfect and dull
Keepin' the cool from coming out, yeah

Oh oh
I'm not too cool
Oh oh
I'm not too cool

Angry and dumb dominate, angry and dumb
Keepin' the cool from comin out, yeah

Oh oh
I'm not too cool
Oh oh
I'm not too cool

I always liked rock and roll
It kinda moves me
I'd like it more if I'd dance, yeah, sure

Oh oh
I'm not too cool
Oh oh
I'm not too cool
Wrong move and you're not too cool
Wrong move and you're not too cool
Run, run, cause you're not too cool
Keep it hidden cause you're not too cool
Perfect and dull, but not too cool
Run, run, you're not too cool
Angry and dumb, but not too cool
Angry and running, and not cool1Embed
