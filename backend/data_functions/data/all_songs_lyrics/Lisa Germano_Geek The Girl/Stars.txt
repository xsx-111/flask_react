Stars LyricsWhy do people like stars?
They're so far away
They're always there
And safe to look at
Wish upon one
I could have been you
In that fantasy
Far away from here
I love my man
Could it be he takes me there?
All those stars lighten up my head
Here it comes again
That uneasy feeling
I could have been you in that fantasy
So smile real big
And wish upon one
Let it take you far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
I could do about anything
Great excuses make it easier
To forget that awful feeling
So smile real big
Oh precious moment
In this vague world full of fantasies
Like my man
Could it be he takes me there?
Anywhere
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
Far away from here
I could do about anything1Embed
