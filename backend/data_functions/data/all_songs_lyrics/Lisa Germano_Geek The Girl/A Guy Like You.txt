A Guy Like You LyricsI can't hear anything
You can yell
You can scream
I got my things to do
Anyway, far from you
You are this baby
Pulls me down angry
I don't care anyhow
People just let me down
I just get angrier
You say that love is it
All of it, a bunch of shit
I'll ruin everything
Piece of mind, or a ring
What makes me angry just makes you sad
This should be easier, maybe if I could hear
But I'll just get angrier
And close my eyes and wish away
Hide it inside
Nobody knows
I just get angrier
There's something you need me for
But I can't give anymore
I gave it all away
Less and less everyday
What makes you crazy
Takes me there too
I just expect it to
Trying to be a guy like you
Walk away
Intoxicated
Nobody knows
I can't hear anythingEmbed
