Up On Your Leopard (Upon The End Of Your Feral Days) LyricsYou're the one who ran in the wild â€˜cause you're the one the wild called
And you're the one who followed the child to save the sun from how it falls
You're the one who had knives set aside for the throats of hunters
But they tricked you with a trinket and a name
And I'm the one who sat at your capture and I'm the one who whispered low
That's the one who followed the child to save the son and look it's starting to snow!
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're the one who's riding around on a leopard
You're the one who's throwing his shit in the air!
You're the one whose wild hide will weather
In the weathering days to a leather
Made for princes to lay their princely heads of hair!
Upon the end of your feral days, upon the end of your feral days
Upon the end of your feral days oh-oh-oh-oh-oooooooooh
You're the one who ran in the wild a virgin to a name
And you're the one who lived off a forsaken land
I'm the one who sat at your capture
And let the snow fall on this whispering rapture
And you're the one who's kissing your captor's hands
Well shit, I know we're all growing old but where there's a will, there is a way, so way to go
Say goodbye to your feral days, say goodbye to your feral days, say-ay goodbye-aye-aye-aye-aaaaaye
Cause you're the one who's riding around on a leopard ba-da-dum
You're the one who's throwing dead birds in the air
And you're the one whose wild hide will weather
In the weathering days to a leather
Made soft so princes can lay down their princely white heads of hair!
So say goodbye
Say goodbye to your feral days
Say-ay goodbye-aye-aye-aye-aye
Your highness is holding your chains
Your highness is holding your chains
Your highness is holding your chains
Your highness is holding your chains
Your highness is holding your chains
Your highness is holding your chains
Your highness is holding your chains
Your highness is holding your chainsEmbed
