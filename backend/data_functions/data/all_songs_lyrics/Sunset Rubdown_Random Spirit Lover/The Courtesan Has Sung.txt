The Courtesan Has Sung LyricsThe courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar
The courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar
Think of the scene where a washed-up actor wipes the makeup off his wife and says
"Morticians must have took you for a whore."
The courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar
The stranger finds you in your home
Says "Brother, your work's got no soul."
You say "Brother, bite your tongue, it is my soul that you have won."
The courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar
And when she showed him all her paintings he said
"Let's do something racy."
Took the bottle from his pocket, it was vodka, again
The courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar
Five actors have arrived, they are good looking
But they're hungry they start cooking
With the trash found on the safety of the stage
And you see the crowd is forming
But the winged things are swarming
Yelling, "Stop, it's fucking poison!"
But the deaf, they hear no warnings
Whoa-ah-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-ah-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-ah-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh)
Think of the scene where a washed-up actor wipes the makeup off his wife and says
"Morticians must have took you for a whore
Oh, morticians must have took you for a whore
Oh, love I'm sorry that they took you for a whore"
And I am sorry if you took me for a whore
Oh, I am sorry if you took me for a whore
But if you're sorry that you took me for a whore
Well, then I'm sorry that I took you for morticians
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh) Whoa-ah-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh) Whoa-ah-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooooh)Embed
