Child-Heart Losers LyricsThere's a child heart, in the child
There's a child heart, in the child
There's a child heart, living wild, oh
La-la-la-la fire makes it go
And you were pretty, before you knew
And you were pretty, before you knew
And you were pretty, before you knew it all
La-la-la-la now fire makes you go
All a diamond is, is good timing
All a diamond is, is good timing
All good diamonds are uncut diamonds, oh
La-la-la-la fire makes them so cold to the eye
Who lets that take place, and where'd you learn to stage dive with such grace?
Indescribable face, what do you stay beautiful for?
And don't you worry about the floor
Why so many, many, many, many, many violins?
Why so many, many, many, many, many violins?Embed
