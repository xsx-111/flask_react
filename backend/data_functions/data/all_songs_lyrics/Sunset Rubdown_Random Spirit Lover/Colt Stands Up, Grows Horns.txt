Colt Stands Up, Grows Horns LyricsI follow the trail you left in the snow
It took your footsteps and made them my own
One thousand and one, One thousand and two
Oh, the gravity of you
You gave me an idol, when you gave me these idle hands
And you twist up land, â€˜til the snow turns to sand
And I can't find the trail back homeEmbed
