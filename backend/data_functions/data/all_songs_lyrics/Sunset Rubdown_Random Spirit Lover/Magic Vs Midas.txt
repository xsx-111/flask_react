Magic Vs Midas LyricsWould you say that you wish you were worse than you are?
Would you say that you wish you were worse than you are?
See, you made up a list of your luckiest stars
And you made me familiar to you in the dark
When you said that you wish you were worse than you are
Hey you, with the gold which you keep, or which keeps you, in place
Do you recoil from its jealous green and copper taste?
Oh, do you love to dance
With it hanging like some hula dress so lightly off your waist?
Was it magic or Midas that touched you?
And by magic, I mean trickery and by Midas, I mean faith
By magic, I mean trickery and by Midas, I mean faith
But the sister speaks of trickery! Is your worth the work of the Midas touch?
Do you close your eyes while you're dancing, the same you close your eyes in your lover's clutches?
How dare I speak of trickery, I am not bestowed with the Midas touch
I don't close my eyes while I'm dancing the same way I close my eyes in my lover's clutches
How dare I speak of trickery, when the wild things singing are pulling their sham?
You can follow the lead of the jackal to see where I am
You can follow the lead of the jackal who waits for the kill to be made by a mightier hand
You made up a list of your luckiest stars, and you made me familiar to you in the dark
You made up a list of your luckiest stars, and you made me familiar to you in the dark
Ba-dum ba-dum oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ba-dum
And you made me familiar to you in the dark, when you said that you wish you were worse than you are
Ba-dum ba-dum oh-oh-oh-oh-oh ba-dum
And you made up a list of your luckiest stars, and you made me familiar to you in the dark
And you made me familiar to you in the dark, when you said that you wish you were worse than you are
And I follow the lead of the jackal to see where you areEmbed
