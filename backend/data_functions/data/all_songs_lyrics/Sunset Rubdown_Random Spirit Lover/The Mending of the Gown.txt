The Mending of the Gown LyricsHe made an enemy, then
He made an enemy of all of you
It's him, not you
You never heard it from me
But there's a breach in the hull
Where the truth and the water's too deep to prove
He made an enemy, then
He made an enemy of all of you
It's him, not you
It's a little red sea- let the miracle worker go free
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down
And a man falls in the sea
He was a man of many nations
Had a hundred souls and a hundred to go
He was a man of many nations
Two hearts, two hands, it's a slippery slope
He had a fear of being naked
But you're any other man in another man's clothes
He was a man of many nations
With revelations, oh, revelations
He wrote a book about the Bible
And he wrote a book about men in the sky
He wrote a book about the smell of winter
Then two, a little less simple to decipher
Saying, “I am the water at the foot of the palms
Oh, I'm sand and wind and a shitty mirage
But either way, I'm a man of many nations!”
Was it the mending of the gown
Or the running it around?
Was it the mending of the gown
Or the running and the running it around?
She had a name, she had a spirit
She had a line in the play, if you waited to hear it
But a master of disguises
Her demise was her design, they said
Was it the mending of the gown
Or the running, and the running, and the running it around?
She said, "My name and my spirit are both corrupted
If you hold me close, you gotta hold me up"
It was the tender mending of this slender gown
That brought me bending to the ground
Now you'll wear any old thing
Oh, you'll wear any old thing
So she wrapped herself in swaddling
That the fever deviated to a broken wing
It's an act, I think she's just pretending
It's an act, I think, she's just pretending
If you burn the virgin flags, then I will shake (Shake!)
As the heat waves in the sand
This one's for Maggie (This one's for Maggie!)
This one's for Sam (This one's for Sam!)
This one's for Maggie (This one's for Maggie!)
This one's for Sam (This one's for Sam!)
Or any other random spirit lover busted
I have lusted after you
The way bloodsuckers do!
The way bloodsuckers do!
The way bloodsuckers do!
Was it the mending of the gown
Or the running it around?
Was it the mending of the gown
Or the running, and the running
And the running, and the running it around?
It was the tender mending of this slender gown
That brought me bending to the ground
But this ship was built to go down
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!
