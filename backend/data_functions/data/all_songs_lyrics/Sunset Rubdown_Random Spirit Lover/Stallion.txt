Stallion LyricsStallion, step away
Saddle up the width of an age
I'm good where I am, I am good where I am, stallion
Wrote off "stay gold" from the list I hold
Then I wrote off "all gold" from the list you hold
I'll be the grave with no name on the stone, stallion
And fight for your right to hate the night
Children sing like a choir with no taste for the wine
And the time-minding dawn when the chiding eye falls upon you, you
First fall of light on the counterfeit ring likens other things, some unknown glittering
The balancing of rider and steed can't be upon yooooouuuu, yooooouuuu
Yooooouuuu, yooooouuuu
Stallion, step away
Saddle up the width of an age
I'm good where I am, I am good where I am
Oh, my god where I am, oh my god where I am
And you, you have to flexing two muscles on the stage
Now, step away, step, step away, step away
Saddle up the width of an age
Wrote off the prospect of gold in my way
Stallion, step away
The fluttering of wings in the trees can't be upon yooooouuuu
Yooooouuuu, yooooouuuu, yooooouuuuEmbed
