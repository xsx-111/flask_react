Setting Vs. Rising LyricsHow you gonna sing a song that runs
From the mouth of where the singing comes
From the mouth of where the song is sung
Do you call a setting sun a sun rising?
How you gonna get the soil and the glory
When you want to be a harvester of light
But the soil only turns under the moon's shitty story?
There may be churches burning down next year
If I'm a city then my citizens will pass no pails along
There may be temples of temptation to take refuge in, my dear
If I'm a city then my citizens will cast a vote
As to where you pray vs. what you're praying for
And what you love vs. what you bow before
And where you beg and what you're begging forEmbed
