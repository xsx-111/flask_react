Driving Rain Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again

If something's open, it's my heart
If something's missing, it's when we're apart
If something's good, it's when we're back together again
Nothing's wrong, it's just insane
Nothing's right until you're back again
Nothing's broken when it's softly spoken
And we're walking slowly down the lane

Why don't we drive in the rain?
Straight to the eye of the hurricane?
Go for a ride in the driving rain

1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Ooh, ooh
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again
Baby, baby
You come walking through my door
Like the one that I've been waiting for
Letting sunshine in the darkest places
When I've been going there again

So why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane?
Why don't we drive in the rain
Straight to the eye of the hurricane?
Go for a ride in the driving rain

1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Ooh, ooh
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again
Baby, baby

In the driving rain
Why don't we drive in the driving rain?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Ooh, ooh
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Oh, let's go back again
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's go for a drive
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Let's go there and back again

You come walking through my door
Like the one that I've been waiting forEmbed
