Spinning on an Axis Lyrics
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again

I watch the sun go down with some sorrow
And now I know it's gonna come back tomorrow
Ain't no reason it has to do that
It's the season of the culture bat

Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Staring in the face of time and space
Spinning on an axis

World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again
Hear me rising
Rise up and sing
Rise up
Rise up
Although I'm curious, it isn't a crime
I want to know if I'll find out in time
A lot of people busy doing their thing
Gonna wake up and sing early

Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
We ask the question, the answer's "yes"
Spinning on an axis
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I watch the sun go down with some sorrow
And now I know it's gonna come back tomorrow
Ain't no reason why it has to do that
It's the season of the culture bat

I watch the sun go down
Wonder if it's gonna come back
Certainly there's no guarantee
But I got a feeling it will be
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on, spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Spinning on an axis
Yeah

World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up again
World spinning round to the next revolution
Sun going down, gonna rise up
Gonna rise up
Gonna rise up
Gonna rise up
Gonna rise up again

World spinning round to the next revolutionEmbed
