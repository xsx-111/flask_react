Your Loving Flame Lyrics
How can I hope to reach your love?
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame

What am I to do if I don't have you?
I'll be feeling blue just sitting here without you
You could be the one to chase my blues away
Away


So tell me how, how to reach your love
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame

What am I to do if I don't have you?
Say I'll be feeling blue just sitting here without you
You could be the one to chase my blues away
Away
'Cause when we kiss, nothing feels the same
I could spend eternity inside your loving flame
So tell me how (Tell me how)
How to reach your love (Your love)
Help me to discover what it is you're thinking of

How can I hope to reach your love?
Here forever in your loving flameEmbed
