Rinse The Raindrops Lyrics
Rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning, skies'll clear
And I'll be here
See the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the song they sing
Awakening
Rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning, skies will clear
And I'll be here
See the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Now listen to the songs they sing
Awakening, oh yeah
Rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning, skies will clear
And I'll be here
Whoa see the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the song they sing
Awakening
Awakening
Awakening
Awakening
Rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning, skies'll clear
And I'll be here
See the sunlight, melt the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the song they sing
Awakening
Rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning, skies'll clear
And I'll be here
Whoa see the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the song they sing
Awakening
And I'll be here
Well rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning, skies will clear
And I'll be here
See the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the songs they sing
Awakening
Rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning, skies will clear
And I'll be here
Rinse the raindrops from your head
Wipe your eyes, go back to bed
In the morning I'll be here
And the skies will clear
See the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the songs they sing
Awakening, awakening
Ah skies will clear and I'll be here
See the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the songs they sing
Awakening
The morning skies will clear
And I'll be here
See the sunlight, break the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the songs they sing
Awakening
Awakening
Oh yeah
Awakening
In the morning I'll be here
See the sunlight melt the ice
For the birds of paradise
Listen to the song they singEmbed
