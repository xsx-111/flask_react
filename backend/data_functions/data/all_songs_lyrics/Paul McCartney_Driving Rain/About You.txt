About You Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

You give me power to get out of bed
When in the morning I'm feeling dead
Living and loving there's a lot to be said
It's true

Going to say it about you
Say it about you

Out of the darkness and into the light
Straight to the centre of everything right
Darling, don't worry, the sky will be bright and blue

When I say it about you
Going to say it about you
I'll say it about you

When did you teach me to fly thru the air?
Sooner or later, we all will be there
I read the headlines, and now I can swear
It's true
And they said it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about you
Gonna say it about youEmbed
