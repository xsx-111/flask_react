Lonely Road Lyrics
I tried to get over you
I tried to find something new
But all I could ever do was fill my time
With thoughts of you

I tried to go somewhere old
To search for my pot of gold
But all I could ever hold inside my mind
Were thoughts of you

I hear your music and it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms in a different style
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild again, oh

Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

Yeah!
Oh, lonely, lonely road
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild
Familiar rhythms in a different style
I hear your music, and it's driving me wild again

Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again
Don't want to let you take me down
Don't want to get hurt second time around
Don't want to walk that lonely road again

I don't wanna walk that lonely road, no
Don't wanna, don't wanna walk that lonely road
Don't wanna walk that lonely road
I don't wanna walk it
No, no, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna walk that lonely road
I don't wanna walk that lonely road again
No, no, no, no
I don't wanna walk that lonely road
No, no
No, noEmbed
