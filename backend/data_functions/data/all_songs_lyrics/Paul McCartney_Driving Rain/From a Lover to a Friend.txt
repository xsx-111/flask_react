From a Lover to a Friend Lyrics
And when the time comes around, we will be duty bound
To tell the through of what we've seen
And what we haven't found will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see

From a lover to a friend, take your own advice
Let me love again
Now that you turned out to be someone I can trust
Someone I believe

Ooh la la la la la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want is to tell me
You're going to take it away

From a lover to a friend
Take your own advice, let me love again
Now that you turned out to be
Someone I can trust, someone I believe

And what we haven't found
Will not be going down
Despite too easy ride to see
From a lover to a friend, you turned out to be
Someone I believe
From a lover to a friend, take your own advice
Let me love again

Ooh la la la la la la la la
How can I walk when I can't find a way
I have a dilemma
All I want it is to tell me
You're going to take it away

From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
From a lover to a friend
Let me love againEmbed
