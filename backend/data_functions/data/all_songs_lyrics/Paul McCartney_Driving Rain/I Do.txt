I Do Lyrics
If you only knew how much it meant to me
You'd understand and I would feel your love was true

This is all I want
This is all I need
This is all I long for
"I do"

Just remember this, after a time it's through
And evermore will there be days for me and you

This is all I ask
All I ask of you
Please remember darling
I do love you

Days go by so quickly when you're having fun
But life is never easy even in the sun

But please remember this, after a time it's through
And evermore will there be days for me and you
This is all I want
This is all I need
Darling please remember
I do love you

If you only knewEmbed
