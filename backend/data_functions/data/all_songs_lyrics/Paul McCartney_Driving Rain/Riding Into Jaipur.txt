Riding Into Jaipur Lyrics
Riding to Jaipur
Riding through the night
Riding with my baby
Oh what a delight
Oh what a delight
It is
Riding to Jaipur
Riding through the night
Riding with my baby
Oh what a delight
Oh what a delight
It is
Riding to Jaipur
Riding through the night
With my baby
With my baby
With my baby
With my, with my babyEmbed
