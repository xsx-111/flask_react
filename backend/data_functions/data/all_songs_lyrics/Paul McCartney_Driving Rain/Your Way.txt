Your Way Lyrics
I like it, please don't take my heart away
It's happy where it is, so let it stay

You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

I've seen it shining from the furthest stars
Like Venus saw it on the way to Mars

You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

I like it, please don't take my heart away
It's happy where it is, so let it stay
You gave me love
You gave me what I wanted
You gave me love your way

Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight
Your way is strong
You way is right
Your way is mine tonight

You gave me love your wayEmbed
