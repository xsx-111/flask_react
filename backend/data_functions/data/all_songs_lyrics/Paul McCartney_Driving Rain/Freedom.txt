Freedom Lyrics
This is my right
A right given by God
To live a free life
To live in freedom

Talking about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom

Anyone tries to take it away
They'll have to answer, 'cause this is my right

I'm talking about freedom
Talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom
I'm talking about freedom
Talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom
Everybody talking about freedom
We're talking about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedom
Talking about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I will fight for the right
To live in freedom
I'm talking about freedom
I'm talking about freedom
We will fight for the right
To live in freedomEmbed
