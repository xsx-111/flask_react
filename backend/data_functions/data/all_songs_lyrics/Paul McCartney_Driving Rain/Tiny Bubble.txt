Tiny Bubble Lyrics
Well, well
Oh, yeah
Mmm, hmm
Well, well
Oh, yeah
Mmm, yeah
Oh, yeah

If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that

All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth

When I look in your eyes I can see the sky
Shining down upon the perfect garden

All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth
You can't imagine just what I've been going through
I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you
I well remember when my heart was free
My soul could laugh, so could we

If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that

All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
Those of us who notice are expected to hide
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside the truth

You can't imagine just what I've been going through
I wouldn't wish it on a soul much less on you
I well remember when my heart was free
My soul could laugh, so could we

If you're part of my love, don't leave home tonight
While we're sleeping we can learn to see that
All the world's a tiny bubble floating inside
All the world's a tiny bubble
All the world's a tiny bubbleEmbed
