Back in the Sunshine Again Lyrics
Here we are
Back in the sunshine again
No more worries
And no more pain

Where we're leaving behind
All our trouble and strife
That's the way it's gonna be
Oh, for the rest of my life

Well, here we are, here we are
We're back in the sunshine again
No more worries, no more worries
And no more pain, no more pain

Life's too short to spend it lonely
You only throw it away
Listen to your voice of reason
Yeah, call it a day
Eh eh ay

Take a ride, take a ride
Out to the land of the free, ooh ooh
Don't hurry take your time, take your time
Come and spend it with me
Ooh ooh ooh
Back in the sunshine
We're back in the sunshine
Ooh, yes

Here we are
We're back in the sunshine again
No more worries, no more worries, no more worries
And no more pain

Life's too short to spend it lonely
You only throw it away
Listen to your voice of reason
Just call it a day
Eh eh ay

Here we are
We're back in the sunshine again
No more worries, no more worries
And no more pain

Here we are, here we are
Yeah, we're  back in the sunshine again
No more worries, oh no
And no more pain
Why, why?
We're back in the sunshine again
No more worries
We're back in the sunshine againEmbed
