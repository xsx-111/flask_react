Pet Cemetery Lyrics
They took my dog away, they treat him like a stray
I talked to God today (All dogs go to heaven)
(Heaven) I miss my dog, (Heaven) I kissed my dog
(Heaven) I miss my dog, (Heaven) I kissed my dog
(All dogs go to heaven)

My dog had a name, keepin’ his name alive
If I had to leave, Hell on Earth (All dogs go to heaven)
My dog had a name (I’m gon’ sing his name)
Keepin’ his name alive (I’m the one to blame)
If I had to leave (He would do the same)
Hell on Earth (Walkin' through the flames)

Heaven
