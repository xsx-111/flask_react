Flea Market Lyrics
I ain’t tryna rush things
But, it’s been a while now
People have names
And they all smile now
Throwin’ in the towel now
Bitch, you better bow down (Yeah)
Throwin’ in the towel now (Yeah)
Tell them bitches calm down (Yeah)
Get on your knees, baby
Copy of the keys, baby
Lovin’ your steez, baby
Brushin’ off fleas, baby
I don’t really wanna have to ask you twice
Yeah, I'll be your girl if you ask me nice
Couldn't wait to see you in a thousand nights
Easy to see, like a traffic light

Oh, oh (Won't you realize, I'm the one)
I don't wanna rush ya
Oh, oh (Won't you realize, I'm the one)
Hope that you trust me
Oh, oh (Won't you realize, I'm the one)
I don’t wanna rush ya
Oh, Yeah, oh (I'm the one)5Embed
