Pretty Ugly Lyrics
Don’t worry ‘bout me, I’m doing good
I’m doing great, alright
It’s about to get ugly, flow so mean
I just can’t be polite
Don’t worry ‘bout me, I’m doing good
I’m doing great, alright
It’s about to get ugly, flow so mean
I just can’t be polite

I bet you ain’t heard no flow like this
Make you say "Yo, excuse me miss"
Go against me, I'll beat like Swizz
I like my paper nice and crisp, uh
Crispy clean and crisp and clean
For the dough, I go nuts like Krispy Kreme
Music is in my Billie genes
Can’t no one ever come between, yeah

Don’t worry ‘bout me, I’m doing good
I’m doing great, alright
It’s about to get ugly, flow so mean
I just can’t be polite
Don’t worry ‘bout me, I’m doing good
I’m doing great, alright
It’s about to get ugly, flow so mean
I just can’t-Embed
