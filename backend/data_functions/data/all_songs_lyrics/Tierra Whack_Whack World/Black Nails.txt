Black Nails Lyrics
Readin’ my open mail, this ship here won’t sail (Yeah)
Best believe I’m gon’ sell (Yeah), if I just be myself
I'ma head and you’re tails, red paint on my nails
Keep shit to myself, listen to myself
Writin' bars in my cell, rice next to my kale
Shirt holy like grail, distant for my health
My name Whack ring bells, yes, I’ve changed like Wells
I’m doing so well, so, I say: "Oh well!"
I don’t tell no tales, should've spent time in Yale
Bitch, shut up, don’t yell, here, boy, take this LEmbed
