4 Wings Lyrics
Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard 'cause I do not like soft
My niggas shine with the lights off
Here go some swag you can bite off
Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard 'cause I do not like soft
My niggas shine with the lights off (Yeah)
Here go some swag you can bite off (Yeah, yum, yum, yum)

Open wide, look at God, homicides
I'm not perfect but I improvise
Drop shit and my niggas vibe
Endless nights I cried when Hulitho died, yeah
My city needs me, I promised I wouldn't fail 'em
If you love somebody, I promise that you should tell 'em
Ain't buyin' what you're selling, pockets swelling
Sellin' white, showin' off, feelin' like I'm Ellen (Ha)

Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard 'cause I do not like softEmbed
