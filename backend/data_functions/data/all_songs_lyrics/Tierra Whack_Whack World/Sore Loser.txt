Sore Loser Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

Know you hate to be ignored
But boy, I’ve been bored
Keep calling my phone
Shit dead like a corpse
Corpse, corpse
Broke his heart, now he
Sore, sore
Change the locks on the door
Damn, another one
I'ma need a boo when the summer done
Need a fine brother like my mother's son
Blah, blah, dun dun, dun-dun-dun
Had a few in the past
But them boys ain’t last
Where them boys with the cash?
Ex dead, if you ask me, uh
So, please don’t ask me
He’s trash, he’s nasty
Keep goin’, walk past me
Who’s that? He’s flashy
Maybe way too flashy
That’s Diddy, I’m Cassie
Free sample, you can have meEmbed
