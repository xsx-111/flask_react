Dr. Seuss Lyrics
Not hard to say, but it’s hard to do
Easy for me, but it’s hard for you
You say you fly, but you never flew
Not hard to say, but it’s hard to do

Let me remind the elephant must be hard to settle it, evident
You only cool when you hella bent, look but don’t touch
I should just be celibate, you the type to sell out
Me, I’m trying to sell a bit, relevant (Not hard to say but-)
I should run for president, anything’s possible, I live in the hospital
I’m sick and tired of all these niggas lying (Not hard to say-)
About all the shit that they be buyin’
You ever laugh just to keep from crying
Think less about living and more about dyingEmbed
