Fruit Salad Lyrics
Worry ‘bout yourself and don’t worry about nobody
Drinking’ water, eatin’ fruits, takin' care of my body
When you doin’ good, they want kick it just like Karate
Stealin’ swag, I know they mad, they tried to rob me

They tried to rob me, they can't deny me
You can't define me, don’t need no ID
They want to rob me, they can’t deny me
You can't define me, I don’t need no ID

I did, I did, I did (I eat all my vegetables)
I did, I did, I did (Lower my cholesterol)
I did, I did, I did (That fast food just make you slow)
I did, I did, I did (Lower my cholesterol)
I did, I did, I did (I ate all my vegetables)
I did, I did, I did (I just had to let you know)

They want to rob me, they can't deny me (I did, I did, I did)
(That fast food makes you slow)
You can't define me, I don't need no ID
(I just had to let you know)4Embed
