Please Come Home LyricsWe've been writing letters each day
Hoping that you'll come home
And we're wondering if you're okay
As you're not on the phone
Face the facts now
Take a chance
Come on back now
Fast
Please come home
Please come home
Everyone cares for you
Please come home
Please come home
Everyone cares for you
Everyone
We've been writing letters each day
Hoping
That you'll...
Come homeEmbed
