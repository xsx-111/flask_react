Lies Lyrics
Tell me no lies
Has peace arrived
Or, is this some kind of joke?
What a surprise
You don't realise
There's some things you don't own


Can you disguise
Can you simplify
This change you put me through?
Can you revive
And will I survive
This life you've brought me to?



Can you disguise
Can you simplify
Ah, this change you put me through?


Tell me no lies
Has peace arrived
Or this some kind of joke?Embed
