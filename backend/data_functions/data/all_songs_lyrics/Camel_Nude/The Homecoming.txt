The Homecoming LyricsInstrumental)
The band marched beneath a banner that read welcome
Home soldier. City streets were littered with cheering
Crowds entangled in the paper streamers that filled the air
Hailed for his 'unquestioned patriotism' and 'heroic bravery'
Nude was unable to respond. The tidal wave of publicity that
Engulfed his life had a devastating effect after 29 years aloneEmbed
