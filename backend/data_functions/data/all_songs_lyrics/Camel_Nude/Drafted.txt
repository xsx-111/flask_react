Drafted Lyrics
In reply to your request
Please find
I hereby protest
To the ways and means you use
You know
I cannot refuse
So I'll take this vow
Of loyalty
Fight for the right
You have said
To be free


When this time has run its course
I must
Live without remorse
For the deeds I'm bound to do
I know
It's all the same to you
But I won't forget
The memory
Taking a life
For a life
To be free
