City Life Lyrics
Wake-up
Wake-up, wake-up
Signs tell the time
You're wasting
Wake up
Wake-up, wake-up
Life you will find
Is changing

O the city life
Endless confusion
Hanging on too tight
To this illusion

I'm not what I appear to be
I couldn't take the honesty
It seemed to be
Too easy for reality

O the city life
What have I come to?
Faces in the night
Friendly to fool you
I always try to justify
The way I am and wonder why
I couldn't be
The same to you I am to me

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up


I'm not what I appear to be
I couldn't take the honesty
It seemed to be
Too easy for reality

Oh, the city life
(Picks you up, lets you down)
Oh, the city life
City lifeEmbed
