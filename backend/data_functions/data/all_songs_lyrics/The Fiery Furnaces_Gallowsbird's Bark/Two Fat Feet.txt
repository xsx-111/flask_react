Two Fat Feet LyricsSlip me out of my northern noose
My Easter egg
My Western wheel
And a Southern snake
I've got a busted breast and a jiggly thigh
A rumpled roast and a ragged eye
A floppy neck and two fat feet
Sneaky cheeks chewin' greasy gums
You got a wing in your snaggle tooth
And you can't knock it back with no 80 proof
You got a wing in your snaggle tooth
And you can't knock it back with no 80 proofEmbed
