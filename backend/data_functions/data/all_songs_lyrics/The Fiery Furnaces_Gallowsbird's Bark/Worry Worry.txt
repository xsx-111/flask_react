Worry Worry LyricsNever let one man worry your little mind
Never let one man worry your little mind
He'll keep you troubled, worried
Worried all the time
Don't you wish your little boy was cute like mine?
Don't you wish your little boy was cute like mine?
He's a married man
But he comes to see me sometimeEmbed
