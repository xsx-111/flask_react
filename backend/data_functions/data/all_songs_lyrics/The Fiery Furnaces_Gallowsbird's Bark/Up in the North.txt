Up in the North LyricsWearing my scarf and my hat
And I squint and I sniff as I went around
Walked up the road through the woods
By the pines, by the lake as I heard the sound
Maria Anna Gamisou
Daughter of a dire in Oulu
Sang me a song or two
And I wrote them down
Up in the North, in the cold
In the ice, in the snow
She would cry and cry
There she would moan, she would whine
And the tears would pour down
And she would never
Angela Exema Milou
A servant girl in Turku
Sang me a song or two
And I wrote them down
Down in the South, in the heat
In the sweat, in the rain
She would cry and cry
There she would moan, she would whine
And the tears would pour down
And she would never
Melissa Jarmon Dupres - oo!
Sitting on a bench in Anjou
Sang me a song or two
And I wrote them down
Elias Doxia Didou
Son of a bitch back in Turku
Sang me a song or two
And I wrote them downEmbed
