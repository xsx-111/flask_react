Rub-Alcohol Blues LyricsTroubles up and down the road
And trials all the way around
Never knew what trouble was
Till my honey threw me down
With nothing but old ragged clothes
My heart strings broken to shreds
Blues creeping over my body
Queer notions flying in my head
The easiest thing I ever done
Was loving and drinking wine
The hardest thing I ever done
Was paying off a judge's fine
I've never worked for pleasure
Peace on earth I cannot find
The only thing I surely own
Is a worried and troubled mind
If men and wine don't kill me
The one more plan to find
Soak up all the old rub-alcohol
Ease all trouble off my mindEmbed
