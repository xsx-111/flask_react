Leaky Tunnel LyricsI pulled my kerchief out of my pocket
Wiped my nose and said hello
I bought a tambourine at the millennium dome
It jangled 2000 times in a row
I caught a cold when I was way down south
Standing out in the heat
Now my eyes are all itchy
And I can't tell which way to walk down the street
I'm stumbling through the crosswalk
And I'm humming in the din
And when I get to the other side
I'm gonna jangle my tambourine again
I fished my microphone out of Regent's Canal
Heading from Little Venice to Greenwich
Dirty boy said let's make in love in the water
I said, No thanks, pal
Went on dictating in my mic
I got no time for a dip cause I'm heading for my ship
I'm going down to the tunnel
Down to the leaky leaky tunnelEmbed
