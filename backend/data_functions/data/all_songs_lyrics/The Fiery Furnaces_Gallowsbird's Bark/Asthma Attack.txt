Asthma Attack LyricsI woulda had a asthma attack
If I seen the shark bite back
I woulda had a asthma attack
If I seen the shark bite back
Yeah it's paradise island I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah I been there before
Once, twice, three times maybe
Once with my Moms and twice with my baby
I shook my silver bracelet at a thousand times
They like the shimmer-glimmer but said
No never, no never, no never swim in the dark
Once, twice, three times maybe
Once with my Moms and twice with my baby
I woulda had a asthma attack
If I seen the shark bite back
I woulda had a asthma attack
If I seen the shark bite back
Yeah, yeah it's just a figure of speech
A python ate my babe when he hit the beachEmbed
