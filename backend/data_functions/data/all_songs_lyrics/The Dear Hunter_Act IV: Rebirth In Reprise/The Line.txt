The Line Lyrics
Heartache buried down below
With your hands tied tight around it
Have a hard time letting go
Like it never even happened

It's the end of the line for you and I
Don't make believe we even tried
It's the end of the line for you and I

Spring had gone and clipped your wings
And the summer led astray
Autumn left a bitter sting
But the winter froze away

It's the end of the line for you and I
Don't make believe we even tried
It's the end of the line for you and I

Now we dream
Of bigger things
Now we sing
To set us free
(Now we dream)
Was lost in limbo long enough for two
(Of bigger things)
But my identity was wasted on you
(Now we sing)
Cast out the past like demons ritually removed
(To set us free)
Make way for the awakening, so long overdue
It's the end of the line
It's the end of the line
It's the end of the line for you and IEmbed
