Is There Anybody Here? Lyrics
I lay my body down
To rest my weary head
I think I left someone there
I left myself for dead

So is there anybody here
Who can tell me where I am
Or at least where I have been?
Because I fear I’m lost, and I cannot be found again

I left my soul exposed to frail hands who hold
My fate up in the air
And through their fingers fall the meaning of it all
Down to the floor it goes

So is there anybody here
Who can tell me where I am?

Waking in the afternoon, a captive in a passive tomb
Moments turn to long Decembers, stoking fires from dying embers
I try to move a limb, but there's a disconnect within
A devil in the alchemy, a phantom staring back at me
It's you
So is there anybody here
Who can tell me where I am
Or at least where I have been?
Because I fear I’m lost, and I cannot be found again

Just waking in the afternoon, a captive in a passive tomb
Moments turn to long Decembers, stoking fires from dying embers
I try to move a limb but there's a disconnect within
A devil in the alchemy, a phantom staring back at me
A pain I simply can't express, from troubles I have long repressed
And then there's you...
