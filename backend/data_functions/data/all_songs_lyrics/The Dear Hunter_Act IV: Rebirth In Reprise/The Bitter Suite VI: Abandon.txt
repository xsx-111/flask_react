The Bitter Suite VI: Abandon Lyrics
Strangers in the soil, so hide your enmity
Are you living up to ghosts or does virtue disagree?
Oh...

Use your gifts for good, rescue them from greed
Find a proper voice as a thistle in the wreath
Oh...

Move them to truth, far from ruin
And barricade the myth I made, the wolves at bay
I know that history fades and sympathy dithers away

The City's Son living under my thumb

You couldn't compromise, so keep playing with fire
Oh...

Move them to truth, far from ruin
And barricade the myth I made, the wolves at bay
I know that history fades and sympathy dithers away
