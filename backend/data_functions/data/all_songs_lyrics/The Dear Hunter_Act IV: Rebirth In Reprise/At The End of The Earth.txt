At The End of The Earth Lyrics
I’ve waited so long just to hear you breathe
That your Voice could lead me
Back from the grave
From the slowing breath of a sleep like Death

Now morning comes
But I’m brokenhearted till we meet again
At the end of the earth

I never had known such a fragile hurt
Of a lover's curse
And the Echoes of you
Rhyme like a distant verse on forgotten words

Now morning comes
But I'm brokenhearted till we meet again
At the end of the earth

I’ll keep moving on out of harmony
Until I see you again, at the end of the earth
(Someday she'll be gone)
I lost my love down below and
I’d swear you'd never know
So give me death or set me free
Just return my soul to Me
Now morning comes but I’m brokenhearted
Till we meet again at the end of the Earth
I’ll keep moving on out of harmony
Until I see you again
At the end of the earth
Till we meet again at the end of the earthEmbed
