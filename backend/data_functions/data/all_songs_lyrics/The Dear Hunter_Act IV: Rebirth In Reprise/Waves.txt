Waves Lyrics
I thought that I knew love
But it was just a wave crashing over us
And in the breaths between the ones we meant to breathe
I had my head under my feet

You knew the way things were
You knew the way they would be
We knew exactly how it'd end

Strays on a stale sea
I'll anchor the engine to a canyon far beneath
The water rushed up from the boards below
So I started slicking my hair with the kerosene

You knew the way things were
You knew the way they would be
We knew exactly how it'd end

And I'm preparing for a burial at sea
But I can see the lighthouse
Yeah I'm praying that these waters don't take me
Cause I can see the lighthouse
I was screaming that the ship was sinking
But you were telling me to just keep drinking
Quartered  into parts again
Arms and legs at the bottom of the ocean
And the thing that made it so much harder
Was the fact that you were someone's daughter

I knew the way things were
I knew the way they would be
I knew exactly how it'd end
And I can see the lighthouse

And I'm preparing for a burial at sea
But I can see the lighthouse
Yeah, I'm praying that these waters don't take me
Cause I can see the lighthouse
Yeah, I can see the lighthouse

I thought that I knew love
But it was just a wave crashing over us4Embed
