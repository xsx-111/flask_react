Remembered Lyrics
Left your face on a map
Sturdied up boulders and loosened the river
To fork where it finds the best
Passage

Met your life before us
Left them your necklace and brandished your ashes
Like stars peaking out in the gloam
Envy

Every choice that you made
Lost before cause had effect found in Babel
Like pieces of puzzles belong
Shackled

Gave myself to the war
Damned if I didn't demand that they sing
Such a sensible baring of you
Mystery

The flame might be gone but the Fire remains
And Iâ€™m stuck on a path to my own ruin
Did you see me behind the wheel?
Did you see me behind the wheel?
And the flame might be gone but the fire...Embed
