If All Goes Well Lyrics
Was it logical lusting after fame
When ambition had never ended well for us?
(Now everything that you lost is surely coming to you)
Every catastrophe has shaped me into something new
(Just don't get carried away making those same mistakes)
I know my limit but I’ll push it
(Yeah) I’ll push it good

I'll give' em a hold and a break to breathe
(Never forget who picks you up when you fall)
And if they can't play nice I won't play with 'em at all
I’ll give them a kick when I learn to lead
(You're getting over your head once again)
And if they don't get out, then I’ll just bury them all

I swear my motive can still remain sincere
And I can remedy all who've wronged before me
(Now everyone that you lost would come back crying to you)
Abandoned memories of family trees I’ve buried too deep
(Just don't get carried away making those same mistakes)
I know my limit but I’ll push it
(Yeah) I’ll push it good
I’ll give 'em a hold and a break to breathe
(Never forget who picks you up when you fall)
And if they can't play nice I won't play with 'em at all
I’ll give them a kick when I learn to lead
(You're getting over your head once again)
And if they don't get out, then I’ll just pity them all

Will you carry us to Eden; someone to believe in
Breaking down the walls which kept us locked away
Lead us into brilliance, born by your resilience
Love us all in spite of what we'll do to you
(I knew that I did this for a reason)
(I knew that I did this for a reason)
Will you carry us to Eden; someone to believe in
Breaking down the walls which kept us locked away
Will you lead us into brilliance, born by your resilience
Love us all in spite of what we'll do to youEmbed
