Ouroboros Lyrics
I bet you thought that you'd succeed
Pulling the wool right over me
Hard to believe this snake stayed in the grass
Just long enough to catch the rabbit's feet
With telescoping glances, hands romanced, enticing you to keep
Laboring against the clock in spite of secrecy
You couldn't know, revealed itself to me
The second you decided to compete

I fell down and I fell apart
"I never wanted to hurt no one, I never wanted to be your city's son"
Then I cried out to his crooked heart
"I never wanted to hurt no one... no one but you"

I bet you thought that you could breathe
A satisfied sigh of relief
A terrible thing, forgetting where you came from
Or have you trouble when you fall asleep?
I’ve seen you fabricate, manipulate and here, you masquerade
But if we're poaching ghosts, you know I’ve got a few that I would raise
Settle yourself; as long as I’m protected
You can bet your secret's safe with me
I fell down and I fell apart
"I never wanted to hurt no one, I never wanted to be your city's son"
Then I cried out to his crooked heart
"I never wanted to hurt no one... no one but you!"

Lost my soul in the place of the great deceiver
Foolish hearts led foolish plans awry; they told me:
"Don't veer far from your home, try never to leave her"
Near, I landed; here I’ll live and die
Traveled too far from the River's side
But it wasn't long before I felt nothing below me
And all of the ground I thought I’d gained, taken away
I thought I was strong, not strong enough, my mettle was bending
Foolish plans kissed foolish hearts goodbye
Traveled too far from the River's side
