King of Swords (Reversed) Lyrics
Gears turning that no wrench can attack
Consideration or pause had their time come and pass
No gloves, bet you can't get enough
Make a fine parade so the public sways in your wake

And I just thought that I would go till the money's gone
I never wanted to fake it
Now I can't stop till everyone who ever done me wrong
Knows Iâ€™m not willing to take it

Boy, you've got a hard time
Bring yourself to glory
You've got a hard time
Bring yourself to glory

I never wanted my name up in bright lights
But I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)
Hey, I was never looking for fame or the limelight
But I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you
No one ever told me what it meant to be alone
I had to learn on my lonesome
Now every feigning flame I chance upon
I put the fire on
I keep my wheels in motion

Boy, you've had a hard time
Bring yourself to glory

I never wanted my name up in bright lights
But I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)
Hey, I was never looking for fame or the limelight
But I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)

You have a hard time
Bring yourself to glory
You have a hard time
Bring yourself to glory
Boy, you have a hard time
Bring yourself to glory
And here's those spoils of war that you asked for
I never wanted my name up in bright lights
But I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)
Hey, hey, I was never looking for fame or the limelight
But I think that I might be there soon
I owe it all to you (I owe it all to you)
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah, I owe it all to you
Hey, hey, hey
I owe it all to you
Hey, hey, hey
I owe it all to you
