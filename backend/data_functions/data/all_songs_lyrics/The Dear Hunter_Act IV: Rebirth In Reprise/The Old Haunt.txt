The Old Haunt Lyrics
Hints of a higher hand, lost on the Somme
Past deeds would never lead the mischief to a christening and
Gears twist and grind away, sped up to speed
While echoed silhouettes deliver to an early dream

Held out of love but gripped too tight
A breath left hanging in the air

You want to leave your home
But you don't want to lose control
And there's far too many ways to die
Far too many ways to die
You want to keep your soul
Above the ocean floor
But there's far too many waves to try
Far too many ways to die

Take a tip from me, I swear Iâ€™ve seen it all before
The fear of what could be will keep you from wanting more

Held out of love, but gripped too tight
Left up, hung In the air
You want to leave your home
But you don't want to lose control
And there's far too many ways to die
Far too many ways to die
You want to keep your soul
Above the ocean floor
But there's far too many waves to try
Far too many ways to die

Never could we keep these things from happening
Never found a way to keep the love in me
Took too long to speak, and never stopped to breathe, to breathe
We read the risks hand in hand
A ruined rest, but now we wake up
We cut our teeth on foreign plans
Then cursed the air, but now we wake up
