Physical Attraction Lyrics
You say that you need my love
And you're wanting my body, I don't mind
Baby, all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine
You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere

This physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction, yeah

Trying hard to get away
But I can't seem to fight the way I feel
Even though you're not for real
Your touch is driving me
Crazy, and when you smile
It's just making me want you more and more
Baby, won't you stay a while?
It could be such a fantasy
This physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
Ooh, it's a physical attraction
Sweet satisfaction, yeah

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door
Out the door

You're confusing me
'Cause I don't know if you want me
But I know that I want you
And that's nothing to be ashamed of
What are you gonna do?

Well, you say that you need my love
And you're wanting my body, I don't mind
Baby, all I've got is time
And I'm waiting to make you mine
You say you wanna stay the night
But you'll leave me tomorrow, I don't care
All of your moves are right
We can take it anywhere
This physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
Sweet satisfaction, yeah

Maybe we were meant to be together
Even though we never met before
We got to move before the sun is rising
And you'll be walking slowly out the door
Out the door

Physical attraction (Physical attraction)
It's a chemical reaction
It's a physical attraction
It's a chemical reaction, yeah

Attraction, reaction (Physical attraction)
So much satisfaction
Attraction, the action
So much satisfaction
It's a physical, a physical, a physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
A physical, physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction
A physical, a physical attraction
A chemical, a chemical reaction2Embed
