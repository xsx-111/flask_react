Think of Me Lyrics
I'm getting tired of waiting around
I feel like I'm always tracking you down
I don't wanna point my finger at you
But there's something you're forgetting
Here's what you better do, you better

Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me (Of me, baby)
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me, oh yeah

You walk in and you see me crying
You apologize say you lost track of time
I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're gonna lose me too
If you don't know what's good for you

Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me (Of me, baby)
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me, oh yeah
Tell me what I did to you
To make you treat me so badly
If you wanna see me anymore
If you don't wanna see me walking out the door, you better

Think of me
I know you want to, baby
Think of me (Of me, baby)
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me, oh yeah
You better think of me
Think, think, think of me (Think)
You know you're driving me crazy (Think)
You better, you better, you better
Think of me, oh yeah

(Think) Stop wasting all my time
(Think, of me, baby)
You know, it could have been so fine
(Think) Hey, boy, I'm waiting on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else?
Stop thinking of yourself, you better
Think of me
I know you want to, baby
(Think) You know you're driving me crazy
Think, think, think of me
You better think of me
Think, think, think of me
(Think, of me, baby)
Stop wasting all my time
(Think) You know, it could have been so fine
You better, you better
(Think)

You better think of me
I know you want to, baby
(Think, of me, baby)
You know, you're driving me crazy
Think, think
Think, think of me
(Think) You better, you better
You better think of me
Stop wasting my all time
(Think, of me, baby)
You know, it could have been so fine
(Think) Hey, boy, I'm waiting on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else?
Stop thinking of yourself, you better1Embed
