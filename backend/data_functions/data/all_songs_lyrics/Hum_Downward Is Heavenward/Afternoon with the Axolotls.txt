Afternoon with the Axolotls LyricsShe hits the plate with both hands high
Downward is heavenward and we are not alone
Condensers on and a drop is found
A fingertip trace says to me I can see you when you are wet
A bed of dead leaves grace the ground
A quick glance to the other side and we will not be found
Symbionts in haste command come close
Screams to me I can see you above the rest
And through it all she seems secure
Downward is heavenward and we are not alone
Head thrown back, a sickened sigh
Eyes shut, Beelzebub can we do this without a net?Embed
