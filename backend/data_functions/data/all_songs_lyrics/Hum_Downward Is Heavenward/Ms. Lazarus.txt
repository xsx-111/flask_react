Ms. Lazarus LyricsI come to you all dressed in sound
With bluebirds stripping wires to the ground
Connected to a time machine that will not power down
Set the crosshairs back on one
You said we'd only die here in a sun
The way your headstone shines, I only wish that it was mine
So set the crosshairs back on one
I nail the loop that brings the second run
Passed the wished-on charms
And through the lens back to your living arms
This time machine won't power down
And this time machine won't power down
And still the crosshairs rest on one
And still you rest there in the morning sun
Still I fumble through the pages of constructions on the ride
I like the blown-out sound you've found
I like the way it feels here coming down
The way your headstone shines, I only wish that it was mineEmbed
