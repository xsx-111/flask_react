Green to Me LyricsThe morning image from the satellite is all blue and green
And we've all got wounds to clean
Here's a rag, here's some gasoline
She wakes up fine and rested well, released at last from in the sleeping cell
Breathing comes with ease, it's a sweet revenge
Built on a chemical ride, my medicine man is the best
Wires to the temples, lace them on, let's see how we sound
It's all green to me
What a sweet revenge
It's all green to me
I see them lift off one by one, I see a cool spot here, let's bring her down
Level to the ground, a lovely mess, that I am blessed to see, of me, of me
She lifts her wings up high, sends her shrill of a lifetime until we die
And all the dreams, details affected in the colored sky
The morning image from the satellite is all blue and green
And we've all got wounds to clean
Here's a rag, here's some gasoline
Lift up your skies and all the other times you realize
It lifts up your days in a single phase, I felt your hand
Lift up your skies and all the other times you realize
It lifts up your days in a single phaseEmbed
