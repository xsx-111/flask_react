If You Are to Bloom LyricsI'm thinking of your wide open eyes
Smiling as they feed the nerves
That push the field of silver and the colorful lines
That only you could see like only you could do
I'm picturing a forcep in ice
That you would see if you could reach
And reconnect the engine to the delicate lens
But I just sit and wait for a blip to break the perfect little thin green line
I dreamt of jet-less high
Seeing clouds from the other side
And rolling softly until the underbelly shines
And the back skims through the steam
Feeding upturned mouths and sprinkling away
A dusty sleep you took too soon
And you need watering if you are to bloom
I'm thinking of your failing green eyes
Smiling as they greet the day
But they can't see me
And now I'm picturing us opening wide
And drinking down our days in haze and bliss
Together till it tumbles aside
But I just sit and wait for a rhythm in a perfect little thin green line
It's true so soon
And the coil speaks
I'd like to see us together
I'd like to lay my head low
I need to lean on a soft one
And bring the spin of the world to a halt
And the coil sleeps
And you've been gathering angels
And fading further each day
I love you now as I never
Remember my face as it quietly makes your way
I dreamt of jet-less high
Seeing clouds from the other side
And rolling softly until the underbelly shines
And the back skims through the steam
Feeding upturned mouths and sprinkling away
A dusty sleep you took too soon
And you need watering if you are to bloomEmbed
