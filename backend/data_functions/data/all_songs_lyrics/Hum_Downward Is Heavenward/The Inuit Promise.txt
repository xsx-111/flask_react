The Inuit Promise LyricsI took a worn out strand of your cellophane hair and stretched it sideways
And though my mind slipped through between the sea beneath
My brain stopped working from the cold
I sort of strayed from what we know
And so I'll be like you and I'll do what's right
And win a love I don't deserve out on the ice tonight
Teach me the bluest song you know
The moon ain't comin' up and I swear to God tonight it feels like snow
I'm glad we got your hands warm so my arms can feel like trust again
I can promise true waves when the summer comes
The world still fits the same form we engraved when it all began
Maybe catch a new wave, feels right, feels right
So we ride whales and drag-race time
And knock the fires from the traces of trilobite hives
You sleep like God inside her womb
And you see clearly too
The silicon wasteland they left inside my mind
I'm glad we got your hands warm so my arms can feel like trust again
I can promise true waves when the summer comes
The world still fits the same form we engraved when it all began
Maybe catch a new wave
We lost the road now
Inject the charms
And we care for all of ours
We stand in rows now
Transfer alarms
Just like the Inuit with the promise song to come down and see
Your solvents frozen here on the petal rung
Is all we have to see enlarged inside as we espy the warming sea
Your breath diffused and never realized aside from where the panicked hide
And I, just a subtle lift provider on the other sideEmbed
