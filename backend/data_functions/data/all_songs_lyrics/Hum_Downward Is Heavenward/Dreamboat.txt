Dreamboat LyricsYou swore the earth was round
And you said that there was no upside down
I hit the starship's left, let the parallax flip like you showed me in the lighthouse
I did the math and it came up 1s and 0s
I know a girl who makes me shine
My dreamboat's leaving on a submarine, she packed a second set of tanks and all I ever want and need
I know a girl who makes me whine
While my dreamboat scatters all the sub-machines, she packed a second set of tanks and all I ever want and need
And you swore the earth was sound
And you said that we could go upside the ground
But the starfish sends in a message in code that you can't see from the lighthouse
And we will dive in the afternoon
I took a simple time to wander, engaging twilight through the trees
And she needs help among the kelp-ways, and I'm not tied to these, no I'm not tied to these
I know a girl who makes me shine
My dreamboat's leaving on a submarine, she packed a second set of tanks and a solar powered lung for me
And to the girl who makes me whine
While my dreamboat scatters all the sub-machines, she packed a second set of tanks and all I ever want and need
For me, for me, for meEmbed
