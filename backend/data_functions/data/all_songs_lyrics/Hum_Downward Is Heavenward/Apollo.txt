Apollo LyricsI'm thinking of a number between everything and two
I'm thinking of a number between everything and two
She said you can find a space between my arms if you will stay, like if we ignore the systems, they'll just blink out and quickly go away
She said I'll keep all the signals that you send home to me, and I'll meet you back here on the ground
It's lift off, lift off again
She's pissed off, pissed off again
Moonlight brings me back again to stay, and I know if she had a way I'd always be through
Tethered to a glass ring she keeps beside the phone, and never ever stepping out into
Blankness and darkness, like underneath the leaf, have settled on me here and scraped away the sound
She said you can find a place inside my heart if you will stay, and I need you back here on the ground
It's lift off, lift off again
She's pissed off, pissed off again
Moonlight brings me back again to stay, and I know if she had a way I'd always be through
Tethered to a glass ring she keeps beside the phone, and never ever stepping out into
I'm thinking of a number between everything and two
And moonlight brings me back again to stay, and I know if she had a way I'd always be through
Tethered to a glass ring she keeps beside the phone, and never ever stepping out into
And moonlight brings me back again this day, and I don't feel a thing here anymore
The strings of information slowing to a stop, the tether's end is slipping from its knot, I'm stretching out in two
I'm thinking of a number between everything and two
I'm thinking of a number between everything and two, and it's molecules of youEmbed
