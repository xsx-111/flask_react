The Scientists LyricsElectrified and lit up by an outline of herself, and smiling now as only she can be
She said I made some new connections to astound them all in ways we've never dreamed about
Her lovely hand is glowing from a light inside itself, from soaking in the esters stacked for miles on a single shelf
Holding my eyes still so she can see all the super-undercover custom hybrids got to me
It's too much, you're too late
I want to see it all again
She says keep this benzene ring around your finger, and think of me when everything you wanted starts to end
And I saw living lusters form in pools beneath her feet, invertebrates that only she can see
And I said what on Earth are all these ampoules for, she says exactly, we're not gonna wait around here anymore
Systems back down slow, watch the dust cloud rescind
And I will keep you, I will keep you to the end
Set your head back low, watch my ears ring
I will take care of you, I will take care of everything
Systems back down slow, watch the dust cloud rescind
And I will keep you, I will keep you to the end
Set your head back low, watch my ears ring
I will take care of you, I will take care of everything
It's too much here, too late, too much here, too late
Piloting my head spins to the ground, and I think I see myself again through the pinhole
But the pinhole captures all of you
And the pinhole captures all of you
And the pinhole captures all of you
And the pinhole captures all of you
And the pinhole captures all of you
Too much here, too late
Too much here, too late
Too much here, too late
Too much here, too lateEmbed
