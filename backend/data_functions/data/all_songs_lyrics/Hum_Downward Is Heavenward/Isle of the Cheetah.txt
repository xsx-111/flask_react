Isle of the Cheetah LyricsChance brought me down on your side, she's just along for the ride
Wings melt and we hide, and all this means nothing to the sun
Are we leaving this one?
Mind comes true here, bruised, and expanding clear
Mind full of you here, I won't claim losses in the sun
Are we leaving this one?
And swift out, she goes to the last frame
Short lives and long days and if I stay, then we'll lay way to you
Your ocean spreads out on sunbeams, radiant, knowing
And your hand looks so nice in mine
And it's been a thousand years seen since inception, and you're radiant, glowing
And they say that you're doing fine
Your ocean spreads out on sunbeams, radiant, knowing
Your hand looks so nice in mine
And the new construct will have both of us, stapled to the island for awhile
And they say that we're doing fineEmbed
