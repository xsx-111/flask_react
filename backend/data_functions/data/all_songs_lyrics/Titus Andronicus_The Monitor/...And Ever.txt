...And Ever LyricsThe enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere
Oh I'm worthless and weak, and I'm sick and I'm scared
And the enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere
The enemy is everywhere
Oh I'm worthless and weak. Oh I'm sick and I'm scared
And the enemy is everywhere

"I am loathe to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break the bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory stretching from battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched, for surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."Embed
