Four Score and Seven LyricsThis is a war we can't win
After 10,000 years, it's still us against them
And my heroes have always died at the end
So who's going to account for these sins?
And I don't know who here is my friend
Well, I'm certain that I've seen uglier men
Christ, fuck me if I can remember when
Will I never be lonely again?
Well the tides are a-turnin' once more
Six dark-winged devils line up at my door
Each one is more evil than that which came before
Seven angels find me spread across the floor
You'd like everyone to believe you're a star
And I'll admit that it's worked out pretty well so far
But when they see the kind of person that you really are
Then you won't be laughing so hard
No, you won't be laughing so hard!
You won't be laughing so hard
(Pt. II)
"We're all depraved and disgusting" I spew like a fountain
"And debased, defaced, disgraced and destroyed
"Most of all disappointed" I say atop this mountain
As I urinate into the void
Fuck I'm frustrated, freaking out something fierce
Would you help me, I'm hungry, I suffer and I starve
Oh I struggle and I stammer 'till I'm up to my ears
In miserable quote unquote art
About how ever since our forefathers came on this land
We've been coddling those we should be running through
Please don't wait around for them to come and shake hands
They're not gonna be waiting for you
Cause these humans treat humans like humans treat hogs
They get used up, coughed up, and fried in a pan
But I wasn't born to die like a dog
I was born to die just like a man
I was born to die just like a man!
It's still us against them
And they're winningEmbed
