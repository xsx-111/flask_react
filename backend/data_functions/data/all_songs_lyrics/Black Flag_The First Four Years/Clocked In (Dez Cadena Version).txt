Clocked In (Dez Cadena Version) LyricsI'M TIED TO A CLOCK
AND I CAN'T GET LOOSE
I DID THIS TO MYSELF
PUTS MY BRAIN RIGHT IN A NOOSE
THAT'S RIGHT
BUZZER SOUNDS, GOTTA MOVE
FEET MOVE, LEGS MOVE, BRAIN MOVES
REAL SLOW
I'VE GOTTA BE ON TIME
JUST TO COLLECT MY REWARD
I'VE GOTTA STAND IN LINE
MAKES ME FEEL SO FUCKING BORED
THAT'S RIGHT
BUZZER SOUNDS, GOTTA MOVE
FEET MOVE, LEGS MOVE, BRAIN MOVES
REAL SLOW
BOSS BARKS ORDERS AT ME
BUT I CAN'T YELL BACK
NO MATTER HOW I TRY
CAN'T GET THAT FUCKER OFF MY BACK
BUZZER SOUNDS, GOTTA MOVE
FEET MOVE, LEGS MOVE, BRAIN MOVES
REAL SLOW
ALWAYS WAKES ME UP IN THE MORNING
NO NO
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS SHIT EVERYDAY
I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE
I'VE GOTTA WORK
KNOCK THAT FUCKER OFF THE WALL
THAT'S RIGHT
GO HOME
BUZZER SOUNDS, GOTTA MOVE
FEET MOVE, LEGS MOVE, BRAIN MOVES
REAL SLOWEmbed
