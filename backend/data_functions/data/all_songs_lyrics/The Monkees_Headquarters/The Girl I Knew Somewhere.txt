The Girl I Knew Somewhere LyricsYou tell me that you've never been this way before
You tell me things I know that I've heard somewhere
You're standing in the places and you're
Staring down through faces, that bring to mind traces
Of a girl, a girl that I knew somewhere
I just can't put my finger on what it is
That says to me "Watch out! Don't believe her."
I can't give any reasons girl
My thoughts are bound down in a whirl
I just can't think who in the world was that girl;
I know I met her somewhere
Someway, somehow this same thing was done
Someone, somewhere did me this same wrong
Well, goodbye dear, I just can't take this chance again
My fingers are still burning from the last time
And if your love was not a game, I only have myself to blame
That's as may be, I can't explain
Just ask the girl that I knew somewhereEmbed
