Mr. Webster LyricsEv'ryone in town knew Mr. Webster
He worked at the bank for forty years
And each week Mr. Frisby made his check out
For sixty-eight dollars clear
And thru the years he thwarted twenty-seven robberies
And each time Frisby promised him a raise
They gave a retirement party for Mr. Webster
Everyone from the bank was there
They had a cake and flowers ordered special
And Frisby had a speech prepared
And a little white box that held a watch with this inscription
"To Mr. Webster, with regards."
Then came the telegram from Mr. Webster
Said, "Sorry... stop... Cannot attend..
I've flown away and taken all your money
Wish you were here to help me spend."
And one by one all the people left the party
And Mr. Frisby locked the doorEmbed
