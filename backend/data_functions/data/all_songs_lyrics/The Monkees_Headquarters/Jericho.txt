Jericho Lyrics???: Make sure you don't blow your cheeks off
(someone plays a trumpet)
???: (laughs) Make sure you don't blow your brains out your ears
Peter?: Yeah, you blow the wind right out your ears if you don't...
(trumpet)
???: (laughs) Look at that pose!
(trumpet)
???: You look like a member of the charmed club in high school
???: Jericho's wall...
Micky: That's what he did, man, you hear about Jericho's wall? He opened up a B-flat valve and blew the seam. The horn didn't knock no wall down, no, it was the seam that blew open, man!
(Peter laughing)
Micky: You never heard about Jericho either, didja? Blew his head off man, and the wall, the whole thing
???: RRRRAAAARAAAA!
Micky: He wasn't...
???: (deep voice) Walls came tumbling down...
Micky: He didn't wanna knock those walls down, man. No, he didn't wanna knock those walls off, man. He was just doing a peace march around the outside of the city, man. It was just your Sunday peace march...
???: (deep voice) La la la la la la... La la la la la la... La la la la la la...
Micky: He wasn't blowin' a little tune, doobie doobie doobie, when all of a sudden, this asshole came up blows off the valve and the seam blew the wall down, they wrote a song about it, ever heard it?
Peter: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Peter and Micky: Jericho, Jericho
Micky: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
Peter and Micky: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho, Jericho
Joshua fit the battle...
???: He's recording, man
???: I think I've lost control
Peter and Micky: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho, Jericho
???: I think I've lost control of the Monkees
Peter and Micky: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
Micky: Hey, hey, hey
Peter and Micky: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho, Jericho
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
Peter: You can talk about your men of Gideon
You can talk about your men of Saul
But there's none like good old Joshua
At the battle of Jericho
Micky: Well, Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho, Jericho
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
Peter: Whoa, Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Ah, Jericho, Jericho
Peter and Micky: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down...Embed
