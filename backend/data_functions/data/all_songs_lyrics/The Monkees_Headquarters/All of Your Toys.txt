All of Your Toys LyricsOne, two...
Once upon a once in a while
It's hard to remember to smile
Just like all of your toys
Can't you see I don't wanna play
I don't need it
Can't you say you want me to stay
I'll believe it
Just like all of your toys
(Oh) When all of your playthings
(Oh) Someday disappear
(Oh) Girl, will you be happy
(Oh) With nothing but tears?
With nothing but tears?
Once upon a once in a while
It's hard to remember to smile
Just like all of your toys
Don't you ever feel kind of sad?
'Cause you're lonely
Think about the love that we had
Are you lonely?
Just like all of your toys
(Oh) When all of your playthings
(Oh) Someday disappear
(Oh) Girl, will you be happy
(Oh) With nothing but tears?
With nothing but tears?
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Just like all of your toys
I don't wanna be
Just like all of your toys
I don't need to be
Just like all of your, just like all of your toys
(Just like all of your toys)
I should have known I'd be alone
(Just like all of your toys)
No, no, no I don't need it
(Just like all of your toys)
Oh, don't you have me believe it
(Just like all of your toys)
I don't wanna be alone
(Just like all of your toys)
I should have known
(Just like all of your toys)
Wouldn't you be happyEmbed
