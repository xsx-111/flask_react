Jackhammer Blues LyricsI'm a jack hammer man from the jack hammer town
Born with a jack hammer in my hand
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
Jack hammer man from a jack hammer town
I hammer on the hammer till the sun goes down
Oh, Lord, got them jack hammer blues
Hammered on the Bonneville, hammered on the Butte
Columbia river on a ten mile chute
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
Hammered in the port of Portland Town
I built ev'ry port from Alaska down
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
Gonna hammer on the hammer until I get done
Sixty-six and a Highway One
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
And a jack hammer woman just sweet as pie
Hammer on the hammer till the day I die
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
Jack hammer man from a jack hammer town
Born with a jack hammer in my hand
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
Jack hammer woman just sweet as pie
Hammer on the hammer till the day I die
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
Well I hammered on the hammer all night long
I hammered for my baby from a-midnight on
Lord, God, I got them jack hammer blues
Jack hammer man sweet as pie
'N' I hammer on the hammer till the day I die
Lord, God, I got them them jack hammer bluesEmbed
