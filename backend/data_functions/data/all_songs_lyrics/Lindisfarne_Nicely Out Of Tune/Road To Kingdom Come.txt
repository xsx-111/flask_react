Road To Kingdom Come LyricsI have no one to call my friend
The road I travel has no end
And so I turn my face up to the sun
And walk on down the road to kingdom come
And as I walk this lonely road
Nobody helps me bear my load
Can somebody tell me what it is I've done
Condemned to walk the road to kingdom come
And if you pass me on the side
Why don't you stop and let me ride
You just had a better deal my son
Walking down the road to kingdom come
And if you pass this way someday
And you should find I've gone my way
There'll always be some poor boy on the bum
Walking down the road to kingdom come
Walking down the road to kingdom comeEmbed
