Clear White Light - Part 2 LyricsDo you believe
The clear white light
Is going to guide us on?
Running along the ground singing a song in the morning light
Follow flowery fields as far as out of sight
Turning your head to the clouds and the sky and the trees
'cause you never know what you might see
Do you believe
The clear white light
Is going to guide us on
The way?
Seeing the sun as it wants to be seen by ev'ryone
Melting the sky throw a hole in your eye where the magic comes
Turning your heads to the skies with the clouds in your eyes
'cause you never know what you might find
Do you believe
The clear white light
Is going to guide us on
The way?
Now is the time to be loving and kind to your fellow men
Seeing the sympathy starting out all over again
Now is the time to give love just one more go
'cause you never know what you might know
And I believe
The clear white light
Is going to guide us on
Yes I believe
The clear white light
Is going to guide us onEmbed
