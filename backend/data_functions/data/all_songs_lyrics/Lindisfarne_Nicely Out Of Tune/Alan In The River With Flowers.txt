Alan In The River With Flowers LyricsHere I sit with time running out on me
Knowing while it's dreams that are upon me
There's grace of a kind
That eases my mind
Some time
Float me down the river
Show me what it's like to be there
Float me down the river
Tell me stories dreams and nightmares
Here I sit the garden surrounds me
Flowers in hand it's dreams that are upon me
And I don't deny
That time passes by
Sometimes
Float me down the river
Show me what it's like to be there
Float me down the river
Tell me stories dreams and nightmares
Float me down the river
Show me what it's like to be there
Float me down the river
Tell me stories dreams and nightmaresEmbed
