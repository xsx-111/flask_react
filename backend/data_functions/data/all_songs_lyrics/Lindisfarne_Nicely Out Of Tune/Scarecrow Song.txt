Scarecrow Song LyricsThe songs you sing are meaningless
The words you say are wrong
Your Saturday nights they are sober
And your Sundays are too long
Your lucky days are over
Your lucky days are gone
You've cast away your coloured coat
The illusions seemed too strong
Now in the wintery season
You can hear the Scarecrow Song
Your lucky days are over
Your lucky days are gone
The bells have all stopped their ringing
The music sounded wrong
And now the only song, worth singing
Is the sad old Scarecrow Song
Your lucky days are over
Your lucky days are goneEmbed
