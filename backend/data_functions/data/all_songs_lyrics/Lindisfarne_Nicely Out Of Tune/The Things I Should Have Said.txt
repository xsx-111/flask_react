The Things I Should Have Said LyricsTwo by two the lovers wandered off into the night
Leaving me alone with someone that I only knew by sight
So we sat and watched each other through the fading firelight
Each one waiting for the silence to be broken
But the things I should have said
That were whispering in my head
Would not be spoken
The black-eyed master glared at me with malice in his eye
The spittle from his twisted lips ran down to his bow-tie
I was dumb before his accusations I dared not deny
When he done with me I stood outside there shattered
And the things I should have said
That came rushing to my head
No longer mattered
Teachers from whose mellowed mouths great pearls of wisdom crawl
To those who scrawl obscenities upon the alley walls
The joke is on the bloke who never spoke a word at all
But whose dreams lay unrevealed 'til they were rotten
And the things I should have said
That I was keeping in my head
Have been forgotten
The things I should have said (repeat to fade)Embed
