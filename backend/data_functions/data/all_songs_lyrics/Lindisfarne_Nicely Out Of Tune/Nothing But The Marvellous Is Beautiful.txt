Nothing But The Marvellous Is Beautiful LyricsNah, nah
Nah, nanna, nanna, nah
Na, nanna, nanna, nun, nah
Sitting on a fence in the middle of the afternoon
Trying to get silly, but it's not working out too well (too well)
Well, well, I just can't tell
If I should go (go), if I should stay (stay)
So I'll just close my eyes and drift away
When you're feeling pretty low and you just don't know
And in which direction you're going
If you shut your eyes and you don't really try
Then you know without really knowing
That's what I heard though it sounds absurd
To a thinking man like you
Well I've got no head for big plans
Instead I think that's what I'll do
Nah, nah
Nah, nanna, nanna, nah
Na, nanna, nanna, nun, nah
Walking down the street trying to keep my feet from misery
Not looking at the people 'cause they're not looking back at me (at me)
Maybe they just can't see
Or think or even feel, maybe they're even unreal (real)
So what can I do now the way I feel?
When you're feeling pretty low and you just don't know
And in which direction you're going
If you shut your eyes and you don't really try
Then you know without really knowing
That's what I heard though it sounds absurd
To a thinking man like you
Well I've got no head for big plans
Instead I think that's what I'll do
Nah, nah
Nah, nanna, nanna, nah
Na, nanna, nanna, nun, nahEmbed
