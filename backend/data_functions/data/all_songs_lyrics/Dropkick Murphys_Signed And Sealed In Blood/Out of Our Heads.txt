Out of Our Heads Lyrics
Are we gonna make it, or is this how we go? (GO!)
Are we gonna take it sitting down? (Hell No!)
We're gonna cause a riot, we're gonna rip it up
We're gonna storm the gates, this place is going' up

Here we go, here we go
We're out of our heads, and it's starting to show
Here we go, here we go
The roof is on fire and it's ready to blow

Are we gonna make it, are we gonna let em know? (Know!)
Are we gonna let em bring us down? (Hell No!)
We're gonna crash party every night and everyday (Hey!)
We got em on the run, we are full either way

Here we go, here we go
We're out of our heads, and it's starting to show
Here we go, here we go
The roof is on fire and it's ready to blow
Here we go, here we go
We're out of our minds, and we're letting ya know
Here we go, here we go
The roof is on fire and it's ready to blow
The roof is on fire and it's ready to blow
