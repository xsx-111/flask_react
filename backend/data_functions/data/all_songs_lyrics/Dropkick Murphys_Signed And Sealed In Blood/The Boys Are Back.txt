The Boys Are Back Lyrics
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble

Speeding down the highway, on ninety-three
I'm missing my home, and it’s killing me
Down the ramp passed the jail, I'm feeling alright
Bought roses for my ladies from a bum at the light
It’s time to get ready for that song and dance
Let’s go my friends, it’s time to take a chance
We’re back in town, we’re gonna get it done
We got nowhere to hide, we got nowhere to run
It’s been a long time coming
It’s been a long time coming

The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble

If that old familiar city could talk in here
You’d be just another nobody, you’ll disappear
Your days are numbered, we’re back around
We’re coming for you and you’re going down

It’s been a long time coming
It’s been a long time coming

The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
It’s been a long time coming
It’s been a long time coming

The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for trouble
The boys are back
The boys are back
The boys are back
And they’re looking for troubleEmbed
