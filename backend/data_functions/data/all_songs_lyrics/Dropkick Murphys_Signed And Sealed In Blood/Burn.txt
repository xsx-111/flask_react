Burn Lyrics
Bring around the fire, set me up and let me go
I ain't going down until I've had my fill
The chase is nearly ended, the party starts tonight
They said we'd never learn, we never will

So dance around the fire and kiss the finest girls
I'll see you all in hell, 'cause tonight there's no return
Make way for the mayhem, say goodbye to sorrow
I'll see you all in hell, 'cause we're going out tomorrow
Oh, we're gonna burn
Oh, we're gonna burn

The money's all but gone and I got nowhere to go
Keep the change ya filthy animal, 'cause I don't wanna know
I don't care about your stories, I don't want to hear your lies
I see there is no future when I look into your eyes


There's a fire in the sky and your face is aglow
We got a few more hours on the radio
It's all that we got, but it ain't what we owe
We're gonna dig up the skeletons and let them go
Cash me out and count me in, it's our time we're gonna win
If you don't, well you can pay the bill
Demons all be damned, catch the sight, enjoy the ride
They said we'd never learn, we never will
