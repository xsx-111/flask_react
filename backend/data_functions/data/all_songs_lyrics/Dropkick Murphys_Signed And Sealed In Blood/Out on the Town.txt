Out on the Town Lyrics
Me and the gang, we were out on the town
In my uninsured '88
It's time to get Maggie down at the bar
She said "Don't you punks dare be late"
It was Saturday night on Hiltop Street
And everybody's dressed to spill
They were having a time for Mary O's boy
Barry, who had recently been killed
In the back of the bar
They were sure having fun
Everybody make some room
She got out of the chair
Threw her fist in the air
And the whole place started to move

So get up, get up, get with the music
Everybody out of your seat
So get up, get up and get with the music
Maggie's got a brand new beat

Tiny was Santa. Red's at the door
And the old brigade's starting to play
Maggie's playing tricks on a few of the boys
She'll take your worries
And your wallet away
Johnny Mac took a slap
From a few older brothers
When her wouldn't dance with Big Marie
But it wouldn't be long
'til they were singing along
With the girl they all came to see
So get up, get up, get with the music
Everybody out of your seat
So get up, get up and get with the music
Maggie's got a brand new beat
So get up, get up, get with the music
Everybody out of your seat
So get up, get up and get with the music
Maggie's got a brand new beat

She was handsome, she was mean
She smoked two packs a days
Since she was 17
A leather face and many a vice
She had a sharper tongue
Than a butcher's knife
She's out past curfew
With the boys in the band
Throwing one last farewell toast
Then she's up with father Dorin
At mass in the morning
Handing out the holy ghost

So get up, get up, get with the music
Everybody out of your seat
So get up, get up and get with the music
Maggie's got a brand new beat
So get up, get up, get with the music
Everybody out of your seat
So get up, get up and get with the music
Maggie's got a brand new beat
Maggie's got a brand new beatEmbed
