Shark Attack Lyrics
Lurking deep below
Racing toward the surface
Fifteen hundred pounds of fury
Power, might and purpose
Animal aggression coming after you and me
Blood in the water
At Tenean Beach

Fear is in the air now
The foolish turn their backs
Who'll be next to feel the wrath
When the predator attacks
Below the water's surface
Soon, ready to explode
If we're gonna beat the beast
We're gonna need a bigger boat

Stay out of the ocean
Learn to fear the sea
Be content to rule the land
It's quite alright with me
Stay out of the ocean
Learn to fear the sea
Be content to rule the land
It's quite alright with me
The predator attacks
The predator attacks

Fear is in the air now
The foolish turn their backs
Who'll be next to feel the wrath
When the predator attacks
Below the water's surface
Soon, ready to explode
If we're gonna beat the beast
We're gonna need a bigger boat

Stay out of the ocean
Learn to fear the sea
Be content to rule the land
It's quite alright with me
Stay out of the ocean
Learn to fear the sea
Be content to rule the land
It's quite alright with me

The predator attacks
The predator attacks
Lurking deep below
Racing toward the surface
Fifteen hundred pounds of fury
Power, might and purpose
Fear is in the air now
The foolish turn their backs
Who'll be next to feel the wrath
When the predator attacks

Stay out of the ocean
Learn to fear the sea
Be content to rule the land
It's quite alright with me
Stay out of the ocean
Learn to fear the sea
Be content to rule the land
It's quite alright with me

The predator attacks
