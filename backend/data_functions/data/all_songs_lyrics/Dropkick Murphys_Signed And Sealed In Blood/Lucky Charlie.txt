Lucky Charlie LyricsHey lucky Charlie, why do you get the breaks?
All the women love you and you never make mistakes
Hey lucky bastard tell us you you do it
We all wish we were you, but ain't got what it takes
You never go hungry
You seem to eat your luck
You never want to drink (?)
So I always let you up
Heavy is the head that has to wear the crown
To you ever get tired of your world renown
Hey lucky Charlie, why do you get the breaks?
All the women love you and you never make mistakes
Hey lucky bastard tell us you you do it
We all wish we were you, but ain't got what it takes
Hey lucky Charlie
Hey lucky Charlie
When you were a kid
You played in trafic every day
Now you cross the street
And you never look each way
When you're in a tussle
You never get a scratch
What's gonna happen
When you meat your match
Hey lucky Charlie, why do you get the breaks?
All the women love you and you never make mistakes
Hey lucky bastard tell us you you do it
We all wish we were you, but ain't got what it takes
He tried to rob a bank
They gave him all the dough
He ran into the cops
Had a couple and a smoke
He's got a horseshoe up his ass
And silver in his mouth
What's he gonna do
When his luck runs out
Hey lucky Charlie, why do you get the breaks?
All the women love you and you never make mistakes
Hey lucky bastard tell us you you do it
We all wish we were you, but ain't got what it takes
Hey lucky Charlie, why do you get the breaks?
All the women love you and you never make mistakes
Hey lucky bastard tell us you you do it
We all wish we were you, but ain't got what it takes
Hey lucky Charlie
Hey lucky Charlie
Hey lucky Charlie, why do you get the breaks? (Hey lucky Charlie)
All the women love you and you never make mistakes
Hey lucky bastard tell us you you do it. (Hey lucky Charlie)
We all wish we were you, but ain't got what it takesEmbed
