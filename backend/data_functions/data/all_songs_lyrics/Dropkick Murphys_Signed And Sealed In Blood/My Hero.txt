My Hero Lyrics
May the road to rise to meet you and the wind be at your back
And that's what dear old Dad would say
Remember, you're a man when you finally have your moment
See fate and fortune come your way
I wouldn't take you wisdom, Dad, thank you for your time
You said, some keep on working 'til the stars, one day, align
But maybe luck'll see them shine on stubborn fools like me and you
Make the most of what they give ya, to yourself you must be true
To yourself you must be true

And we'll live
To fight another day
If things don't always go our way
And we'll live
To fight another day
That's what my old man would say

May the spirits all be with you, when the devil turns his back
When the day is at its darkest, an anxiety attack
Call on me to see you through it, call on me to be your guide
I'll be there, so when you need me i'll be standing by your side
I'll be standing by your side
And we'll live
To fight another day
If things don't always go our way
And we'll live
To fight another day
That's what my old man would say

My hero, My heart
My hero, My heart
My hero, My heart
My hero, My heart
To yourself you must be true
To yourself you must be true

And we'll live
To fight another day
If things don't always go our way
And we'll live
To fight another day
That's what my old man would say

My hero
