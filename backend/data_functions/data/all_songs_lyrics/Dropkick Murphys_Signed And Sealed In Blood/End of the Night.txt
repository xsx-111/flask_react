End of the Night Lyrics
The amber, the fire is starting to fade, but it's now that I'm at my best
Give the angel on my shoulder a break for the night, 'cause the devil ain't getting no rest
I got thousands of stories, you've heard them before, yet I'll tell them again and again
Come on, pull up a stool now and buy me a drink, and please think of me as a friend

We live for the weekend, each city's the same
There's a bar on the corner where they don't know your name
There's plenty of drink, they've been saving' your chair
It's our second home, we ain't goin' nowhere

It's the end, end of the night
But we ain't goin' home
It's the end, end of the night
But we ain't goin' home
It's the end, end of the night
But we ain't, goin' home

This life it ain't easy, still we manage to win
There's times to be knocked down, yeah we live with our chin
We are generous guys with our hearts on the sleeves
Misunderstood though, the boss disagrees
We can't catch a break, wrote the book on bad luck
We'd hold down a job if they didn't all suck

The bartender's spoken and he's made it clear
If you ain't goin' home, then you ain't stayin' here
You can't shut us off and you won't turn us down
There's plenty of joints who'll be grateful to have us around


Well you've been beaten me black and you've beaten me blue
The scars are well worn on my face
I've packed up the bags and I've sulked off in shame
For one last walk of these streets
