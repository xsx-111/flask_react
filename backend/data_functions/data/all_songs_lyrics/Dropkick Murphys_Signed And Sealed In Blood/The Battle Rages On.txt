The Battle Rages On Lyrics
His fists was raised fury
The signal came at dawn
An army at the ready
Their vengeance will be strong

The kingdom, will always make its worth
The martyr, will soon fall on his sword
The freedom, the battle rages on
The righteous, will be here when you're gone

Their voices clash with courage
Their two worlds did collide
It echoes through the ages
They bravely gave their lives

The kingdom, will always make its worth
The martyr, will soon fall on his sword
The freedom, the battle rages on
The righteous, will be here when you're gone

Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
The battle rages on
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Ohh
Will be here when you're gone
His fists was raised fury
The signal came at dawn
An army at the ready
Their vengeance will be strong
The kingdom, will always make its worth
The martyr, will soon fall on his sword
The freedom, the battle rages on
The righteous, will be here when you're gone
The kingdom, will always make its worth
The martyr, will soon fall on his sword
The freedom, the battle rages on
The righteous, will be here when you're goneEmbed
