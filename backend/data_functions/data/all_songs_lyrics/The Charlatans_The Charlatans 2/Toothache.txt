Toothache LyricsI bet'cha them bullets can surely blow
Me back to hell all down we go
Lick your belly and I make you smile
I hear ya, I'm achin' I'm milking the miles
Honey I don't mind, you're trickin' me right?
I'm a tramp and I love you
Hold me down
Hold me down
Mesmerisin' me
All the world can see
I can sing oh eah
I'm drivin' in the backseat of your love
Shooting stars can make you see
You're living on love I can feel it's real
Lick your belly and I make a smile
I hear ya, I'm achin' I'm milkin' the miles
No milk don't melt in the back of my mouth
I'm a tramp and I love you
Hold me down
Hold me down
No milk in the back of my mouth
No milk in the back of my mouth
No milk in the back of my mouth
Mesmerisin' me
All the world can see
I can sing oh eah
Don't need no bore-a-tellin' me
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
I'm drivin' in the back seat of your love
Mesmerisin' me
All the world can see
I can sing oh eah
Don't need no bore-a-tellin' me
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
I'm drivin' in the back seat of your loveEmbed
