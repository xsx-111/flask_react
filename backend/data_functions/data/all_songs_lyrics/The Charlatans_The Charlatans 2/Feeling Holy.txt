Feeling Holy LyricsDown, deep
I know where I wanna be
Long promised road
And an island made out of me
One drop can make you feel how I feel love
Love can make a mighty meal on the hill
One drop gets you feeling holy, hello below me
One drop gets you up, up and away
Bad skins in bombers
Blue, white and green
Chaps take a look at my hands
Ain't no fruit of what it can mean
One sweet buzz can make you feel how I feel
One sweet love can make a mountain slide up the hill
One drop gets you feeling holy, hello below me
One drop gets you up, up and away
Shake it down
One drop, gets you feeling holy, hello below me
One drop gets you up, up and away
Feeling holy, hello below me
Fucking feeling holy
Feeling holy, hello below meEmbed
