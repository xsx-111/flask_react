Listen to the Music Lyrics{Intro}

Don't you feel it growing, day by day
People getting ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad
Woah, gotta let the music play
What the people need is a way to make them smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message, get it on through
Oh now mamma don't you ask me why

Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time
{Bridge}

Well I know you know better
Everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy and we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feeling good to you
And you're feeling good to me
There ain't nothing we can't do or say
Feeling good, feeling fine
Oh, baby, let the music play

Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time

Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly

Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
Oh, oh, oh listen to the music
All the time5Embed
