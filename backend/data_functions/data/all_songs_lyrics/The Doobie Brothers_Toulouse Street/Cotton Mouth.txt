Cotton Mouth Lyrics
Red-eyed momma keep cryin'
Blue-eyed cat keeps a lyin'
Catfish keep his eye on the string
And that cottonmouth keep on windin'

Sing, sing, sing

Dark moon keeps hidin'
And 'gator, he keeps right on slidin'
And bull frog, he ain't mindin'
Oh, cottonmouth keep on windin'

Sing, sing, sing
Oh, we gotta keep on movin' on, yeah

Lightnin' bugs in bottles
They gimme all the light I need
And I'm seinin' bait for linin'
And that cottonmouth keeps on windin'

Sing, sing, sing
Oh, that big iron pot's a boilin'
And that red-eyed momma keeps toilin'
And the crawdad meat's for dinin'
And oh, that cottonmouth keeps on windin', Lord, yeah

Sing, sing, singEmbed
