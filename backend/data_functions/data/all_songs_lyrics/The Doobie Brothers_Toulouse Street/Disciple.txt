Disciple Lyrics
Night time, I jumped back in the alley
Saw a shadow closin' in
And blue smoke all around the figure
A knife blade is flashing grim
I made my move to get away
Seems like nowhere to run
All of a sudden I was blinded by a flash
A devil of a man with a gun
Whoo! Man, I didn't believe it!
Now, let me out of here!

Lightnin', it crackled all around me
Storm clouds are movin' in
The blue smoke cleared so fast around me
The strange hunter's gone again
I looked up to see what had happened
There he stood in front of me
He had a silver cape and eyes of red
With a button down limousine
Man, I gotta make my getaway!

Lightnin' crackled all around me
Storm clouds are movin' in
The blue smoke cleared so fast around me
The strange hunter's gone again
I looked up to see what had happened
There he stood in front of me
Silver cape and his eyes red
And a button down limousineEmbed
