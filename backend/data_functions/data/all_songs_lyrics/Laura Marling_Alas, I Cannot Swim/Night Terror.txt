Night Terror Lyrics
I woke up and he was screaming
I'd left him dreaming
I'll roll over and shake him tightly
And whisper, "If they want you, oh, they're gonna have to fight me
Oh, fight me"

I woke up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green
Oh, a candle at my chest, and a head on his knee
I got up; it was dark; there's no one in the park at this hour
How do I keep finding myself here?
"Oh, fight me"

If I look back and he is screaming
I'd left him dreaming; a dangerous feat
And I'll run back and shake him tightly
And scream, "If they want him, oh, they're gonna have to fight me
Oh, fight me"

But if I wake up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green
Oh, a candle at my chest, and a head on his knee
I'll roll over and hold him tightly
And scream, "If you want him, oh, you're gonna have to fight me
Oh, fight me, oh, fight me"Embed
