Tap at My Window Lyrics
He taps at my window
Willing that I'll let him in
I don't think I will though
My heart's taken, I won't tell him again

Maybe I'll write him a story and maybe I'll fall asleep in his arms
Maybe I'll wake up lonely and fallen away again
Until you calm me down
I'll race around this town
Trying to find, oh, an emotion you cannot deny
I will not have him treat me this way

And Mother I blame you with every inch of the being you gave
For I have become you and I know every part of your game
And Father I love you, but how can you watch as I push her away
I cannot forgive you for bringing me up this way

Maybe I'll write them a story and maybe I'll fall asleep in his arms
Maybe I'll wake up lonely and fallen away again
Until you calm me down
I'll race around this town
Until you calm me down
I'll race around this town
Trying to find, oh, an emotion you cannot deny
I will not have him treat me this way
So tap at my window
Maybe I might let you in
I don't think I will though
My heart's taken I won't tell you againEmbed
