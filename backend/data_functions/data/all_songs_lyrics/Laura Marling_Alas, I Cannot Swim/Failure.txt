Failure Lyrics
He used to be a singer in a rock and roll band
He would write the songs and I'd tremble at his hand
But oh, la la
He lost poetic ethic
And his songs were pathetic
And he's a failure now

He used to be the life and soul of everyone around
You'd never catch him looking up
And never see him down
But oh, la la
He couldn't raise a smile
No, not for a while
And he's a failure now

Don't cry, child
You've got so much more to live for
Don't cry, child
You've got something I would die for
And if it comes to the rain
Just be glad you'll smile again
Because so many don't
And so many go unnamed
People push right past me shouting their disclaims
A preacher pushes me aside and asks to wash my sins
I said no, la la
If he made me in his image then he's a failure too

I used to need a couple people keep my head down
Now I need a whole lot more to keep me on the ground
But oh, la la
I gave up something and I gave it up for nothing
And I'm a failure now

Don't cry, child
You've got so much more to live for
Don't cry, child
You've got something I would die for
And if it comes to the rain
Just be glad you'll smile again
Because so many don't
And so many go unnamedEmbed
