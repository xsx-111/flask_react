Ghosts Lyrics
He walked down a busy street staring solely at his feet
Clutching pictures of past lovers at his side
Stood at the table where she sat
And removed his hat, in respect of her presence
Presents her with the pictures and says:
"These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you
These are just ghosts that broke my heart before I met you"

Opened up his little heart, unlocked the lock that kept it dark
And read a written warning saying, "I'm still mourning
Over ghosts, over ghosts, over ghosts
Over ghosts that broke my heart before I met you"

Lover please do not fall to your knees
It's not like I believe in
Everlasting love

So he went crazy at 19, so he lost all his self-esteem
And couldn't understand why he was cry, cry, crying, crying
He would stare at empty chairs
Think of the ghosts that once sat there
The ghost that broke his heart, all the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghost that broke his heart, all the ghosts that broke my heart
The ghost, the ghost, the ghost, the ghost, the ghost, the ghost
The ghost that broke my heart before I met you
Lover please do not fall to your knees
It's not like I believe in
Everlasting love

He says: "I'm so lost, not at all well"
Ooh, ooh
He was done and there was nothing left to be
Well, it turned out I'd been following him and he'd been following me
It was done after it was over
We were just two lovers crying on each other's shoulder

And I said, "Lover, please do not fall to your knees
It's not like I believe in
Everlasting love
Lover please do not fall to your knees
It's not like I believe in
Everlasting love"Embed
