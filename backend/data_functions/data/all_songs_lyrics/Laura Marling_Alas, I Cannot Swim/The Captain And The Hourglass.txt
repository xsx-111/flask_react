The Captain And The Hourglass Lyrics
You kicked the blow
Now you've got to kick the guy
You sat alone
Under bellowing sky
If I feel God judging me
I fell into the water, and now I'm free

My friends they don't really get me
Think I'm the only one
Well I sold my soul to Jesus
And since then I've had no fun
Behind every tree is a cutting machine
And a kite fallen from grace
Inside every man is a heart of sand
You can see it in his face

And he'll tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick away
Another second lost with every fallen grain
And he'll tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick away
Another second lost with every fallen grain

The wind and I we speak the same
But he don't hear so well
If you gonna have to curse him
Well you're gonna have to yell
And the sky and I, we've had our fights
But I'm coming round to rain
If the rain come out and I don't go out
I don't ever have to speak again
I can tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick away
Another second lost with every fallen grain
I can tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick away
Another second lost with every fallen grain

The captain's got his boots on and he's heading out the door
Leaving his lady alone thinking "He don't love me no more"
He's done with all this bullshit, he's going back to war
If heaven is as heaven does then this is hell for sure

And he'll tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick away
Another second lost with every fallen grain
And he'll tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick away
Another second lost with every fallen grain

You kicked the blow
Now you've got to kick the guy
You sat alone
Under bellowing sky
If I feel God judging me
I fell into the water, and now I'm free1Embed
