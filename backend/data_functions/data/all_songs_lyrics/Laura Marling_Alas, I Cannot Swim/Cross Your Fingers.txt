Cross Your Fingers Lyrics
Look down on the barley that you have grown
Four mountains stand around you, they're not your own
And light squares and bodies are all you see
Since you broke down
Since I broke down
Since we broke down

Oh, I jump into your grave and die
And on my word, you'll give up your whole life
For me, and you'll be reborn bigger and stronger and less alive
I, I, I, I

Cross your fingers, hold your toes
We're all gonna die when the building blows
Cross your fingers, hold your toes
We're all gonna die when the building blows
And the house that you were born in is crumbling at the corner
Sagging skin and feet of crows, feet of crows

Oh, I jump into your grave and die
And on my word, you'll give up your whole life
For me, and you'll be reborn bigger and stronger and less alive
I, I, I, I
Oh, oh, (oh)
Oh, oh, (oh)
Oh, oh, (oh)
