Shine Lyrics
I have traveled past your window many times
I find your face too hard to define
I can't touch you hollow thing
You plagued my mind
I can never go outside
I will never go back to being blind

I have wondered what you're doing every day since last I asked
Your cheeks hollow I don't like your eyes dark
I need shine, I need shine, I need shine
Step away from my light I need shine

I am honest now, not a shouter
I am reformed, reborn, and forgiven
And you've been busy but you've missed me
And I plagued your mind
You will never go outside
You will never go back to being blind

I need shine, I need shine, I need shine
Step away from my light I need shine
I need shine, I need shine, I need shine
Step away from my light I need shineEmbed
