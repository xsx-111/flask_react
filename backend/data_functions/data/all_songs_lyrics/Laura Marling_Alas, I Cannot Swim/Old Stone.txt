Old Stone Lyrics
He chased me through the rain
"Honey, I'm going your way'"
I don't think so
You can chase me through the rain
And scream my name, a childish game
But I love to be young
And honey I was never gonna change
And honey you are never gonna change
But you love, don't you love it that way

Old stone
Ten thousand years and you're still on your own
Don't you love, don't you love me that way?

And if you swear that you're alright
I'm not gonna try and change your mind
Because the same night I dream that I lose you
I'll fall in love
Oh, honey don't let me walk away from this
If I'm trying to fuck up my own life
Then until I figure out why
I think it's best you keep your distance
Lest I fall in love
Old stone
Ten thousand years and you're still on your own
Don't you love, don't you love me that way?

He chased me through the rain
"Honey I'm going your way"
I don't think so
You can chase me through the rain
And scream my name, a childish game
But I love to be youngEmbed
