My Manic and I Lyrics
He wants to die in a lake in Geneva
The mountains can cover the shape of his nose
He wants to die where nobody can see him
But the beauty of his death will carry on, so
I don't believe him

He greets me with kisses when good days deceive him
And sometimes with scorn, and sometimes I believe him
And sometimes I'm convinced my friends think I'm crazy
Get scared and call him, but he's usually hazy

At one in the morning, day is not ended
By two, he is scared that sleep is no friend
And by four, he will drink, but he cannot feel it
Sleep will not come because sleep does not will it
And I don't believe him
Morning is mocking me

I'll wander the streets, avoiding them eats
'til the ring on my finger slips to the ground
A gift to the gutter, a gift to the city
The veins of which have broken me down
And I don't believe him
Morning is mocking me
Oh the gods that he believes
Never fail to amaze me
He believes in the love of his god of all things
But I find him wrapped up in all manner of sins
The drugs that deceive him and the girls that believe him

I can't control you, I don't know you well
These are the reasons I think that you're ill
I can't control you, I don't know you well
These are the reasons I think that you're ill

And since last that we parted, last that I saw him
Down by a river, silent and hardened
Morning was mocking us, blood hit the sky
I was just happy, my manic and I
He couldn't see me, the sun was in his eyes
And birds were singing to calm us down
And birds were singing to calm us down

And I'm sorry young man, I cannot be your friend
I don't believe in a fairytale end
I don't keep my head up all of the time
I find it dull when my heart meets my mind
And I hardly know you, I think I can tell
These are the reasons I think that we're ill
I hardly know you, I think I can tell
These are the reasons I think that I'm ill

And the gods that he believes
Never fail to disappoint me
And the gods that he believes
Never fail to disappoint me

My nihilist, my happy man, my manic, and I
Have no plans to move on
But birds are singing to calm us down
And birds are singing to calm us down6Embed
