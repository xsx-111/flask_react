Living the Dream LyricsTime and time again Lord I keep going through the motions
A means to an end but the ends don't seem to meet
Walking around living the dream anytime I take the notion
Til the truth comes bubbling up so bittersweet
Ain't no point getting outta bed if you ain't living the dream
It's like making a big old pot of coffee when you ain't got no cream
I don't need to change my strings cause the dirt don't hurt the way I sing
I don't have to do a Goddamn thing except sit around and wait to die
Well I've been waiting on an angel waitress to come and take my order
Tell me all about the special today
Staring at a puddle of mud in my spoon couldn't be much boreder
Hoping them circles on the paper don't call back telling me to start today
That old man upstairs, he wears a crooked smile
Staring down at the chaos he created
Said son if you ain't having fun just wait a little while
Momma's gonna wash it all away
And she thinks Mercy's overrated
Ain't no point getting outta bed if you ain't living the dream
Like making a big old pot of coffee when you ain't got no cream
I don't need to change my strings cause the dirt don't hurt the way I sing
I don't have to do a Goddamn thing except sit around and wait to die4Embed
