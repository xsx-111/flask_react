A Little Light LyricsThrough all these Earthly trials of sorrow
Through all these days of mortal sin
Through all these eternal nights with no tomorrow
Gotta stay on the straight and narrow and find a little light within
Gotta walk that road all the way to Heaven
Gotta walk that road until the dawn
Gotta walk that road all night
All you need is a little light
And the closer you get, lord, the brighter it turns on
Don't need no compass no map or chart
Don't need no stars shining above
Don't need nothing but a little light in my heart
Glowing inside me like a blanket of love2Embed
