Just Let Go LyricsWoke up today and decided to kill my ego
It ain't ever done me no good no how
Gonna break through and blast off to the Bardo
In them flowers of light far away from the here and now
Taking a 49 divine day vacation
From reality and all else in between
Gonna transmigrate to my destination
Far beyond time in an eternal dream
But am I dreaming or am I dying
Either way I don't mind at all
Oh it feels so good you just can't help but crying
Oh you have to let go so the soul may fall
Oh my God it's so beautiful
Everything is a part of me
It's so hard looking through all the lies made of wool
But if you close your eyes it becomes so easy to see6Embed
