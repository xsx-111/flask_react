Life of Sin LyricsWell lately things have been a little complicated
Quality of life has got me down
Well sex is cheap and the talk is overrated
And the boys and me are still working on the sound
A little happiness, a little love was all I wanted
Sure as Hell thought I'd found it but I was wrong
She left my heart feelin' taunted and my memories all haunted
But it's her I have to thank for all my songs
So every day I'm smokin' my brain hazy
All I can do to keep from goin' crazy
But the paranoia is slowly creepin' in
I keep drinkin' myself silly
Only way for this hillbilly
And I thank God for this here life of sin
Every morning when I rise look in the mirror and despise
The sight of everything and all that I've become
The level of my medicating some might find intimidating
But that's alright cause' it don't bother me none
Well lately things have been a little complicated
Quality of life has got me down
Well sex is cheap and the talk is overrated
And the boys and me still workin' on the sound4Embed
