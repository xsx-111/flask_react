Long White Line LyricsI won't be around this old town anymore for a long long time
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
I woke up my baby was gone without her I don't need no home
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Went to the bank to get my dough I don't care where I go
Gonna' push this rig 'til I push that girl out of my mind
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
New York City, Old St. Joe, Albuquerque, New Mexico
This old rig is humming and rolling and she's doing fine
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line3Embed
