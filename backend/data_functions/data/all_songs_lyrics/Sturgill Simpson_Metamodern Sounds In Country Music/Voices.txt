Voices LyricsThere's a voice that I can hear sometimes out here on the mountain
When it's dark and the sky is pouring acid like a fountain
And the memories like coal dust stain the window of my eyes
So ask them no more questions they can't sell you no more lies
I hear voices all around me in society's depression
Over and over they recite their first impression
And the rivers are all crying but the ocean cannot speak
'Til her waters crash into uncharted shores so dark and bleak
How I wish somebody'd make them voices go away
Seems they're always talking but they ain't got much to say
A picture's worth a thousand words but a word ain't worth a dime
We all know they'll go on talking til the end of time
Don't call it a sign of the times when it's always been this way
Forked tongues and voices behind curtains with no name
Well they plot their wicked schemes setting fate for all mankind
With evil that can fill God's pretty skies with clouds that burn and blind
How I wish somebody'd make them voices go away
Seems they're always talking but they ain't got much to say
A picture's worth a thousand words but a word ain't worth a dime
We all know they'll go on talking til the end of time3Embed
