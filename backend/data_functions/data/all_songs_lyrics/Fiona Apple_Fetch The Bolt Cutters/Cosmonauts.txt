Cosmonauts Lyrics
Your face ignites a fuse to my patience
Whatever you do, it's gonna be wrong
There's no time to interrupt the detonation
Be good to me before you're gone
When I met you, I was fine with my nothing
I grew with you and now I've changed
What I've become is something I can't be without your loving
Be good to me, it isn't a game

Now let me see, it's you and me, forgive, good God
How do you suppose that we'll survive?
Come on, that's right, left, right
Make lighter of all the heavier

'Cause you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

When you resist me, hon', I cease to exist
Because I only like the way I look when looking through your eyes
And when you come back
You commemorate the penetration of the sun into the deep, dark sky
Now let me see, it's you and me, forgive, good God
How do you suppose that we'll survive?
Come on, that's right, left right
Make lighter of all the heavier

'Cause you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off

Start it, start it off, start it off
Start it, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it, start it off, start it off now
Start it, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it, start it off, start it, start it
Start it, start it

You and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Start it, start it off, start it off
Start it off, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it off, start it off, start it off now
Start it off, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it off, start it off, start it, start it
Start it, start it
Start it off, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it off, start it off, start it off now
Start it off, start it off, start it off, baby
Start it off, start it off, start, start, start, start

Now we'll be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off
Oh, you and I will be like a couple of cosmonauts
Except with way more gravity than when we started off7Embed
