Relay Lyrics
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch

I resent you for being raised right
I resent you for being tall
I resent you for never getting any opposition at all
I resent you for having each other
I resent you for being so sure
I resent you presenting your life like a fucking propaganda brochure
And I see that you keep trying to bait me
And I'd love to get up in your face
But I know if I hate you for hating me
I will have entered the endless race

Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport (Evil is)
When the one who's burned (Evil is)
Turns to pass the torch (Evil is a relay sport)
Evil is a relay sport (Evil is)
When the one who's burned (Evil is)
Turns to pass the torch (Evil is a relay sport)

I resent you for being raised right
I resent you for being tall
I resent you for never getting any opposition at all
I resent you for having each other
I resent you for being so sure
I resent you presenting your life like a fucking propaganda brochure
And I see that you keep trying to bait me
And I'd love to get up in your face
But I know it if I hate you for hating me
I will have entered the endless race

Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport (Evil is)
When the one who's burned (Evil is)
Turns to pass the torch (Evil is a relay sport)
Evil is a relay sport (Evil is)
When the one who's burned (Evil is)
Turns to pass the torch (Hurt myself even more)

I'm sorry

Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Evil is a relay sport
When the one who's burned
Turns to pass the torch
Wipe it all away
Wipe it all away
I used to go to the Ferris wheel every morning
Just to throw my anger out the door9Embed
