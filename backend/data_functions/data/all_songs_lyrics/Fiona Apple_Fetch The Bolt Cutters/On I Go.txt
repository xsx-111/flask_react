Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move
On I go, not toward or away

Up until now in a rush to prove

But now I only move to move
On I go, not toward or away
Up until now it was day, next day
Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move
On I go, not toward or away
Up until now it was day, next day
Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move
On I go, not toward or away
Up until now it was day, next day
Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move
On I go, not toward or away
Up until now it was day, next day
Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move
On I go, not toward or away
Up until now it was day, next day
Up until now in a rush to prove
But now I only move to move

It could be alright (If I get there in time)
Be alright (If I get there in time)
In the long run
