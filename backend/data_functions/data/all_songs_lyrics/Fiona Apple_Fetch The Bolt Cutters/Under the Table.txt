Under the Table Lyrics
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me

I told you I didn't wanna go to this dinner
You know I don't go for those ones that you bother about
So when they say something that makes me start to simmer
That fancy wine won't put this fire out, oh

Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up

I'd like to buy you a pair of pillow-soled hiking boots
To help you with your climb
Or rather, to help the bodies that you step over along your route
So they won't hurt like mine

Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
And if I don't wanna go, leave me alone
Don't push me, cookie, don't push me, don't you push me
If you get me to go and I open my mouth
To the fucking mutton that they're talking about
You can pout, but don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you shush me

Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)

And if I don't wanna go, leave me alone
Don't push me, cookie, don't push me, don't you push me
If you get me to go and I open my mouth
To the fucking mutton that they're talking about
You can pout, but don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you shush me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me

Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (I would beg to disagree)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)6Embed
