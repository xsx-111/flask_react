Newspaper LyricsI too used to want him to be proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's telling you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
And it's a shame because you and I didn't get a witness
We're the only ones who know
We were cursed the moment that he kissed us
From then on, it was his big show
I grew concerned when I saw him start to covet you
When I learned what he did, I felt close to you
In my own way, I fell in love with you
But he's made me a ghost to you
I watch him let go of your hand, I wanna stand between you
But it's not what I'm supposed to do
I watch him walk over, talk over you, be mean to you
And it makes me feel close to you
It makes me feel close to you
It makes me feel close to you
It's not what it's supposed to do
It makes me feel close to you
I too wanted to make him proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's telling you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
And it's a shame because you and I didn't get a witness
We're the only ones who know
We were cursed the moment that he kissed us
From then on, it was his big show
From then on, it was his big show
From then on, it was his big show
And you're wearing time like a flowery crown
Sitting that, sitting that big cat down
And I'm alone on the summit now
Trying not to let my light go out
I too used to want him to be proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's telling you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
And it's a shame because you and I did not get a witness
We’re the only ones who know
We were cursed the moment that he kissed us
From then on, it was his big show
I grew concerned when I saw him start to covet you
When I learned what he did, I felt close to you
In my own way, I fell in love with you
But he's made me a ghost to you
I watch him let go of your hand, I wanna stand between you
But it's not what I'm supposed to do
I watch him walk over you, talk over you, be mean to you
And it makes me feel close to you
And you're wearing time like a flowery crown
Sitting there, sitting that big cat down
And I'm alone on the summit now
Trying not to let my light go out
Trying not to let my light go out
And you're wearing time like a flowery crown
Sitting there, sitting that big cat down
And I'm alone on the summit now
Trying not to let my light go out
Oh, I too used to want him to be proud of me
And then I just wanted him to make amends
I wonder what lies he's told you about me
To make sure that we'll never be friends
To make sure that we'll never be friends
To make sure that we'll never be friends
To make sure that we'll never be friends13Embed
