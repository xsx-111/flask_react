Heavy Balloon Lyrics
People like us, we play with a heavy balloon
We keep it up to keep the devil at bay, but it always falls way too soon
People like us, we play with a heavy balloon
We keep it up to keep the devil at bay, but it always falls way too soon
People like us, we play with a heavy balloon
We keep it up to keep the devil at bay, but it always falls way too soon

I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams
I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams

In the middle of the day, it's like the sun
But the Saharan one, it's staring me down
Forcing all forms of life inside of me to retreat underground
It grows relentless like the teeth of a rat
It's just got to keep on gnawing at me
And it constricts like a boa on a hose, nothing flows
So the pressure grows instead of the seed
People like us get so heavy and so lost sometimes
So lost and so heavy that the bottom is the only place we can find
You get dragged down, down to the same spot enough times in a row
The bottom begins to feel like the only safe place that you know
But you know what?

I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams
I spread like strawberries (I spread like strawberries)
I climb like peas and beans (I climb like peas and beans)
I've been sucking it in so long
That I'm busting at the seams

(I spread like strawberries), I spread like strawberries
I climb like (I climb like peas and beans)
I spread like strawberries
I climb like peas and beans
I spread like strawberries
I climb like peas and beans (That I'm busting at the seams)
I spread like strawberries
I climb like peas and beans6Embed
