Chosen Ones Lyrics
You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For death surely awaits you
With sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen ones

Human bones blanket the dirt
Of the heathen's lair
That we must pass this den of death
The only path from here
But I walk in the light
The time to die has come
No one shall take my life
I'm of the chosen ones


Black shadows fill the sky
As the creature's eyes grow near
Raise the shield
Of the holy pilgrim high into the air
Heaven's powers fill my arms
Onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh, the beast is coming
To put you to the test
Look out

Now this land is mine to pillage
Rape and steal and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign; for now, I stay
I stay to kill!


You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For death surely awaits you
With sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen onesEmbed
