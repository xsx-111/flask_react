No Line on the Horizon Lyrics
I know a girl who's like the sea
I watch her changing every day for me
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
One day she's still, the next she swells
You can hear the universe in her sea shells
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

No, no line on the horizon
No, no line

I know a girl with a hole in her heart
She said, "Infinity is a great place to start"
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
"Time is irrelevant, it's not linear"
Then she put her tongue in my ear
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line
Ooohhh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh
Oooohh ohhh
Oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh
The songs in your head are now on my mind
You put me on pause and try to rewind
Oh, and replay-ay-ay

Every night I have the same dream
I'm hatching some plot, scheming some scheme
Oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm a traffic cop, rue du Marais
The sirens wailing, but it's me that wants to get away
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

No line on the horizon
No, no line
No, no line on the horizon
No, no line2Embed
