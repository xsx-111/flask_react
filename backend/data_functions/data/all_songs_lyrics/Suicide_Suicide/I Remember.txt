I Remember LyricsI remember the neon nights
I remember the wonderful flights
I remember how free we were
I remember our incredible love
I remember your TV screen
I remember the red light dream
I remember how free we were
I remember incredible love
I remember your X-ray eyes
I remember your moonlight cries
I remember how free we were
I remember incredible love
I remember our incredible love
I remember incredible love
