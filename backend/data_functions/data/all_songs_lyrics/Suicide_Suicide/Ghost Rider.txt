Ghost Rider Lyrics
Ghost Rider motorcycle hero
Hey baby, baby, baby he's a-lookin' so cute
Sneak around-round-round in a blue jumpsuit

Ghost Rider motorcycle hero
Hey baby, baby, baby he's a-blazin' away
Like the stars, stars, stars in the universe

Ghost Rider motorcycle hero
Hey baby, baby, baby he's a-screamin' the truth
America, America is killin' its youth
Hey baby, baby, baby he's a-screamin' away
America, America is killin' its youth
America, America is killin' its youth

Ghost Rider
