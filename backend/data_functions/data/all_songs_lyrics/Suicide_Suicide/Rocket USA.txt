Rocket USA LyricsRocket rocket USA
Shooting on down, I'm on my way
TV star riding around
Riding around in a killer's car
It's 19-hundred 77
Whole country is doing a fix
It's doomsday, doomsday
Ah!
Riding around, riding high
Riding around with my babe
Riding around in my Chevy '69
Speeding down the skyway, ooh!
Speeding down the skyway, ooh!
Rocket rocket USA
Shooting on down, on my way
TV star riding around
Riding around in a killer's car
It's doomsday, doomsday
Ah! C'mon
Speeding down the skyway
100 miles per hour
Gonna crash
Gonna die
Ooh! yeah
And I don't care
Rocket rocket USA
Speeding down the skyway
Speeding down the skyway, ooh!2Embed
