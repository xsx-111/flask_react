Frankie Teardrop LyricsFrankie Teardrop
Twenty year old Frankie
He's married, he's got a kid
And he's working in a factory
He's working from seven to five
He's just trying to survive
Well, let's hear it for Frankie
Frankie, Frankie
But Frankie can't make it
'Cause things are just too hard
Frankie can't make enough money
Frankie can't buy enough food
And Frankie's getting evicted
Well, let's hear it for Frankie
Oh, Frankie, Frankie
Oh, Frankie, Frankie
Frankie's so desperate
He's gonna kill his wife and kid
Frankie's gonna kill his kid, hmm
Frankie picked up a gun, hmm
Pointed at the six month old kid in the crib
Oh, Frankie
Ah
Frankie looked at his wife
Shot her
Ah
Ah
Ugh, ugh
"Oh, what have I done?"
Let's hear it for Frankie
Frankie Teardrop, hmm
Frankie put the gun to his head, mmh
Uh, uh ah, hmm
Ah
Mmh, Frankie's dead
Ah, ah, mmh, ah
Ooh, Frankie, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Frankie's lying in hell
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah
Come on, get up
We're all Frankies
We're all lying in hell
Come on, get up, come on
Ah, ah, ah12Embed
