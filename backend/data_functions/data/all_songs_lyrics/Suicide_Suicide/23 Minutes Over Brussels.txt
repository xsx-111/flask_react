Ghost Rider motorcycle hero
Hey baby, baby, baby he's a-lookin' so cute

Hey baby, baby, baby he's a-blazin' away
Like the stars, stars, stars in the universe
Ghost Rider
Hey baby, baby, baby he's a-screamin' the truth
America, America is killin' its youth
America, America is killin' its youth
America, America is killin’ its youth

This is our new song, it’s "Rocket USA"!

Rocket rocket USA
Shooting on down the Highway
TV star riding around
Riding around in a killer's car
It's nineteen-hundred-and-78
It's doomsday, doomsday
It's doomsday, doomsday


Riding around, riding high
Riding around with my babe
Riding around in my Chevy '69
Speeding down the skyway
Hundred miles per hour
Gonna crash
Gonna die
Rocket rocket USA
Shooting on down, I'm on my way
Speeding down on the skyway
Speeding down on the skyway
You’re gonna die
