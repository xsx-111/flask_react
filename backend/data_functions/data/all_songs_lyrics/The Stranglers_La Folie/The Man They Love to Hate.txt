The Man They Love to Hate LyricsThey woke to grey English morning
And to a strange honeymoon
The girl who gave him all her love
And the man who said it still wouldn't do
His parents always worked hard
Never went to bed late
Nd though they were God's own people
They're still the ones he loves to hate
He never wanted to
Suffer this fate
All the girls have fallen for
The man they love to hate
The city is an animal
It snores and by day it roars
And though he loved to hate it
He couldn't live without it's flaws
With pastel curtains moaning
At a thousand harsh words - then hush
The girl she wanted to leave
Because she loved the man too much
He never wanted to
Suffer this fate
All the girls have fallen for
The man they love to hate
His father was a fighter
And he practised on his son
His mother was just some furniture
Who'd lost the will to run
The girl she wrote him a farewell note
And though he probably didn'y care too much
The girl she finally left him
Because she loved the man too muchEmbed
