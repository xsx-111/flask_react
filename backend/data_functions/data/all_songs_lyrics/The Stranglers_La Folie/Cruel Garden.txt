Cruel Garden LyricsBetter get out of the woods today
Plenty danger waiting there
Plenty hungry madames out today
Eat you up as soon as stare
Cruel garden
Cruel garden
Birds of prey are on the wing
Cruel garden
Cruel garden
Hope I can survive the spring
If you're walking in the woods tonight
Watch out for a madames eyes
One jumped up and grabbed me what a fright
Said that I was just her size
Cruel garden
Cruel garden
Birds of prey are on the wing
Cruel garden
Cruel garden
Hope I can survive the spring
Oh oh oh oh oh gotta get home in the light
Oh oh oh oh oh shouldn't be down here at night
Cruel garden
Cruel garden
Birds of prey are on the wing
Cruel garden
Cruel garden
Hope I can survive the spring
Oh oh oh oh oh gotta get home in the light
Oh oh oh oh oh shouldn't be down here at nightEmbed
