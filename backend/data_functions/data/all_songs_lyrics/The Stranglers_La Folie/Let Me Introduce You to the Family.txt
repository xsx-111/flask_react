Let Me Introduce You to the Family LyricsI love the family
Longer than longevity
Mother tells me what to be
Taller than the tallest tree
I love the family
Sister loves me tenderly
Sitting on my daddy's knee
Let me introduce you to the family
I love the family/I love the family
I love the family/I love the family
I love the family/I love the family
I love the family
Friends will fall for the family
Brother you are dear to me
Watch it grow the family tree
Can't outrun the family
It gets me where I want to be
Trough thick and thin it will help me
Let me introduce you to the family
I love the family/I love the family
I love the family/I love the family
I love the family/I love the family
I love the family
