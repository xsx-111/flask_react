Golden Brown Lyrics
Golden brown, texture like sun
Lays me down, with my mind she runs
Throughout the night, no need to fight
Never a frown with golden brown

Every time, just like the last
On her ship, tied to the mast
To distant lands, takes both my hands
Never a frown with golden brown

Golden brown, finer temptress
Through the ages, she's heading west
From far away, stays for a day
Never a frown with golden brown


Never a frown (never a frown)
(Never a frown) with golden brown (with golden brown)
(With golden brown) never a frown (never a frown)
(Never a frown) with golden brown (with golden brown)
(With golden brown) never a frown (never a frown)
(Never a frown) with golden brown (with golden brown)
(With golden brown) never a frown (never a frown)
(Never a frown) with golden brown (with golden brown)11Embed
