Tramp LyricsTakes the time to stay one place
Though his clothes aren't finest lace
Read the lines on a tramp's face
Taking his time just like you just like me
Wandering so fancy free
Searching for love in the call of the wild
Travelling lost like a child
Law has missed him every day
Doesn't need it anyway
Life is the next meal away
A lost woman long ago
Does she miss him does he know?
Does it matter in the snow?
Taking his time just like you just like me
Wandering so fancy free
Searching for love in the call of the wild
Travelling lost like a child
Taking his time just like you just like me
Wandering so fancy free
Searching for love in the call of the wild
Travelling lost like a childEmbed
