You Hold the Key to My Love in Your Hands LyricsYou hold the key to my love in your hands
You hold the scene of the world in your hands
How can you say that this is romance
When you hold the key to my love in your hands
If I scream, its all in my dreams
But you never want to take out
Take it out of your hands
You try to explain your life with your mouth
I never seen such an over insult
I search so high and low in your mouth
When will I ever find my heart sure about
If I scream, its all in my dreams
But you never want to take out
Take it out of your mouth
If I scream, its all in my dreams
But you never want to take out
Take it out of your mouth
I want to feel the Ðµarth moveEmbed
