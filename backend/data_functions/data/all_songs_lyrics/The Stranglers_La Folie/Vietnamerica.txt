Vietnamerica LyricsIt's over linger
On nightmares of the waste
The pagan values a bloodsweet crimson taste
Treasures captured
Pleasures enraptured
Lose their friendship
Vietnamerica
Vietnamerica
Vietnamerica
The native plaintive
Cry in ancient lands
Omnipotent gods have burnt their hands
Lightning providers
Fatal dividers
Spread heads inside us
Vietnamerica
Vietnamerica
Vietnamerica
So friends, Oh! Friends
Paint the mother's face Liars conspire
To hide within God's grace
Treasures captured
Pleasures enraptured
Lose their friendship
Vietnamerica
Vietnamerica
