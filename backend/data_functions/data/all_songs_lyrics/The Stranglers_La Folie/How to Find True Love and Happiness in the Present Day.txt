How to Find True Love and Happiness in the Present Day LyricsOnce I knew a man in love with money
He said it solved his worries and his cares
The one day
I heard him say
Something I hear everywhere
Once I knew a man in love with power
He bought a uniform and he kept it clean
Then one day
I heard him say
There's something he's never seen
Tell him how to find true love and happiness
In the present day
Tell him how to find true love and happiness
In the present day
Then I know a girl in love with living
Didn't like to stay in one place long
Then one day
I heard her say
She'd discovered something's wrong
Tell her how to find true love and happiness
In the present day
Tell her how to find true love and happiness
In the present day
Repeat
Tell him how to find true love and happiness
In the present day (X 3)Embed
