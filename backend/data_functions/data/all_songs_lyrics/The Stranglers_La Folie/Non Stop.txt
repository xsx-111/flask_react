Non Stop LyricsDedicated emancipated
Claims she waited her life for her man
Loves to pray every day
Says she's not frustrated in any way
Dressed in a black cotton sack
Pledges herself and she never looks back
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
And she's running/running/running/running/running
Enlisted sister knows her mister
Never two times with the rest of the clan
In her eyes you sympathise
The afterlife holds a better plan
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
And she gives up her whole life
And she'll never be your wife
'Cos she;s got the best lover
Better than any other
Better than any other
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
And she's running/running/running/running/running
Dedicated emancipated
Claims she waited her life for her man
Loves to pray every day
Says she's not frustrated in any way
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
She's a non stop nun
And she gives up her whole life
And she'll never be your wife
'Cos she's got the best lover
Better than any other
Better than any other
Better than any otherEmbed
