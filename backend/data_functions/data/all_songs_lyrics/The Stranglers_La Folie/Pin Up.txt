Pin Up LyricsShe's a centrespread special size of the month
She's the one on the wall
Watched by him she's scared to move
She's very well known only in the one stance
She's the girl that survived over a hundred million glances
She's the pin up
She's always on his mind a technicolor dream
The secret weapon
She lives on his locker door
She's the girl he dreams of when he's at sea
Although she's in 2-D he'd like her at home waiting
She's the pin up
She's the pin up
All over submarines
They think she's so serene
As a mermaid she don't look much
But such a sin could be this year's last year's thing
She's a charity gives something for nothing
A wallchart for his heart a victim of all his desires
Sometimes he dreams of a scratch me scratch me section
A rope ladder of hair a Babylon for him to climb
She's the pin up
She's the pin up
All over submarines
They think she's so serene
As a mermaid she don't look much
But such a sin could be this year's last year's thing
She's a centrespread special size of the month
She's the one on his wall
Watched by him she's scared to move
She's very well known always in the one stance
She's the girl who'll survive over a hundred million glances
She's the pin up
She's the pin up
