Cocktail Nubiles LyricsI want to love you like your Dad
And be your superman
I'll show you things you've never had
And hold your little hand
Bring on the nubiles
Bring on the nubiles
I kiss your zones erogenous
There's plenty to explore
I've got to lick your little puss
And nail it to the floor
Bring on the nubiles
Bring on the nubiles
I go crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Lemme lemme fuck ya fuck ya
Lemme lemme fuck ya fuck ya
Lemme lemme lick your lucky smiles
Bring on the nubiles
Bring on the nubiles
I go crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Lemme lemme fuck ya fuck ya
Lemme lemme fuck ya fuck ya
Lemme lemme lick your lucky smiles
Bring on the nubiles
Bring on the nubiles
Just bring them on
There's lots of games that we can play
Just turn my tap, I'll drip
And when the fever reaches you
I'm high beneath my zip
Bring on the nubiles
Bring on the nubiles
I go crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for you
Crazy for youEmbed
