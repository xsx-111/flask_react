Let Me Down Slow Lyrics
You look a little dressed up
You're acting way too smart
Your face a little bit flushed
For a walk in the park
And you're clutching your phone
As you walk in the dark
And your smile's got a twist
You're looking so hardcore
If you've something to say
Don't be too direct
Because I feel a little fragile
Don't hit the nail on the head

I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh no no no
I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow
No no no no

There's a swish in your step
There's a gleam in your eye
Are you coloring your hair
With some new kind of dye?
But the first one to blink
Is the first one to fall
I don't want a confrontation
I've got my back to the wall
Whoa I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh no no no no
I said, baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh no no no no no no


I said baby, baby, let me down real slow
Oh no no no no
I said let me stretch out in the afterglow
Oh nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah no

Let me down real slow
Oh no no no no no no no
Oh baby, baby, don't rest on your phone
Oh no no no
