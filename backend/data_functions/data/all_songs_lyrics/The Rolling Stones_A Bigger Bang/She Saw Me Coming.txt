She Saw Me Coming Lyrics
She saw me coming
She saw me coming, yeah

She saw me coming, I didn't see a thing
I wasn't looking, I just walked into it
A sucker for it, I'm a sucker, thought I was so cool
She saw me coming, boy did I get screwed
Yeah

She saw me coming, she had me dead to rights
Her aim was stunning, I was lined up in her sites
She worked so fast and she didn't mess around
It was all over before the sun goes down, 'fore the sun goes down

She saw me coming, yeah
She saw me coming
She saw me coming, she moved in for the kill
She saw me coming, she served up on a grill

She busted in and she burglarized my soul
But now the bad news: she's out on parole
She wrote the opening, the middle, and the end
What a cast of characters of lovers and my friends
The plot was twisted, there was only one result
She saw me coming but the going, going got too tough

She saw me coming, yeah, yes she did
She saw me coming, right on the grid, right on the grid
She saw me coming, oh what a stupid jerk
She saw me coming, she was a piece of work

She must have tapped my phone
She saw me coming, I felt like I was cloned
She saw me coming, she had me on the ropes
She saw me coming, took me for a dope
She saw me coming, yes she did, yes she did
She saw me comingEmbed
