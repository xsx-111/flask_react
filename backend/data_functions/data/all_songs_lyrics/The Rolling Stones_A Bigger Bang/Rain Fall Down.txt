Rain Fall Down Lyrics
It was a filthy block of flats, trash was on the floor
A stink was in my nose, hinges off the doors
She took me in her room, all was spic and span
Fixed me up a drink, turned down all the lamps

And the rain fell down
On the cold, hard ground
And the phone kept ringing
And we made sweet love

Why do we live in this strange grey town?
They build it up and let it all fall down
Feel like we're living in a battleground
Everybody's jazzed
Why do we live in this strange grey town?
The paint is peeling and the sky turned brown
The bankers are wankers, every Thursday night
They just vomit on that ground

And the rain fell down
On the cold, grey town
And the phone kept ringing
And we made sweet love
And we made sweet love
Everybody's dreaming
Everybody's scheming
Watching the rain fall down

She cooked me up some eggs, then she made some tea
Kissed me on the cheek and I turned on her TV
It was all the usual crap, all the usual sleaze
For ten thousand quid, some bimbo spilled the beans, yeah

And the rain fell down
On the cold, wet town
And the phone kept ringing
And we made sweet love
And we made sweet love

Yeah, and the rain fell down
And we made, and we made
And we made sweet love, yeah
And the phone kept, and the phone kept ringing
Yeah, mmm, ah, yeah
And the phone kept ringing
The phone kept ringing, yeah
And the rain (Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain)Embed
