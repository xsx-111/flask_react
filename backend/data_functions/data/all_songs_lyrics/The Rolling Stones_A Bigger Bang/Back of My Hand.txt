Back of My Hand Lyrics
I hear a preacher on the corner
Rantin' like a crazy man
He say there trouble, troubles a-comin'
I can read it like the back of my hand

I see love, I see misery
Jammin' side by side on the stage
In the wind some mournful melody
I can read it like the back of my hand
The back of my hand
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Oh, I see dreams, I see visions
Images I don't understand
I see Goya's paranoias
I can read it like the back of my hand
Read it like the ah, ah, ah, ah
Well, read it like the back of my hand

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Read it like the back of my hand1Embed
