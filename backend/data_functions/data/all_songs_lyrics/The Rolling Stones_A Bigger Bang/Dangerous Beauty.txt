Dangerous Beauty Lyrics
In your high school photo, you looked so young and naive
Now I heard you got a nickname, "The Lady of the Leash"
Well I find you on a midnight shift
I bet you had your fair share of stiffs
There were onerous odors, I've got to admit

Because you're a dangerous, dangerous, a dangerous beauty
It's so painfully plain to us you're doing your duty

Who you got there in that hood? You look so fancy in those photographs
With your rubber gloves on you're a favourite with the Chiefs of Staff
You're doing such a wonderful job
You're a natural at working with dogs
Keeping everyone awake at night with a touch of the prods

Well you're a dangerous, dangerous, a dangerous beauty
Yeah, disdainfully, painfully a bit of booty, yeah
And you're a dangerous, dangerous, a dangerous beauty
Beauty

Well you're a dangerous, dangerous, a dangerous beauty
If I was your captain, I'd put you soon to bed
Well you're a dangerous, dangerous, a dangerous beauty

What I say
Yeah everybody, beauty
Everybody now, yes
Are you one bad apple in a box?
Yeah, dangerous
Giving them electric shocks
I've seen the gloves coming off
Dangerous
If looks could be killing, I bet you shoot me nowEmbed
