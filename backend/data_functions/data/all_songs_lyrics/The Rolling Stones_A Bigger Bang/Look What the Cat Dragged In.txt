Look What the Cat Dragged In Lyrics
I know that you like to go out drinking
And you love to have a good time
You came in when I was drinking coffee
Having breakfast 'round about nine
I won't interrogate you and I never will berate you
'Bout your lifestyle
But where you been? Lost weekend

What's that look on your face?
You must have done the walk of shame
Your eyes are all red, get ready for bed
Your hair's all over the place
And look what the cat dragged in
Don't you call me your friend
Get out of my house with your dirty old mouse
Check yourself out again

Look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, you're checking right out again
Yeah, look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, checking right out again

Looking at the Sunday papers, up with all the latest
It was so quiet (So quiet)
Checkin' what was going on in Syria and Lebanon
A bad fright (Bad fright)
Ain't goin' to criticize you and I hate to ostracize you
With a bad night
Where you been? Lost weekend
You look like you're totally spaced
Your breath's got a horrible taste
You look like a leper, just Sergeant Pepper
Are you going to throw all over my face?
And look what the cat dragged in
Take it right out again
Get out of my house with your dirty old mouse
Take it right out again

Look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, we're checking right out again
Yeah, look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, checking right out again
Yeah


Well, look what the cat dragged in
Yeah, never do that my friend
Well, look what the cat dragged in
Look what the cat, look what the cat, look what the cat dragged inEmbed
