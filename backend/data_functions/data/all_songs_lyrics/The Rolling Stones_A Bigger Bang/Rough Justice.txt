Rough Justice Lyrics
One time, you were my baby chicken
Now you've grown into a fox
And once upon a time, I was your little rooster
Now am I just one of your cocks?

It's rough justice, oh yeah
You're gonna have to trust me
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart

So put your lips to my hips, baby
And tell me what's on your mind
I know you still got that animal attraction for me
It's been a long, long time

It's rough justice, oh yeah
Oh, we're never gonna dust it
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart
You're feeling loose and lusty
So if you really want me, yeah
It's rough justice
And you know I'll never break your heart
It's rough justice, oh yeah
You think you're real, it's just me
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart

First time I saw, baby
You were springing like a young gazelle
And next thing I know, we're way down the road
And you're flying like a bat out of hell

It's rough justice, oh yeah
You'll have to, to discuss it
You're gonna have to trust me
But you know I'll never break your heart
I give you my position
Don't want no opposition
It's rough justice
But you know I'll never break your heart

Whoa
Now come on, babe
Whoa, now, now
Come on, baby, woo
Come on, baby, nowEmbed
