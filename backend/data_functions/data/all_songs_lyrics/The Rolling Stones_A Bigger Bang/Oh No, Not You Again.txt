Oh No, Not You Again Lyrics
Here you stand before me waiting to be kissed
You're a beauty, such a cutie, how could I resist?
It's been a month of Sundays since we last had spoke
So much water, you get dollars, I fell out of the boat

Oh no, not you again, fucking up my life
It was bad the first time I can't stand it twice
Oh no, not you again, I can't stand the pace
Once bitten, twice shy, get me out of the the race

The setting's so romantic, love is in the air
All is perfect but I'm allergic to your business stares
You look so cool and tempting in your couture dress
You're addictive, as predicted, I'm nervous, I confess

Oh no, not you again mashing up my life
It was bad the first time, yeah, you had me in a vice
Oh no, not you again, I hear you and I shout
It was bad the first time around when you turned me inside out

Everybody's talking, showing up their wits
The moon is yellow but I'm like jello, staring down your tits
My mind flashes forward, I feel it flashing back
I still dreaming and I'm screaming, "Get me off the rack"

Oh no, not you again, I can't stand the pain
I was burned the first time, yeah, I can't deal it again
Oh no, not you again messing up my life, yeah
Once bitten, twice shy, but I can't do it twice

Oh no, not you again, fucking up my life
It was bad first time around, I better take my own advice
Oh no, oh no, oh nooooo!Embed
