Wild Talk LyricsYou got a big red tongue
'Cause you've been talking too long
I wouldn't get it back if I lended you an ear
Syllables and sounds is all I hear
So please read my hips and get a hold on your lips
Can't ask you to stop, it ain't no use
It's a verbal mess when your tongue is loose
'Cause your mouth is racing
While your mind is standing still
Yeah, all that wild talk, it's making me ill
Wild talk, told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the same lines
It's wild talk
Wild talk, thought I couldn't get enough
But you just babble along the same lines
Yes, wild talk
Yeah, but I have to believe
That you'll use your eyes to see
That I might like you better
If we slept together
'Cause why discuss all night
When there's room for a fight?
You just linger on, you're talking me down
It's a waste of words when I'm around
But your tape is rolling
While your brain is on standby
Yeah, all that wild talk, it must be making you high
Ah, too high
Wild talk, told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the same lines
It's wild talk (Some wild-talking misses)
Wild talk (Could I get through with some kisses?)
Thought I couldn't get enough
But you just babble along the same lines
It's wild talk
Wild, wild talk
Yeah, your tape is rolling
While your mind is on standby
Yeah, all that wild talk
It must be making you high
Wild talk, told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the same lines
It's wild talk
(Oh, sweet, wild-talking misses)
Wild talk (Could I get through with some kisses?)
Told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the same lines
It's wild talk
Wild talk, thought I couldn't get enough
But you just babble and babble and babble
It's wild talk (Yeah, sweet, wild-talking misses)
Wild talk (Could I get my kisses?)
Told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the same lines
It's wild talkEmbed
