Jihad LyricsFrom the steamin' Mekong Delta
To the shores of Tonkin Bay
Bombs of yellied gasoline'll
Make night as bright as day
And the mogul's hard tank masters
Adore their new grenades
And the D.A.D. find their 9-inch shells
Great for border raids
Yeah! I'm superfurious
I've done it again
I reach 50 when I count to 10
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
And you can shake your fist at the TV set
And you can slam your hand in the table
And you can cry and curse through tight, locked teeth
Just as hard as you are able
But you can't run away from trouble
'Cause there ain't no place that far
No fuel left for the pilgrims
That's just the way we are
'Cause I'm superfurious
I've done it again
I reach 50 when I count to 10
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
This is tower again, do you read me?
You can get the girls and you can get the video machine
But the fuel you asked for, you cannot have
What?! Blow me to heaven!
Jihad, I'm gettin' so mad, I'm gettin' so mad
Who's mad? I'm mad, so mad
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
Jihad, I'm gettin' mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrimsEmbed
