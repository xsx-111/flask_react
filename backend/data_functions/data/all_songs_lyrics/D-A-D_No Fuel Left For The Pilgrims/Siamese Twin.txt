Siamese Twin LyricsHuh! Come on, tell us about her
She's two of a kind and she's mine and I tell you, I love her
She is a six-hole golf course, ooh, I need her
Double days and double nights, triple beds is double all right
A love story new and improved that I want her
'Cause I've been with a Siamese twin (Siamese twin)
I've been with my double friend
I've been with a Siamese twin (Siamese twin)
I've been with my double friend
To save myself from trouble, I went for a double
Not just the hype of a stereotype, but a real nice couple
Latin, Nordic or Asian, don't care which nation
Twin towers, happy hours, I love her, yeah
'Cause I've been with a Siamese twin (Siamese twin)
Yeah, I've been with my double friend
I've been with a Siamese twin (Siamese twin)
I've been with my double friend
Yeah, give me happy hour!
I've been with a Siamese twin (Siamese twin)
I've been with my double friend
I've been with a Siamese twin (Siamese twin)
I've been with my double friendEmbed
