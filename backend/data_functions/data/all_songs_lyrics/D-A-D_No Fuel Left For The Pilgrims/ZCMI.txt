ZCMI LyricsSay, if you see a vicious lightning
On the nighttime sky
There is no use to check the starmap
Or ask your daddy why
And if you get me on the wire
I'll give you this reply
See, I'm comin' higher and higher
Over chimney pot and spire
(ZCMI)
Yeah, I'm that high-flyin' guy
(ZCMI)
And when the moon sails by
(ZCMI)
Yeah, I smile and wave goodbye
(ZCMI)
Beyond the end of space
To the future and back
In search of solid ground
To plant our flag
Yeah, we'd like to build a base
But the sky is too black
See, I'm comin' higher and higher
Over chimney pot and spire
(ZCMI)
Yeah, I'm that high-flyin' guy
(ZCMI)
And when the moon sails by
(ZCMI)
Yeah, I smile and wave goodbye
(ZCMI)
(ZCMI)
Surrender or die!
(ZCMI)
(ZCMI)
Yeah, I'm that high-flyin' guy
(ZCMI)
Yeah, I smile and wave goodbye
(ZCMI)
When the moon sails by
(ZCMI)
Yeah, I'm the ZCMI
