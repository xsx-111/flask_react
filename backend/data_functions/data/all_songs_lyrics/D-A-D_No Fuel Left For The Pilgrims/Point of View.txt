Point of View LyricsYeah, you like a man when his mind is strong
When his ego's so high he couldn't be wrong
And you like a man when he's right at the top
When his ego is growing and it don't seem to stop
See, I'd like to share your point of view
As long as it's my view too
Can't win on a comprise, I'd rather lose on my own
'Cause I feel kinda good when I'm all alone
And you play the games by the book and the rules
See, I play 'em backwards, let's see who'll lose
Yeah, you don't go for the man, you go for his balls
So let's see who stands, let's see who falls
Yeah, I'd like to share your point of view
As long as it's my view too
Can't win on a comprise, I'd rather lose on my own
'Cause I feel kinda good when I'm all alone
And if I take a stand, it will be my own
And take it, yeah
Yeah
Shhh, take a look in these eyes
Do they look sincere?
Read my lips, did I make it clear?
Bye-bye, so long, I don't want you here
Yeah, I tried to share your points of view
If not all, then maybe just a few
I couldn't win on a compromise, I'd rather lose on my own
'Cause I feel kinda good when I'm all alone
And if I take a stand, it'll be my own
Get out of my heart
And my mind
And my homeEmbed
