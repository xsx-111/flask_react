Sleeping My Day Away Lyrics
Mumbling good morning and raising my head
A bad-breath kiss to my pillow pet
Takes a look at the day and turns and stay in bed
Open my eyes when the day have died
I turned the world and I slept all right
Now my daymare is over, I zip my jeans tight
Oh, Lord, won't you bless this night?

From the pale lips of a youth who lay
I'm sleeping my day away
And when the night comes to the city, I say:
I'm sleeping my day away
Yeah, with my pale lips in the pillow, I say:
I'm sleeping my day away
After dark is the game I play
I'm sleeping my day, I'm sleeping my day away

When my dreams begin, I'll be proud to be letting you in
With a smile on my face, I guide our dreamboat in
So if you wanna travel along with me
You better sleep tight the rest of the day
You see, I could be a sleeper, it's not rest I lack
'Cause I hit the sack when the sun's coming back
From the pale lips of a youth who lay
I'm sleeping my day away
When the night comes to the city, I say:
I'm sleeping my day away
Yeah, with my pale lips in the pillow, I say:
I'm sleeping my day away
That after dark is the game I play
I'm sleeping my day, I'm sleeping my day
I'm sleeping my day away

I'm sleeping my day, I'm sleeping my day
I'm sleeping my day away

I'm sleeping my day away
Yeah, now I've turned the world around
Yeah, I did it again
I'm sleeping my day away
And now I have to wear my shades down Sleeper's Lane
I'm sleeping my day away
Yeah, all the good people have gone to bed again
I'm sleeping my day away
Because the devil's at work inside my brain
I'm sleeping my day away
I'm sleeping my day...
I'm sleeping my day away
I'm sleeping my day away, awayEmbed
