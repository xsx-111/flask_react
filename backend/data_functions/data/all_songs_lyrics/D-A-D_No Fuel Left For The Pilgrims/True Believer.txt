True Believer LyricsOoh, yeah!
I have my hair high and low
Anywhere the wind blows
I'm doing mph anywhere my soul goes
I'm hell right-on gasoline feed
That's all I need for the life that I lead
I'm a true believer, yes, I am
You try to get me if you can
Yeah! I'm riding alone and I've drugged my senses
There's no one else to take the consequences
See, when the day's gone free and the night creeps up on me
I take my German pipe, that's where I wanna be
I'm a true believer, yes, I am
And you try to get me if you can
Get me!
True believer, yes, I am
True believer, yes, I am
True believer, true believer, yes, I amEmbed
