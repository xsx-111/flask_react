Overmuch LyricsYeah, I heard a phone ring from deep down within
A friendly voice whispering under my skin
Yeah, I have to stop my enterprise below
But I'm not so sure the guy will let me go
Yeah, my girl says I'm overdressed
And my God says nothing at all
Yeah, it's funny how I'm in hip-deep
Feels like the devil's got my soul
Oh, oh, oh, overmuch
I'm too much, I'm overmuch
I'm way over, overmuch
I'm too much, I'm overmuch
I'm way out of reach and way out of touch
And I roll on the floor
That's what the floor is for
And I walk out that door
(That's what the door is for)
In the night, I'm way out of sight
But in the day, I keep getting in the way, yeah
You see, my friend says I'm over the top
And I should chill out the while
But you can see it in my face and my smile
I'm gonna stay for a whi-i-i-ile
Overmuch
I'm too much, I'm overmuch
I'm way over, overmuch
I'm too much, too overmuch
Much, much, much, much, overmuch
Ah, yeah
Overmuch, I wasn't born as such
Overmuch, but I've become way
I've become way, way, way, way overmuch
I'm too much, I'm overmuch
I'm way over, overmuch
I'm way overmuch
That's what I am
Yeah, I'm overmuch
I'm too much, I'm overmuch
Yeah, tell me again, overmuch
I'm not like other men
Overmuch, oh, I'm too much, I'm overmuchEmbed
