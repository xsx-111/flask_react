Rim of Hell LyricsI'll start your day with a shock
See, one of these days 'bout 12 o'clock
The world will turn into a little rock
And it's going to fall down with the sound of a knock
Now, I'm one of these guys who's nice to know
'Cause I know a place to go
It's just down the generation gap
I'll take you there in a red-hot cab
And if you want, I mean you really, really want
I'll show you my hometown and it's down
Yeah, you can tell by the smell
So close you can hear them yell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hell
Oh, Lord, let me live to tell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hell
And with your host, lift your glass for a toast
Don't be afraid of the colours he wear
Look around, all your friends are here
Now, don't say you've had enough
Stay awhile, stay tough!
Grab his horns like you just don't care
We'll eat the fire and drink what's there, yeah!
'Cause if you want, I'll take you down, down
I mean, you really, really want
I'll show you my hometown
Let's stay until the end, the very end
And to be saved by the bell
So close we almost fell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hell
Yeah, you can tell by the smell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hell
To the edge and back and to the edge again
Too hot for the DJ and too hot for his friends
Come on, party!
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hell
Yeah!
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hell
Oh, Lord, let me live to tell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hell
Please, I can't stand the smell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of hellEmbed
