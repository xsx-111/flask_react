Girl Nation LyricsI had a ticket to fly, so I boarded the plane
When a combat-dressed stewardess shouted my name
I'm wanted alive, yeah, I'm in for a trial
It's minimum mercy 'cause they've found my file
Hijacked, kidnapped, trailed and trapped
They fly me in
I'm gonna pay for all of my sins
Now it begins
Yeah, I've found place where girls eat men
Now I'm back in girl nation again
A girl nation
Female civilization
A girl nation
Female civilization
It's a female tale, it's hard to use words
But I'm landed and stranded among oysters and birds
Bad bush and dangerous curves
Bad boys get what they deserves
Wild sisters dancing all night
('Round that totem)
With a knife to my throat
('Round that totem)
Yeah, they're chanting the oath
Singing 'bout Mama all through the night
Around that totem of the red light
In girl nation
Female civilization
A girl nation
Female civilization
A girl nation
By interstellar navigation
Sweet, female persuasion
Globetrotting to lady land
Back where time began
One wild second and then I was down
One full circle, they stood all around
Countin' my bones, waitin' to be dead
When a soft, loving hand lifted my head
Tender lips kissing my chin and whispering
"Honey, where have you been?"
In girl nation
(Totem of the red light)
Female civilization
In girl nation
(Totem of the red light)
It's a female civilization
Girl nation
(Totem of the red light)
By interstellar navigation
Sweet, female persuasion
Globetrotting to lady land
Back where time began
In girl nationEmbed
