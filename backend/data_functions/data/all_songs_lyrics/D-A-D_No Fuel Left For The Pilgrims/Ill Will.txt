Ill Will Lyrics
What we need isn't systems
Or regulatin' plans
But bigger guns to shoot with
And a bigger type of man

Ill will
For good or ill, my iron will is unrivalled still
Evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me and my friends
Ill will, no patterns, no sense

I hate mental exercise
Thinking gives me pain
I know people don't turn out that way today
But here we go again

Ill will, ill will
For good or ill, my iron will is unrivalled still
Evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me and my friends
Ill will, no patterns, no sense
Rock 'n' roll!
Yeah! Ill will!!!Embed
