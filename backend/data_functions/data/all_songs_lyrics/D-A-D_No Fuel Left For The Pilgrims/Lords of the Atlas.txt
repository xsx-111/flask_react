Lords of the Atlas LyricsIn my travelling heart
There's an urge to see
Foreign lands and alien birds
And new stories that no one heard
To stick a pin in the globe
And to believe and hope
There's a whole new world to unravel
As far as a Boy Scout can travel
Company of adventurers
(On the secret track)
Caesars of the wilderness
(Round the world and back)
Card-carrying members
Ooh, we're the lords of the atlas
To see God standing on a local hill
And know there's forests unthrod still
Don't look back when you climb the stairs
I'm travelling the mental fares
Going through eternal cloud land
To the ends of the earth
And after 2,000 steps of climbing
I know it was the whole trip worth
Company of adventurers
(On the secret track)
Caesars of the wilderness
(Round the world and back)
Card-carrying members
Ooh, we're the lords of the atlas
Company of adventurers
(On the secret track)
Caesars of the wilderness
(Round the world and back)
Card-carrying members
Ooh, we're the lords of the atlas
(We're the lords)
Yeah, we're the lords of the atlas
Yeah, we're the lords of the atlas
Sitting cross-legged on Persian rugs
Addicted to a thousand drugs
Our flags nailed to the mast
Captain says: Forward fast!
Company of adventurers
(On the secret track)
Caesars of the wilderness
(Round the world and back)
Card-carrying members
Ooh, we're the lords of the atlas
Company of adventurers
(On the secret track)
Caesars of the wilderness
(Round the world and back)
Card-carrying members
Ooh, we're the lords of the atlas
(We're the lords)
(Lords of the atlas)
Caesars of the wilderness
Card-carrying members
We're the lords of the atlas
(We're the lords)
Yeah, we're the lords of the atlas
(We're the lords)
(We're the lords)Embed
