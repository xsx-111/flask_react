Believe Lyrics
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love
After love, after love

No matter how hard I try, you keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through, there's no talking to you
It's so sad that you're leaving, it takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done, you're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

What am I supposed to do, sit around and wait for you?
Well, I can't do that, and there's no turning back
I need time to move on, I need love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through and maybe I'm too good for you, oh
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong
I don't need you anymore, oh, I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore, no, I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
Do you believe in life after love?32Embed
