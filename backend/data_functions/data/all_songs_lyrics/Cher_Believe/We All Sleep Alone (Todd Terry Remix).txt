We All Sleep Alone (Todd Terry Remix) LyricsSomebody, somewhere, turns off the lights
Somebody all alone faces the night
You've got to be strong
When you're out on your own
'Cause sooner or later
We all sleep alone
Nobody, nowhere, holds the key to your heart
When love's a possession, it'll tear you apart
You may have lovers wherever you roam
But sooner or later
Ooh, we all sleep alone
Oh, the young and the young at heart wait
But the wait never ends in the soul
When you feel love is all gone away
Independence has come
And into the night I go
Don't make no promises that I can't keep
I won't be no prisoner of somebody's needs
You may have lovers wherever you roam
But sooner or later
Ooh, we all sleep alone
Ooh, we all sleep alone
Yeah, yeah, we all sleep alone, yeah
And I know, and I know how you feel
Like I've taken what you're saying to me
'Cause we all sleep alone
Yes, we all sleep alone
Yeah
We all sleep aloneEmbed
