Runaway Lyrics
Nobody said it would be easy
Nobody gives you guarantees
'Cause a heart can always be broken
And there can be no loving without tears

Runaway, to a place where nobody knows
Runaway, gotta let this feeling go
Runaway, if I can't find love
I gotta runaway

Nobody's looking for perfection
How could they give it in return?
But I told my heart to believe you
And you just gave your love to anyone

Runaway, to a place where nobody knows
Runaway, gotta let these feelings go
Runaway, 'cause I don't wanna hurt anymore
Though my heart is always searching
If I can't find love, I gotta runaway
Runaway, runaway, runaway
If I can't find love, if I can't find love
'Cause a heart can always be broken
And there can be no loving without tears

Runaway, to a place where nobody knows
Runaway, gotta let these feelings go
Runaway, and I don't wanna hurt anymore
Though my heart is always searching
If I can't find love
I gotta runaway, runaway, runaway
If I can't find love
I gotta runaway, runaway, runaway
I've gotta run, I've gotta runaway
If I can't find love, if I can't find love
If I can't find love, if I can't find loveEmbed
