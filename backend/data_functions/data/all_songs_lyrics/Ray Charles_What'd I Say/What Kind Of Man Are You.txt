What Kind Of Man Are You Lyrics
What kind of man are you? (Oh, oh)
Why do I love you so?
What kind of man are you
Yeah, yeah, when you love me no more?
What kind of man are you?
Mmm, mmm, why can't I let you go?

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Yes, ooh ooh, about you

What kind of man are you?
I, I, I just can't satisfy
What kind of man are you?
Oh yeah, no matter how I try
What kind of man are you?
Yeah, yeah, why do you tell me lies?

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Yes, ooh ooh, about you
What kind of man are you?
Mmm, mmm, I'm always left alone
What kind of man are you?
Hey, hey, how long can this go on?
What kind of man are you?
Oh, help me somebody
You know right from wrong

I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Yes, ooh ooh, about you
Oh yeahEmbed
