Golden Ball LyricsThe only viable sun what we have in common, we have nothing common
I live with it's companions, I live with it's companions
They can illuminate within it's commandment to illuminate
To attenuate, to illuminate, to accentuate for we are old fellows
Illuminate but we are...
Like falling two in half from visible to invisible
Into the intercourse that illuminates
Each fragment of the screen, put into the ball
Of which it's part, observe the failing of it's tendencies
There's no above, there's no below
Two months (?), the only dynamic sunEmbed
