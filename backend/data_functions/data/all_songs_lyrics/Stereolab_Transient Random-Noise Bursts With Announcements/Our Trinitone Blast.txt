Our Trinitone Blast Lyrics
What you decide to be is what you are
Your only way ahead, your way to go far
Your reason's the key to who you really are
The decision's in your head it can't be far
Prejudice confines the best of you
Break the shackles, it's up to you
Be your own master, owe it to you

Self doubt, denial will kill you

"It's harder" means more work to be who you are
It might mean hardship, it might take a while
Struggle, conflict, crisis; they're all at the bar

Don't let anyone close your heart

Bounders are vulnerable creatures who
Project their fear and weakness upon you
Refuse to play the role that they want you to

You can take your life in your hands
Don't let anyone close your heart
Revive the noble side of you
You can overcome in the end
What I decide to be is what I am
My true and best way ahead's in my command
My reason's the key to my development
I want to stretch myself to be who I am
Push them off is the best I can do
While canalising onto better things
If it has to explode then it will

Self doubt, denial has killed me
I don't let anyone close to my heart
Don't want to be taken apart
I can gain myself in the end2Embed
