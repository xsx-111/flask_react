Crest LyricsIf there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
La-la-la, la-la, la-la
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
If there's been a way to build it, there'll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-laEmbed
