Jenny Ondioline LyricsLife on Earth is a bloody hazardous affair
As in the city, the republic was collapsing away
I think the brilliant crust's hiding sad realities to come
And there's a decisive battle that we all had that we lost
I don't care if the fascists have to win
I don't care democracy's being fucked
I don't care socialism's full of sin
The untenable system engenders rot
But what is exciting's the challenge and stimulation
That the tensions help keep the creative nerve so taut
The absence of profounder transformation in the country
Make their hopes turn sour, feelings of let down in irony
Obviously once more it could be called treachery
Rappel Ã  l'ordre, oh don't you get too revolutionary
I don't care if the fascists have to win
I don't care democracy's being fucked
I don't care socialism's full of sin
The untenable system engenders rot
But what is exciting's the challenge and stimulation
That the tensions help keep the creative nerve so taut
Life on Earth is a bloody hazardous affair
Impressive malleability of human identity
The horrors of the war were to be repeated anyway
It was like taking candy from a baby
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
Give me the strength, the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
Where is the lift, the hope, and the struggle?
We got to keep the lift, hope, and struggle
