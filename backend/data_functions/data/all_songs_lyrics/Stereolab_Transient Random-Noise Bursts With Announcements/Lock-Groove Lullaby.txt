Lock-Groove Lullaby LyricsLearn to earn how, learn how things are
I salute the people who perceive
What's around, they digest, so it clears
Learn to learn love, learn how things are
All the worlds of the world will deceive
The idea before it is conceived
Learn to dream, ah, mystical, al
Express through the body what is meant unconsciouslyEmbed
