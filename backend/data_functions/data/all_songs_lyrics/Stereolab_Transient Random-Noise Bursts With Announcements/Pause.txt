Pause LyricsRetrieve the past like a prayer, bringing it back into the light
What was yesterday will reform today to retrieve lost life
Lost loves (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Retrieve (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Lost words (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Ideas (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Overcome (unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
(Unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness)
Unconsciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into
Consciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into
Consciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into
Consciousness, made conscious out of the darkness into
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la...1Embed
