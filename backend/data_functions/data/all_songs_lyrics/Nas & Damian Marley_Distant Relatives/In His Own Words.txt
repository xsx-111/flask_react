In His Own Words Lyrics
JAH TOLD YOU
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
JAH TOLD YOU
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"

Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the Tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin holders
Or I'm, sitting with goons in the visiting rooms
Flip it I could have been you, behind state walls biddin'
These are the things that a G pray for
Acquit us, a little stash in the safe or little Shorty to wait for him
Or a Shorty to take the weight for him
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw Gods face on the design in my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see Him every day y'all
In a bus or the train or
The billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for Him
Have faith for Him, no matter what His name's called
Seen!
JAH TOLD YOU
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"

Can you think of a color that you never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you never been?
Well is many are called, but them never deemed
Worthy for the cause, cause them never clean
Help who help themselves, Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah Jah like a Cherubim
Keep we strong through the winter like an Evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seemed
All things are related, and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage?
Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage, nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keeps his word, Yow nuh care what the plan is
Don't be astonished, Stumbling blocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace
Woah!
JAH TOLD YOU
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
JAH TOLD YOU
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"

Some ask me if I feel that Zion is surreal
And in my songs, do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is the only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combinations of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective, I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition, getting high with my brethren
Then I ask him why is Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons and suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
Its like its been exchanged for this penicillin
Seen
JAH TOLD YOU
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
JAH TOLD YOU
IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"
TO GUIDE YOU
THROUGH THIS COLD WORLD
"AND I'LL SEE YOU THROUGH"1Embed
