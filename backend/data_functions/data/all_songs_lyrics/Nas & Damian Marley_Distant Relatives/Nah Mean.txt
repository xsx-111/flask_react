Tougher than concrete
Eh bwoy

Boom

You nah mean? Mi dip out a whole fourteen, nah mean
And reload man extra magazine, nah mean
And wounded them housing scheme, nah mean
Nuff a dem a move sideway and lean, nah mean
Can't come bout when man deh in, nah mean
We nuh like dem colonial regime, nah mean
Ethiopian nuh like Mussoline, nah mean
Mi Queen hafi rock and come in, nah mean
And jump pon mi big trampoline, nah mean
And boost up her self-esteem, nah mean
Nuff a wonder how man kitchen so clean, nah mean
And which recipe dat a steam, nah mean
The lyrics dem a flow like a stream, nah mean
Mek you feel like you living in a dream, nah mean
It come to the crop man a cream, nah mean
It come to discipline man a Dean, nah mean
Mi tougher than a Hummer limousine, nah mean
We stepping, we fresh and we clean, nah mean
I burn the stinkest of green, nah mean
Better listen up careful and keen, nah mean
A Puppa Nas a rock and come in, nah mean
We celebrate like I finished probation, boy boy
Knotty Head with no chaser, boy boy
From the mouth, I can spit out a razor, boy boy
Open up your facial like your boy Roy in his prime
Eat food, dinnertime, Jr. Gong pass the Guinness
Handle business, black Velvet sippers
Females never bid us farewell, they with us
'Cause we arrive on the scene just like a high beam, nah mean
Don't let us have to make the 9 scream, nah mean
At your racial policin' regime, nah mean
Spiritual like a Elohim, nah mean
In a casino or a yacht, wherever I'm seen
My brothers and sisters are never forgot, nah mean
Don't wanna hear another soldier drop, nah mean
Another dope addict get shot with the morphine
And Feds are indictin' my block, nah mean
They're wearin' red from they shoes to they top, nah mean
I'm wishin' that all the violence would stop, nah mean?

We nuh like the sound of siren, nah mean
And some bwoy soft like ice cream, nah mean
From a bwoy mek the Feds intervene, nah mean
We send a bwoy go tek intravene, nah mean
Parabellum dem a itch up inna spleen, nah mean
Inna Queens, gunman reign Supreme, nah mean
Kingstonians are real blood fiends, nah mean
The world is a big crime scene, nah mean
Yo, yo, Mr. President (Yo, a-Mr. President)
What you doin' for my residents?
(What you doin' with my residents?)
Yo, Mr. Minister (Mr. Minister)
Why you bein' sinister, hey? (Hey)
Yo, yo, Mr. President (Yo, yo, Mr. President)
What you doin' for my residents?
(What you doin' with my residents?)
Yo, Mr. Minister (Mr. Minister)
Why you bein' sinister?

Say man a di real Buffalo inna Rastafari regime
Bush Bungalow is where mi dwell with mi queen
Trash to the bone down inna camouflage green
Nuff a dem that can't go the places we been
Nuff a dem that can't see the sights that we seen
That's why them face all a twist up and a lean, nah mean
Dem better mind we kick it off clean, nah mean
Man a gangster just like Gambin', dat mean
Dem can't serve "Congo dread" court subpoen', nah mean
A who you want come in convene, nah mean
Attorney haffi rock and come in, nah mean
Mi pocket dem green like sperling, nah mean
Mi regular fly out and fly in, nah mean
The stadium pack like sardine, nah mean
Can't catch mi speed, a fassy hole need caffeine, nah mean
Run out a breath and antihistamine (Nah mean)
Wash over gold dem come in like Listerine (Nah mean)
You think a lie we badder than Al Pacin' (Nah mean)
It's genocide, it's a genocide
It's a genocide, it's a genocide
Fifth floor, cookin' raw, had my own supply
'Cause of capitalist ways, that was back in the days
So now I do rap and it pays10Embed
