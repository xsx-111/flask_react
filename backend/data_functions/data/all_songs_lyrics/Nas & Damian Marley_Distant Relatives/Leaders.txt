Leaders Lyrics
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world
Change
The world
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the
World
Change the world

Yeah!
Got out the 600, blunted
Chicks hunt him
Neighborhood know he comin'
Jake hate him, snakes could not violate him
Pimps memorize his lines verbatim
He reps N.Y., yo
Gives C-notes to winos
Not church, it's how he tithe though
He walks the tenement
Sleeps at his super fly condo
My kinda nigga, my Icon, my idol
No certificate for this misfit who handle business
The odds stacked against him
He fights back mackin' Benzes
Never puts cash or ass before friendship
He laughs last?
As some die young, he is still existin'
Somehow he got around the pitfalls of the system
When he walks, we watch
When he talks, we listen
Leaders
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world
Change the world
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world
Change the world

Who do I follow?
Who do I copy?
Look in to the mirror, and it's you I see look at me
Everything new like it fresh from the factory
Everything you do? It impact me
Your lifestyle attract me
Parents try distract me
When I grow up, I want to be like you exactly
And as soon as I get over this acne
There's no way anybody coulda stop me
Me gravitate toward the aura
And all the mannerism
The sendin' out of orders
And man start movin' busy
The lockin' of the corners?
The streets and all the buildings
Mi love you like a father
Mi ready and mi willin'
Anything what you a talk is law in my dominion
And mi have similar thoughts, I share the same opinions
Mi have it say you smart
With mi best interest at heart
I'm followin' your path
Yow mine whe you a walk
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world
Change the world
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world
Change the world

They appeal to the conscious
The Paramount, the Caesar, the monsters
The grandiose, the martyrs
The hell on earth pompous
Ellsworth Bumpy Johnsons
The Harlemites, the Garveyites
Black as the credit card we swipe
Poppin' Dom tonight
For all of mine
I can see myself back at the Autobahn
Malcolm on the podium, shells drop to linoleum
Swipe those, place 'em on display at the Smithsonian
Next to only gems that were left behind by holy men
Infectious charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexists
Resistance against oppression
Progressive thinkin'
Ghetto speakers
Protestors against the colored
Only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon
The contradiction
The cross, the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinnin'
On Esau's back inscription
That it was written
That nothing is coincidence'n
They took our leaders and they lynched them
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world
Change the world
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world
Change the world
Change the world, change the world
Change the world
Change the world, change the world
You change the world4Embed
