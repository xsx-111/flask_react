Unhappy Girl (Demo) Lyrics
Come here now little baby
Come here now little girl
You look, look so sad
You can have anything in this world
Why don't you go shoppin'?
Go to the boutique, buy yourself something sexy
You're just on an unlucky streak

Unhappy girl, unhappy girl, unhappy girl
Come on and cheer up

Why you don't put on some music?
Pun on your favorite song
Why don't you start dancin'?
You'll forget your troubles before long

Unhappy girl, unhappy girl, unhappy girl
Come on and cheer up

Why don't you pop the top down?
Open up a 
Call a boy on the phone
Yeah, there's no reason to be alone
Unhappy girl, unhappy girl, unhappy girl
Come on and cheer up
Unhappy girl, unhappy girl, unhappy girl
Come on and cheer up
Unhappy girl, unhappy girl, unhappy girl
Come on and cheer upEmbed
