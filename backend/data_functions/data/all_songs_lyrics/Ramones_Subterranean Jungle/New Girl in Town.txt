New Girl in Town Lyrics
Here comes that new girl, everybody
Check her out
She wants to be a part of the city
Well, I'll treat that girl just like a queen
She looks kinda like a hopeless drug fiend

Hey new girl, you just arrived in town
Hey new girl, can I show you around?
Let me show you the lights of the city
Let me show you every avenue
Let me show you what the rock n' roll kids do

Here comes that new girl, everybody
Check her out
She looks real cool, just like one of us
Comes from New Jersey, just got off the bus
Every freak in town want to love her gold
And in her first move

Hey new girl, you just arrived in town
Hey new girl, can I show you around?
Let me show you the lights of the city
Let me show you every avenue
Let me show you what the rock n' roll kids do
Well, I see your eyes wondering
If you're missing anything
Come on girl and find out
What the rock n' roll kids are all about

Hey new girl, you just arrived in town
Hey new girl, can I show you around?
Let me show you the lights of the city
Let me show you every avenue
Let me show you what the rock n' roll kids do
Hey new girl, you just arrived in town
Hey new girl, can I show you around?
Let me show you the lights of the city
Let me show you every avenue
Let me show you what the rock n' roll kids doEmbed
