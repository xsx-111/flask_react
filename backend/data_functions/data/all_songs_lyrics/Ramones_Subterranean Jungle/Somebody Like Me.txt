Somebody Like Me Lyrics
Tired of nagging nothingâ€™s ever happening
That's the attitude that is not fun
A bottle of wine, a tube of glue
I do not know what to do

I am just a guy who likes to rock and roll
I am just a guy who likes to get drunk
I am just a guy who likes to dress punk
Get my kicks an' live up my life

Tired of complaints I am ready for fun
But I will make friends with anyone
Are you out there somebody like me
If you are, I hope that you can see

I am just a guy who likes to rock and roll
I am just a guy who likes to get drunk
I am just a guy who likes to dress punk
Get my kicks and live up my life

Do not go to school do not make me laugh
Cannot hardly spell, cannot do math
In the bar or out on the street
At the concert at the boutiqueEmbed
