Roots of Hatred (Demo) Lyrics
I know you’re everything
Well, I know those tales you told
I smell them in the breeze
With every midnight break
I make you beg me please
I let my soul escape
Well I let my blood run cold
So that my nerves would freeze
Whatever it would take
To set my heart at ease

One little wrong got so complicated
That little wrong became the roots of hatred
Roots of hatred, roots of hatred, had me fallin’
Fallin’ apart, hatin’, hatin’ with all of my heart
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

A secret hiding place
You said there’s buried gold
Under roots of all those trees
Whatever I must face
I’ll set my heart at ease
One little wrong got so complicated
That little wrong became the roots of hatred
Roots of hatred, roots of hatred, had me fallin’
Fallin’ apart, hatin’, hatin’ with all of my heart
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, ohEmbed
