Indian Giver Lyrics
I can still remember, it wasn't long ago
Things you used to tell me
You said I had to know
Told me that you love me
And that you always would
Then I said I loved you
You said that that was good
Girl you made a promise
Said you'd never want me to go
Oh no, oh

Indian giver
Indian giver
You took your love away from me
Indian giver
Indian giver
Took back the love you gave to me

Baby, I was feeling the way I wanna feel
You had me believing the love we had was real
Said we'd be together
And that we'd never end
Now and till forever
Oh yeah, that's what you said
Girl when I was down I knew that you would always be there
Oh, yeah, oh
Indian giver
Indian giver
You took your love away from me
Indian giver
Indian giver
Took back the love you gave to me (Yeah!)


Indian giver
Indian giver
You took your love away from me
Indian giver
Indian giver
Took back the love you gave to me
You're an Indian giver
Indian giver
You took your love away from me
You're an Indian giver
Indian giver
Took back the love you gave to me
You're an Indian giver
Indian giver
You took your love away from me
You're an Indian giver
Indian giver
Took back the love you gave to me
You're a Indian giver
Indian giver
You took your love away from me
Indian giver
Indian giver
Took back the love you gave to meEmbed
