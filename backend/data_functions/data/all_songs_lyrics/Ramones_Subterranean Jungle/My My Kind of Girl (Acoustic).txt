My My Kind of Girl (Acoustic) Lyrics
When I saw you on 8th street
You could make my life complete, baly
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You are my-my kind of a girl
And when I saw you by
The jukebox, ow-ow
You put a quarter in and played
My favorite song too, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You are my-my kind of a girl
I think we would look pretty good together
Walking through a winter wonderland
And this time I think it is forever
I hope your parents understand
When I saw you by the Peppermint Lounge
You were lost but you have been found, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You are my-my kind of a girlEmbed
