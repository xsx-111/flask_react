Psycho Therapy Lyrics
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
That is what they want to give me
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho
All they want to give me

I am a teenage schizoid
The one your parents despise
Psycho Therapy
Now I got glowing eyes
I am a teenage schizoid
Pranks and muggings are fun
Psycho Therapy
Going to kill someone

Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
That is what they want to give me
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho
All they want to give me

I like taking Tuinal
It keeps me edgy and mean
I am a teenage schizoid
I am a teenage dope fiend
I am a kid in the nuthouse
I am a kid in the psycho zone
Psycho Therapy
I am going to burglarize your home

Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
Psycho Therapy
