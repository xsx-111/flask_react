In the Park Lyrics
All dressed up when the sun sets low
And the big, bright moon shines a friendly hello
When my heart pants with lust like a Romeo
And I'm all messed up when the fireflies glow
Oh-ho, oh-ho
I just want to cuss and fight
Well, I'm going out tonight
Everything is out of sight
Well, it's gonna be all right
Oh-ho, oh-ho

I'm gonna hang out in the park
Hang out after dark
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight

Under street lamps, I will play
After the school day
When troubles disappear
And I feel excitement's here
Oh-ho, oh-ho
Kids in cars go cruisin' by
The big, bright moon shines in the sky
Music's playing that portable sound
While everybody's hanging all around
Oh-ho, oh-ho
I'm gonna hang out in the park
Hang out after dark
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight

All dressed up when the sun sets low
And the big, bright moon shines a friendly hello
When my heart pants with lust like a Romeo
And I'm all messed up when the fireflies glow
Oh-ho, oh-ho

I'm gonna hang out in the park
Hang out after dark
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
I'm gonna hang out in the park
Hang out after dark
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
I'm gonna hang out in the park
Hang out after dark
I'm gonna be with the gang tonight
I'm gonna hang out in the park
Hang out after dark
I'm gonna be...Embed
