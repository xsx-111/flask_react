Time Has Come Today LyricsCuckoo
Time has come today
Young hearts can go their way
Can't put it off another day
I do not care what others say
They say we do not listen anyway
Time has come today, hey
Oh, the room has changed today (hey)
I have no place to stay (hey)
I am thinking about the subway (hey)
My love has blown away (hey)
My tears have come and gone (hey)
Oh Lord I got to run (hey)
I got no home (hey)
No, I have no home (hey)
Oh, now the time has come (time)
Nowhere to run (time)
Might get burned up by the sun (time)
But I'll have my fun (time)
I have been loved, pushed aside (time)
I have been crushed by tumbling tide (time)
And my soul has been psychedelicized (time, time)
Now the time has come (time)
There are things to realize (time)
Time has come today (time)
Time has come today (time)
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time
Oh, now the time has come (time)
No place to run (time)
Might get burned up by the sun (time)
But I'll have fun (time)
I have been loved, put aside (time)
I have been crushed by the tumbling tide (time)
And my soul has been psychedelicized (time, time)
Now the time has come (time)
There are things to realize (time)
Time has come today (time)
Time has come today (time)
Time has come today (time)
Time has come today (time)Embed
