Bumming Along (Demo) Lyrics
1-2-3-4

Don't wanna try, but I do, ooh-ooh
Don't want no trouble, but I got, I got you
I'm not the world's first unluckiest guy
I'll pick that  where I belong
I'll be that bum, I'll be bumming along
I'm a cigarette, I'm a snow white girl
Horny and bad to the core
I'm in Vegas playing and I'm having a ball
And baby, I'm up on my love

I'm a-rocking, I'm a-rocking, I don't wanna break
Want a-laughing, want the girls spend more than I make
I'm right mama, daddy you're wrong

I don't wanna try, but I do, ooh-ooh
Don't want no trouble, but I got, I got you
I'm not saying, my goal's too high
I'll pick that  where I belong
I'll be that bum, I'll be strumming that song
I'm a style queen and an alley cat
Puzzling for a hook
In a phone booth with all your talk
Baby don't you leave me stoned
I'm a-rocking, I'm a-rocking, I don't wanna stop
I got new cars new cars new cars got new cars
I'm wrong again, hey, mommy you're wrong

I make mistakes, supposed to be
I'll make it through
I don't want no trouble, but I got, I got youEmbed
