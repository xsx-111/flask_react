You Can Still Change Your Mind Lyrics
It's going to be another hard night, you want to take it all alone
You want to face up to the trouble
You want to face up to your soul
And baby you can have it any way you want it
You just get a little lost from time to time
Sometimes it gets a little crazy somewhere down inside

But you can still change your mind
You can change your feelings
You can change your mind

Everybody wants all the world can give 'em
Everybody wants to get all they can get
Everybody's waiting on something that hasn't come yet
And you can hide it for a little while honey
You can try and just lose it for a while
Then it's going to do something to you somewhere down inside

But you can still change your mind
You can change your feelings
You can change your mind
Yeah, and it gets harder by the minute, girl
Oh, it gets harder every day
Listen to me darling, oh, you don't have to wait
It's alright

You can still change your mind
You can change your feelings
Just hold tight, everything's going to be alright
If you can change your mind
You can change your feelingEmbed
