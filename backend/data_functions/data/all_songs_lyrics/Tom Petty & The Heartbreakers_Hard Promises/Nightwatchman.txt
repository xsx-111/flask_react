Nightwatchman Lyrics
I'm the nightwatchman
I make the rounds
I'm the nightwatchman
I gotta keep my nose to the ground

Oh, this ain't no job for a man like me
Yeah, I got potential, I could be just what you need
Yeah, you got to think about the pros and cons
Listen here, could be right, and you could be wrong

'Cause I'm the nightwatchman
I am security
I'm the nightwatchman
How safe do you wanna be?

I'll just sit around at night and listen to the radio
Yeah, when we get real bored, I might have a little smoke
Yeah, I got a permit to wear this .38
But listen, my life's worth more than the minimum wage

I'm the nightwatchman
I make the rounds
I'm the nightwatchman
I gotta keep my nose to the ground
I'm the nightwatchman
I am security
I'm the nightwatchman
How safe do you wanna be?

I'm the nightwatchman
I'm the nightwatchman
I'm the nightwatchman
How safe do you wanna be?Embed
