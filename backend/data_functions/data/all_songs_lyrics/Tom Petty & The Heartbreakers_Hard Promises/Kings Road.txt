Kings Road Lyrics
Well they put me out on the old Kings Road
I didn't know which way to go
There was people all around wearing funny looking clothes
Some boys, some girls, some I don't know

I didn't know which way to go
I'm a new world boy on the old Kings Road

Rockabilly music was in the air
When I looked in the door, they said come over here
They had socks and shirts and underwear
That I'd seen before, but I don't know where

I didn't know which way to go
I'm a new world boy on the old Kings Road

A Pakistani man said, "Listen here
Let me fix you up before you go back there
You can't get 'em in the USA
Not in New York City, not in West LA."
I thought about it, said I don't know
I'm a new world boy on the old Kings RoadEmbed
