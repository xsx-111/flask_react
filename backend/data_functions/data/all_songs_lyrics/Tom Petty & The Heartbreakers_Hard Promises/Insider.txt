Insider Lyrics
You've got a dangerous background
And everything you've dreamed of
Yeah, you're the dark angel
It don't show when you break up

And I'm the one who oughta know
I'm the one left in the dust
Yeah, I'm the broken-hearted fool
Who was never quite enough

I'm an insider, I've been burned by the fire
And I've had to live with some hard promises
I've crawled through the briars
I'm an insider

It's a circle of deception
It's a hall of strangers
It's a cage without a key
You can feel the danger

And I'm the one who oughta know
I'm the one you couldn't trust
I'm the lonely, silent one
I'm the one left in the dust
I'm an insider, I've been burned by the fire
And I've had to live with some hard promises
I've crawled through the briars
I'm an insider

I'll bet you're his masterpiece
I'll bet you're his self-control
Yeah you'll become his legacy
His quiet world of white and gold

And I'm the one who oughta know
I'm the one you left to rust
Not one of your twisted friends
I'm the one you couldn't love

I'm an insider, I've been burned by the fire
And I've had to live with some hard promises
I've crawled through the briars
I'm an insiderEmbed
