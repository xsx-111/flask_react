Letting You Go Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-whoa
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-oh

I used to think that when this was all over
You might feel different about me
Yeah, I always knew one day you'd come around
Now I wonder if dreams are just dreams

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I'm having trouble letting you go
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I'm having trouble letting you go

Baby look out your window, it's raining on your summer home
You're by the fire keeping warm and dry
There's no one as honest as those in pain
Oh honey can't you see me, will you let me inside?

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I'm having trouble letting you go
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I'm having trouble letting you go
And it's a restless world, an uncertain time
You said hope was getting hard to find
But time rolls on, days go by
What about the broken ones?
What about the lonely ones?
Honey, I'm having trouble letting go

It's off in the distance, somewhere up the road
There's some easy answers for the tears you've cried
And it makes me uneasy, makes me feel different
Do you get scared when you close your eyes?

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I'm having trouble letting you go
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I'm having trouble letting you go
I'm having trouble letting you go

Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-whoa
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-whoa
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-ohEmbed
