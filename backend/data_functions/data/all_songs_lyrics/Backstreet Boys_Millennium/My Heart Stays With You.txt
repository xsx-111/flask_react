My Heart Stays With You Lyrics
You know, sometimes being on the road is rough
Especially loneliness

Girl I miss you and it's only been one day
Since I went away and already I say
I long to kiss you and hold you in my arms
The nights are much too long when you're gone
Baby, that's why

Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
My heart stays with you
After every show
I want to rush over to you
(Over to you)
My heart stays with you

Trust me, when we are apart
I won't break your heart
Wherever you are, I know you feel me
Baby, cause I can feel you too
No matter what you do
I think of you
Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
(Everywhere I go)
My heart stays with you
After every show
I want to rush over to you
(I wanna rush to you)
My heart stays with you

Baby, yeah
When I'm leaving town
Girl it hurts me too, but I've got a job to do
Baby, yeah, I'll be back around
To feel your sweet face, your dear embrace
No one can take your place
I want you to know

Wherever I go, wherever I go
Oh baby, I'll be rushing over to you
Wherever I go

Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
My heart stays with you
(My heart stays with you)
After every show (wherever I go)
I want to rush over to you
My heart stays with you
Wherever I go
Girl, my heart stays with you
(Wherever I go)
My heart stays with you
(Girl, my heart stays with you)
After every show (wherever I go)
I want to rush over to you
My heart stays with you
(My heart stays with you)
Wherever I go
Where I stop the most
My heart stays with you
Whatever I do
I'm gonna rush over to you
My heart stays with youEmbed
