The Perfect Fan Lyrics
It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayer to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years or grace
And it flatters me when I see
A smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan

You showed me how to love
(You showed me how to love)
You showed me how to care
(You showed me how to care)
And you showed me that
You will always (always) be there (be there)
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

You showed me (you showed me!)
When I was young just how to grow (to grow)
You showed me
Everything that I should to know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan
'Cause mom you always were
Mom you always were
(Mom you always were)
You know you always were
'Cause mom you always were
The perfect fan
I love you, mom1Embed
