Back To Your Heart Lyrics
Hmmm-mmh
Oh-oh-oh yeah

It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart?

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, hmmm

I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
'Cause you're love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And make you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only if you tell me girl
The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you
And find a way back to your heart?

Give me one more chance
(Give me one more chance)
To give my love to you
(To give you my love, my love)
'Cause no one on this Earth
Loves you like I do
Tell me...

The words to say
The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do
To get to you (get to you)
And find a way back to your heart? (heart!)
I turn back time
To make you mine
And find a way back to your heart
(Help me find a way back to your heart)
I beg and plead
Fall to my knees (my knees)
To find a way back to your heart
The words to say (these arms of mine)
The road to take (are open wide)
To find a way back to your heart
(From now until the end of time)
What can I do (you are my world)
To get to you (what can I do?)
And find a way back to your heart?
(This heart of mine belongs to you)

Hmmm, back to your heartEmbed
