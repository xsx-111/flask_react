Larger Than Life Lyrics
Ha
Yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha! Woo
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright

All of our time spent
In flashes of light

All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
(Alright)

Lookin' at the crowd
And I see your body sway, come on
Wishin' I could thank you
In a different way, come on
'Cause all of your time spent
Keeps us alive, yeah

All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
(Larger than life)

Ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh (Ha-ha-ha, that's right)
All of your time spent
Keeps us alive (Yeah!)
Every time we're down
You can make it right

All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

(Yeah) Every time we're down
(Yeah) You can make it right
(Yeah) That's what makes you larger than life
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah!
All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger— (That makes you larger than life)
That makes you larger—
That makes you larger than life (Life)2Embed
