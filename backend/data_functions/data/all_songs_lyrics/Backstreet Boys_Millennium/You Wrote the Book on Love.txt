You Wrote the Book on Love Lyrics
When I first met you, my life turned a page
Chapter one was how true love was made
You taught me with your kiss
Things about romance I missed
You knew everything from A to Z
What pleases you and what pleases me
Girl, when you touched me
I began to understand
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
I wanna read every word
So I know everything about you
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of your love
I know, you wrote the book on love

Oh Brian, help me sing

Each time I hold you I find something new
'Cause I know what I love about you
Girl, I discovered you bring out
The lover in me, yeah, yeah
You're like a fire that burns in my soul
Like a volcano I'm ready to blow
'Cause every time I look at you
I feel love I can't explain
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
I wanna read every word
'Til I know everything about you
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book on love, on love

I hear what your heart is saying to me (saying to me)
I see the picture so clearly
I'm thirsty for the knowledge true love brings
When you're near me
Yeah, yeah

You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of you
Oh, you wrote the book
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
And I wanna read every word
'cause you, Baby, you wrote the book
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
I wanna read every word
'Til I know everything about you
Oh, you
You wrote the book on love (you wrote the book on love)
Girl, I just can't get enough of you
Oh you wrote the book on love, on loveEmbed
