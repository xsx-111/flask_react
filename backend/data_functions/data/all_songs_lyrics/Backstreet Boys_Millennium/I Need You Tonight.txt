I Need You Tonight Lyrics
Oh, yeah

Open up your heart to me
And say what's on your mind, oh yes
I know that we have been through so much pain
But I still need you in my life, this time

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you tonight

I figured out what to say to you
Sometimes the words they, they come out so wrong
(Always they do)
And I know in time that you will understand
That what we have is so right, this time

And I need you tonight
I need you right now
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
All those endless times
We tried to make it last forever more
And baby I know
I need you (oh oh, yeah)
I know deep within my heart
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right
I really need you, oh

I need you tonight (I need you, oh I need you baby)
I need you right now (It's got to be this, it's got to be this)
I know deep within my heart
No, it doesn't matter if it's wrong or it's right
All I know is baby
I really need you tonight
