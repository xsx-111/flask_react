If You Knew What I Knew Lyrics
Oh yeah, hey

It's 7 AM, thinking about you
Wondering if the thoughts I'm feeling
You're feeling too
Like a newborn child, soft to the touch
Baby is it possible
To love someone so much?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

If you knew what I knew
You wouldn't say what you said (say what you said)
If you knew what I knew
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady yes (my lady, yes my lady)
If you knew what I knew

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Time passes by, the only tears I cry
Are filled with disillusion of fears I have inside
Like a lost soul
I feel like I'm all alone (all alone)
If only I could feel your pain
Within your heart of stone, oh-oh!

I wish I may, I wish I might
Be that certain someone you wish for every night

If you knew what I knew
You wouldn't say what you said (say what you said)
If you knew what I knew
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady yes
If you knew what I knew

Then you wouldn't have to go away
If you knew what I knew
Then you would be here
To stay right by side always
If you knew what I knew
You wouldn't say what you said (say what you said)
If you knew what I knew
We'd be together instead
Of you breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Over things that aren't true
My lady yes (my lady, yes my lady)

If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
We would be together instead
If you knew what I knew my baby
You would never have said what you said
If you knew what I knew my baby
We would be together instead

Girl if you knew (say what you said)
If you only knew
Girl if you knew (loving you, oh-oh)
Girl if you knew (say what you said)
Girl if you knew (say what you said)Embed
