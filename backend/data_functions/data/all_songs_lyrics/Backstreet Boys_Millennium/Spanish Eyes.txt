Spanish Eyes Lyrics
Here we are in the arms of one another
And we still go on searching for each other
Knowing that hate is wrong
And love is right for us tonight
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to
Look into your Spanish eyes

Let it be (let it be)
If we are nothing more than dreamers
Who believe that we see no one between us
How can they be in my heart (in my heart)
And in my mind? (in my mind)
When all I can find
When I look into your Spanish eyes
I know the reason why I am alive
And the world is so beautiful tonight
It's a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to
Look into your Spanish eyes

I loved you from a distance
Thought I couldn't reach that far
I can't believe how close that we are
When I look into your Spanish eyes
And the world is so beautiful tonight

It's a place I have never been
And it comes from deep within
And it's telling me
That I'm about to win first prize
Knowing all I have to do
Is reach out my hand to you
Anytime I want to
Look into your Spanish eyesEmbed
