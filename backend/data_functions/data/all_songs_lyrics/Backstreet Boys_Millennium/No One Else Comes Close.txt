No One Else Comes Close Lyrics
Oh, oh-no, mmmh, yeah

When we turn down the lights
The two of us alone together
Something's just not right
And girl, you know that
I would never ever let another's touch
Come between the two of us
'Cause no one else will ever take your place

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch, you can do so much
No one else come close

Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh
(No one else comes close)
Mmmh-mmh, mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh (oh-oh)
Mmmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
And when I wake up to
The touch of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come true, oh yeah
Girl, you know I'll always treasure
Every kiss and everyday
I love you girl in every way
And I always will, 'cause in my eyes, oh baby!

No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch, you can do so much
Girl, can't you see that no one else comes close
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You’re so special girl to me
And you’ll always be eternally (baby)
Every time I hold you near
You always say the words I love to hear
Girl, with just a touch, you can do so much
No one else comes close
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh
(No one else comes close)
Mmmh-mmh, mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh (oh girl)
Mmmh-mmh-eh, mmh-mmh (oh-oh-oh)

No one else comes close
Damn, I love youEmbed
