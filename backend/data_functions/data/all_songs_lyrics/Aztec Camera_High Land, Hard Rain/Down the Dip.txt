Down the Dip LyricsChorus:
I put all the love and beauty
In the spirit of the night
And I'm holding my ticket tight
Stupidity and suffering
Are on that ticket, too
And I'm going down the dip with you
I swear I'm touched but then I'm tired
Everyone who tries to tie me
'cause I seem to realize
That my cup overflows
And then I tumble down and take your hand
And no one even knows
With the broken backs
And the pack of macks
Sayin' that's the way it goes
Chorus
'cause I been facin' all the red
Me, I'm chasin' all the orange
And while the bourgeois breed
All you need is greed
And that quiet remembrance day
I'm gonna pull that chain
'til the heavens rain
And I see them wash away
'cause I've bound myself to virtue
But I'm bound to be amused
If it's less than this
You know I can't approve
I've been hangin' with the hollow men
Who never got the groove
And I'm going down the dip with you
