Pillar to Post LyricsOnce I was happy in happy extremes
These bitter tokens are worthless to me
So you appear and say how I've grown
Fill me up with faces I've known
In this light they're far from divine
I'll save them up and spend them when I have time
The salted taste of all your tears and woes
Sent me in haste my melancholy rose
Those tasteless lips were closed
You watched me come, you'll see me go
Once I was happy in happy extremes
Packing my bags for the path of the free
From pillar to post I am driven it seems
These bitter tokens are worthless to me
Just like June the curtains are closed
The ghost of shame he sits here and sighs
I'll love the flames like I've loved the cold
I'll learn to love the life of the "could I, could I, could I"
So I don't cross my fingers any more
You looked for rags and found them at your door
How could you ask for more
Than everything you've heard before?
Once I was happy in happy extremes
Packing my bags for the path of the free
From pillar to post I am driven it seems
These bitter tokens are worthless to me
Once I was happy in happy extremes
Packing my bags for the path of the free
From pillar to post I am driven it seems
These bitter tokens are worthless to me
Once I was happy in happy extremes
Packing my bags for the path of the free
From pillar to post I am driven it seems
These bitter tokens are worthless to meEmbed
