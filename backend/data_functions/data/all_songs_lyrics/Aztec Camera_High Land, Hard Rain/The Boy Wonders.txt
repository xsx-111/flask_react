The Boy Wonders LyricsI brought you some francs
From my travelling chest
You'll spare me the thanks
'Til you know I'm the best
So, come Hogmonay
When love comes in slurs
Resolutions I'll make
And you can label them hers
We threw our hands up high
We nearly touched the sky
We clicked our heels and spat and swore we'd never let it die
All those boy wonders
Sold their medals when they saw this train
Now this boy wonders
When he'll feel the fall of honest rain
I came from high land where the hopefuls have to hesitate
Now this boy wonders
Why the words were never worth the wait
I'm waiting, waiting
In pastel paper, pink over grey
We wrap, wrap, wrap and chuck, chuck away
The poor excuse they peddle as their prose
Dry your tears, tie your tongue
And you're never sixteen
And I'll give you a glimpse
Of the hard and the clean
And my travelling chest
Will be open to you
And boy will you learn
That you haven't a clue
I even asked my best friend
But he could not explain
It hit me when I left him
I felt the rain and called it genius
Called it genius
All those boy wonders
Sold their medals when they saw this train
Now this boy wonders
When he'll feel the fall of honest rain
I came from high land where the hopefuls have to hesitate
Now this boy wonders
Why the words were never worth the waitEmbed
