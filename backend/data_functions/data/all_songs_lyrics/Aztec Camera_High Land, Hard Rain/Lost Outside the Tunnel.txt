Lost Outside the Tunnel Lyrics
I laughed until it got too dark
Somewhere else her voice will bark
Someone else will be involved
Someone stronger still

I'm lost here by myself, and lost outside myself
But we were not to blame, we're not the same

I get up to get back down
People's voices seem to drown me out
When I am in two minds
Who could hide a love so blind?

I'm lost here by myself, and lost outside myself
But we were not to blame, we're not the same

I cared for you in our one dream
A one way rush to what I'd seen
A desert free from threats, mundane
A tunnel for our love
I'm lost here by myself, and lost outside myself
But we were not to blame, we're not the same1Embed
