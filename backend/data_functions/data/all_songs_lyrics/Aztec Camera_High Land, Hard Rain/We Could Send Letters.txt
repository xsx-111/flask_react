We Could Send Letters LyricsYou said you're free, for me that says it all
You're free to push me and I'm free to fall
So if we weaken we can call it stress
You've got my trust, I've got your home address
And now the only chance that we could take
Is the chance that someone else won't make it all come true
We're making tracks that show our touch and go
And now it's touch and come, and you should know
But then four years won't mean that much to me
When I've been smothered in the sympathy you bleed
Just close your eyes again
Until these things get better
You're never far away
But we could send letters
While you were gone I reached another town
They couldn't help me, but they showed me round
And now I've seen what you can't understand
I'd try to lead you but I'd crush your hand
Because the people in the village know
It doesn't matter where you choose to go
The end's the same
I found some blood I wasn't meant to find
I found some feelings that we'd left behind
But then some blood won't mean that much to me
When I've been smothered in the sympathy you bleed
Just close your eyes again
Until these things get better
You're never far away
But we could send letters
I found some blood I wasn't meant to find
I found some feelings that we'd left behind
But then some blood won't mean that much to me
When I've been smothered in the sympathy you bleed
Just close your eyes again
Until these things get better
You're never far away
But we could send lettersEmbed
