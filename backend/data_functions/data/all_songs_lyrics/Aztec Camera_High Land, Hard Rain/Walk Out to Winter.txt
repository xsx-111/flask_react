Walk Out to Winter LyricsWalk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry
You'll wonder why
We met in the summer and walked 'til the fall
And breathless we talked, it was tongues
Despite what they'll say, it wasn't youth, we'd hit the truth
Faces of Strummer that fell from your wall
And nothing was left where they hung
So sweet and bitter, they're what we found
So drink them down and
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry
You'll wonder why
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chance is buried just below the blinding snow
You burn in the breadline and ribbons and all
So walk to winter
You won't be late, you'll always wait
This generation, the walk to the wall
But I'm not angry, get your gear
Get out of here and
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry
You'll wonder why
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chance is buried just below the blinding snow
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
Chill will wake you, high and dry
Walk out to winter, swear I'll be there
You'll find
Snowblind
This is life
