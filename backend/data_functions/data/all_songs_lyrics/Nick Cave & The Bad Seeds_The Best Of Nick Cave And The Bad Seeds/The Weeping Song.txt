The Weeping Song Lyrics
Go son, go down to the water
And see the women weeping there
Then go up into the mountain
The men, they are all weeping too

Father, why are all the women weeping?
They are all weeping for their men
Then why are all the men there weeping?
They are weeping back... at them

This is the weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the men and women sleep
This is the weeping song
But I won't be weeping long

Father, why are all the children weeping?
They are merely crying son
Oh, are they merely crying, father?
Yes, true weeping is yet... to come

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the little children sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
Oh father, tell me, are you weeping?
Your face seems it's wet to touch
Oh, then I'm so sorry, father
I never thought I'd hurt you so much

This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While we rock ourselves to sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
No, I won't be weeping long
No, I won't be weeping long
No, I won't... be weeping long4Embed
