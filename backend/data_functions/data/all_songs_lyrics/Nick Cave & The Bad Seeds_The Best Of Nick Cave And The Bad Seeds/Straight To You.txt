Straight To You Lyrics
All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks

This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running

Straight to you, for I am captured
Straight to you, for I am captured
One more time

Now the light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge

Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running

Straight to you, for I am captured
Straight to you, for I am captured
Once again
Gone are the days of rainbows
And gone are the nights of swinging from the stars

For the sea will swallow up the mountains
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks

Straight at you, but I'll come a-running
Straight to you, but I'll come a-running
One more time

Now heaven has denied us its kingdom
And the saints they're all drunk howling at the moon

And the chariots of angels are colliding
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running

Straight to you, for I am captured
Straight to you, for I am captured
One more time2Embed
