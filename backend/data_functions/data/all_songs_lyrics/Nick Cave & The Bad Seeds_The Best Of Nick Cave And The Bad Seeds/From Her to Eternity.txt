From Her to Eternity Lyrics
Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
You know, she lives in apt. 29
Why? That's the one right up top a mine
I start to cry, I start to cry
Oh, I hear her walkin'
Walkin' barefoot cross the floor-boards
All through this lonesome night
And I hear her crying too
Hot-tears come splashin' on down
Leaking through the cracks
Down upon my face
I catch 'em in my mouth!
Walk and cry, walk and cry

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

I read her diary on her sheets
Scrutinizing every little piece of dirt
Tore out a page and stuffed it inside my shirt
Fled outta the window
And shinning it down the vine
Outta her nightmare
And back into mine
Mine! O Mine!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!
Cry! Cry! Cry!

She's wearing them bloo-stockens, I bet!
And standin' like this with my ear to the ceiling
Listen I know it must sound absurd
But I can hear the most melancholy sound I ever heard!
Walk and cry, kneel and cry!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

Oh tell me why? Why? Why?
Why the ceiling still shakes?
Why the fixtures turn to serpents snakes?
This desire to possess her is a wound
And it's naggin' at me like a shrew
But I know, that to possess her
Is, therefore, not to desire her
O o o then ya know
That lil girl would just have to go!
Go! Go!
From her to eternity!4Embed
