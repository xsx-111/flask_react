Nah! Lyrics
Ohh
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh

I thought I might begin by filling you in
In case you didn't already know
I'll never forget how you got up and left
In fact, it was downright pretty low
There ain't no way I wanna
You know I ain't gonna
Take you back, so don't even try
You can beg, you can plead
You can sweat, you can bleed
Too bad I could care if you cry

That's it! (That's all!)
We had fun (Had a ball)
It was good while it lasted
But now I'm past it
(It was short!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again? Nah!
You won't find me
Naked and cold, justa sittin' on the doctor's table
Waitin' to be told justa why
I'm no longer able to feel my heart beatin'
Give me a good reason why
I kinda went numb
Just around about the time you told me you were movin' on
And you said that you were gonna phone me
It's been so long and there ain't nothin' wrong with the line

It's too late to regret it
But you're the one who said it
We're better off being apart
I hate to be a downer
But don't bother comin' 'round here
'Cause I won't have a change of heart (A change of heart)

That's it! (That's all!)
We had fun (Had a ball)
It was good while it lasted
But now I'm past it
(It was short!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again? Nah!
You won't find me
Naked and cold, justa sittin' on the doctor's table
Waitin' to be told justa why
I'm no longer able to feel my heart beatin'
Give me a good reason why
I kinda went numb
Just around about the time you told me you were movin' on
And you said that you were gonna phone me
It's been so long and there ain't nothin' wrong with the line

Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah
Ha
Hey, yeah, yeah

Well, I hope you learned a lesson
'Cause you'll never be messing
With my head again the way that you did
It was never gonna work; you were too much of a jerk
I'm finally fed up with it
That's it! (That's all!)
We had fun (Had a ball)
It was good while it lasted
But now I'm past it
(It was short!) It was sweet
Sure you swept me off my feet
I miss you now and then
But would I do it all again? Nah!

You won't find me
Naked and cold, justa sittin' on the doctor's table
Waitin' to be told justa why
I'm no longer able to feel my heart beatin'
Give me a good reason why
I kinda went numb
Just around about the time you told me you were movin' on
And you said that you were gonna phone me
It's been so long and there ain't nothin' wrong with the line

Oh, nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah
Nah, nah, nah nah
Oh
Oh, nah, nah3Embed
