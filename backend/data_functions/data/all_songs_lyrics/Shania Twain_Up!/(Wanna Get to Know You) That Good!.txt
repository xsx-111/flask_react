(Wanna Get to Know You) That Good! Lyrics
Oh
Mmm, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

I'll be there when you're sleepin'
And every hour you're awake
I wanna hear your secrets
Wanna share your worries
Wanna go the deepest
I don't wanna hurry
I wanna take a lifetime
To memorize your face
Wanna hold you closer; kiss you longer
Wanna hear your heartbeat
Stronger and stronger

Wanna know you all over
Till I know you by heart
Gotta know you with all that I got

I wanna know you that good
Like no one knows you
Gonna reach way down deep in your mind
I wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know
Wanna get to know you that good
Gonna know you right through
You know I want to
So badly, it hurts all the time
I wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know you that good
Yeah, I wanna know you that good
Every feel of your fingers
Every curl in your hair
Don't wanna miss a minute
Wanna be right in it
Do everything you're doing
Go everywhere you're going

Wanna know you all over
Till I know you by heart
Gotta know you with all that I got

I wanna know you that good
Like no one knows you
Gonna reach way down deep in your mind
I wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know
Wanna get to know you that good

Oh
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh
Oh, wanna know you that good
Wanna know your emotions
Wanna taste every tear
I wanna hear you breathing
Feel what you're feeling
I wanna get to know

Know you that good
Like no one knows you
Gonna reach way down deep in your mind
I wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know
I wanna get to know you
Wanna get to know
I wanna get to know you
To know you
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I wanna know you by heart
Oh, I wanna know you that goodEmbed
