What a Way to Wanna Be! Lyrics
I don't wanna wear that
It only makes me look fat
Time to tone my thighs, gotta lose another size, yeah
What a way to wanna be
Exfoliate, look great
Feel guilty 'bout what you ate
You're buying all the books
To learn the latest looks, yeah
What a way to wanna be

We like to buy, we like to spend
To keep up with the latest trend
But we don't get no satisfaction
Living like a slave to fashion
No more thinking for yourself
Just get it off a shelf

Oh-oh, why be perfect?
No, oh, it's not worth it
Don't be so obsessed
C'mon, give it a rest
This is not some contest, just do your best
'Cause nobody's perfect
What a way to wanna be
Moisturize, exercise
Erase the Rings around your eyes
Cover what you can
Get a Coppertone tan, yeah
What a way to wanna be (Wanna be)
Stabilize the mood you're in
You're back on diet food again
Bigger is the best, but only in the chest, yeah
What a way to wanna be (Wanna be)

We like to buy, we like to spend
To keep up with the latest trend
But we don't get no satisfaction
Living like a slave to fashion
No more thinking for yourself
Just get it off a shelf

Oh-oh, why be perfect?
No, oh, it's not worth it
Don't be so obsessed
C'mon, give it a rest
This is not some contest, just do your best
'Cause nobody's perfect
What a way to wanna be
It's so very unnecessary
Yeah, how insane to be so vain
It's so synthetic, I just don't get it
I don't get it, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't be so obsessed
C'mon, give it a rest
This is not some contest, just do your best
'Cause no-o-body's perfect

Oh, nobody's perfect
No, oh, it's not worth it
Don't be so obsessed (Nobody's perfect)
This is not some contest (Nobody's perfect)
What a way to wanna beEmbed
