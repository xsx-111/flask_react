Juanita Lyrics
Hey
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh

She is the restless river running through my veins
She rides without the reins
Her name's Juanita
She lives in the heart of every woman in the world
Within' the reach of every girl who wants to meet her

(She's gonna be riding through)
Her name's Juanita
(She's gonna be riding free) She's riding free
(She's gonna be inside of you, gonna be inside of me)
She's inside of you and inside of me

Oh, go with her, flow with her
Dream with her, scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
If you can find her and free her
Juanita will unchain your heart
When someone tries to take away the freedom of your choice
To take away your voice, that's when you need her
She's there if you dare to give our broken wings a try
Come on and take a leap and fly, and you can be her (Be her)

(She's gonna be riding through)
Oh Juanita
(She's gonna be riding free) Riding free
(She's gonna be part of you, and a part of me)
She's a part of you and a part of me, yeah

Oh, go with her, flow with her
Yeah, dream with her, scream with her
Oh, let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
If you can find her and free her
Juanita will unchain your heart
Ooh

Oh, Juanita
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hmm, yeah
Ahh, ohh
Oh, go with her, flow with her
Dream with her, scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
Oh, go with her, flow with her
Oh, dream with her, scream with her
Let her take over, or just get to know her
Be everything you can be
Oh, if you can find her and free her
Juanita will unchain your heartEmbed
