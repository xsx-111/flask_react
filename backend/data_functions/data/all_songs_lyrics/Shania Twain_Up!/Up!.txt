Up! Lyrics
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up
I'm goin' up, up, up, up

It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothing's coming easily

Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
Not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear

Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
There's no way but up from here
Even something as simple as
Forgetting to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh

Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
There's no way but up from here

Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When everything is goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holding on
It's about as bad as it could be (Bad as it could be)
Seems everybody's bugging me (Everybody's bugging me)
Like nothing wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothing's coming easily
Oh, oh, oh, oh

And up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Up, up, up
Where the clouds gonna clear
Up, up, up
There's no way but up from here
Up, up, up, ooh
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
Up, up, up, up, I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
Ohh

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
