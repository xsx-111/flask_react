Waiter! Bring Me Water! Lyrics
Yeah

He took me to our favorite spot
A place we go to hang a lot
Something seemed to catch his eye
Over my shoulder
Over my shoulder
I turned around to see what's up
A pretty young thing sure enough
She was new, he wanted to
Know her
Know her

Oh, yeah
Then she flicked her hair (Yeah)
Oh, yeah, he began to stare

Waiter! (Waiter!) Bring me water!
I gotta make him keep his cool
(Waiter!) Bring me water!
He's acting like a fool
(Waiter!) Bring me water!
Uh, oh
I did my best to block his view
But it was like he could see through me
I just knew he wanted to
Know her
Know her

Oh, yeah, I ain't getting nowhere (Yeah)
Oh, yeah, she's still standing there

Waiter! (Waiter!) Bring me water!
I gotta make him keep his cool
(Waiter!) Bring me water!
He's acting like a fool
(Waiter!) Bring me water!
Ohh, yeah
Hah!

There's gotta be a way to cool this clown
He's starting to embarrass me
I may even have to hose him down
Bring me water!
I don't know what he finds so distracting
What's so hot about her
I really don't like the way he's acting
Bring me water!
Bring it on
Oh
What's so hot about her?
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Waiter!) Bring me water!
I gotta make him keep his cool
(Waiter!) Bring me water!
Send him back to school
(Waiter!) Bring me water!
He's acting like a fool
(Waiter!) Bring me water!
Waiter! Bring me water!Embed
