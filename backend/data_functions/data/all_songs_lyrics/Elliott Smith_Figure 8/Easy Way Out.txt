Easy Way Out Lyrics
You’ll take advantage ’til you think you’re being used
Cause without an enemy your anger gets confused
And I got stuck on a side you know I never chose
But it’s all about taking the easy way out for you, I suppose

There’s no escape for you, except in someone else
Although you’ve already disappeared within yourself
The invisible man, who’s always changing clothes
It’s all about taking the easy way out for you, I suppose

While I watch you making mistakes
I wish you luck, I really do
With the problem, with the puzzle
Whatever’s left of you

I heard you found another audience to bore
A creative thinker who imagined you were more
A new body for you to push around and pose
It’s all about taking the easy way out for you, I suppose
It’s all about taking the easy way out for you, I suppose2Embed
