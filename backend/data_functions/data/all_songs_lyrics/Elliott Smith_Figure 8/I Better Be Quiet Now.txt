I Better Be Quiet Now Lyrics
Wish you gave me your number
Wish I could call you today
Just to hear a voice
I got a long way to go, I'm getting further away

If I didn't know the difference
Living alone would probably be okay
It wouldn't be lonely
I got a long way to go, I'm getting further away

A lot of hours to occupy, it was easy when I didn't know you yet
Things I'd have to forget
But I better be quiet now, I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on and getting upset

Maybe I have a problem
But that's not what I wanted to say
I'd prefer to say nothing
I got a long way to go, I'm getting further away

Had a dream as an army man with an order just to march in my place
While a dead enemy screams in my face
But I better be quiet now, I'm tired of wasting my breath
Carrying on, not over it yet
Wish I knew what you're doing
And why you want to do it this way
So I can't go the distance
I got a long way to go, I'm getting further away
I got a long way to go, I'm getting further away4Embed
