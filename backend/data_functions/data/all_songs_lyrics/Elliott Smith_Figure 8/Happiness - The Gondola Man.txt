Happiness / The Gondola Man Lyrics
Activity's killing the actor
And a cop's standing out in the road
Turning traffic away

There was nothing she could do until after
When his body'd been buried below
Way back in the day

Oh my, nothing else could have been done
Made his life a lie so
He might never have to know anyone
Made his life the lie you know

I told him that he shouldn't upset her (ooh)
And that he'd only be making it worse involving somebody else (ooh)
But I knew that he'd never forget her (ooh)
While her memory worked in reverse to keep her safe from herself (ooh)

And oh my, nothing else could have been done
She made her life a lie so (ooh)
She might never have to know anyone
Made her life the lie you know
What I used to be
Will pass away and then you'll see
That all I want now
Is happiness for you and me
What I used to be
Will pass away and then you'll see
That all I want now
Is happiness for you and me
What I used to be
Will pass away and then you'll see
That all I want now
Is happiness for you and me
All I want now is happiness for you and me2Embed
