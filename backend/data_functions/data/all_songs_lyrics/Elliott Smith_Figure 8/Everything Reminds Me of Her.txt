Everything Reminds Me of Her Lyrics
I never really had a problem because of leaving
But everything reminds me of her this evening
So if I seem a little out of it, sorry
But why should I lie? Everything reminds me of her

The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette
Of the sun on the steeple
And I gotta hear the same sermon
All the time now from you people:

'Why are you staring into outer space, crying?
Just because you came across it, and lost it'
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her5Embed
