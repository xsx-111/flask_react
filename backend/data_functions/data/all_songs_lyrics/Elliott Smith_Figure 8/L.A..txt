L.A. Lyrics
The gentleman's in the lane
Spinning his hat on a cane
Stepping out
Out for change
Good morning all, it's a beautiful day
The generals are winning a war
Seemed suicidal before
You came along, now
Now I'll protect you
Long as you stay

L.A
Morning had to come
I'd be walking in the sun
Living in the day
But last night I was about to throw it all away

If patience started a band
I'd be her biggest fan
Look at me, I'm talking to you
I don't want the lead in your play
The star's just a part of the scene
The gentleman in green
Paying off out on the street
I can't go home
It's not on my way

L.A
Things I've never done
Cars parked in the sun
Living in the day
But last night I was about to throw it all away
Last night I was about to throw it all away
Last night I was about to throw it all away
Last night I was about to throw it all away1Embed
