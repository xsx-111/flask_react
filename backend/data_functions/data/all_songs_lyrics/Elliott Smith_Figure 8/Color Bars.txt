Color Bars Lyrics
I see color bars when I come
Sgt. Rock broke the key off in the lock
To where I come from
Sir, no sir, we have no power in the air
The battle's on the ground
Laying low again, high on the sound

Bruno S. is a man to me
You're just some dude with a stilted attitude
That you learned from TV
You'll undo, but I'll be connecting everything
The traffic in my town
Riding high again, high on the sound

Everyone wants me to ride into the sun
But I ain't gonna go down
Laying low again, high on the sound1Embed
