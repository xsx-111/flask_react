In the Lost and Found (Honky Bach) / The Roost Lyrics
He held his breath to hold your hand
To walk the stair steps in pairs
Climbing up a slippery slope
I'm in love, love I hope

Don't go home, Angelina
Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and found

He kissed you quick, feeling weird
Lonely leered, and disappeared
This is such a simple place
The passing time can't erase

Don't go home, Angelina
Paint tomorrow blue

Day breaks but every morning when he wakes he thinks of you

I'm alone, but that's okay
I don't mind most of the time
I don't feel afraid to die
She was here, passing by
Don't go home, Angelina
Stay with me, hanging around in the lost and foundEmbed
