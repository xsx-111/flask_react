Pretty Mary Kay Lyrics
Almost forgot, started to say
Rode into the sun, past everyone
Hallelujah, pretty Mary K

I found faith in the infirmary
There's a soldier lying in bed
With a wound to the head
Calling out to pretty Mary K
Here's what you get
For things that haven't happened yet

I happened upon pretty Mary K
But a soldier to the fore waved you away
I walk round the dock
And talk to St. James
Though I'm already done

And ask everyone
"Have you seen her?"
Pretty Mary K
Have you seen her?
Pretty Mary KEmbed
