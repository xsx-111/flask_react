Figure 8 Lyrics
Figure eight is double four
Figure four is half of eight
If you skate you would be great
If you could make a figure eight
That's a circle that turns round upon itself

Figure eight is two times four
Four times four is two times eight
If you skate upon thin ice
You'd be wise if you thought twice
Before you made another single moveEmbed
