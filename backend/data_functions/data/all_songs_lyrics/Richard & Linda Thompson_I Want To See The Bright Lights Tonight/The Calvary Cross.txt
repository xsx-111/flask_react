The Calvary Cross Lyrics
I was under the Calvary Cross
The pale-faced lady, she said to me
I've watched you with my one green eye
I'll hurt you till you need me

You scuff your heels and you spit on your shoes
You do nothing with reason
One day you catch a train
Never leaves the station

Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me

Now you can make believe on your tin whistle
Ah, and you can be my broom boy
Scrub me till I shine in the dark
I'll be your light till doomsday

Oh, it's a black cat cross your path
And why don't you follow?
My claw's in you and my light's in you
This is your first day of sorrow
Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for meEmbed
