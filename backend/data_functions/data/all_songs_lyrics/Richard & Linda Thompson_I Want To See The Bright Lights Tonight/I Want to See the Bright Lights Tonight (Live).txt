I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight (Live) Lyrics
I'm so tired of working every day
Now the weekend's come I'm gonna throw my troubles away
If you've got the cab fare, mister, you'll do all right
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Meet me at the station, don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

There's crazy people running all over town
There's a silver band just marching up and down
And the big boys are all spoiling for a fight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Oh meet me at the station, don't be late
I need to spend some monеy and it just won't wait
Take me to the dancе and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

A couple of drunken nights rolling on the, rolling on the floor
Is just the kind of mess I'm looking for
Well I'm gonna dream till Monday comes in sight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
Meet me at the station, don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
Oh take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Okay, this is an, this is an old Buck Owens song. It's called Together Again. Or Untogether Again. Embed
