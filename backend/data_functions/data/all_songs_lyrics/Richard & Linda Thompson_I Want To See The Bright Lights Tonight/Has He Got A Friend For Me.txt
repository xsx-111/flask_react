Has He Got A Friend For Me Lyrics
Saturday night and I'm all alone
No ring on the doorbell, no ring on the phone
And nobody wants to know anyone lonely like me

Your boyfriend's good looking, he's got it all there
Looks like God made him with something to spare
You look good together scurrying off down the street

Has he got a friend?
Has he got a friend for me?
Has he got a friend?
Has he got a friend for me?

He's got the haunt of the sea in his eyes
He wouldn't notice me passing by
I could be in the gutter or dangling down from a tree

If you know someone who is graceful and wise
Doesn't mind girls who are clumsy and shy
I don't mind going with someone that I've never seen
Has he got a friend?
Has he got a friend for me?
Has he got a friend?
Has he got a friend for me?Embed
