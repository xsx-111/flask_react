The Calvary Cross (Live at the Roundhouse) Lyrics
I was under the Calvary Cross
Pale-faced lady, she said to me
I've watched you with my one green eye
And I'll hurt you till you need me

Scuff your heels and you spit on your shoes
Ah, you do nothing with reason
One day you catch a train
Never leaves the station

Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me

Now you can make believe on your tin whistle
And you can be my broom boy
You can scrub me till I shine in the dark
But I'll be your light till doomsday

It's a black cat cross your path
And why don't you follow?
My claw's in you and my light's in you
Oh, this is your first day of sorrow
Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for meEmbed
