Together Again (Live) Lyrics
Together again, my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights have all passed away
The key to my heart you now hold in your hand
And nothing else matters, we're together again

Together again all the grey skies are gone
You're back in my arms and that's where you belong
The key to my heart you now hold in your hand
And nothing else matters, we're together again
And nothing else matters, we're together againEmbed
