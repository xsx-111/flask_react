Mystery Title LyricsHad to leave in a hurry, couldn't wait to get away
It's not a case of being sorry, it's the price I have to pay
And confidentially I think it's sad, but there's nothing I can do
If the road leads to the highway, well, I've got to move
I've got to move
Got to change my arrangements, heed the word, I'm on my way
I can't stand it much longer, got to move, all I can say
I didn't mean to let you down, but there's nothing I can do
Road leads to the highway, well I'm hot, I've got to move
I'm hot, I've got to move
Talk of strain in relations of the days of being abused
You told me never to worry, I'll never ask you to
Categorically I have to say it's as much as I could do
To sit around here waiting, when I'm hot, I've got to move
Oh, sometimes it's lonely
Oh, but it's the only way I know
And the road is calling me on
Ooh baby babe, I've got to move, yes
Ooh, now baby baby, I've got to leave, yeah
And when I think back
I smile and know that, win or lose
That the road is calling me on
Ooh, baby baby, I've got to move, yes
Ooh, baby babe, I've got to move, yeah
There's a man and a suitcase standing in a darkened room
Message light is burning and the blinds are always drawn
It's been a while since the last time, never should come back too soon
Behind, the door is slamming, when he's hot, he's got to move
When he's hot, he's got to move
Yes, he's got to move

Sometimes, it’s lonely, yeah
Sometimes, it’s lonely, yeah yeah yeah
That’s right, yes yes, that’s right
Yes, that’s right
Ooh, yes, you know it's right, you know it's right
You know it's right, you know it's right
You know it's right, you know it's rightEmbed
