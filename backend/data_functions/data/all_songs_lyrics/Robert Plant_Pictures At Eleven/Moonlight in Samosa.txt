Moonlight in Samosa LyricsTime and again, I see you walking down the street
Over and over, just like before
Once in a while, you stop and say hello to me
Just like you used to do before
Time and again, it's like we were in love and then
Over and over, nobody keeping score
Once in a while, I think you notice when I smile
That love still lingers in my eye
It can't go wrong
It can't go wrong
It lingers on
It lingers on
Day after day, I turn it over in my mind
Dream after dream, it's hard to tell you how I find
Out of the blue, I'm suddenly so close to you
Despite the years that I've been gone
Will you stop?
Will you wait a minute?
Please remember
Can you stop?
Can you just give me
One minute to explain?
I will not cause a fuss
I will not rock the boat
Believe me, darling
Ooh, what is, what was
It's all the same
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, ohEmbed
