Worse Than Detroit LyricsOperator
Give me Central, Central
Help me try to get my baby on the line
Information
Hear me calling, calling
Find that number, give it to me one more time
It's been so long since I saw her
Anything I'd give to hear the little girl of mine
Whatever it takes
Got to make it, make it
Please connect me now before I lose my mind
Because I don't know, no, I don't know what I'm gonna do
No, I don't know, no, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Tastes so good
Sweet as honey, honey
All she carries is impossible to use
It's built for speed, man
Watch her coming, coming
Moves so fast in someone else's shoes
Looks so fine, lord
Watch them running
Anything she wants, you feel obliged to do
Keep your hands
In your pockets
She can shift more gold than the king of Peru
But I don't know, no, I don't know what I'm gonna do
No, I don't know, no, I don't know what I'm gonna do
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody yeah
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody yeah
Man drink whisky, drive him crazy in time
Woman sits and cries as day follow day
Man need lovin', keep him happy sometime
Woman gets some when the honeydripper's on his way
But I don't know, no, I don't know
What I'm gonna do
But I don't know, but I don't know, I don't know
No, I don't know, no, I don't know, no, I don't know
Yes, no, yes, no, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah, oh
.. She can do it, she can do it, she can do it, babe
Oh, yes, she's sweet as honey, sweet as honey
Sweet as honey, ooh yeahEmbed
