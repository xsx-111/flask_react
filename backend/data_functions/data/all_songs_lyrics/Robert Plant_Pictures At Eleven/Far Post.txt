Far Post LyricsNo talk of love between us, some things better left unsaid
Talk of the plans move through my head, through my head
No talk of tears and pain, it's been so long
I really don't know your name
It's the rules of the game
Wheels keep turning round and round
Years keep spinning round and round
No words assured without a trace, like the shadows in the sun
No room for fools who rush, it's all been done
You've got new friend, a new pool
And you know they're putting troubles to the vote
Tired eyes slow dance in the sunlight, it's all a joke
Wheels keep spinning round and round
Years keep spinning round and round
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, yeah
With the passing of your time
Though you seldom come to mind
I remember the day
Sure as winter follows fall
Sure as maybe I will call
Just remember the day
Far off the hazy day, long gone, the lingering gray
Chill winds blow cold around the fires of love
Farewell the call to arms, release the captive heart
Time's keeper clouds the skyline on the last resort
Wheels keep spinning round and round
Years keep spinning round and round
Ooh yeah
With the passing of your time
Though you seldom come to mind
I remember
Sure as winter follows fall
Sure as maybe I will call
Just rememberEmbed
