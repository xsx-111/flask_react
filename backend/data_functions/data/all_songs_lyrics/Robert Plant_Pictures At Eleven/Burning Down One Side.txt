Burning Down One Side LyricsSlipped through the window by the back door
Caught short in transit with my love
Jumped up, fell back, cut off from romance
How could I fall without a shove?
Tip-toed like thunder on my feeling
You rock me gently with your sighs
My knees are weak, my head is reeling
Consumed by the fire in your eyes
Don'tcha know why?
Goodness no! Why?
Stepped in and shattered my defenses
Just playing hooky with my heart
Slipped through the window by the back door
And took the keys to my poor heart
Yes, my poor heart
Oh!
Try as I might, try as I may
Yes, I'll try anything to make you stay
'Cause I need your love
Yes, I need you, love
Yes, I need your love
Oh, I need you, love
I'm looking high, I'm looking low
Can't find where did my baby go
Gotta find out why she ran away
I don't know, where did my baby stay?
Try as I might, try as I may
I'll try anything to make you stay
Fire down the Boulevard d'Amour
Shot through the neon in the night
Hotfoot through alleys, check the doorways
Try that old parking lot on Ninth
There's three-course kissing in the same place
Oh, but that don't help me out no more
I've been away so long, I'm dreaming
Little girl, ain't I seen you before?
(Oh, little girl)Embed
