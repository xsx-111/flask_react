Fat Lip LyricsI can't believe it, it happens each day
It's ill-conceived, just throw it away
To watch a wave, time slipping away
It won't be long now
I hold a moment, an hour sublime
It's my belief, dancing with time
To watch the wave, time slipping away
It won't be long now
Down at the landing where the boats come in
People stand in line
Close by the water where the fishes swim
Round and round to pass the time
But you know it's gonna get there
Around and around, it's gonna spin
Out at the airport where the planes come in
People buzzing like flies
Out at the airport where the planes come in
The hours go flashing by
But you know it's gonna get there
Around and around, it's gonna spin
Down at the station where the trains come in
Never make it on time
Down at the station where the trains come in
See my friends all walk the line
But you know they're gonna get there
Around and around, they're gonna spin
View it all with suspicion
View it all and despise
View it all with suspicion
View it all with my eyesEmbed
