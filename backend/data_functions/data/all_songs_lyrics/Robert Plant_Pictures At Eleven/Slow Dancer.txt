Slow Dancer LyricsSlow
Slow dancer
Ooh, no answers
For you
New moves to see
Oh, fast talkers
In dark corners
For you
New words to hear
Oh, sly glances
Oh, half chances
For you
The eye that sees
When the sun slips from the day
And the coolness brings relief
There's no torment 'neath the stars
In the stillness of the night
When the swirling has to cease
Behind the safety of the veil
Ooh yeah
Now
In high places
Darkened faces
So indifferent
In days to be
Oh, lost race
No losers
Only winners
Return to see
New order
Can't be altered
When the eyes
Refuse to see
When the sun slips from the day
And the coolness brings relief
There's no torment 'neath the stars
In the stillness of the night
When the swirling has to cease
Behind the safety of the veil

(Ah-ah)
Ah-ah ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ah ah-ah
Now now now now!
Soft, soft spoken
Never could get broken
Awaiting the call that frees
Slow burning
Oh, Turn with yearning
Complacence burns down on me
Hearts leaping
Hopes been reaching
To the heights, to the heights
The signs to see
Oh, baby
I should say now, baby baby baby
In the darkness
Oh Lord, so good
Oh Lord, so fine
In the darkness
In the darkness
Yes, yes yes yes
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, no no no 
Feels good, oh yes
Please, please, please
So good, so good, so good, my babyEmbed
