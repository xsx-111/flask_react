Pledge Pin LyricsWatch them go
'Cause one by one, they rise to fall
Hearts in tow
It's just a game, she's only having fun
She laughs and turns away
Surprised, she mocks it all the same
Tonight's the loss, tomorrow's gain
And in the end, it's so
Stand in line
As one by one, they march in time
In the wing
Stand and watch these foolish things go by
Just preparing for the play
Aloof, she moves
The confidante with practiced step
Maribel, she executes her role, role
As the cavalcade begins to thin
Do you stop and look around?
Free to choose, but not to win
You're just too late, your show is at the end
Now you're the victim of your game
Through your fingers, watch them slip
Familiar rules just hit and miss
For the one who never showsEmbed
