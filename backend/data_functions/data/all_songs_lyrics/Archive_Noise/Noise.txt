Noise LyricsStay in your coma, in your own frustration
Lip sinking haircut, blow me away
Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Suffocate in this noise, colder
It means so much to me
Nostalgia makes your living so easy
Luddites make it easy for me
Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Suffocate in this noise, colder
It means so much to me
To me
To me
To me
To me
To me
To me
To me
Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Cause I'd rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise
Rather be in this noise
Repetition baby
Machine is taking over
Dance with me baby
The future is here
Scientific baby
Waltz hand in hand
Scientific baby
Technological man
Would you rather be in this noise?
Celebrate in this noise, colder?
It means so much to me
Would you rather be in this noise?
Celebrate in this noise, colder?
It means so much to me
Repetition baby
There's no escape from me here
Run run baby
Try to run from me here
Reconciliation
Welcome back here
Fun fun fun fun fun!
Get your fun from us here
Would you rather be in this noise?
Celebrate in this noise, colder?
It means so much to me
Would you rather be in this noise?
Celebrate in this noise, colder?
It means so much to me
It means so much to me
It means so much to me
It means so much to me
It means so much to me
It means so much to meEmbed
