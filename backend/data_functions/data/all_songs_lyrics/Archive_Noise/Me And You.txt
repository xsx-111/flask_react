Me And You LyricsI'm beside myself
But does it matter
It's good to hear you're doing well
But does it matter
I'm beside myself
But does it matter
It's good to hear you're doing well
But does it matter
In the end
It's about me and you
The hardest part
Cos it's about me and you
The hardest part
It's about me and you
The hardest part is letting you go
It's about me and you
The hardest part
Thinking all about me and you
And if it breaks down
I will shut downEmbed
