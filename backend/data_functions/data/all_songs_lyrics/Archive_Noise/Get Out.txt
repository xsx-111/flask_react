Get Out LyricsGet out
Get out
Cos I don't know what you're about
Get out
Get out
Cos I don't know what you're thinking about
Something says leave
Just leave
Cos I don't like you looking at me
I don't want you here
I don't want you near
Cos your face just gives me the fear
Blow out
Blow out
Cos I don't believe you're who you are
And who you said to me
No you're out
Get out
I don't wanna know what your about
Get out (Repeat x 8)
Out the door
Out the door
You've become an intolerable bore
Disappear
Disappear
Before your voice it brings me to tears
Don't want you here
Don't want you near
Cos I think you're fucking weird
Blow out
Blow out
I can't stand to see your face
I wish you'd go some other place
Get out
Get out
I don't want you hanging about
Get out (Repeat x 10)Embed
