Waste LyricsTalk to me
I haven't said a word in days
Please talk to me
And I can tell you of my ways
In which I numb myself
In which I numb myself
Drink with me
I will talk of things I want
To do in life but know I can't
Find the energy
Find the energy
Find the energy
Find the energy
Time has come
Come to me at such a speed
And given me the time I need
To waste
Waste on you, I've got time to waste on you
Waste on you, I've got time to waste on you
Waste on you, I've got time to waste on you
On you
On and on and on and on with you
Waste on you, I've got time to waste on you
Waste on you, I've got time to waste on you
On you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with you
On and on and on and on with youEmbed
