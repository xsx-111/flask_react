Love Song LyricsAll this time I'm distracted from the world
The world outside of your arms
All I need is here
Try and find, a way to say the things
The things I feel when you smile
They take away my words
You know, that people come and go
It's here for me
When things in life run me down
All I need is you
You wanted a love song
You asked for a love song
You wanted a love song from me
You asked for a love song from me
Now there's a love song for you
Yeah, I know, I don't hear you, I don't see you, I can't feel you
You know, it's always my fault, communication is such a let down
I ain't proud of my behaviour
I thank the lord, you're still here
I thank the lord, you're still here
I thank the lord, you're still here
I thank the lord, you're still here
I thank the lord, you're still here
I thank the lord, you're still here
Yeah I know that I push you
Yeah I know that I push you
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know that I push you
I know that I push you
I know that I push you
I know that I push you
I know that I push you
I know that I push you
I know that I push you
I know that I push you
Try and find, a way to say the things
The things I feel when you smile
They take away my words
You know, that people come and go
You wanted a love song from me
You asked for a love song from me
Now there's a love song for youEmbed
