Wild Saxaphone LyricsI wanna mambo, jambo, do my number
Hold my baby all the summer
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
I wanna bip it, bop it, really rock it
Oooooh, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
I wanna rock rock rock
Roll roll roll
Bop bop bop
I wanna rip it, rock it, really bop it
Oooooh, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
I wanna rock rock rock
Roll roll roll
Bop man bop
I wanna rip it, rock it, really bop it
Yeah, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
I wanna mambo, jambo, do my number
Hold my baby all the summer
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
I wanna rock rock rock
Roll roll roll
Bop man bop
I wanna flip it, flop it, really bop it
Aaaaah, Davy Crockett
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
Every time I hear that wild saxophone
Every time I hear that wild saxophoneEmbed
