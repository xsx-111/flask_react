My One Desire LyricsI wanna walk with you, talk with you all night long
And there's no better time than tonight
When I get you under the stars above
Put your lips to mine with your kiss of fire. Oh yeah
Just to be with you baby tonight is my one desire
I want to date with you would be great with you baby tonight
When I get you into my arms tonight everything's gonna turn out right
Put your lips to mine with your kiss of fire. Oh yeah
Just to be with you baby tonight is my one desire
Well all the time I waisted baby be my steady date
I want to make up for lost time. Tonight I just can't wait
Put your lips to mine with your kiss of fire. Oh yeah
Just to be with you baby tonight is my one desire
Well all the time I waisted baby be my steady date
I want to make up for lost time. Tonight I just can't wait
Put your lips to mine with your kiss of fire. Oh yeah
Just to be with you baby tonight is my one desire
Well all the time I waisted baby be my steady date
I want to make up for lost time. Tonight I just can't wait
Put your lips to mine with your kiss of fire. Oh yeah
