Jeanie, Jeanie, Jeanie LyricsWell, Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, come and dance with me
There's a real wild party and the booze is free
First we'll fuck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tough luck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll rock
Rock and roll, well, do what you're told
Well, I live in Bellmore, U. S. A
Well, I rock all night and I sleep all day
First we'll fuck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tough luck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll rock
Rock and roll, well do what you're told
Baby, baby, you will have to wait
I'll be ready at eight
I keep a knockin' at your front door
I wanted you alone till I get some more
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, got my blue suede shoes on
Got a pink carnation and my black slacks too
First we'll fuck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tough luck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll rock
Rock and roll, well, do what you're told
Baby, baby, you will have to wait
I'll be ready at eight
I keep a knockin' at your front door
I wanted you alone till I get some more
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, come and dance with me
There's a real wild party and the booze is free
First we'll fuck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tough luck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we'll rock
Rock and roll, well, do what you're toldEmbed
