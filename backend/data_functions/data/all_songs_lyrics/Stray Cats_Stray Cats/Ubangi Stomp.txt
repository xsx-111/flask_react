Ubangi Stomp LyricsOoooOoooOooo-ah!
Well I rocked over Italy and I rocked over Spain
Rocked in Memphis, it was all the same
'Till I rocked to Africa and rolled off the ship
Seen them natives do an odd looking skip
Parted the weeds and looked over the swamp
And I seen them cats doing the Ubangi Stomp
Ubangi stomp, reggae roll, beats any stomp that you ever been told
Ubangi stomp, Ubangi style, when it hits it drives them Ubangi's wild
Well I looked up the chief he invited me in
He said, Hey big jam session's about to begin
He handed me a tom tom, I picked up the beat
That crazy thing send shivers to my feet
I rocked and I rolled, skipped with a smile
Gonna Ubangi stomp man, Ubangi style
Ubangi stomp, reggae roll, beats any stomp that you ever been told
Ubangi stomp, Ubangi style, when it hits it drives them Ubangi's wild
Well I rocked all night and part of the day
Had a good rockin' time with the chief's daugher May
We were making good time and gettin' to know
When the Captain said, "Sorry we gotta go."
Well, well that's all right man now, go right ahead
Gonna Ubangi stomp 'till I roll over dead
Ubangi stomp, reggae roll, beats any stomp that you ever been told
Ubangi stomp, Ubangi style, when it hits it drives them Ubangi's wildEmbed
