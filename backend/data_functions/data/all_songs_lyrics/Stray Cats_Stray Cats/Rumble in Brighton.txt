Rumble in Brighton LyricsWell there's the rockabilly cats with their pomps real high
Wearing black drape coats, all real gone guys
The cool skinheads with roll up jeans
Looking real tough and mighty mean
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There ain't a Godddamn thing that the cops can do
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
They sew fish hooks under their colars
Got razors in their shoes
"Go cat go" is their battle cry
World War Three is starting to brew
Well, the skinheads all use black jacks
And they're looking mighty mean
They got chains wrapped around their fingers
And their heads are all shaven clean
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There ain't a Goddamn thing that the cops can do
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Well there ain't a man left standing
So let's all go grab a beer
No team is a winner
So we'll see you all next year
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There ain't a Goddamn thing that the cops can do
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Rumble in Brighton tonight
Rumble on the beach tonight
Rumble in Brighton tonight
Rumble on the beach tonight
Well man there ain't a Goddamn thing that the cops can do
So line back up for a side line view
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There's a rumble in Brighton tonightEmbed
