Runaway Boys LyricsGet kicked out for coming home at dawn
Mom and Dad cursed the day you were born
Throw your clothes into a duffle bag
Shoutin' as ya slam the door home is a drag
Who can I turn to and where can I stay ?
I heard a place is open all night and all day
There's a place you can go where the cops don't know
You can act real wild they don't treat you like a child
Runaway boys
Your hair's all greasy and you feel like a slob
You're only fifteen and you can't get a job
RUN into the luncheonette and shoot a few games
Losing all your quarters, man it's always the same
Steal a couple of bucks to buy a new toy
Slip into the alley with the
Runaway boys
Runaway boys
Runnin' faster, faster all the time
You're under age and God knows, that's a crime !
Get kicked out for coming home at dawn
Mom and Dad cursed the day you were born
Throw your clothes into a duffle bag
Shoutin' as ya slam the door home is a drag
Who can I turn to and where can I stay ?
I heard a place is open all night and all day
There's a place you can go where the cops don't know
You can act real wild they don't treat you like a child
Runaway boys
Runnin' faster, faster all the time
You're under age and God knows, that's a crime !
Runaway boys
Runaway boys
Runaway boys
