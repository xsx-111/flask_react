Crawl Up and Die LyricsWell, I don't know what's the matter
Oh, what's the matter with me
Well, I don't know what's the matter
Oh, what's the matter with me
Well, I can't control my legs now
And I can't hardly see
Well, I'm smoking past the filter
And it's burning my lips
Well, I'm smoking past the filter
And it's burning my lips
My body is a shakin'
Down to my finger tips
Oh, please let me stay here
Well, let me stay here tonight
C'mon baby let me stay here
Let me stay here tonight
I want to crawl baby crawl up
I want to crawl up and die
Ohh!
Well, I'm searchin' for the poison
That's gotta keep me alive
Well, I'm searchin' for the poison
That's gotta keep me alive
And if I don't find that poison
I'm gonna crawl up and die
Well, I can't control this feeling
That I'm having inside
Well, I can't control this feeling
That I'm having inside
I want to crawl baby crawl up
I want to crawl up and die
Oh, please let me stay here
Well, let me stay here tonight
C'mon baby let me stay here
Let me stay here tonight
I want to crawl baby crawl up
I want to crawl up and die
Oh, please let me stay here
Well, let me stay here tonight
C'mon baby let me stay here
Let me stay here tonight
I want to crawl baby crawl up
I want to crawl up and die and die and dieEmbed
