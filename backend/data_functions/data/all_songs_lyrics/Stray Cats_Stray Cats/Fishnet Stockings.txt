Fishnet Stockings LyricsWell my sweet baby wears fishnet stockings
When she starts a rockin' there ain't no stoppin'
Singing wop bop a doo dop fishnet stockings
Shoo wop a doo dop when she's rockin'
Bop bop a doo dop there ain't no stoppin'
Rockin' with my baby in her fishnet stockings
Well she's got a pair in pink
She's got a pair in red
When she puts the black ones she makes me loose my head
Singing wop bop a doo dop fishnet stockings
Shoo wop a doo dop when she's rockin'
Bop bop a doo dop there ain't no stoppin'
Rockin' with my baby in her fishnet stockings
One time
Well she's got a pair in pink
She's got a pair in red
When she puts the black ones she makes me loose my head
Singing wop bop a doo dop fishnet stockings
Shoo wop a doo dop when she's rockin'
Bop bop a doo dop there ain't no stoppin'
Rockin' with my baby in her fishnet stockings
Rock it again now
Well my sweet baby wears fishnet stockings
When she starts a rockin' there ain't no stoppin'
Singing wab bop a doo dop fishnet stockings
Shoo wop a doo dop when she's rockin'
Bop bop a doo dop there ain't no stoppin'
Rockin' with my baby in her fishnet stockingsEmbed
