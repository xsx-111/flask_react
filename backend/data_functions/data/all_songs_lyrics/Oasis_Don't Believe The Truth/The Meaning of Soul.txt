The Meaning of Soul Lyrics
I gotta show you, man, the meaning of soul
I'm taking on love tonight
Get outta my way, yeah man, I dig what you say
But that ain't enough, alright
I'm a different breed and I am outta your league
I'm ten outta ten, alright
Get out of my way, yeah man, I dig what you say
But that ain't enough, alright

All rise, I see the love in your eyes
If it's alright, then I'll be your light

I gotta show you, man, the meaning of soul
I'm taking on love tonight
Get outta my way, yeah man, I dig what you say
But that ain't enough, alright
I'm a different breed and I am outta your league
I'm ten outta ten, alright
Get out of my way, man, I dig what you say
But that ain't enough, alright

All rise, I see the love in your eyes
If it's alright, then I'll be your light
I gotta show you, man, the meaning of soul
I'm taking on love tonightEmbed
