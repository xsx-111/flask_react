Keep the Dream Alive Lyrics
'Four Seasons' seconds flicker and flash, I'm alone
A lonely scream provides the scene, it's no home
Every night I hear you scream
But you don't say what you mean
This was my dream, but now my dream has flown

I'm at the crossroads, waiting for a sign
My life is standing still, but I'm still alive
Every night I think I know -
In the morning - where did it go?
The answers disappear when I open my eyes

I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams collide
And even though I fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
I will keep the dream alive

'Four Seasons' seconds flicker and flash, I'm alone
A lonely scream provides the scene, it's no home
Every night I hear you scream
But you don't say what you mean
This was my dream, but now my dream has flown
I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams collide
And even though I fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
I will keep the dream alive

Nah, nah, nah...1Embed
