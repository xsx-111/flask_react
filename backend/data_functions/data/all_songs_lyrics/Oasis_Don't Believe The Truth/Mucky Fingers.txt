Mucky Fingers Lyrics
I know you think you deserve
An explanation on the meanings of life
But what you think that you heard
Slipped away out the back of your mind

You'll get your mucky fingers burnt
You get your truth from the lies you were learned
When all your plastic believers will leave us
And they won't return
(Walk on)

And when you look in the mirror
And you're tying up your buttons and bows
And as you face your disease
You can squeeze into the emperor's clothes

You found your God in a paperback
You get your history from the union jack
And all your brothers and sisters have gone
And they won't come back

I'm fed up with life in the city
All the phonies have blown my mind
When I'm gone, yeah, you look like you'd miss me
So come along with me
But don't ask why
Cos it's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine1Embed
