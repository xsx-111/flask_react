Turn Up the Sun Lyrics
I carry madness everywhere I go
Over a border and back to the snow
So if you see me and I look right through
You shouldn't take it as a reflection of you

Come on, turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another

The boys in the bubble
They wanna be free
And they got so blind
That they cannot see
But I'm not your keeper
I don't have the key
I've got a piano
I can't find the 'C'

Come on, turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another
Come on, turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another2Embed
