Love Like a Bomb Lyrics
I'm seeing
A whole nother world in my mind
Girl I'm feeling
An' breathing in love all the time

You turn me on
Yer' love's like a bomb
Yer' blowing my mind
You turn me on
Yer' love's like a bomb
Yer' blowing my mind

Am I reaching
The world that I want deep inside
Girl I mean it
An' you hold the key to the shrine

You turn me on
Yer' love's like a bomb
Yer' blowing my mind
You turn me on
Yer' love's like a bomb
Yer' blowing my mind
Blowing my mind
Blowing my mind
Blowing my mind
She's blowing my mind
Lah lah lah...

Yeah I'm seeing
A whole nother world in my mind
Girl I'm feeling
That we've been in love all the time

You turn me on
Yer' love's like a bomb
Yer' blowing my mind
You turn me on
Yer' love's like a bomb
Yer' blowing my mind
Yeah I'm seeing!1Embed
