Tomorrow Lyrics
Today is the day I'll learn that I believe in miracles
I can feel the world opening up, I think I broke the curse
No, I won't grab you by the arm when you go
No one can give me what I want, yeah, I know

Let's get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time's on our side, while our hearts are young
Let's think about it tomorrow

Daddy said he needed money, so he put her on the street (street)
She had just turned thirteen, got a family to feed (feed)
Yeah we grew up in a hurry (that's when she met me)
Daddy got a little worried (American dream)

C'mon, let's go, we'll think about it tomorrow
C'mon, let's go, we'll think about it tomorrow

Let's get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time's on our side, while our hearts are young
Let's think about it tomorrow
Let's get out of this hopeless town
Nobody can stop us now
And time's on our side, while our hearts are young
Let's think about it tomorrow
Las horas se me hacen siglos aqu√≠
Dame un beso que me dure una eternidad
C'mon, let's go
Porque nunca voy a regresar, nunca
C'mon, let's go
Te invito si quieres, y como un cometa en el cielo
C'mon, let's go
Nos quemaremos juntos
Nos quemaremos juntos19Embed
