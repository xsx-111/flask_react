Tyrant Lyrics
Baby dímelo
Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo

All I hear is sirens
In a world so violent
Would you be a tyrant
If I gave you power
Would you take it out
Look me in my iris
I can read your silence
When everything is a riot
You're my peace and quiet

All around we go
Your lovin' is like a kaleidoscope
I don't wanna come down
Keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
Wanna seize the throne
But what would you do with all that control
I don't wanna come down
Keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
Word on the street, you got hoes
I disappear like El Chapo
'Til you said you would cut off the whole world
If little old me would be yours
Well Mira, mira, míralo (míralo, míralo)
Papi está rico, papi está guapo (papi está guapo)
The world's been asking us to lose control
All we ever do is French like Brigitte Bardot (Brigitte Bardot)

All around we go (all around, all around)
Your lovin' is like a kaleidoscope
I don't wanna come down
Keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round (around, around, around)
Wanna seize the throne (I know you wanna, I know you wanna)
But what would you do with all that control
I don't wanna come down
Keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round (around, around, around)

Baby dímelo
Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo
Boy, you're driving me crazy
Although I say nothing can faze me
Place the spark in my life back
Now I want to show you how I thank that
Don't think you can lie
I can see through your mind
Don't lose this
We have it all, all

All around we go (all around, all around)
Your lovin' is like a kaleidoscope
I don't wanna come down
Keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round (around, around, around)
Wanna seize the throne (I know you wanna, I know you wanna)
But what would you do with all that control
I don't wanna come down
Keep spinnin' me 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round (around, around, around)

We're goin' 'round and around and around, goin' down, down
We're goin' 'round and around and around, goin' down, down55Embed
