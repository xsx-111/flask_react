Gotta Get Up (Interlude) Lyrics
I'm getting tired of sleeping in
But you're much better in my dreams
The clock is counting down, alarm says: "Wake up, now"
I wanna spend the day in bed
But I gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up
Gotta get up and get me something
Gotta get up, gotta get up, gotta get up
Gotta get up and get me something real
Get me something real10Embed
