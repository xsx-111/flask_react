Flight 22 Lyrics
There's several exits on this aircraft in the event of an emergency
At this time, please fasten your seat belts, as we are preparing for take off. And welcome aboard, Flight 22

Been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces, yeah
But nothing like you (you, you, you)
Oh, met you at the airport
Flight 22 (two, two, two)
I want you to have it all (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I want you to have it all (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I wonder if you really know
What I do for you to have it
I've had it with the waiting and hesitating

So pack all your bags, don’t gotta ask where we're going to
Don’t wanna be anywhere if it ain't with you
Nowhere in this world can compare, boy that's the truth
To wherever we're going on Flight 22

I know you've been patient, that's an understatement, yeah
But what can I do (do, do, do)
Oh, make myself look silly, hoping that you hear me
All my girls say that I'm acting a fool
Now touch me, kiss me, catch me, or miss me
Give it, take it, you can't mistake this
Let's get away from it all
So pack all your bags, don’t gotta ask where were going to
Don’t wanna be anywhere if it ain't with you
No where in this world can compare, boy that's the truth
To wherever we're going on Flight 22

Take me all the way, Flight 22, baby
And baby we're not gonna make it
At least I'm going down with you
Our baggage might just be too full on Flight 22
Flight 22, Flight 2214Embed
