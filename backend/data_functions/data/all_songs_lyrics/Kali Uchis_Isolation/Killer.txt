Killer Lyrics
Baby, have you got no soul?
Is your heart a gaping hole?
How come I didn't see that in you?
How come I can forgive you?
And if you loved me, you'd never do this
No, if you loved me, you wouldn't put me through it

That makes you a killer, a killer, a killer
That makes you a killer, a killer, a killer

Forever is for dreamers (for dreamers)
And it's foolish to not know you're a schemer
It's silly I think of our unborn children
'Cause all I'm thinking about right now is how Iâ€™ll never know 'em
And if you loved me, you would never do this
Our future's battered and bloody, you're so fucking ruthless

That makes you a killer, a killer, a killer
That makes you a killer, a killer, a killer
That makes you a killer, a killer, a killer
That makes you a killer, that makes you a killer14Embed
