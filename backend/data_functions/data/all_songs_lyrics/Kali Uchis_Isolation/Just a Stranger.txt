Just a Stranger Lyrics
Dollar bills, dollar bills
Dollar bills, dollar bill
Dollar bills, dollar bill

She wants my hundred dollar bills
She don't want love
She wants my hundred dollar bills
She don't want love
She wants my hundreds
Oh, she wants my hundreds

She's a hurricane
Feel the earth shake
If the devil was asleep she'd knock him wide awake
And if you were her, you never know
I think you'd do it too
But if it takes one to know one
You must not have a clue
(So, come on)
Baby, I don't ever judge, just wanna have a little fun
(Yeah, come on)
No, I won't be here for long, some will say I'm on the run
Go and say what you want
You are just a stranger
Watching from the bleachers
'Cause you can't take the danger

She wants my hundred dollar bills, she don't want love
She wants my hundred dollar bills, she don't want love
She wants my hundreds
(She only want it if it's money and she want it when she want it)
She wants my hundreds
(She only want it if it's hundreds and she want it in abundance)

No, you never knew me then
And you'll never know me now
When bellies are hungry, but there ain't no money
You get it and don't care how
Be the one that everyone likes, just approval 'til they die
I'm the one they love to hate, I'm the one who will survive

Go and say what you want
You are just a stranger
Watching from the bleachers
'Cause you can't take the danger
She wants my hundred dollar bills, she don't want love
She wants my hundred dollar bills, she don't want love
She wants my hundreds
She only want it if it's money and she want it when she want it
She wants my hundreds
She only want it if it's hundreds and she want it in abundance
She wants my hundred dollar bills, she don't want love
She wants my hundred dollar bills, she don't want love
She wants my hundreds
She only want it if it's money and she want it when she want it
She wants my hundreds
She only want it if it's hundreds and she want it in abundance

Dollar bills, dollar bill
Dollar bills, dollar bill
Dollar bills, dollar bill
