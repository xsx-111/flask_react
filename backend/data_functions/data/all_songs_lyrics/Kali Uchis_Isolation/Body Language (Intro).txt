Body Language (Intro) Lyrics
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I wanna know if you want to
I wanna go if you want to go
I'm sick and tired of talking
Told you everything you need to know
'Cause the rest is in the body language
Do you hear me? Can you feel me now?
Yeah, the rest is in the body language
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna be the one to say
Never wanted to go through it
I think about it most every day
Now I'm packing all my bags, and I am leaving it behind
There's no tracking where I'm going
There's no me for them to find

Just come closer, closer, closer, closer, closer
(I wanna know who you are)
Just come closer, closer, closer, closer, closer11Embed
