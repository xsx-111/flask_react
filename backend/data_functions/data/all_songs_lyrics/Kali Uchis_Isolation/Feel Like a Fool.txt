Feel Like a Fool Lyrics
What can I do? It's just too late to reach you
Your cigarette burnt holes all through my t-shirt
The truth is such a pain, too horrible to name
They say don't blame the player but he played the game

It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Some might laugh, some might call it cruel
When you learn your baby don't belong to you

Love you for being sick and twisted
But pussy is a hell of an addiction
My heart went through a shredder
The day I learned about your baby mothers
'Cause you're a grown ass man, now you should know better
But I still run all my errands in your sweater
'Cause the truth is such a pain, too horrible to name
They say don't blame the player but he played the game

It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Some might laugh, some might call it cruel
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
I can't look, closed my eyes
Can't believe it could've been mine
:
It's no fun to feel like a fool
When you learn your baby don't belong to you
Some might laugh, some might call it cruel
When you learn your baby don't belong to you

No fun to feel like a fool, fool
It's no fun to feel like a fool15Embed
