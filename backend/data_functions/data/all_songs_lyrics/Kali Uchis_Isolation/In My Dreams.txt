In My Dreams Lyrics
I'm feelin' happy inside, I got no reason to hide
I'm a dream girl
I'm never stressing my bills, nobody ever gets killed
It's the dream world
My mama's never on coke, this isn't my way to cope
Washin' my mind out with soap
(Ohh, ohh)

Everything is just wonderful
Here in my dreams
Here in my dreams
Every day is a holiday
When you're living inside your dreams
Why would anyone stay awake
After being so sound asleep?
Everything is just wonderful in my dreams

He's never messing around, he's always holding it down
He's my dream boy
We bought a house in the clouds, so we can only look down
It's the dream world
Don't ever worry or care, except to pick what to wear
Why isn't everyone here?
(Ohh, ohh)
Everything is just wonderful
Here in my dreams
Here in my dreams
Every day is a holiday
When you're living inside your dreams
Why would anyone stay awake
After being so sound asleep?
Everything is just wonderful in my dreams

The moments we are happiest
(Happiest, happiest)
Are the moments that we don't exist
(Don't exist, don't exist)

Everything is just wonderful
Here in my dreams
Here in my dreams
Every day is a holiday
When you're living inside your dreams
Why would anyone stay awake
After being so sound asleep?
Everything is just wonderful in my dreams
Everything is just wonderful
Here in my dreams
Here in my dreams
Every day is a holiday
When you're living inside your dreams
Why would anyone stay awake
After being so sound asleep?
Everything is just wonderful in my dreams19Embed
