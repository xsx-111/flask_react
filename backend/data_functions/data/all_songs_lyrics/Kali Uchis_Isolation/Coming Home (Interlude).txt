Coming Home (Interlude) Lyrics

I'm looking back, now thinking, maybe I was wrong
I been so out of place and desperate for so long
I wrote about it, think I made a billion songs
But nothing would ever heal the wound
No, nothing would ever seal the wound
No, nothing

Now I gotta go
I'm coming home, coming home
It's been too long
If they wanna know, tell 'em I went home
Coming home

We got greens and cherry pie, everyone ain't always nice
Well that's because they love you right
And bitches bark, but they don't bite at all
Coming home


Go left foot then right, c'mon, just take your time
Keep on, keep on moving, moving
Gotta get it right, I can't pause and rewind
Keep on, keep on moving, moving
I know, stop holding me back, quit pushing me forward
Keep on, keep on moving, moving
I move at my own pace, just leave me alone
'Cause I'm too this and I'm too that
I'm too skinny, I'm too fat
I'm all good, 'cause where I'm at I keep it moving
I'm the sweetest peach to fall, but some don't like peaches at all
I'm too short and I'm too tall, keep it moving

Go left foot then right, c'mon, just take your time
Gotta get it right, I can't pause and rewind
Keep on, keep on8Embed
