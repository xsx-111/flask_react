Miami Lyrics
Kali Uchis
BIA
Las cabroncitas
Bienvenidos a Miami

I can feel it in the air, ooh, Miami
(Miami, Miami, Miami, Miami)
How you pay off all them bills? (How?) Ooh, her panties
(How you gonna pay 'em all?)
When I was just a little girl (I was just a little girl)
Had my sight set on a bigger world
Got myself a visa
And started catching flights to where the grass is greener

Live fast and never die, I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price, blow up the spot like dynamite
Live fast and never die, I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price, blow up the spot like dynamite

Ain't here to be cute, I ain't here to impress
(No, no, no, no, no)
You know why I'm calling, I'm here to collect
(You now what I came for, I'm here to collect)
They look at me funny when I write a check
'Cause they assumed I would be paying in sex
(Miami, Miami)
And I was looking for a job, and then I found one
(I found one)
He said he'd want me in his video like Bound 1
(Like Bound 1)
But why would I be Kim? I could be Kanye
In the land of opportunity and palm trees
Live fast and never die, I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price, blow up the spot like dynamite
Live fast and never die, I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price, blow up the spot like dynamite

Don't do what I'm runnin' from, but I'm always on the run
Now I can't afford to look back, back
Hey! (Kali)
I just wanna know (BIA), if you wanna run let's go

Split fast in the 2-seat, blowin' Kali Uchis
Prolly with a Fronto, never see me smoke a loosey
Need my money pronto, you don't wanna see me moody
If you knew me, then you'd probably wanna get to know the new me
Vamoâ€™, pa Miami, how we live la vida loca
Me llamo perico pero no me gusta coca
New vice now I need a blunt with my Mimosa
Never get it twisted, ain't too bougie for Corona
With a lime on the side, I bring my sand to the trap
'Cause my baggage is way too expensive to pack
I be ten toes down, two hands in the bag
'Cause when you fast forward you don't ever look back, uh
Live fast and never die, I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price, blow up the spot like dynamite
Live fast and never die, I'm moving at the speed of light
I'll take your money, raise the price, blow up the spot like dynamite17Embed
