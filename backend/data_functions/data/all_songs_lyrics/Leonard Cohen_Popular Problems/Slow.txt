Slow Lyrics
I'm slowing down the tune
I've never liked it fast
You wanna get there soon
I wanna get there last
It's not because I'm old
It's not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That's what my mamma said

I'm lacing up my shoes
But I don't want to run
I'll get there when I do
Don't need no starting gun
It's not because I'm old
And it's not what dying does
I've always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood

I've always like it slow
I never liked it fast
With you it's got to go
With me it's got to last
It's not because I'm old
It's not because I'm dead
I've always liked it slow
That's what my mama said
All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night
I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes

I've always like it slow
I never liked it fast
With you it's got to go
With me it's got to last
It's not because I'm old
It's not the life I led
I've always like it slow
That's what my mama said

I'm slowing down the tune
I've never liked it fast
You wanna get there soon
I wanna get there last
So, baby let me go
You're wanted back in town
In case they want to know
I'm just trying to slow down1Embed
