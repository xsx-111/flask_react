My Oh My Lyrics
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my

All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Wasn't hard to love you
I Didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
