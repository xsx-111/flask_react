On My Fingers Lyrics
They try to feed me in times of hunger
But I refuse their generous hands
Though I am a taker, an opportunist
I’ve got longings no offer can stand
Take a good look here
Marvel at this stunner of a being so profound
He must be our saviour
The second coming
He has come here to waltz around
I don’t care whose house is on fire
As long as I can warm myself at the blaze
Of burning furnish, cherished photographs
Unrelated hell

Come here and balance
On my fingers
They will be here for you
When its all you have left
I always lied to you, did you not know
And I’ll put you in manacles, doesn’t it show
Little bird land on my fingers
I will place a stone on each of your hostile wings
Can you transcend my force in your broken allure
Flee in my shackles, I´ll be coming after you
Take a good look here
Marvel at this stunner of a being so profound
He must be our saviour
The second coming
He has come here to waltz around

Come here and balance
On my fingers
They will be here for you
When its all you have left
I always lied to you, did you not know
And I'll put you in manacles, doesn't it show
Little bird land on my fingers
I will place a stone on each of your hostile wings
Can you transcend my force in your broken allure
Flee in my shackles, I'll be coming after you1Embed
