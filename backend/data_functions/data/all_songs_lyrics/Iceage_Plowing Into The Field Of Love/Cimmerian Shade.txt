Cimmerian Shade LyricsIt was light seen through structure
Landscapes seen through a prison cell
Staring into the warm summer night
Trying to focus my eyes
I want to hear the silence in my drunken comfort
But voices they echo on and on and on
In the cimmerian shade
Let everything be washed in white
Into long rolling waves of light
Swaying like long curtains in an open window
I can never sleep tonight
I want to hear the silence in my drunken comfort
But voices they echo on and on and on
In the cimmerian shade
I want to hear the silence in my drunken comfort
But voices they echo on and on and on
In the cimmerian shade
I want to hear the silence in my drunken comfort
But voices they echo on and on and on
In the cimmerian shade
Cimmerian shade
Cimmerian shade
Cimmerian shade
Cimmerian shadeEmbed
