Glassy Eyed, Dormant and Veiled LyricsThe world was once seen burning in my eyes
Just as it is in yours now
A hurricane of memories put out the embers that remained
And now I’m gone
Though I’m obsolete, I'll scold you even in your dreams
Rise from your sleep, boy
A myriad of maladies
Incomplete identity
Hunger for the love you never gave

Don’t think I did not hear you coming home, boy
Don’t think I did not hear you coming home, last night
I am an absent father
Glassy eyed, drunken and veiled
Father, can you hear me
My head is pounding like the wagons on a freight train
The wheels are poorly fastened and they threaten to drive off the tracks
Lead by your ever present voice
I'm gonna take this fall for us
A myriad of maladies
Incomplete identity
Hunger for the love you never gave

Don’t think I did not hear you coming home, boy
Don’t think I did not hear coming home, last night
I am an absent father
Glassy eyed, drunken and veiled
I’ve got nations blaming me for the passings of their children
I’ve been dragging ships across dry land
To fill the hole you emptied
Somewhere in you there is something belonging to me
And i don’t know how to retrieve

Don’t think I did not hear you coming home, boy
Don’t think I did not hear you coming home, last night
I am an absent father
Glassy eyed, dormant and veiled1Embed
