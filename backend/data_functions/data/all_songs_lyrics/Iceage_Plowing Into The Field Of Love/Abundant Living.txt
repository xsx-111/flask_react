Abundant Living Lyrics
I will outnumber
I will outdrink
And crash through borders
Abundant living

In the gaslights fire
I felt the power
As the mist came down
Hour by hour
In the gaslights fire
I came to power
As the mist came down
Hour by hour

And when I fall
Iâ€™ll bring it all
Down here with me
Soaked in alcohol

In the gaslights fire
I felt the power
As the mist came down
Hour by hour
In the gaslights fire
We came to power
As the mist came down
Hour by hourEmbed
