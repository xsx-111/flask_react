Simony LyricsBit into flesh much like my own
Electric skin
Like none i’ve ever known
Idle chastise
This dumb harlot just won’t learn
In these arms is all she ever yearned for
The passing of this night burns
The absent kiss possesses a million regrets
These sacrifices can’t redeem no soul
Primal urges oversold
Simony
At fault again
I levitate from the ground
To watch myself, the useless horehound
Forced closure
By the thankless condition
It fumbles its was to recision
Its was to recision
The passing of this night burns
The absent kiss possesses a million regrets
These sacrifices can’t redeem no soul
Primal urges oversold
Simony
Simony
Simony
Simony
