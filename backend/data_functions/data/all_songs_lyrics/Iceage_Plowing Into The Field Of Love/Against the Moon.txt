Against the Moon LyricsOn a pedestal
Shining bright
Justify me
Make me right
I can fight it
Make it roam
But a fugitive has a tendency to return home
Pissing against the moon
Softly she put her hand on my mouth
Softly, so that i
In the silence
Only heard breathing
Closed in living
Pissing against the moon
Whatever I do
I dont repent
I keep pissing against the moon
Whatever I do
I do not repent
I keep pissing against the moon
Pissing against the moon6Embed
