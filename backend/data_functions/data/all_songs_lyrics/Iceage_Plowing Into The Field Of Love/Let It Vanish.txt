Let It Vanish LyricsWhatâ€™s gone is best forgotten
The past flown miss
Is purposely spared from my raining bullets
To keep away from consequence
I gave you life
Comprehend that I gave you life
To see it disarray
It disarrays
Sitting in an ambush
Waiting for the time that my claws of contradiction
Hesitates in crime
Start the hunt
Let it vanish
Start the hunt
Let it vanish
Hunt
And capture
Hunt
Let it vanish
He must be conceived with sharp cut instinct
The prey wants a killer
With blood lusting eyes
I gave you life
Comprehend that I gave you life
To see it disarray
It disarrays
Sitting in an ambush
Waiting for the time that my claws of contradiction
Hesitates in crime
Start the hunt
Let it vanish
Start the hunt
Let it vanish
Hunt
And capture
Hunt
Let it vanishEmbed
