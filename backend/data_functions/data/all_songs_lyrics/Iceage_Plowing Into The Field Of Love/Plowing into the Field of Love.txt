Plowing into the Field of Love LyricsAll those brash young studs
They have no idea what its like up here
I am that ragged figure of a man standing
Up in a mansion window
Looking down at the strung out refugees
Some men would question why you would feed an
Animal with champagne
Paddling through still dark waters
And the moon illuminates a thin white line
Bootlickers stand aside
I am plowing into the field of love
In the dying light
I made a binding contract with the lucid blue
Our affairs are at chance
Always to its favor
Always as its vessel
As you please
As you please
Please
Paddling through still dark waters
And the moon illuminates a thin white line
Bootlickers stand aside
I am plowing into the field of love
Paddling through still dark waters
And the moon illuminates a thin white line
Bootlickers stand aside
I am plowing into the field of love
They will place me in a hearse
They will place me in a hearse
They will place me in a hearse5Embed
