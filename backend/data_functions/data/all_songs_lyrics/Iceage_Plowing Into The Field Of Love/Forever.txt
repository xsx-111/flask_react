Forever Lyrics
I always had the sense that I was split in two
It seems so complicated
To shift between existence
To long for the better one

Lurking in his footsteps
Hounding his trace
It is backbreaking being a search dog
Looking for its tail

If I could dive into the other
Like it was an ocean
Caressed by its water
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
Dive into the other
Like it was an ocean
Caressed by its water
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
Just below the surface
The surge is keeping me adrift
But then I leap into the heavens
Reveal myself to everyone
To astonish and amaze

If I could dive into the other
Like it was an ocean
Caressed by its water
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
Dive into the other
Like it was an ocean
Caressed by its water
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever

Dive into the other
Like it was an ocean
Caressed by its water
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
Dive into the other
Like it was an ocean
Caressed by its water
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever
I’d lose myself forever5Embed
