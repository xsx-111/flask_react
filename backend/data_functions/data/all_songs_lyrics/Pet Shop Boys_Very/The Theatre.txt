The Theatre Lyrics
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)

It's another world here
The streets are gleaming
I was even dreaming
That they're paved with gold
Seventeen
At half-past ten
All the crowds are surging past
An electric display

There's another world here
Below shop windows
Upon the pavement
Where you wave goodbye
Boys and girls come to roost
From Northern parts
And Scottish towns
Will we catch your eye?
While you pretend not to notice
All the years we've been here
We're the bums you step over
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah!)

It's another world here
Somebody is singing
I was only wishing
For a bit of cash
From a patron
Of the arts
Or at least the Phantom of the Opera
Will I catch your eye?

While you pretend not to notice
All the years we've been here
We're the bums you step over
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Pavarotti in the park
Then you walked
Back up the Strand
Did you catch my eye?

And then pretend not to notice
All the years we've been here
We're the bums you step over
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
In the end, you pretend
'Cause it's so much easier
We're the bums you step over
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)

We're the bums you step over
As you leave the Theatre
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)Embed
