Fin LyricsI hold it all to the love in her eyes
Lord knows I can feel her, see her, in my mind
And her spoken words ring through my head
Though I'm lost, I can hear them calling me there
Hey, the song, do you feel (feel)
Leave your light on through the night
Love (love) and loss so dear
You know it's a long way home
Well a lonely road to the promised land
May be long but I see the end some day
To broken lives on the mountain side
Out in the cold, kinda hurried shifting sands
They're in the other world to where you lie
Pulling your heart then the ravens say goodbye
Hey, the song, do you feel?
And leave your light on through the night
Loss, from .... so dear
You know it's a long way homeEmbed
