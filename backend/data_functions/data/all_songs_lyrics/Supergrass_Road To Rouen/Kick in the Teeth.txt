Kick in the Teeth LyricsIt's a kick in the teeth, can make it hard to smile
I'm turning to a dirty plastic style
Well I don't mind, there ain't no use in crying
So I just keep on trying
And the heartache would be fun
But I just can't get my head around what you want
Oh yeah
Killing time waiting for tomorrow
Well I can't sleep, take my pills of sorrow
The other guys are terrified of dying
But I just keep on trying
And the heartache would be fun
But I just can't get my head round what you
What you want

A kick in the teeth, broken glass sent flying
It's a fucking cheek, a bloody mouth, don't mind it
You cut me down but there ain't no use in crying
So I just keep on trying
The heartache would be fun
But I just can't get my head round what you
Oh, what you want
What you want
Don't know what you want
What you want
Don't know what you want
Don't know what you want
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what you want, oh... Woo!Embed
