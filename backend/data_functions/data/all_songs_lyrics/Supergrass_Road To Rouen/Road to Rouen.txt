Road to Rouen LyricsThere's damage out there some place
You got to step aside
Where are you going that decision is made
That's how it started
Too hot and dirty inside
Contain your feelings when there's nowhere to go
Follow all the signs and they'll lead us away
And it's all good stuff for ... around the world today
Turn off your television
Don't be the hatchet man
His time has come and now I'm ready to go
Cut up and fear
Tap into the nervous system
Retrieve your message tell me what do I know
Follow all the signs and they'll lead us away
But it's all good stuff for ... around the world today
Tried on the feeding time
The truth is
It's going to get you and won't let go
I'm isolated
I'm going nowhere fast
There's no direction so where do I go
Follow all the signs and they'll lead us away
But it's all good stuff for ... around the world todayEmbed
