Tales of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6) LyricsMaking sense of what I've heard
And what is on my mind
Don't look down cause it's far to fall
Count the hours, face the fear
It's haunting me these days
We're past the post and through the door
We hail commercial suicide
Kiss the life you left behind
Don't let it bother you
You do what it takes to get what you can
Last night I thought about
Another life and what I'd do
It's hanging over me
I'm sure to break your loving heart
I'm dying to take a walk
Down this sugar coated sonic path
Cause I've been hanging around for hours
Staring at your hologram
Outside a northern harbour
Digging up the harder times
I might have known that you'd been
Tearing up the photographs
Standing on your holy ground
Lost sight of all I've done
Picking round for higher ground
Guests out in paradise
With China dolls and better times
The satellite is always overhead
It's watching you
You know it's living hell
I'm solid gone, coming for no-one, no-one, no-one1Embed
