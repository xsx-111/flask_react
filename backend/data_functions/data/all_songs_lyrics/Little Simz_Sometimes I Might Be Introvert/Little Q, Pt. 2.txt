Little Q, Pt. 2 Lyrics
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la

Grew up in the South side of that River Thames
Hard to think outside the box when you're stuck in the Ends
I had dreams of many things as a youngin
I was fourteen when the streets offered tough lovin'
Older brother went to jail, daddy weren't around
No choice now but to be the man of the house
If you're talking role models, nowhere to be seen
You can't fathom what I think 'til you been where I been
PTSD from the roads, trouble was everywhere that I looked
Hard to avoid it even if I just kеpt my head in my books
There ain't no еasy way out, drownin' internally
When you're stuck in a ocean of doubt with all this uncertainty
Lived bein' angry my whole life like it's part of my DNA
I couldn't tell you why it became something that we embraced
Then we take that same anger and turn it into someone else's pain
Nothing's changed here, the cycle still remains
Mama told me my sun will shine
We don't decide everything in God's time
And when mama told me, I prayed to God
To walk with me, my journey's begun
See, my mama told me my sun will shine
We don't decide everything in God's time
And when mama told me, I knew that I
Was strong inside, but we all cry sometimes

Shit changed when I had a brief encounter with death
Thought the pearly gates opened when that knife was in my chest
Not the mental scars, the physical's all you see
But the boy that stabbed me is just as damaged as me
I could have been the reflection that he hated
The part of him he wishes God did not waste time creating
The broken homes in which we're comin' from, but who's to blame when
You're dealt the same cards from the system you're enslaved in?
It's fucking mayhem
Imagine being in a hospital, wired up to the machines
They told me I had been in a coma for two weeks
But time is an illusion, my mind told me I'm invincible
But my body reminded me I'm human
When you're so close to the Heavens, God shows you who's there
Nowhere to be seen are the people who said they care
This must've been written for people who came to read it
'Cause life gave me a second chance and many never see it, Q
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
(We eat from a tree full of forbidden fruits)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
(Not about what you see, but what lives in the wound)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
(We eat from a tree full of forbidden fruits)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
(We all know real criminals live in the suit)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la (Like the sun in the sky)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Spread your wings, fly)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la (We're going high)
(We all know real criminals live in the suit)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la (Like the sun in the sky)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Spread your wings, fly)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la (We're going high)
Like the sun in the sky
Spread your wings, fly
We're going high
Like the sun in the sky
Spread your wings, fly
We're going high
(Spread your wings, fly, fly)4Embed
