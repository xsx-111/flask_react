How Did You Get Here Lyrics
How did you get
How did you get, get
How did you get
How did you get here?
How did you get
How did you get, get
How did you get
How did you get here?

How the hell did I get here? Sometimes, I sit here and I wonder
I'm the version of me I always imagined when I was younger
All the doubt I had thrown at me, all the time I invested
I sit and read my old lyric books like, "Damn, it must’ve been destined"
Stuck to it, I improvised my way hеre, no rules
Back when it was sеrious, handin' mixtapes out in my school
All I had was my brain and my hunger, had to use that as tools
Amount of people that told me no and I turned that into my fuel
Slackin' in my schoolwork, didn’t care much
Sisters are gettin' onto me
But trust me, this music ting is my prophecy
I didn't need to convince them 'cause they saw it all from just watching me
Now I got them on sight, confidence rises
There ain't no stoppin' me, I'm unstoppable
Got a strong head on my shoulders and bein' good-hearted don’t cost at all
Times I thought I had lost it all when I ain’t even have shit to my name
Studio runs on foot, trekkin' through the rain
Made me into what I became, all I wanted to be around
Was like-minded people on the same page and I found that in Space Age
Back then, we never had a penny
But it didn’t matter to us because our soul was nourished
Shootin' music videos in Chucks' garden with no budget
Came up with some real ones, all the talent we had to harvest
We didn't always see eye-to-eye, but they always had my back regardless
That was a pivotal time
Breaks my heart it didn’t work, but we tried
Still, I had never aborted the mission
All that I've taken is all God has given
When Tola's talkin' to me, then I listen
Told me to follow my own intuition
Go at the pace I set for myself
I don't need drums to follow the rhythm
Couldn't have planned this, it was just written
Many dreams I'm sittin' on
I'm made up of the same stars that I wish upon
Times I thought that my prayers weren't gettin' answered
But, boy, was I wrong
All it took was me knowin' I'm meant to be here
It's where I belong, it's where I belong, yeah
How did you get (Like, sometimes I forget)
How did you get, get
How did you get
How did you get here?
But I have to think back and remind myself of the journey
It's been a beautiful one, yes

Sometimes, I sit and I wonder
I'm the version of me I always imagined when I was younger
All the albums I studied, learned about flow and cadence
I sit and listen to my old shit like, "Damn, all it took was patience"
Story over the glory, other paths that weren't for me
Wasn't much of an academic or road-invested or sporty
Made the most with all I was blessed with, of the tools in my inventory
Things the teachers don't teach you and now the student might lead you
If you wanna leave the class, then you're free to
Everything here is subjective
If you stand where we're standin', you might understand the perspective
How the hell did you get far? You ain't get no head start
All decisions we made is based on our circumstance, we hope to surpass it
Took most of our lifetime to wake up
Smell the roses, realise that the world is ours
Us and them, but we worlds apart
Nothing in life comes easy and you work twice as hard 'cause you Black
Used to think mum exaggerated 'til the world showed me it's fact
Still, it's mine for the takin', lock the doors and we break in
Still got love for them non-believers, yeah, the ones that said we won't make it
Everything you want is out there waitin' for you to take it
The key is to have faith in your dreams and never stop chasin'
And you'll make it, trust

How did you get
How did you get, get (All it was was perseverance)
How did you get (Pushin', never givin' up)
How did you get here?
They built them walls so high up and we tore 'em down
They told us no, we said yes
It's okay
Some get it, some don't
(It didn't take you long to get here)
But we keep pushin' on
(How did you believe you would get here?)
And in times of doubt
(You didn't sell your soul, but you held on)
Always
(It didn't take you long to get here)
And here we are
It's the story of never-ending, it's been a long road
Haha
Feel good, don't it? Yeah
(It didn't take you long to get here)
Tell your kids to play this
(How did you believe you would get here?)
