Protect My Energy Lyrics
That's why I, I
Love bein' alone
Protectin' my energy
That's why I, I
Sink in on my own
Don't you think of savin' me

Don't call me
I don't wanna speak
I got problems
But I'm not fuckin' weak

I'm so guarded
Heart is like a stone
Protectin' what's inner me
I, I, I, I hate to be controlled
Think of what you say to me
Total silence is my therapy
I don't need your sympathy
Internal guidance is all that I seek
Don't disturb my inner peace

'Cause I'd rather be alone with my only ones that care for me solely
Rather be alone with my only ones that carе for me solely
Rather bе alone with my only ones that care for me solely
Rather be alone with my only ones that care for me solely
Rather be alone with my only ones that care for me solely
Rather be alone with my only ones that care for me solely
Rather be alone with my only ones that care for me solely (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
That's why I, I
Love bein' alone
Protectin' my energy
That's why I, I
Sink in on my own
Don't you think of savin' me (Yeah)

Don't call me (Don't you call me)
I don't wanna speak (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I got problems
But I'm not fuckin' weak
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, woah

I'm so guarded
Heart is like a stone
I, I, I, I hate to be controlled
Total silence is my therapy
Protectin' my energy4Embed
