Miss Understood Lyrics
Don't stop
I can feel your pain
I can see your tears
So misunderstood
You're Miss Understood

I don't wanna be up, I been down for days
Layin' in my misery, hopin' I will be saved
Stuck in my ways, stubborn, I know it can't be changed
Livin' in isolation, attention I never crave
There go little Simbi from around the way
She wanted the credibility, never cared for fame
While the palette fades, release the colours of pain
It's a black and white world, still in the area GREY
(Don't stop) Lookin' back, was it all a waste of
Handshakes and how-are-yous and what-you've-been-up-tos
And will-you-be-home-soons and when-are-you-droppin'-again?
Sussin' me out, secretly hopin' I'm done with the pen
No receipts, can't return the gift I was sent
Everything I touch is felt with the purest intent
Conversations with you is causin' resentment
Hard to accept the realness, she said
(Don't stop) I've been lovin' you freely
Back when you was broke, handin' out them CDs
Tried to fall in love and you cut 'cause you need me
I told you, "Give it up" and you never believed me
Your obsession with me is with me has been your Achilles' heel
Feelings equals weakness and that's why you bury yours
Understand you are just a vessel for the Lord
Lion heart, don't you feel the blessings in your paws?
Don't stop
I can feel your pain
I can see your tears
So misunderstood
You're Miss Understood

(Do-do-don't stop) Little misleadin'
Misguided, misunderstood, misjudged
(Pain) Little mistaken
Heartbroken, that's basic, mistrust (Pain)
For many days and for many nights
I just couldn't fathom all the fake stuff
Eyes wide open to fake love
'Cause no one's checkin' for you when you got it bad
And you're in the worst, lowest place, still could never crash
Strong women bounce back and secure bags
Know it's in my DNA to only be great
Niggas tryin' hard to get the juice and I'm lemonade
I write words for a livin' and still can't communicate
Honesty is in my bones, I can't do the fake
Life's too short and I've seen too many tears
I've come too far for me to be consumed by my fears
Can't believe the space I'm in with my older sister
I left the global empire and now she thinks I dissed her
It weren't that, I just needed to explore shit on my own
I just needed to figure outâ€”, mmm
I probably let my anger get the best of me
When it comes to family, see, now you testin' me
You want my everything until there's nothing left of me
I just wanted you to call me, sayin', "Hey, sis, how's your day been?
How's your love life? Who you datin'?
Oh, he fucked up? Girl, I had the same thing
But there's a bigger picture God is painting"
It's hard mixing family and business
I really wanted it to work and God is my witness
So misunderstood
You're Miss Understood
Don't stop
I can feel your pain
I can see your tears
So misunderstood
