Gems (Interlude) Lyrics
Follow the arrow, Simz
Look for the messages
Follow your intuition
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
(Follow the arrow, Simz)
Find your calling, Simz
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
(Your heart will guide you, Simz)

Take your time
Inhale, exhale
Breathe
Do you want fifteen years or fifteen minutes?
Do not tire yourself out
One foot out of line and you'll be ridiculed
I'm tryna to live up to the expectations
Puttin' everything I can into what I create
I'm tryna be the best version of myself
I'm tryna be the greatest version of myself
I know I've got a lot to learn and I can be stuck in my ways, yes
But honestly, more time, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place

But understand you're human
Be proud
Your light will shine in the darkest hour
Pressure makes diamonds
Do not fold
They won't silence you, but they'll try to
So, follow your heart
It'll guide you

Two plus two is four
One plus one is two
Four plus two equals six
Follow the arrow, Simz
Your heart is full of gems
Your heart is full of gems
Physically high, mentally low
You're hurting inside, but nobody knows
Physically high, mentally low
You're hurting inside, but nobody knows1Embed
