Speed Lyrics
Niggas wanna put me in a box
Niggas think they're coming for my spot
I could buy your life with no excuses
If I had a penny for all the rappers that I influenced (Woo-woo)
I know what I bring, no, I ain't stupid
You should try that shit on someone that isn't bein' their truest (True, true)
Figured I'd just leave you niggas to it
But watch how you step, promise you don't wanna see me lose it (No, no)
Niggas know I got this shit on lock
Niggas think they're comin' for my spot
Don't you know you're dealing with a boss?
I make winnings out of any loss (Any loss)
I think I do just what I please
I'm already a legend, you should humble your speech (Yeah-yeah)
AGE 101 disturbing the peace
I think I'm Kanye West, I see the blood on the leaves (Yeah-yeah)
Motherfuckers ain't ready for my steez (Woo)
Motherfuckers wanna tour in my speed
I'm running with ease, I am me (I am me)
Catch up if you please, I got 'em singin'

Influential as fuck, I should ink in my skin
All this ink in my pen is what led me to win
Do my ting, then I duss, I don't linger for fun
Oh, you wish you could come, wanna be my plus-one
Give a fuck 'bout your style or the latest of trends
If you knew what it took just to get out the Ends
Wanna stay where I stay, know you'll only surrend'
Still running with ease, marathon, not sprint, nigga
You could tell I'm really going at it
They know when I drop, it's problematic
Keep it on the move, I'm never static
I go in the booth and show you magic
Got a hard drive full of classics
I keep that shit locked up in the attic
If I bring 'em out, it's a wrap though
I'm not sure if these niggas can hack it
Still runnin' with ease, marathon, not sprint
Don't you know you're dealin' with a boss?
Don't you know you're dealin' with a boss?2Embed
