Point and Kill Lyrics
Uh

I do as I want, I do as I like
I no watch face, I no fear nobody, nobody
I do as I want, I do as I like
I no watch face, I no fear nobody, nobody
Point and kill
If I want it, it's mine
You can't stop it, hey

Family no go suffer, oh, inna my lifetime
Dey be fine, do am proper, no lie, lie
Give me strength, let me prosper
Daddy say he want me to be lawyer, be doctor
Riff raff, kiddi cohn, window shopper
Oh, yeah, fine boy, take away auntie
Bougie, ah, eleyi, o wa fancy
When I see it, I

Point and kill
If I want it, it's mine
You can't stop me, hey
You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me
Point and kill
You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me
Point and kill
You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me
Point and kill
You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me (Huh)

I do as I want, I do as I like
I no watch face, I no fear nobody, nobody
Said, I do as I want, I do as I like
I no watch face, I no fear nobody, no fear nobody

Emini paid, what can you offer?
Snakes in the grass, no trust am
Point and kill any impostor
I'm smooth travel, never stuck in customs
That's in any city, you can come and see it with me
Reality will hit you 'cause not everywhere is pretty
But for now, bring the Naira, come gimme
Can't stop greatness, what's the point in tryin'?
Hard not to recognise with all this pressure we applyin'
Tell my people, "Rise up," can never be silenced
You think we're apologetic, I think we're defiant
Mummy say I gotta be a go-go-getter
Got the devil tryna tempt me, but I know better
Never been the type to not acknowledge all the signs
It's the fact that everything I want is in front of my eyes
So, when I see it, I
Point and kill
If I want it, it's mine
You can't stop me, huh
Point and kill
Point and kill

You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me
Point and kill
You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me
Point and kill
You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me
Point and kill
You can't stop me, oh, you can't stop me4Embed
