I See You Lyrics
Would you take me as I am? Overlook all my mistakes?
Though correct me when I'm wrong, humble me, put me in my place?
Would you be the one I come to when I'm needin' an escape?
Still be my biggest fan if I canceled all my dates?
I got shit I haven't dealt with, would you help me through my pain?
If it's any reassurance, just know I would do the same
Lookin' at you, I know that God took His time
Hope I'm seein' the real you, not a disguise
Know I like my time alone, but still don't wanna be lonely
Whisper in my ear and tell me you won't leave
Time flies, can't tell you how much we've spent
'Cause I'm present in this moment, hope this feeling never ends

Hopin' that I never wake up
'Cause in this dream, I'll never be alone
You saved my life
I'm hopin' that I never wake up
Somethin' so special, we can't let it go
With you, I'll never be alone
I'm hopin' that I never wake up

Never thought you'd be so special in my life
This is love built over time, this wasn't love at first sight
When plannin' for my future, I've been keepin' you in mind
If we ever grow apart, hope our stars will realign
You know where you come from, you ain't forgotten
It's an honour to witness and watch you blossom
You want words of affirmation and I got 'em for you
No situation is perfect
But givin' up without tryin' is what we're not gonna do
I'm speakin' your love language, readin' body language
Our connection requires a deeper understandin'
Communication isn't always verbal
But energy transferred is universal
They talk it, but we put it into practice
Centre each other, makin' sure nothin' here can knock us off our axis
That's real companionship, you as sweet as molasses
Intelligence that's matched with beauty in all its facets
Here to see us goin' forwards and never backwards
Anyone that's in our presence sees the clear attraction
Past situations didn't work and someone done the hard graft
Just for you to reap the benefits, but that's what happens
My God, been lookin' divine lately, hydrated, melanated
Don't like the fuss, but this deserves to be celebrated
There's just certain flex that comes with feelin' exhilarated
Ain't it just the best ownin' it? Knowin' you've elevated?
Hopin' that I never wake up
'Cause in this dream, I'll never be alone
You saved my life
I'm hopin' that I never wake up
Somethin' so special, we can't let it go
With you, I'll never be alone
I'm hopin' that I never wake up
Hopin' that I never wake up
'Cause in this dream, I'll never be alone
You saved my life
I'm hopin' that I never wake up
Somethin' so special, we can't let it go
With you, I'll never be alone
I'm hopin' that I never wake up4Embed
