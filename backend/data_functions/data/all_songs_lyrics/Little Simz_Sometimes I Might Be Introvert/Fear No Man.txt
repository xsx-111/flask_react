Fear No Man Lyrics
Huh

Rose petal mami, rose to be rose gold
I just demonstrate greatness they cannot show
No new friends, can't be welcomed in my section
See that little zone there, that's a no-go
Tell me who you know floatin' on a beat like this?
You can not respect it, I ain't askin' you to like this
You can always trust I'll give you somethin' new to vibe with
Heads turn when I pull up lookin' stylish
Ain't your typical rapper, I ain't got my neck froze
Still, your favourite artist couldn't even step close
Heard thеy want my crown, but I ain't never stressеd though
'Cause to your career, that would be detrimental, come on

Fear no man, fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today
Fear no man, fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today
Get the hell from 'round me, I ain't playin'
True, I've been a bad breed, I'm my dad's seed
Eyes low, mad lean, blame it on the green
Got a wealth of knowledge, you should listen when I speak
I was probably the hardest kid in the class to teach
Come get on my level, come get on my level
From a youngen, true, I've been I different kinda rebel
Comin' for it all, I'd be a fool if I just settle
The spirit guidin' me won't see me dancin' with the devil
'Cause I

Fear no man, fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today
Fear no man, fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today

I get what I want when I want it
More time, I don't even want it, to be honest
To you, my life like a movie on steroids
But to me, it's just another day at the office
Put my mum on the cover of GQ
You can't relate 'cause that's somethin' that G's do
Cut through, I'm mobbin' and weavin'
No one likes a pussy, don't be in your feelings, ayy
Ten o'clock on the dot
Pull up in that new somethin' from the lot
I think I'm bein' lowkey when I steppin' in
But I'm Little Simz, I forgot (Oh, nah)
Tell 'em don't be on me lookin' for a way in (No, no)
Push me, I'ma go Super Saiyan, know what I'm sayin'?
Don't get me irate, ain't no stoppin' God's plan
Everybody bleeds red, so I fear no man
Fear no man, fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today
Fear no man, fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today

Oya
Come on, fast, fast, I don't got time
Somebody is waiting for me
Bye

Fear no man, fear no man
Fear no evil, fear no person
Fear no spirit, fear nobody
Fear no man, fear no evil
Fear no person, fear nobody3Embed
