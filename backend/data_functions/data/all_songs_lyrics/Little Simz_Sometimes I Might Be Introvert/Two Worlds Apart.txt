Two Worlds Apart Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh

Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady, lady (Oh-ooh)
Know you see the confidence, believe me, I am wavy (Oh-ooh)
I need something deeper, money does not stimulate me (Oh-ooh)
Whether you got mansions or got diamonds in your AP (Yeah, yeah)
Drama, drama, drama, drama, drama, drama, drama (Oh-ooh)
Please don't tell my mama I've been smokin' marijuana (Oh-ooh)
Talk pi√±a coladas, gettin' loose in the Bahamas (Oh, but you love me still)
Look at me now, I got a bitch, her name is karma
I was movin' wild, but now I'm calmer (Oh-ooh)
We was on the front line listenin' to Kendrick Lamar (Oh-ooh)
Still the same, now we just blow that yaya on the charters (Oh-ooh)
Twenty-four's to Aussie just to hang with some koalas (Yeah, yeah)
Livin' in the present, still my future lookin' sweet (Oh-ooh)
Jodeci and cherry wine, sippin' on that Arrows Creek (Oh-ooh)
Please let go of all your troubles whenever you're here with me and (You'll be free, no, no)
Huh?
Patience, patience, patience, patience, patience (Oh-ooh)
London-born estate girl to international sensation (Oh-ooh)
Cuttin' through your settings, do not need an invitation (Oh-ooh)
Baskin' in this feeling, if I must say, it's amazing (Yeah, yeah)
I'm amazing
Our two worlds and, our two worlds and, our two worlds and, our two worlds apart
Two worlds apart

Boujee, boujee, boujee, boujee, boujee (Oh-ooh)
You made her your everything, but she was just a groupie (Oh-ooh)
I got higher standards, don't waste time tryin' to pursue me  (Oh-ooh)
You would trade intellect for an artificial booty (Oh-ooh)
That's goofy, goofy, goofy (Yeah, yeah)
Tenisha held you down, but you want Lucy (Oh-ooh)
Now she kickin' up a fuss like Bruce Lee (Oh-ooh)
Okay, if you love me, baby, why'd you want to lose me? (Oh-ooh)
You use me, confuse me, accuse me, it's truly a movie (Yeah, yeah)
Covered with silver linings, it took time just to learn about timing (Oh-ooh)
I got lost in it, you got lost in it
You clocked out, meanwhile I stayed bossin' it (Oh-ooh)
What it cost to be this damn hot with it?
Who knew love would be so damn toxic? (Oh-ooh)
I am intoxicated, exhilarated, finally moved on
How devastating for you (Oh-ooh)
Got my groove on, meditatin' too, creatin', makin' innovative moves (Oh-ooh)
Listen up, honey
Never had a penny, now I'm on artist-slash-actor money, yeah

But you love me still
And I love you (I do)
And I love you (I do)
And I love you (Love you)
And I love you (I do)
And I love you (Love you)
And I love you2Embed
