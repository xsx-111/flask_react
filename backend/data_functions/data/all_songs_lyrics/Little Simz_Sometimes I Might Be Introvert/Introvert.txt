Introvert Lyrics
There's a war, there's a war

The kingdom's on fire, the blood of a young messiah
I see sinners in a church, I see sinners in a church
Sometimes I might be introvert
There's a war inside, I hear battle cries
Mothers burying sons, young boys playing with guns
The devil's a liar, fulfil your wildest desires
Now I don't wanna be the one to doctor this
But if you can't feel pain, then you can't feel the opposite
The fight between the Yin and Yang's a fight you'll never win
I study humans, that makes me an anthropologist
I'm not into politics, but I know it's dark times
Parts of the world still living in apartheid
But if I don't takе this winner's flight, that's career suicide
Though I should've been a friеnd when your grandma died
I see the illness eat my aunt laying in her bed
I see her soul rising as her body gets closer to death

Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone
I need a licence to feel
Internal wounds and I'm not tryna be healed (No, I don't, no, I don't)
I sabotage what we are trying to build
'Cause of feelings I keep inside, but it's time to reveal (Reveal, reveal)
I hate the thought of just being a burden
I hate that these conversations are surfaced
Simz the artist or Simbi the person?
To you I'm smiling, but really, I'm hurting
I dedicate my life and gave my heart over twenty-something years
Left wondering how I even feel
But was it even worth it?
I bottle up and then spill it in verses
One day, I'm wordless, next day, I'm a wordsmith
Close to success, but to happiness, I'm the furthest
At night, I wonder if my tears will dry on their own
Hoping I will fulfil Amy's purpose
Angel said, "Don't let you ego be a disturbance"
Inner demon said, "Motherfucker, you earned this"
Like they strip you of everything you're deserving
Realise there is a prison in us, we are conditioned as fuck
Man, it's like they can't sleep till our spirit is crushed
How much fighting must we do? We've been fearless enough
All we seen is broken homes here and poverty
Corrupt government officials, lies, and atrocities
How they talking on what's threatening the economy?
Knocking down communities to re-up on properties
I'm directly affected, it does more than just bother me
Look beyond the surface, don't just see what you wanna see
My speech ain't involuntary
Projecting intentions straight from my lungs
I'm a Black woman and I'm a proud one
We walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome
But as long as we're unified, then we've already won
Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone

Sometimes I can be introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Sometimes I can be introvert
And so it begins
The base is an amalgamation of everything
Rules are not to be played by rebels
The story of never-ending
Your introversion led you here
Intuition protected you along the way
Feelings allowed you to be well balanced
And perspective gave you foresight
The top of the mountain is nothing without the climb
Only the strong will survive
Only the strong (Will survive)
Alone, but not lonely
Your truth unveils with time
As you embark on a journey
Of what it takes to be a woman32Embed
