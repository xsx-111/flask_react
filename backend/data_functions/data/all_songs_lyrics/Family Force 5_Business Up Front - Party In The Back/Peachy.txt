Peachy Lyrics
I think about you all the time
But even though I don't talk to you
That doesn't even mean that we are through
I, see you as paradigm
Of a life that seems so amused
By all the things that I refuse
I, think your walkin' on broken glass (broken glass)
And I hope your not going down fast (going down fast)
That all seemed so real to me (real to me)
Cause I was living in my own fantasy (fantasy)
You're running after a grand mistake (grand mistake)
You're headed for the real heartache (real heartache)
And then you tell me that you think I'm wrong
(And not exactly rocking on the microphone-a)

Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy, yeah
Friend, can't you see I'm trying to help you out
But your mind is stuck on things that leave you adrift with broken wings
You, wanna talk about God Philosophy
I don't think there's anything wrong
I've got time, in fact lifelong
I, think your walkin' on broken glass (broken glass)
And I hope your not going down fast (going down fast)
And then you tell me that you think I'm wrong
(And not exactly rocking on the microphone-a)

Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy, yeah

Don't bring me down (Don't bring me down)
Cause I don't- (Cause I don't), Cause I don't have time for that anymore
(He's a great musician and singer, Scott. And he writes his own songs. I guess you're calling him the school genius)
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy, yeah
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy
Hey, don't ever bring me back
To where I used to be
Cause now I feel so fine and I feel so Peachy, yeah
Yeah...Embed
