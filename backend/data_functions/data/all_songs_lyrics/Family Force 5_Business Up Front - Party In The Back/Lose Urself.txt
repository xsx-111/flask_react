Lose Urself Lyrics
Attracted to a girl that's quite like you
Quite like you
I don't know, hold on

You stand there with your long black hair
Looking so fresh with your savoir-faire
You've got the coolest friends
They're up to date with the latest trends
Independent in your own world
Rock the life girl, rock the life girl
The DJ starts to play underground hits from what's their name
You're looking kind of anxious with your back up against the wall (with your back up against the wall, with your back up against the wall)
Don't this kind of music make you want to move at all
(So whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna, gonna do)

Don't you walk away from me
'Cause I got to get you next to me
If you've got game girl step to me
Just lose them friends and dance with me
Dance next to me, dance next to me
Oh please, oh please, oh can't you see
That I got to get you baby
To lose yourself with me
I must say that you captivate
In so many ways that I can't relate
But I want to be your latest thing
For you girl I'd do anything
I've never been attracted to a girl that's quite like you
(A girl that's quite like you, a girl that's quite like you)
We've got more in common than you think
You make me move
(I don't know, say what)

Don't you walk away from me
'Cause I got to get you next to me
If you've got game girl step to me
Just lose them friends and dance with me
Dance next to me, dance next to me
Oh please, oh please, oh can't you see
That I got to get you baby
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)
Lose yourself, lose yourself
Just lose yourself, lose yourself

Don't you walk away from me
'Cause I got to get you next to me
If you've got game girl step to me
Just lose them friends and dance with me
Dance next to me, dance next to me
Oh please, oh please, oh can't you see
That I got to get you baby
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)
To lose yourself with me
(To lose yourself with me)Embed
