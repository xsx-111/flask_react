Never Let Me Go Lyrics
Time don't wait for no one
Leaving you broken
Especially when you're under the gun
Makes things complicated
Leaving you jaded toward
Everything that's under the sun
Tick Tock Tick Tock, Goes the clock
Tick Tock Tick Tock, Till I drop
But time don't phase me, Not a bit
Cuz I give mine to you, All of it
Death can't shake me, From ya hand
Me minus you equals, Not a chance
It's good to know that, When I go
You'll never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me go
I want some Face to Face
Just Gimme that Full Embrace
What did I Hear you Say?
That you will Never Ever Let me Go
I'll never Know
When It's my Time to Go
I Know one Thing fo' sho'
That you Will Never Ever Let me Go
Never ever let me go
The mind is a ticking time bomb
Itching to go off
Impatiently it waits in the calm
Bang, Bang, it might be over
In one little moment
Before you know it
It's all gone
Tick Tock Tick Tock, Goes the clock
Tick Tock Tick Tock, gonna pop
It's good to know that, When it goes
You'll never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me
Never ever let me go
One thing I'll never know
The time and place that I'll go
Death can shake me from your hand
You Never let me go
I Know
You Never ever ever evey every let me go
You Never ever let me go
I Know
You Never ever never ever let me go
I want some Face to Face
Just Gimme that Full Embrace
What did I Hear you Say?
That you will Never Ever Let me Go
I'll never Know
When It's my Time to Go
I Know one Thing fo' sho'
That you Will Never Ever Let me-
I want some Face to Face
Just Gimme that Full Embrace
What did I Hear you Say?
That you will Never Ever Let me Go
I'll never Know
When It's my Time to Go
I Know one Thing fo' sho'
That you Will Never Ever Let me-Embed
