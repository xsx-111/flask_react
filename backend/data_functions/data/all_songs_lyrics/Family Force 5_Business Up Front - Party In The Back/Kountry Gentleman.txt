Kountry Gentleman Lyrics
Yeah, Yeah
I come from the land where the mullet attacks
Business up front, party in the back
You got a style in the south when you steppin' out
Put a gold tooth in your mouth, look at you now
Tank top, your ball cap, you think you're all that, but you lookin' like Scott Stapp
You're just another redneck from back in the woods
Not a Kountry Gentleman that can bring the goods
(Tayo)

My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch your mouth
My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That's what its all about
My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch your mouth
My momma raised me in your dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That's what its all about

IROC-Z, got an eagle on it
Rollin' on some 12s, don't you know I'm gonna flaunt it?
Am I driving to fast for ya now?
BACKFIRE!
The muffler goes KABLOW!
Now that I've got your attention
Just let me mention that I'm pinchin' pennies
T o buy some twenties
And I've got plenty of millions of moneys just to give to my friends
And that would certify me as a kountry gentleman
BRBRBR
Momma
What you cooking up in that kitchen?
Cooking fried chicken?
You know I love that soul food
Everything you cook is so good
For a southern man like me you gotta cook it up green, cook it up mean
Momma don't like it when you got leftovers, give me some of them collard greens
Got me some grub and I got to go, out to the grocery store
Tailgate party at the Pig Wig, jumpin' up and down in the back of the truck bed
Look at that kid trying to act all big
Trying to breakdance, and break his leg
He ain't got what I got, so let's make it hot in this parking lot

My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch your mouth
My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That's what its all about
My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch your mouth
My momma raised me in your dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That's what its all about
The dirty dirty south
The dirty dirty south

Watch what your sayin' around my momma
She raised me in the dirty south
I said watch what your sayin' around my momma
She raised me in the dirty south
I said watch what your sayin' around my momma
She raised me in the dirty south
I said watch what you say around my momma
Tha-that's what its all about

My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch your mouth
My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That's what its all about
My momma raised me in the dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
So you best watch your mouth
My momma raised me in your dirty south
A Kountry Gentleman
That's what its all about1Embed
