Love Addict Lyrics
Hold up, wait a minute, put a little love in it

Doctor, Doctor, I've got an emergency
It seems I'm head over hills, a case of L-O-V-E
It's like I'm glowing inside
Yeah, a light I can't hide
And if this feeling is bad then I don't wanna be right
What I've got in my soul gives me the highest delight
Oh yeah it's better than drugs
In fact it's sent from above, huh huh

Hold up, wait a minute, put a little love in it

Hey, can't kick the habit
Yeah, I got to have it
Yeah, I'm what they call a
Love addict, love addict
Hey, can't live without it
Yeah, g'on shout about it
Hey, I'm a symptomatic
Love addict, love addict
Need a refill cause I just can't get enough
I've got a fever, oh yeah, and the prescription's love
So lay the truth on me
Cause that is all that I need, huh huh

Hold up, wait a minute, put a little love in it

Hey, can't kick the habit
Yeah, I got to have it
Yeah, I'm what they call a
Love addict, love addict
Hey, can't live without it
Yeah, g'on shout about it
Hey, I'm a symptomatic
Love addict, love addict

I'm blessed, I must confess
My heart is pounding in my chest
Cause this love's the best
I'm just a love addict

Coming down with something outrageous
Lookout now cause it so contagious
This feeling's got me reeling
So amped up that I hit the ceiling
Gotta clear my throat (huh huh)
Now I gotta have some more
Hold up, wait a minute, put a little love in it

Hey, can't kick the habit
Yeah, I got to have it
Yeah, I'm what they call a
Love addict, love addict
Hey, can't live without it
Yeah, g'on shout about it
Hey, I'm a symptomatic
Love addict, love addict
Can't kick the habit
Yeah, I got to have it
Yeah, I'm what they call a
Love addict, love addict
Hey, can't live without it
Yeah, g'on shout about it
Hey, I'm a symptomatic
Love addict, love addictEmbed
