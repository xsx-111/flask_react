Put Ur Hands Up Lyrics
Ugly people put ur hands down

You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
This is a stick-up, yo, I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter y'all
Go on put ur hands up
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and go on put ur hands up

Step 1, listen up loud and clear
Because we got a little something to put in your ear
I know you came to have a good time
So kick off your shoes and relax you mind
Now put on your other shoes to make you dance
Cause if you don't you might never get the chance
Step 2, raise those arms off your sides
Yeah you got it now
Now stick em up in the sky

Wah-oh, wah-oh
Just throw 'em over your shoulder
Wah-oh, wah-oh
If you're young, if you're older
Wah-oh, wah-oh
Cause you'se a high roller
Ugly people put your hands down
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
This is a stick-up, yo, I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter y'all
Go on put ur hands up
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and go on put ur hands up

Step 4, did you get left behind
Because if you did we're gonna press rewind
*rewind whirring*
I have feeling we should be dealing
With the fact sweat's dripping from the ceiling
It's a fact, Step 3 is so whack
*record scratch* Sike!
Now flip the track back

Wah-oh, wah-oh
Just throw 'em over your shoulder
Wah-oh, wah-oh
If you're young, if you're older
Wah-oh, wah-oh
Cause you'se a high roller
Ugly people put your hands down
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
This is a stick-up, yo, I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter y'all
Go on put ur hands up
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and go on put ur hands up

Yeah
You gotta keep doin' what you doin', you know?
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause time is like a wildcat baby
It's comin' to get ya
*wildcat growl*

Wah-oh, wah-oh
Just throw 'em over your shoulder
Wah-oh, wah-oh
If your young, if your older
Wah-oh, wah-oh
Cause you'se a high roller
Ugly people put your hands down
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
This is a stick-up, yo, I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter y'all
Go on put ur hands up
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and go on put ur hands up
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
This is a stick-up, yo, I didn't hiccup or stutter
It's like butter y'all
Go on put ur hands up
You wanna throw down, go on put ur hands up
Start the party now, go on put ur hands up
There's nothing wrong with getting ur party on
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon and go on put ur hands upEmbed
