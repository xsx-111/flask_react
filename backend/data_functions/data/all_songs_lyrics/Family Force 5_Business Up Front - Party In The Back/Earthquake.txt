Earthquake Lyrics
Get down!
It's shaking like an earthquake

I saw Shawty dancing on the floor
I'm kind of nervous to approach her though
Oh, she's so stylish like a supermodel
Oh, should I meet her? Yes, I think you oughta

The needle dropped
My track was on
We began to rock
Our eyes were locked
"I love your song!"
Yeah, girl sing along
She said DJ's make my heart ache
I said, "Baby, watch the place shake like an earthquake!"

Drop that 808
The walls begin to shake
It's too much for the club to take
It's shaking like an earthquake
Devastation from the sounds I'm making
And there's no escaping from the bass
It's shaking like an earthquake
10.0 on the Richter scale
Shake it like an earthquake
Move your tail!
'Bout that time my people all were quaking
Another 10.0 was in the making
Like a natural disaster
Run for the pasture
'Cause the bass will flow
Take you out like El Ni√±o
It's rumbling, crumbling, all the way down
It's tumbling, fumbling, you love that sound
"Can you turn up the bass?"
"Sorry girl, can't hear in this place"
"I have a request that I'd like to make"
"Well, what you wanna hear, girl? Shake like an earthquake?"

Drop that 808
The walls begin to shake
It's too much for the club to take
It's shaking like an earthquake
Devastation from the sounds I'm making
And there's no escaping from the bass
It's shaking like an earthquake
10.0 on the Richter scale
Shake it like an earthquake
Move your tail!
Yo, it's not loud enough, pump up the track!
Ready? Okay!
Boom boom, you broke it down, you broke it down
Now build it up, build it up, build it up ()
Boom boom, you broke it down, you broke it down
So shake it up, shake it up, shake it up (Shake it up)
Boom boom, you broke it down, you broke it down
Now break it up, break it up, break it up, woo!

Drop that 808
The walls begin to shake
It's too much for the club to take
It's shaking like an earthquake
Devastation from the sounds I'm making
And there's no escaping from the bass
It's shaking like an earthquake
10.0 on the Richter scale
It's shaking like an earthquake
Move your tail!

Shake it on down
Shake it on down
Shake it on down
Move yourself when you hear that soundEmbed
