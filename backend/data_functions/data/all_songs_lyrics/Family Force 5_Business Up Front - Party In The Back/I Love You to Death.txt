I Love You to Death LyricsI-I-I-Love Ya To Death
I-I-I-Love Ya To Death
My Heart Jumps
It Jumps Out Of My Chest
Cause I Love Ya To Death
There's No Shame In What I Say
Because I Love Ya
I Love Ya To Death
Ah Ah Ah Ah
I Chose
To Forget All The Rest
Cause Your The Best
I Love Ya to Death
I Took A Bullet To My Bulletproof Vest
And It Hurt
Ow!
Ya Know It
I Love Ya To Death
We'll Be Together Forever
And That's A Promise Promise
Can't Live A Second Without Ya
Got To Be Honest Honest
I'm Not Afraid the Jesus that I take
This Ain't No Test
You Know I Love Ya To Death
Oh!
Hey!
I Love Ya To Death
And That's Always
Hey Hey Hey Hey
I Love Ya To Death
And That's Always
I-I-I-I-I-Love Ya To Death
I-I-I-I-I-I-Love Ya To Death
I Put My Money Where My Mouth Is
Shut, Give It Up
Even The Show Biz
Just To Prove I Don't Need To Be Your Rythmic
Ow Ow Ow!
I Love Ya To Death
You Know I'll Always Love You The Same
It's True
That'll Never Change
Cause I'm A-A-A-A-A-A-All About Ya
You Know I'll Never Live A Second Without Ya
We'll Be Together Forever
And That's A Promise Promise
Can't Live A Second Without Ya
Got To Be Honest Honest
I'm Not Afraid
Of The Treasures That Pay
This Ain't No Test
You Know I Love Ya To Death
Oh!
Hey!
I Love Ya To Death
And That's Always
Hey Hey Hey Hey
I Love Ya To Death
And That's Always
