Numb Lyrics(Hey, you know.....cardboard is, uh, one of the coolest things ever
made by paper! Dance on cardboard)

Oh no they broke out the cardboard
Looks like I'm headed to the dance floor
to break it down for 'em once again
Guess what, jigga what, hey, I can do a head-spin
I don't care what jam is on
Cause I ain't going home until the break of dawn
Find myself in tune with the groove
I can't stop, uh, I gotta move

Play me song
(Make it) nice and long
Pump it through the speakers so I can hear
The beat of the drum
(Rocking) all night long
Make you wanna dance till your feet go numb
Play me song
(Make it) nice and long
Pump it through the speakers so I can hear
The beat of the drum
(Rocking) all night long
Make you wanna dance till your feet go numb
YEAAHHHHH!! Your feet go Numb
Dance to the beat till your feet go Numb, baby
YEAAHHHHH!! Your feet go Numb
Watch out I'm gonna do the moonwalk
Got so many moves I'm against the law
You can't step to this.
Don't wanna mess with this, hey, and even if you tried
I'd go like this (hey, just watch me)
Ok, I'm back in the picture
Gonna do the centipede, don't let me hit you
You try to step on the floor
But you realize I'm in control
Of the party, of the party, y'all
You don't stop your feet until we end this song
To the left, to the right, to the back, to front
Hey, DJ, put it on

Play me song
(Make it) nice and long
Pump it through the speakers so I can hear
The beat of the drum
(Rocking) all night long
Make you wanna dance till your feet go numb
Play me song
(Make it) nice and long
Pump it through the speakers so I can hear
The beat of the drum
(Rocking) all night long
Make you wanna dance till your feet go numb
YEAAHHHHH!! Your feet go Numb
Dance to the beat till your feet go Numb, baby
YEAAHHHHH!! Your feet go Numb
Do you want to dance? Well it's time to get up on your feet then girl.
Because it's time to set the record straight. Drum Machine!

Play me song
(Make it) nice and long
Pump it through the speakers so I can hear
The beat of the drum
(Rocking) all night long
Make you wanna dance till your feet go numb
Play me song
(Make it) nice and long
Pump it through the speakers so I can hear
The beat of the drum
(Rocking) all night long
Make you wanna dance till your feet go numb
YEAAHHHHH!! Your feet go Numb
Dance to the beat till your feet go Numb, baby
YEAAHHHHH!! Your feet go Numb

Yeah you don't want to mess with this!
Check this break dancing out! Uh! Wow!
Shimma limma ding dong y'all!
Hey, check me out.Embed
