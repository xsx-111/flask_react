Replace Me Lyrics
My batteries died sometime ago (wuh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
I gotta heart shaped box where they must go (wuh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Corrosion's building everyday
My flesh is leading me astray that's why I started to decay
And I will slowly rot away but I can't feel that anyway

This heart it wants to beat
These lungs they want to breathe
These eyes they want to see
Got a mouth that wants to sing

Desperation
Needing You
Every last breath
I scream for You
Shatter me into a million pieces
Make me new
Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me
Make me what You want me to be
I am Yours, for You to use
So, take and replace me with You

Needing more than just a jump start to get me through
My disconnection is now the issue
I miss my first love bad and it's driving me mad
Just like a mixed up crazy person out of his head
Its been a long long time I've been on the decline
I do an a-bout face so I can be replaced, one eighty
This heart it wants to beat
These lungs they want to breathe
These eyes they want to see
Got a mouth that wants to sing

Desperation
Needing You
Every last breath
I scream for You
Shatter me into a million pieces
Make me new
Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me
Make me what You want me to be
I am Yours for You to use
So, take and replace me with You

One for the body
Two for the soul
Three to get ready
Now go go go
Replace me with You
(Replace me with You)
Desperation
Needing You
Every last breath
I scream
Desperation
Needing You
Every last breath
I scream for You
Shatter me into a million pieces... Make me new
Crush me, tear me, break me, mold me
Make me what You want me to be
I am Yours for You to use
So, take and replace me with YouEmbed
