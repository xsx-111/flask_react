Face Down LyricsI shut my eyes in search of sleep
Tossed and turned and hoped for dreams
Awakened by a voice that was so clear
It felt so near to me
I want your love I need your touch
I've been missing you so much
I reach out for your hand
And now it feels like I am falling
Down, Down, Down
Till I Kiss the Ground, Ground, Ground
:
Fall Down with my Face Down
Giving up Me, Myself and I
It's a Bittersweet Taste to Swallow my Pride Now
Face Down is Where I Stay Now
If You See Me Standing Up Again
Just Knock Me Back Down so I can Live
Face Down

I'm on my face again
It's where I should have been
It brings me back to where I found you
Where I first fell for you
No more depending on myself
It's you and me and no one else
You stretch out your hand
And now it feels like I am falling into
Love, Love, Love
Can't get enough of Love
Chorus
I got to live face downEmbed
