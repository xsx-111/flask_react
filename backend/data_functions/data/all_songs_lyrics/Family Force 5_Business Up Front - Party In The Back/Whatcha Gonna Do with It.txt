Shake yo body now lose control

Hey kids rock 'n' roll
Shake yo body now lose control
Move it, Lose it

You got to rock 'n' roll
When you enter through the door
It's time to lose control
So let your body know
Let the beat hit ya soul
While your feet can work the floor
Makin people say whoa

Whatcha Whatcha gonna do with it
Hey kids rock 'n' roll
Shake yo body now lose control
Move it, Lose it

When I move I'm an outlaw
So watch out y'all
I don't move slow
Please know that it's all my fault
When I ro rrr ro rock
Rock yo sox off
Pull up in a limousine
Make all the young people scream
The paparazzi think I'm foxy
When I pop 'n' lock see
I make a big scene
So whatcha gonna do with it
DO whatcha gonna do with it
Tell me somethin' how you gonna move with it
Showin' everybody how you move with it
Whatcha Whatcha gonna do with it
Make sure ya body's in tune with it
Stay fly with ya black hair dye
Cuz you're rockin' to da beats of the
