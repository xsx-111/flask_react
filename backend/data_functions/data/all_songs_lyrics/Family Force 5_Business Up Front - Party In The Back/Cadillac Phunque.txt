Cadillac Phunque Lyrics
I give my props to the speak and spell
It taught me grammar in the A-T-L
Growing up as a kid in Marietta
I puts those beats all into my sampler
Played the loops all night on that Casio
Dreamin' of hearin' my songs on your stere-ere-o
And I haven't stopped to this day
Gimme a guitar and I will start to play

Why do you wanna dance?
It's the expression I feel when I hear the music in my ear
Why do you wanna sing?
It's the sound coming out when I'm communicating

Rollin' around, serving it up
Bringin' y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up
Bringin' y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up
I brought y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up

Back to the story and I hit the streets
I throw my boombox on my shoulder as I feel the beats
I'm pumping up the Footloose by Kenny Loggins
Sound hits my ear, it's got my head a-bobbin'
To my ESE's house I wanna go
Bust out the Contra, let's play Nintendo
Yes, yes, let's dig through the crates
Serve me up a loop and I will throw it on your plate
Why do you wanna dance?
It's the expression I feel when I hear the music in my ear
Why do you wanna sing?
It's the sound coming out when I'm communicating

Rollin' around, serving it up
Bringin' y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up
Bringin' y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up
I brought y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up

You wanna know where the funk's at?
It's in the back of my Cadillac
Yo, I don't know what you want from me
But I know that you know that I gotta make it funky
I don't know what you know from me
But I know I know that I'm workin' in the family
I don't know what you want from me
But I know that you know that I gotta make it funky

And if you don't know, then now you know
Cadillac escalade
Rollin' around, serving it up
Bringin' y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up
Bringin' y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up
I brought y'all some Cadillac Phunque
Rollin' around, serving it up

Rollin' around, rollin' around
Rollin' around, rollin' around, I'm rollin' around y'all
I'm rollin' around, I'm rollin' around
Rollin' around, I'm rollin' around, I'm rollin' around y'all
I'm rollin' around, I'm rollin' around, I'm rollin' around
I'm rollin' around, I'm rollin' around y'all
Rollin' around, serving it upEmbed
