American English LyricsSongs when they're true are all dedicated to you
And this invisible world i choose to live in
And if you believe that then now i understand
Why words mean so much to you:
'cause they'll never be about you
And maybe you're young without youth
Or maybe you're old without knowing anything's true
I think you're young without youth
Then you contract the American Dream
You never look up once
And you've contracted American Dreams
I require you to stop and look up
Sing a song about myself
Keep singing a song about myself
Not some invisible world
Constantly searching to find something new
But what will you find when you think that nothing's true?
Maybe it's that nothing is new
So you let me hear songs that were written all about you
The good songs weren't written for you
They'll never be about you
Then you contract the American Dream
You never look up once
And you've contracted American Dreams
You never look up once, so dont look up
Sing a song about myself
Keep singing a song about myself
Not some invisible world
Sing a song about myself
Keep singing a song about myself
Not some invisible world
And I won't tell you what this means
'cause you already know
And I won't tell you what this means
'cause you already know
So sing a song about myself
Keep singing a song about myself
Not some invisible world
You came along and found the weak spot
That you always wanted
Let yourself be everything
That you've always wanted
It doesn't have to be so decided
But you've always wanted
No need for explanations
You've always wanted
You'll find what you'll find when you find there's nothing
You'll find what you'll find when you find there's nothingEmbed
