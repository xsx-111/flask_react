(I Am) What I Am Not LyricsCalling places, collecting careless
Sentences I write them down
So I ignore them, and you should too, you should ignore every word
Is calling what you can surrender
The only way to really learn
That the alphabet made up the words
You could never resist to quote
If all this wisdom is true
Then I doubt it could really have come from you
Then I am what I am not, I am what I am not
So there must be something more then
If I am just a thought I'm not
Faster than the destination
Of knowing where you really are
Is where you've always been
Or is it where you began
And happiness, did it happen
Sooner than the doubt it cost you
You learn from the mistakes that I taught you
If all this wisdom is true
Then I doubt it could really have come from you
Then I am what I am not, I am what I am not
So there must be something more then
I am what I am not
If there's nothing more then
I am what I am not, I am what I am not
There must be something more then
If I am what I am not
Then I am what I am not, I am what I am not
There must be something more then
I am what I am not
I know there's nothing more then
I am what I am not, I am what I am not
I know there's nothing more then
If I am what I am notEmbed
