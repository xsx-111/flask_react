You Held the World in Your Arms LyricsEvery face
Even the one you saw yesterday
It looks different today
Cause everything's changed since yesterday
In every possible way
Things seem different today
Not like yesterday
Is consideration
More like an exception
Of consideration?
You held the world in your arms tonight
And what if you held the world in your arms?
When you're secure do you feel much safer?
But days never change and it's three years later
It's like your life
Hasn't changed and it's three years late
How does it feel to be three years late?
And watching your youth drift away
What seems different, seems different today?
What seems different, seems different today?
Is consideration
More like an exception
Of consideration
You held the world in your arms tonight
And what if you held the world in your arms?
You held the world in your arms tonight
And what if you held the world in your arms?
Tonight
Tonight
Cause you held the world in your arms tonight
And what if you held the world in your arms?
Cause you held the world in your arms tonight
And what if you held the world in your arms?Embed
