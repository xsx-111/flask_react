Tell Me Ten Words LyricsI have to stop
Saying to be honest
It's not a real defeat
To have to stop
Saying to be honest
It's not a great defeat
No no no
Not such a great defeat
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that way
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that way
Can you tell me ten words
That you'd use
To describe the world
You tell me ten words
That you use
To describe the world
To people
Though people never seem to know
To people
Though people never know
The more I say
The more I keep confusing things
That make me feel complete
So I keep lying to be honest
And it's not a real defeat
No no no
Not such a real defeat
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that way
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that way
Can you tell me ten words
That you'd use
To describe the world
You tell me ten words
That you'd use
To describe the world
To people
Though people never seem to know
To people
Though people never know
It's what you thought you are
It's what you thought you are
It's what you thought you are
It's what you thought you are
It's what you thought you are
(What you never thought you were)
It's what you never thought you could be if you tried much harder
(What you never thought you could be if you tried much harder)
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that way
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that way
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that way
All these things that you don't know
It seems so much better that wayEmbed
