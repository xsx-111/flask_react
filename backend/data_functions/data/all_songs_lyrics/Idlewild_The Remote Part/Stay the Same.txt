Stay the Same LyricsIt sometimes happens
It always happens to me
But always isn't a word i use
Always isn't a word i chose
When i know that
This won't survive much longer
Unless we alter what we have
But then again survival
Is not why we should
Stay the same
If we can't be the same
We won't stay the same
Our similar thoughts will never let us
Stay the same
If we can't be the same
We won't stay the same
If we retain
You know that
I won't be much help to you
If it won't happen the way
That you've always planned it
Just so you could become
More interesting
This time for a purpose
Only now i know the purpose
And i know that
What is here will not be here much longer
Unless we alter what we have
Or alter what we dont have
What we won't have
What we've never seemed to have
What we try to have
We fail to have
And all of this was just so we won't
Stay the same
If we can't be the same
We won't stay the same
Our similar thoughts will never let us
Stay the same
If we can't be the same
We won't stay the same
Just because we think we are the same
Its just so we won't
Stay the same
If we can't be the same
We won't stay the same
When we believe we are not the sameEmbed
