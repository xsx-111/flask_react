Live in a Hiding Place LyricsThere are times that I should try, to be so much more alive
But if time was right then I would be with you again
Or do you worry that I try to avoid the point and then deny
The time I spent deciding it was you again
It's when I live in a hiding place
It's the only way I feel safe
When I'm safe in a hiding place
(that's not hidden now)
I'm safe in a hiding place
It's the only way I feel safe
When I'm safe in a hiding place
And you're full of facts but not things that could add up to words
Think about meaning more as an after word
As in afterward
I return but don't remain, I'm impatient for a reason
To complain about winter, making me see through again
Or is it your damaged reply, that makes me realise that
The more I try the less that plans will help me comprehend again
That's why I live in a hiding place
It's the only way I feel safe
When I'm safe in a hiding place
(that's not hidden now)
I'm safe in a hiding place
It's the only way I feel safe
When I live in a hiding place
And you're full of facts but not things that could add up to words
You think about meaning more as an after word
And you're full of facts but not things that could add up to words
You think about meaning more as an after word
As in afterwardEmbed
