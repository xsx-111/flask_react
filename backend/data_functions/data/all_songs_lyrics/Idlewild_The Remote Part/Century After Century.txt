Century After Century LyricsSince you're breathing
Is it all that space can fill
So just by looking in
Ill be looking still
(find and follow stories well)
You make it except for
A newspaper
The headline's telling me
That fortune favours the brave
Ive never been known to be that brave
What i want is on its way out
All i needed was an easier way to stay
Walking around the city
As the light fades
Is that all that you remain
I'm thinking about these promises
That i have ever made
I know what they will never say
I know what they will never say
Century after century may remain
And if i need to remember
That the entire earth is outside this window
So close the windows
Keep the curtains shut forever
And if i need to remember
The entire earth is outside this room
So close the windows
Close the windows
Isn't it romantic to be romantic
When you dont understand what you love
Or if a word like that could ever mean anything
But what you want is on its way out
I didn't hear
Cheerleading for creative writers
Your cheekbones
Dont taste of anything at all
Its on its way out
Its just an easier way to stay
Talking about a city
That the light mades
Is it all that you remain
Its the same story told
But its these stories that dont fade
I know what they will never say
I know what they will never say
Century after century may remain
Is it all that you remain
Is it all that you remain
Is it all that you remain
Is it all that you remain
Is it all that you remain
(i know what they will never say)
Is it all that you remain
(i know what they will never say)
Is it all that you remain
(i know what they will never say)
Is it all that you remain
(i know what they will never say)
Is it all that you remain
Is it all that you remainEmbed
