I Never Wanted LyricsI created myself to be on my own
But i didn't expect to be alone
Did you create yourself to be on your own
These are the reasons things should be unknown
The days won't let you know
The days won't let you know
That all i never wanted was to be there with you
And all i ever wanted to know anywhere with you
No one creates themself
Unless they try to shut out the caution
That made them lie to
All this talk
But noone will tell me
Where and when i need to go
The days won't let you know
The days won't let you know
That all i never wanted was to be there with you
And all i ever wanted to know anywhere with you
There is no reason
There is no reason
There is no reason
For that now
(you always have to have reason)
There is no reason
(you have to have reason)
There is no reason
There is no reason
For that
All i never wanted was to be there with you
And all i ever wanted to know anywhere with you
?you don't
All i never wanted was to be there with you
And all i ever wanted to know anywhere
Ever wanted to know anywhere with youEmbed
