Way Out of Here Lyrics
Out at the train tracks
I dream of escape
But a song comes onto my iPod
And I realize it's getting late

I can't take the staring and the sympathy
And I don't like the questions:
"How do you feel?" "How's it going in school?"
"Do you want to talk about it?"

Way out
Way out of here
Fade out
Fade out, Vanish

I'll try to forget you
And I know that I will
In a thousand years or maybe a week
I'll burn all your pictures, cut out your face
And the shutters are down and the curtains are closed
And I've covered my tracks
Disposed of the car and I'll try to forget even your name
And the way that you look when you're sleeping
Dreaming of this
Way out
Way out of here
Fade out
Fade out, Vanish

Way out
Way out of here
Fade out
Fade out, Vanish4Embed
