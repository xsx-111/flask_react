Anesthetize Lyrics
A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing, but I'm saying nothing with feel

I simply am not here
No way I-
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining, please

And because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here, don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way I-
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining, please

The dust in my soul makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds, and I'm zoning out
I'm watching TV, but I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored, but I can't switch off
Only apathy, from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy

We're lost in the mall, shuffling through the stores like zombies
Well, what is the point? What can money buy?
My hand's on a gun, and I find the range - God tempt me
Well, what did you say? Think I'm passing out

Only apathy, from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy


Only apathy, from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy

Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf

The water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you, but I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me
In this moment you were stolen
There's black across the sun

Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf
Smiling into the sun23Embed
