Fear of a Blank Planet Lyrics
Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blind to let it inside
The bed is unmade, some music still plays
TV, yeah it's always on
The flicker of the screen, a movie actress screams
I'm basking in the shit flowing out of it

I'm stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing
X-Box is a god to me
A finger on the switch, my mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me


Don't try engaging me
The vaguest of shrugs, the prescription drugs
So you'll never find a person inside
My face is mogadon
Curiosity has given up on me
I'm tuning out desires, the pills are on the rise
How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

I'm through with pornography
The acting is lame, the action is tame
Explicitly dull, arousal annulled
Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day with nothing to say
Your shallow proclamations all misinformation

My friend says he wants to die
He's in a band - they sound like Pearl Jam
The clothes are all black, the music is crap
In school I don't concentrate
And sex is kinda fun but just another one
Of all the empty ways of using up a day

How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom


You don't try
To be liked
You don't mind
You feel no sun
You steal a gun
To kill time
You're somewhere
You're nowhere
You don't care
You catch the breeze
You still the leaves
So now where?10Embed
