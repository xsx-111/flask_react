Moons and Horror Shows LyricsToday is a day when many fine things will come
Today is just a memory tomorrow
I know that there's some bad things to come
But I'll forget them all until tomorrow
The days are long and nights don't come at all
We eat and drink and then we fall asleep
And then I dream of moons and horror shows
And then I'll wake up fresh and new tomorrow
Then I dream of moons and horror shows
And then I'll wake up fresh and new tomorrow
Hmmmm...Embed
