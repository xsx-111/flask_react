Times of Trouble LyricsYou know we're living in times of trouble
The past was better for me
While I'm living in times of trouble
Maybe you can help me
Oh maybe you can help me
I keep on looking on over my shoulders
And fear has fallen to me
I looked a while and then once over
Maybe you can help me
Well maybe you can help me
Another week, another weekend
Passes right over me
Another way to find a new friend
Maybe you can help me
Oh maybe you can help me
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Mmm uh huh huhEmbed
