Shame on the Night Lyrics
Shame on the night
For places I've been and what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
And, oh, so, shame on the night, alright

And shame on you
You've stolen the day, snatched it away
But I saw the sky and I never wanna die
Now you know the reason why
I say, oh, shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run

Shame on the sun
For the light you sold, I've lost my hold
On the magic flame, but now I know your name
Oh, Lord, just go the way you came again
Oh, oh, shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
So I know I'd better run

Shame on the night
For places I've been and what I've seen
For giving me the strangest dreams
You never, never, never know just what they mean
And oh, shame on the night

You don't care what you've done
Here I go, I've got to run

Shame on the night
Shame, shame on you
Shame on my dreams
Shame on the sun and you
Shame on the night
Well, I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Shame on the night
Shame on you
Shame on all of you
Shame on the night
