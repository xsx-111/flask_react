Rainbow in the Dark Lyrics
When there's lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It went cold, lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

Do your demons
Do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark, yeah


When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear it calling
You beware, look out

There's no sight of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow, like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah, you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark5Embed
