Caught in the Middle LyricsLooking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while it can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it, you'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all, yeah
Flying away in the clouds
You know you're losing your control
And finding your way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it, you'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
I feel it, I see it in your eyes
You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle, helpless again
Yeah, looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know, no
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You can feel it, you can see it
You know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it, I see it in your eyes
You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle, helpless again
Like the rush of the thunder that brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle of
You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again, oh man, oh, hey, yeah
You've been caught in the middle1Embed
