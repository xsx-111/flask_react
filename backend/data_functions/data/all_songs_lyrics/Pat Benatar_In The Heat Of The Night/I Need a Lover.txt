I Need a Lover LyricsI need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me mad
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Someone to thrill me, and then go away
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Someone that knows the meaning of ah - Hey hit the highway
Well I've been walking the streets in the evening
Racing through this human jungle at night
I'm so confused, my mind is indifferent
Hey - I'm so weak, won't someone shut out that light
Electricity runs thru the video
And I watch from this hole I call home
And all the stonies that are dancin' to the radio
I got the world calling me tonight on the phone
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me mad
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Someone that knows the meaning of ah - Hey hit the highway
Well I'm not wiped out by this poolroom life I'm livin'
But I'm gonna quit my job, and go to school, and head back home
Now I'm not asking to be loved or be forgiven
Hey - I just can't face shakin' in this bedroom one more night alone
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me mad
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Someone that knows the meaning of ah - Hey hit the highway
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Someone to thrill me, and then go away
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
I need a lover that won't drive me mad
I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Someone that knows the meaning of ah - Hey hit the highwayEmbed
