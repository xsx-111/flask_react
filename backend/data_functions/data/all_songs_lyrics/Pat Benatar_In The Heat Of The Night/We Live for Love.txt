We Live for Love Lyrics
Your love's contagious
One kiss is dangerous
But I have more to risk than you lose

I feel passion growin'
I know that love is only
Just one inch away strikin' us

We live for love
We live for love

When we get tired
And watch the summer fade away
Will you think of romance? What will we do?

Is there a place where we can go
Where time stands still for those who know?
'Til eternity we'll fulfill our desire

We live for love
We live for love
We live for love
We live for love

I never planned to win the race
But you convinced me face to face
There was never a chance of losin' at all

We live for love
We live for love
We live for love
We live for love


We live for love
We live for love
We live for love
We live for loveEmbed
