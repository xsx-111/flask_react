In the Heat of the Night LyricsIn The Heat Of The Night, when you know it ain't right
But you do what you wanna do
You do what you feel, no one can feel like you
Out in the summertime city, ain't it a pity
There's so much to tie you down
You're leaving tonight to somewhere you can't be found
While down at the edge of town
At a pool hall where they all hang around
You hear them talkin' about the girls they knew
And talk about what they're gonna do
Then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?
Is it right, or is it wrong?
Does it matter what's right, In The Heat Of The Night?
Out in the streets tonight, under the neon lights
You're searchin' for something new
But nothin' is real, and no one can feel like you
They say that eagles fly in this red hot sky
But were they just passin' through
Or did they look down, and see what you found was true
But still in the back of your mind
You've got somethin' to believe in, but there's so much to find
As the bright lights dim, and the night closes in
You thought everything is ending, but it's yet to begin
And you ain't seen nothing yet!
But what you see you'll never forget, and you'll say
Why oh Why)
Did it take you so long to want something more?
Why oh Why)
Did you never get off on this before?
Why oh Why)
Well, here it is, the love you've been waitin' for
Why oh Why)
Standin' in front of you like an open door
And then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?
Is it right, or is it wrong?
Does it matter what's right, In The Heat Of The Night?
In The Heat Of The Night, when you know it ain't right
But you do what you wanna do
You do what you feel, 'cause no one can feel like youEmbed
