If You Think You Know How to Love Me LyricsA breathless drive on a downtown street
Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run, though we run it still burned our eyes
Oh, yes we can walk on the wild, wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise, you can take my hand
And show me the way to understand
So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
A reckless night in a nameless town
And we moved out of sight, with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe
Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn, and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands
It's up to you to make me understand
So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes, if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really, really want me to stay
You've got to lead the wayEmbed
