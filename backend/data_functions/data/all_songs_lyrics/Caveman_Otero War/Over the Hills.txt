Over the Hills Lyrics
You never said it would be easy
How could I explain all the time we spent?
Just always thought there was a problem

How could I
Just try to feel alright
Try to work it out
With only little time

Wait a minute for the moment
Everything you say has the right to stay
To look  for the progress
How could I, how could I?
It's not just opened up for no one
So it won't amount to the wrong we make
It's just the echo of an old room

How could I
Just try to feel alright
Try to work it out
With so much little time
In the middle now
You want to seem alright
It changes over time
You're having memories of the old way
But there's no reward for a cold embrace
It's like the mirror is never ending

How could
I just try to feel alright
Try to work it out
With so much little time
In the middle now
You want to seem alright
It changes over timeEmbed
