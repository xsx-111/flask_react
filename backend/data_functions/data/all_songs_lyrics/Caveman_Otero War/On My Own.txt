On My Own LyricsIf there was another way
I think about things that we once said
Give it just another try
'Cause you don't want me, I'll be on my own
Should we have another day
To take a chance on everything we had
Give it just another try
'Cause you don't want me, I'll be on my own
Own, own, own
Own, own, own
Own, own
Should we make a plan to stay
Or can we make it up another way
Tell me if it was a lie
'Cause you don't want me, I'll be on my own
Could there be another day
Where hopefully these things won't be so bad
Give it just another try
'Cause you don't want me, I'll be on my own
Own, own, own
Own, just like anybody else
It's coming up real loud
It's the way it always was
Or am I just looking out
I don't wanna talk about it
Is there any other way
So we can take this all out of our minds
To make it easy over time
'Cause you don't want me, I'll be on my own
Own, own
Own, just like everybody else
It's coming up real loud
It's the way it always was
Or am I just looking out
I don't wanna talk about it
You don't want me, I'll be on my own
You don't want me, I'll be on my own
You don't want me, I'll be on my ownEmbed
