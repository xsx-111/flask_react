80 West LyricsYou always had a good reason
But I don't need one at all
I never really thought you should believe someone
Who's been down all the time
You let me in on your feelings
And now they're easy to read
I never really thought you would believe someone
Who's been down all the time
Because I cannot wait so long to say I'm leavin'
'cause of you
Yeah suppose that way of livin will be easy
'cause of youEmbed
