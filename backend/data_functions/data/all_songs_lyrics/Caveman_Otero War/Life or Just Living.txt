Life or Just Living LyricsYou wanna know what I'm seeing?
Is it too hard to find?
Just like a book that's full of answers
But your pages left behind
Is it life or just living?
And would you even know?
The road ahead is never ending
With so far left to go
You've come around with a reason
Just to ease our minds
Cuz if you don't I'll be leaving
With what I couldn't find
You've got that look in your eyes
You've got that look in your eyes
How come it always keeps starting over?
It's the way I am
What a feeling
Take a breath or just breathe in
So you can rewind h
May be a fool for believing
Or was I always blind?
I found that look so deceiving
Cuz it hurts every time
You put my head on the ceiling
To watch it all unwind
You got that look in your eyes
You got that look in your eyes
How come it always keeps starting over?
This is the way I am
What a feeling
Does it feel like
You wanna be after the moment
And I know that
Yeah I know it
X 4
You got that look in your eyes
You got that look in your eyes
You got that look in your eyes
How come it always keeps starting over?
It's just the way I am
What a feeling
It's just the way I am
What a feeling
It's just the way I am
What a feelingEmbed
