Never Going Back Lyrics
Changed my mind
In a lonely room
I wanna take you down in the morning
Still I'm wide awake
When the day is done
Just the light that leads me back again
Changed my mind
When I fell for you
I wanna know what it's like but I can't pull through
Still I'm wide awake
And the day is done
Just the light that leads me back again

Uuh uuh
Never going back again
Uuh uuh
Never going back again

Changed my mind
Just to see what's you
I wanna do it first to make it through
Still I'm wide awake
And the feeling's gone
Just a light that leads me back again
Uuh uuh
Never going back again
Uuh uuh
Never going back again


Uuh uuh
Never going back again
Uuh uuh
Never going back again
Uuh uuh
Never going back againEmbed
