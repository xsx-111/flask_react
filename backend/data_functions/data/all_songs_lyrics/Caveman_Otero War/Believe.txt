Believe LyricsI thought you would have stayed
Why’d you leave
I went too far and I wasn’t home again
And you and me believe
I agree
Just waiting up for the sun again
I know it’s not for me
Well I believe
It took a moment to find out where I’ve been
And you are just a thing I could see
But know what an open mind would need
So I promise to protect you
Put it in my mind
It’ll come out in the end now
Cause inside there’s a dream stalking me
Well there is never a normal time to end
But you had all the dreams I would need
I’m waiting up for the sun again
Just waiting up for this one again
So I promise to protect you
Put it in my mind
It’ll come out in the end nowEmbed
