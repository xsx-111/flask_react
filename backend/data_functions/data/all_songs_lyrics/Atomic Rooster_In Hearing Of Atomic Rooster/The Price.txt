The Price LyricsI just won't want your love
No, I don't, no, I don't
I just won't have your love
No, I won't, no, I won't
I just don't want your love
No, I don't, no, I don't
I just won't have your love
No, I won't, no, I won't
If I had known the truth before I never would have stayed
If I had looked behind your eyes and seen beyond the grave
I never would have saved my soul to buy a heart for me
But now the bargain has been made and Satan wants a fee
But now the bargain has been made and Satan wants a fee
You can take my soul
You can have my soul
You can take my soul
You can have my soul
You can take my soul (Do it, do it)
You can have my soul (Do it, do it)
You can take my soul (Do it, do it)
You can have my soul (Do it, do it)
When I see you I can't believe the deed that I have done
I could have had a million things but I chose only one
I sacrificed my soul for you, I cannot change my fate
I look upon the one I love and all I feel is hate
I just don't want your love
No, I don't, no, I don't
I just won't have your love
No, I won't, no, I won't
I just won't want your love
No, I don't, no, I don't
I just won't have your love
No, I won't, no, I won't
I just don't want your love
No, I don't, no, I don't
I just won't have your love
No, I won't, no, I won't
I just don't want your love
No, I won't, no, I won't
I just don't want your love
No, I don't, no, I don't
If I had known the truth before, I never would have stayed
If I had looked behind your eyes and seen beyond the grave
I never would have sold my soul to buy a heart for me
But now the bargain has been made and Satan wants a fee
But now the bargain has been made and Satan wants a fee
Now you got to pay the price (I don't want to pay)
Now you got to pay the price (I don't want to pay)
Now you got to pay the price (I just don't want to pay)
Now you got to pay the price (Oh, no, no)
Now you got to pay the price (I just don't want to pay)
Now you got to pay the price... (No, no, no...)Embed
