Black Snake LyricsCrane-Darnell
Black snake living in a black hole, hiding from the sun
Black snake living in a black hole 'till the game is won
Black snake living in a black hole, hiding from the sun
Black evil hides in the darkness when the night is come
Black evil hides in the darkness when the night is come
BLack snake, black snake, black snake, black snake
Black snake living in a black hole, waiting for the man
Black snake living in a black hole, doing what he can
Black snake living in a black hole, hiding for the sun
Black evil hides in the darkness when the night is come
Black evil hides in the darkness when the night is come
Tell me sisiter, tell me child
What's in the dark black makes you feel so wild ?
Tell me brother, tell me child
What's in the dark black makes you feel so wild ?
Black snake, black snake, black snake, black snake
Black snake living in a dark hole, hiding from the sun
Black snake living in a dark hole 'till the game is won
Black snake living in a black hole, hiding from the sun
Black evil hides in the darkness when the night is come
Black evil hides in the darkness when the night is come
Tell me sister, tell me child
What's in the dark black makes you feel so wild ?
Tell me brother, tell me child
What's in the dark black makes you feel so wild ?
Black snake, black snake, black snake, black snakeEmbed
