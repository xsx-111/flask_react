Breakthrough LyricsCrane-Darnell
An invisible prison encircles my mind
I wait for a vision, I search for a sign
An invisible prison is built around me
There may be a guard, but there isn't a key
I got to break-out, I have to be free
I got to break-out, it's stifling me
Help me!
I got to make a breakthrough
I got to make a breakthrough
I got to make a breakthrough
I got to make a breakthrough
Now!
I must find a way, I must find a way
I must find a way,out of here
An invisible prison, I cannot escape
With walls I can't see,with walls I can't break
An invisible prison,how can I be free?
There isn't a guard, for the jailer is me
I got to break-out, I have to be free
I got to break out, it's stifling me
Help me!
I got to make a breakthrough
I got to make a breakthrough
I got to make a breakthrough
I got to make a breakthrough
Now!
I must find a way, I must find a way
I must find a way out of here
There's got to be a way, yeah,there's got to be a way
There's got to be a way on out of here, babe, yeah
I can't find a way, I can't find a way
I can't find a way out of here
There must be a way, there must be a way
There must be a way out of here
Let me out,let me out, let me out please!
Oh,there must be a way, there must be a way
There must be a way out of hereEmbed
