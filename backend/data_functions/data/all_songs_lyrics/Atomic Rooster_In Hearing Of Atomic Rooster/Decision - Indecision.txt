Decision / Indecision LyricsCrane-Darnell
I don't know what went wrong, I just can't find the reason
I thought the game was won, but facts can be deceiving
So I’m going to find the way, to become what I am
I’m going to find the way, back home
I don't know how I lost the secret I was holding
Like far beneath the flood, it has been crushed and broken
So I’m going to find the way, to become what I am
I’m going to find the way, back home
I’m going to find the way, to become what I am
I’m going to find the way, back home
I don't know what went wrong, I just can't find the reason
I thought the game was won, but facts can be deceiving
So I’m going to find the way, to become what I am
I’m going to find the way, back home
I’m going to find the way, to become what I am
I’m going to find the way, back home
Find a way back home, going to find the way back home
Going to find my way - back homeEmbed
