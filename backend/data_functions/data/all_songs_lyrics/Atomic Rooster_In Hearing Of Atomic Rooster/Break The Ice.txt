Break The Ice LyricsDuCann
Everything you say, evil woman you
Taking all you can, everything you do
Guess I’m the one, yes I’m the one
Tread a dirty road, close away the day
Careful now, you look.look the other way
Guess I’m the one, yes I’m the one
'Cos I’m the one, , yes I’m the one
You can't stop, oh, the way you feel
Can you know ? can you understand ?
When I see you trying to be so nice
Coming closer now, breaking the ice
Come along with me, time for you to pay
In the heat of night I will show the way
Guess I’m the one, yes I’m the one
In the cold of day you will never find
The amorbid sensor hidden in my mind
Guess I’m the one, yes I’m the one
'Cos I’m the one, yes I’m the one
You can't stop, oh, the way I feel
Can you know ? can you understand ?
For when I see you trying to be so nice
Coming closer now, breaking the ice
Everything you say, evil woman you
Taking all you can, everything you do
Guess I’m the one, yes I’m the one
Tread a dirty road, close away the day
Careful now, you look.look the other way
Guess I’m the one, yes I’m the one
'Cos I’m the one, yes I’m the one
Yes I’m the one, yes I’m the oneEmbed
