Head In The Sky LyricsDuCann
The scared are the chosen few
Looking for the times we knew
Colour of the day's gone by
Hang your head up to the sky
The sky, your head's in the sky
The day's going by
Fight for the nights you had
All the good take from the bad
Sign up on the dotted line
Payment for the times you died
You die, your head's in the sky
Your head's in the sky
The day's going by
Your head's in the sky
The scared are the chosen few
Looking for the times we knew
Colour of the day's gone by
Hang your head up to the sky
The sky, your head's in the sky
The day's going by
Your head's in the sky
The day's going by
Your head's in the sky
The day's going by
Your head's in the sky
The day's going byEmbed
