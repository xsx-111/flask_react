All American Girl LyricsSkin tight soul delight
Changing her life for another
She dreams magazines
Sees herself on the cover
Anything anytime anywhere
It's fitting in that matters
Faithfully she believes in the look he wants to know better
She knows what she wants
She's an all American girl
She knows what she needs
She's a sold American girl
She knows what she knows
She's an all American girl
She does what she does
She's an all American girl
Sold American
She's got a Double Bubble with a bossanova back
She's a real hot pepper and I like it like that
It's all right you don't have to change your way
You're all right I'm hoping the best part stays
She knows what she wants
She's an all American girl
She knows what she needs
She's a sold American girl
She knows what she knows
She's an all American girl
She does what she does
She's an all American girl
Sold American
Street smart close to the heart gotta be real
More than the clothes you wear
You know what you've got look to your heart
You carry your history thereEmbed
