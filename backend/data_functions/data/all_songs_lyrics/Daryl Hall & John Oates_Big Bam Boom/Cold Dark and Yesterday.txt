Cold Dark and Yesterday Lyrics
The sun beats down so slow
I feel my body heating up inside (Oh)
I watch the danger zone
For signs of life but not a soul alive
Try every trick I know
To keep my temperature from blowing sky-high (Oh)
Check on the time to go
Lay my spirit down to fantasize

Disembark, disconnect possibilities unknown
On the edge of a heading for heavy weather (Oh)
I suspect, I can tell, I can feel it in my bones
All not well but you never, never, never know

(Cold and it's dark) I'm feeling cold
(It's cold and it's dark) I'm feeling cold
(Cold and it's dark) I feel the chill is all around me, yeah (Yesterday)
(Cold and it's dark)
Just like the space in my heart
(Cold and it's dark) It's cold and it's dark and it's yesterday (Yesterday)

Glamorama all around me
Friendly natives turning back to brown (Oh)
I keep my shades well down
They cannot penetrate what can't be found (Oh)
Feel the fever start to rise
Slip away in indiscreet disguise (Oh)
How can a man survive when the weak meet the soft
And the heat blinds your eyes?
(So I )
Left to right, up and down
Well, it's picture postcard time
Hear the sounds, save the image in my mind

(Cold and it's dark) I'm feeling cold
(It's cold and it's dark) I'm feeling cold
(Cold and it's dark) I feel the chill is all around me, yeah (Yesterday)
(Cold and it's dark)
Just like the space in my heart
(Cold and it's dark) It's cold... (Yesterday)


(Cold and it's dark) I'm feeling cold
(It's cold and it's dark) I'm feeling cold
(Cold and it's dark) I feel the chill is all around me, yeah (Yesterday)
(Cold and it's dark)
Just like the space in my heart
(Cold and it's dark) It's cold and it's dark and it's yesterday (Yesterday)

Disembark, disconnect possibilities unknown
On the edge of a heading for heavy weather
(Cold and it's dark)
() (Oh)
Left to right, up and down (Cold and it's dark)
Well, it's picture postcard time
Hear the sounds, save the image in my mind
(Cold and it's dark)
When the weak meet the soft
Well, how can a man survive? (Oh)
Feel the heat start to rise (Cold and it's dark)
Glamorama all around
(Oh)
(Cold and it's dark)
I suspect, I can tell, I can feel it in my bones
All not well but you never, never, never... (Oh)
(Cold and it's dark)
(Cold and it's dark)
(Cold and it's dark)Embed
