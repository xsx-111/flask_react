Del Davis Tree Farm LyricsDel Davis sold Christmas trees
Stood up to 8 feet tall
Season was lookin' mighty thin
He'd hoped to sell 'em all
Here he comes with a dollar in his hand
Represents the epitomized man
The boy liked rock 'n' roll
Seemed that's the way he paid his way
With the help of Del and them "Doogs"
There's a bit more joy this holiday
Here he comes with a dollar in his hand
He represents the epitomized man
He's Del Davis, one hell of a guy
Out on GravensteinEmbed
