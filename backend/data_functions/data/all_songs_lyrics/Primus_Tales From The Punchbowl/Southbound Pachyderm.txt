Southbound Pachyderm LyricsQuite a surprise
What an ingenious device
Boredom encompasses my time
I don't know what I should do
Indulging a moment of your time
Seldom the breeder of lies
But you won't believe that it's true
They take to the skies
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
Pinholes through cardboard at the sun
Passing the bucks by one by one
Leaving nothing in return
Watching the majesty blow past
Speculating which will be the last
Savoring my piece of pie
And there is no reprise
They're filling the skies
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
Southbound Pachyderm
