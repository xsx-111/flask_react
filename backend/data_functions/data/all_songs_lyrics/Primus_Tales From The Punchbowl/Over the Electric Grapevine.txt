Over the Electric Grapevine LyricsThey headed southward from San Francisco
To be with Chuckles and the others
With electric in the air
And peroxide in their hair
They looked like golden brothers
They drove a Datsun, an automatic
The radio blaring static
Made a face into the light
Burst out laughing at the sight
The hysteria ensuing would dominate the night
From all the candy the seats were sticky
As they were drawn into the Grapevine
Then "Introduce Yourself" came on
As the barreled through the fog
The demon puffing madly on a mentholated log
They were tired, they were sleepy
So they parked behind the Roxy
Adam went to use the phone
So they sat there all alone
When Adam's voice came beaming through on the radio
He started laughing
He started laughing
La da da
Hey hey!

Vive la France
