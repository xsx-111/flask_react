Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding Lyrics
The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Is gonna grow and die

Oh it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
While if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow
And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you so I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Ooh oh
Ooh
Oh oh oh oh ooh
Love lies bleeding in my hands
Oh
Oh ohEmbed
