The Big Medley Lyrics
So 'ya
Thought 'ya
Might like to
Go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind this cold eyes?
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise
Lights...
Roll the sound effects...
Action...
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)



So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

You make me weep
And wanna die
Just when
You said we'd try
Loving, touching, squeezing
Each other
When I'm alone
Oh by myself
You're out
With someone else
Loving, touching, squeezing
Each other
You're tearing me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearing me apart
Oh what can I say?
You're tearing me apart
It won't be long, no
Until you're alone
When you're lover
Oh he hasn't come home
Because he's loving, oh he's touching, he's squeezing
Another
He's tearing you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearing you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
'Cause he's loving, touching, another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry




Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on
Turn it on, turn it on againEmbed
