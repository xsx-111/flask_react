Perfect Strangers Lyrics
Can you remember
Remember my name
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Ooooh and cold
Cold spirits of ice (ice ice)
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning
The echo of a point in time
In distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Ooooh and laughing
As the spirits appear
Ooooh all your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers
Oooooh ooh
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow
Oh

A strand of silver
Hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind
Ooooh is aching
With the dead of the night
Precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain
Perfect strangers
