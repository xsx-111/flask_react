The Rover / Achilles Last Stand / The Song Remains the Same Lyrics


It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turn to you you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Woah the songs to sing
When we at last return again yeah
Oh
Oh
Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
To know the streets the seaman hears
The devil in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah
Oh
Ooh
Into the sun the south the north
Lies the first of hope
Shackles of commitment fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd yeah
Oh oooh
To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path
That churns up into stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head with heavy feet, yeah
Ooooh
Oh

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Here we go
Wanted to know, oh oh
Sing out Hare, Hare, oh
Dance the Hoochie Koo
The city lights
Oh so bright
As we go sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding
Through
Oooh
All rightEmbed
