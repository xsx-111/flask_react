Beachball Lyrics
Tonight's alive
The beachball's set to fly
Those well tequilaed guys
Who smile at strangers
À tes souhaits
À tes amours chéri
You give a little sneeze
And dance the rhu-rhu-rhu-rhu-rhumba

This life is sweet
We're dancing in the street
Who knows who you might meet?
You'll do fine

The little weekends here
Thursday has an ear
The kaffeeklatsch career
She talks to strangers
And kissing by the sea
Particular to me
'ti punch, mojito, sling
And dance the rhu-rhu-rhu-rhu-rhumba
This life is sweet
We're dancing in the street
Who knows who you might meet?
You'll do fine

We flash the seaside sky
With starfish butterflies
To cast a spell and welcome locals
Weekenders and strangers

You'll do fine
You'll do fine
You'll do fineEmbed
