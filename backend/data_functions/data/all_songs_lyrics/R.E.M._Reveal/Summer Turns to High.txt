Summer Turns to High Lyrics
Mercury is rising still
Turn the fan on high
I won't step on my own shadow
No-one wants to cry
Someone put a pox on me
I'll spit in their eyes

Summer turns to high

With my bedsheet cape and sandals
Circle citronella candles
Summer's here the light is raising hopes and dragonflies
If those hopes are overshadowed by cotton-candy, caramel-apple

Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high
Summer high

After wine and nectarines the fireflies in time
Move like syrup through the evening with a sweet resign
I won't pine for what could have been
I'm preoccupied
Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high
Summer turns to high
Summer highEmbed
