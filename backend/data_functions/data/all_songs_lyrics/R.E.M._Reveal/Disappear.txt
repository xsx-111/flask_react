Disappear Lyrics
I've dragged my feet across the seat
And jumped out the passenger side
The only thing worth looking for
Is what you find inside
But that had not yet appeared
Lost, invisible here
Tel Aviv and Agadir
Taroudant and Olomouc
Before I learned to see
The vanishing point appear

I looked for you and everywhere
I looked for you and everywhere

There is a calm I haven't come to yet
I spent half my life figuring what comes next
I telescoped in, I finally win
I finally win the prize
That now my eyes see a comic's
Perfect timing squeezed
I'm head-first fighting everything
The crushing force of memory
Erasing all I've been
The vanishing point appears
I looked for you and everywhere
I looked for you and everywhere
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear

Look at this face
Can you believe it?
Am I living in a beautiful vacuum?
Because I can't see it
The vanishing point appears

I looked for you and everywhere
I looked for you and everywhere
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear
I came to disappear1Embed
