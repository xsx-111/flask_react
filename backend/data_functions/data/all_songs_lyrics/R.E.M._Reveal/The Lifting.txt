The Lifting Lyrics
Grounded 5 a.m
The night lite is comforting
But gravity is holding you
Once settled into sleep
You have watched on repeat
The story of your life
Across the ceiling
And in review

You've said the air was singing
It's calling you you don't believe
These things you've never seen

"good morning, how are you?
The weather's fine, the sky is blue
It's perfect for our seminar
Now close your eyes
And start to breathe
Allow the noise to recede
Allow yourself to drift and fly away"
But you just stay

You've said the air was singing
It's calling you you don't believe
These things you've never seen

Did you hear these voices calling you

Locked into a conference room
"we're only what our minds assume
And rationale is leaving you
This conceit these systems of belief
Your counselor agrees
"you've always mark these boundaries now you're free
And with relief

You've said the air was singing
It's calling you you don't believe
These things you've never seen
Never heard
Never dreamed
You've said the air was singing
It's calling you you don't believe
These things you've never seen

Never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never
Never, never, never
Now once you had a dream
Of oceans and sunken cities
Memories of things you've never known
And you have never knownEmbed
