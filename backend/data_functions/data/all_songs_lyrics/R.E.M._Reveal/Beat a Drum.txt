Beat a Drum Lyrics
The sun reflected in
The back of my eye
I knocked my head against the sky
The dragonflies are busy buzzing me
A seahorse as if we were in the sea

Half way from coal
Half way to diamond
My fall knocked a mean chip out of me
I'm gathering as far as I can reach
Perched up on a precipice
And this is what I've seen

This is all I want
It's all I need
This is all I am
It's everything
This is all I want
It's all I need

A bluejay hectors from the felled Catalpa tree
Doctorate in science and a theologian's dream
The dragonflies are trying to lecture me
A seahorse as if we were in the sea
This is all I want
It's all I need
This is all I am
It's everything
This is all I want
It's all I need

Beat a drum for me
Like a butterfly wing
Tropical storm across the ocean
But don't explain I'm sure I'll want to know
Don't forget we're just half way from coal

This is all I want
It's all I need
This is all I am
It's everything
This is all I want
It's all I needEmbed
