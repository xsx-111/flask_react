She Just Wants to Be Lyrics
It's not that she walked away
Her world got smaller
All the usual places
The same destinations
Only something's changed
It's not that she wasn't rewarded
With pomegranate afternoons
And Mingus, Chet Baker and chess
It's not stampeding fortune
Or prim affectations
She's off on her own
But she knows
Now is greater than the whole
Of the past
Is greater and now she knows

She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be
She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be

It's not that the transparency
Of her earlier incarnations
Now looked back on
Weren't rich and loaded
With beautiful vulnerability
And now she knows
Now is greater
Now is greater
And she knows that

She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be
She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be

Now is greater
Now is greater
And she knows that

She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be
She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be
She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be
She just wants to be somewhere
She just wants to be
It's not like if angels
Could truly look down
Stir up the trappings
And light on the ground
Remind us of what, when, why or who
That how's up to us
Me and you
And now is greater than the whole
Of the past
Is greater and now she knows that

Now she knowsEmbed
