Forty Days And Forty Nights LyricsForty days and forty nights
Since my baby done left this town
Oh the sun shinin' all day long
But the rain it just keeps on comin' down
She's my life I need her so
Why she left I just don't know
Forty days and forty nights
Since I sat right down and cried
It keeps on rainin' all the time
But the river is runnin' dry
Lord help me it just ain't right
I love that girl with all my might
Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby done broke my heart
I've been searchin' for her everywhere
Just like a blind man in the dark
Love can make a poor man rich
Or break his heart, I don't know which
Forty days and forty nights
Like a ship out on the stormy sea
I've been prayin' for her every night
That she would come back home to me
Life is love and love is light
I hope she comes back home tonightEmbed
