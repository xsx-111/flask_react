Fat Jack LyricsFAT JACK by STEPPENWOLF
Rolly Poly Fat Man
Thunder down the hall
On your way to breakfast
You got to have it all
A plate of cold spaghetti
One day on the floor
Clean your chops and take time
To contemplate your stall
Every morning, pass by the mirror
Chuckle at your smiling face
"So good to see youâ€"you're looking good"
Good to see you
Now you're on your way
Flag a cab to Getchell
"Hey boy, Guv'nah Way!
Hey now, where you headed?
The Albert's on your right"
Fat Jack where are you going?
I can see you walking down the road
Fat Jack where are you going?
I can't understand how you tote your own load
Rolly Poly Fat Man
Spin your swivel chair
Next time 'round you'll catch up
If business war is fair
5 o'clock is closing
Give yourself a raise
Didn't get no business
But you made my whole day
Every morning, pass by the mirror
Chuckle at your smiling face
Every morning, pass by the mirror
Strapped in a self embrace
"So good to see youâ€"you're looking good"
Good to see you
Now you're on your way
Hey Jack, Fat Jack where you goin'?Embed
