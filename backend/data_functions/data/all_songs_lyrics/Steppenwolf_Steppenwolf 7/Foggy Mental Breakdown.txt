Foggy Mental Breakdown LyricsHear me holler down the mountain side
I'm near the sky blinking at the evil eye
Hear me holler at the city's grind
It stole my soul just about lost my mind
Let the loneliness roll in
Like the foggy mountain dew
Wipe the madness from my eye
'Till my anger slowly dies
When the shadow play begins
I'll be watching thru the night
'Till I find myself again
Hear me holler cross the sea of light
It took my dream and smashed it 'gainst the night
Hear me holler at the town below
Got nothing left to make me stay and no place left to go
Let the loneliness roll in
Like the foggy mountain dew
Wipe the madness from my eye
'Till my anger slowly dies
When the shadow play begins
I'll be watching thru the night
'Till I find myself againEmbed
