Brides of Jesus LyricsMatthew stood by the wall and watched his love below
Her pale hair came in golden rings down below her shoulders
As she waved and slowly turned around
To find the path that led her to the ancient gate was closed
She said Matthew why won't you tell me what it is you see
Your smile so wide this figured grin
You look as if, you look as if you're looking right through me
Why won't you tell me how it is you see
Through the darness all around me
No amulets or chains will work to keep the demons from
Or hide the night filled eyes from the brides of Jesus
The brides of Jesus
The brides of Jesus
Keep them over me
Keep them over me, can't you see
On tender-hooks and to be pleasure bent
His voice it scratched the air
May bring you so much sorrow
That you may be entertaining angels unawaresEmbed
