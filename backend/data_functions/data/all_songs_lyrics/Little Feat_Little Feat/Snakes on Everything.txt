Snakes on Everything LyricsSomeone looking out for me
You can step right up and show yourself if you will
It seems like I've been hiding from my friends too long
You can take over for a while-- I need the rest
A chance to laugh it off
I ain't made sense in so long -- I almost quit trying
This can't be the way it's supposed to work
I've tried by myself and now I want to try it out with you
You may not believe I need it -- I haven't shown it in the past
It took me a while to get above myself
I barely made the test
You're out there and I feel you
So come on out of hiding
Someone looking out for me
You can step right up and show yourself if you will
It seems like I've been hiding from my friends too long
You can take over for a while -- I need the rest
A chance to laugh it off
I ain't made sense in so long -- I almost quit tryingEmbed
