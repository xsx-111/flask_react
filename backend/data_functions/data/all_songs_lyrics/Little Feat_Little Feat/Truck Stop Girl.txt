Truck Stop Girl LyricsHis tail-lights flickered as he pulled up to the truck stop
The same old crowd was hanging out again tonite
He said fill up my tank while I go check my load
It feels like it's shifting all around
He was the kind of man
Do all he could
Above all he had integrity
But he was so young
And on a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girl
As he went inside hew was merrily greeted
By the girl with who he was in love
She held out a glass and said have another
This is the last time we can meet
With her hair piled up high and a look in her eye
That would turn any good man's blood to wine
All his eyes could see, all his eyes could see
Was the stares from all those around him
He ran out to the lot and climbed into his rig
And drove off without tightening down
It was a terrible thing
To see what remained of the rig that poor danny was in
But he was so young
On a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girl
But he was so young
On a ten city run
In love with a truck stop girlEmbed
