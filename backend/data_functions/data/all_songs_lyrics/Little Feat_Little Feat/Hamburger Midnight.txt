Hamburger Midnight LyricsSquare knees was asking for a reason
How can I go sleeping in a car
I got red hot tires, my tires are smokin'
I'm so broke I don't want to stop
My gears are crying
My gears are crying
I got the ha hamburger
Ha hamburger
I got the ha hamburger midnight blues
Got a grease mother, she's a holder finder
Keeper of the scooter gas
You gotta lift your tail and seal you fate
Snort the crank your old man stashed
And ride a tin can
Ride a tin can street machine
Square knees was asking for a reason
How can I go sleeping in a car
I got red hot tires, my tires are smokin'
I'm so broke I don't want to stop
My gears are crying
My gears are crying
I got the ha hamburger
I got the ha hamburger
I got the ha hamburger midnight bluesEmbed
