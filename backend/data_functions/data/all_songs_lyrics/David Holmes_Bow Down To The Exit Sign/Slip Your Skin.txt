Slip Your Skin LyricsYou are like the sun, you're burning blind
I can see the magic in your eyes
I'm blown away ... wind
No sense of gravity I spin
Slip, slip, slip your skin
Feed, feed, feed your sin
Give it, give it, give it ... penetrate
I'm a fiend for fire, you can't stop me
Blind your eyes, ... to make a body
... hand...
Skinny cat, copy funk (?)
Slip, slip, slip your skin
Feed, feed, feed your sin
Give it, give it, give it ... penetrate
He was a ... clean, this motherswingin (?)
You are like the sun, you're burning blind
I can see the magic in your eyes
I'm blown away ... wind
No sense of gravity I spin
Bobby Gillespie & Martina:
Slip, slip, slip your skin
Feed, feed, feed your sin
Give it, give it, give it ... penetrate
He was a ... clean, this motherswingin (?)
Give it, give it, give it
(repeated)
No one, you and me
We see colours they can't see
There's no one here, just you and me
We see colours they can't see
There's no one here, just you and me
We see colours they can't see
Slip, slip, slip your skin
Feed, feed, feed your sin
Slip, slip, slip your skin
Feed, feed, feed your sin
Give it, give it give it
Slip, slip, slip your skin
Feed, feed, feed your sin
Give it, give it, give it
Slip, slip, slip your skin
