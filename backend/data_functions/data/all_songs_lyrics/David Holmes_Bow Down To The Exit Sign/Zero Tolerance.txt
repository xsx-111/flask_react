Zero Tolerance LyricsI saw you
Across the ice
We skate together
Across the water
Daddy, daddy
Won't you try
I'm so alone
This obsession cannot be mine
I don't wanna be
A rock star
I don't wanna be
Your singing song (?)
(I can't believe)
I can't believe
(You can't feel)
You can't feel
(What I feel)
What I feel
(Or what I ... you)
Or what I ... you
(x2)
I saw you and (?) all your faces
You took me to so many different places
It was enough
To be decided
Where's the fun
When you're gonna hide it
I never struggle in my arms
I never love in the dark
I don't wanna be
A rock star
I don't wanna be
Your singing song
(I can't believe)
I can't believe
(You can't feel)
You can't feel
(What I feel)
What I feel
(Or what I ... you)
Or what I ... you
(x3)
I saw you (I saw you)
Across the ice (across the ice)
We skate together (we skate together)
Across the water (across the water)
Daddy, daddy (Daddy, daddy)
Won't you try (won't you try)
I'm so alone (I'm so alone)
This obsession cannot be mine (can't be mine)
I don't wanna be
A rock star
I don't wanna be
Your singing song
(I can't believe)
I can't believe
(You can't feel)
You can't feel
(What I feel)
What I feel
(Or what I ... you)
Or what I ... youEmbed
