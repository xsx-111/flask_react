Outrun LyricsIn you and I
A crackled glace forever
My father's eye
He was up in the dark
Your clever tongue
Covers me in whispers
I struggle now
With a dawn, with a light
The glace of your eye
In the room is a shiver
You put your winter inside
It's home, no place to deliver
A part in ... becomes a part in time
And I can say, yeah
I'd like to go
Don't take it back
So I can tell you so (?)
And I can say
I'd like to go
Don't hold along (?)
In a strong home (?)
I alone
.. my head like a fly (?)
I think there's a guilty
Reborn in this world
Its smiling ear ties me by noon
... soon
And I can say, yeah
I'd like to go
Don't take it back
So I can tell you so (?)
And I can say
I'd like to go
Don't hold along (?)
In a strong home (?)
You can take me to let you know
You can see now beyond what is on shore
You can take me to let you got to know
You can now see me and what is on my shore
And I can say, yeah
I'd like to go
Don't take it back
So I can tell you so (?)
And I can say
I'd like to go
Don't hold along (?)
In a strong home (?)
And I can say, yeah
I'd like to go
To show you what you wanna see
.... on shore
You should take me to let you know
You can see now what is on shore
Propriety will keep you below
You can see now...
