Ghost Town LyricsCome on let's go down
Everybody's waiting for us down at the ghost town
Bill Bailey said he'd be around
If Mrs. G. Robinson would just put that bad Havana down
Lovely Queen Anne Boleyn
Learning new tricks
From the Great Houdini
And that's the way she's gonna make it
Come on, come on let's go down
Everybody's waiting for us down at the boom town
O. Redding an' Washington
Chico an' Harpo an' Karl are in the kitchen with mum
Buster Keaton and King Tut
Are waiting for Disney to wake up
Now that's the way
No that ain't the way he's gonna make itEmbed
