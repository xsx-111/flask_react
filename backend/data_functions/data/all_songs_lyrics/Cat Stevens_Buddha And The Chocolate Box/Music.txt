Music LyricsYesterday I was on the edge
Hopin' everything was going to work itself out
A good honest man doing the work of God
Trying to make things better for him
A lover of life in a school for fools
Tryin' to find another way to survive
New music, new music, new music
Sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world, can save us, oh, oh, oh
My friend said well, I think I found a way
To help make myself richer
I said don't you know , well, it won't be too long before
The bad old devil will get you back
Back I said put back your heart and sing, sing
While you know you're still living
Sing, sing, sing , while you know there's still
New music, new music, new music
Sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world, can save us, oh, oh, oh
Take a look at the world, think about how it will end
There'd be no wars in the world, if everybody joined the band
Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
Thered be no wars in the world
If everybody joined in the show, oh, oh
Think about the light in your eyes
Think about what you should know
There'd be no wars in the world
If everybody joined in the show, in the show
New music, sweet music can lighten us
Can brighten the world, oh, oh, oh
Yesterday I was on the edge
Hopin' everything was going to work itself out
A good honest man doing the work of God
Trying to make things better for him
A lover of life in a school for fools
Tryin' to find another way to surviveEmbed
