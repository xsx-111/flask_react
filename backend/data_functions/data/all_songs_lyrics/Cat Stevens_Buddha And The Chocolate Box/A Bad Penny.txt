A Bad Penny LyricsOh, don't say those same idle lies
I've heard them before
Oh oh, this fool who, who left half his heart on an early train
(Aaa aaa aaa ooh)
Won't buy no more
Oh no
Don't use those same weepin' eyes
I've wipe them no more
Oh oh, I didn't want to have to be cruel
But the truth must be said
You ain't heard enough
Oh, it was not so long ago
Since you wandered out of here
To become a silver model of a city on the air
So don't choke me with your lies
Because this man has open eyes, I can see
I can see
I can tell
Oh oh oh oh
Umm umm
I had it enough
All those sneaky bars and smart parties
Had enough
All those sweet friends and lovers
I've had enough
All those lonely rooms and blank faces
I've had enough
And I want you, I want you no more
I want you, I want you no more
I, I don't want
Oh no, don't say those same idle lies
I've heard them before
Oh oh, this fool who, who left half his heart on an early train
Won't buy no moreEmbed
