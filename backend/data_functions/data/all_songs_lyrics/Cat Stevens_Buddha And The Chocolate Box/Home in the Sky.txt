Home in the Sky LyricsCome the morning, I'll be far from here
Slowly rising in another sphere
Old world goodbye
'Cause I'll be home in the sky in the morning, bye bye
Stars are crying over my old house
But I'm still breathing happy above the clouds
Oh home, home at last
Because all of the bad times are past, past
Music is a lady that I still love
'Cause she gives me the air that I breathe
Music is a lady that I still need
'Cause she brings me the food that I eat
Come the morning, I'll be far from here
Slowly rising in another sphere
Home, world goodbye
'Cause I'll be home in the sky in the morning
Bye-bye, bye-byeEmbed
