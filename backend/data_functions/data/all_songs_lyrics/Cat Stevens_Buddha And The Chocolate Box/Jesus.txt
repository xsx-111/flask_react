Jesus LyricsThey used to call Him Jesus, long time ago
They're still calling Him Jesus, don't you know?
They crossed the wood and hanged Him a long time ago
They still misunderstand Him those who don't know
And in the evening his love will lead the blind
In every secret corner there in your mind
They called Him Gautama Buddha, oh long time ago
He turned the world to order, don't you know?
He used to sit knowing oh long time ago
Where you and me were going
And in the evening his love will lead the blindEmbed
