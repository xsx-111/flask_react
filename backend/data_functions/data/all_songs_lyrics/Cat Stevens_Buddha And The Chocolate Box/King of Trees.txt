King of Trees LyricsHe was the King of trees keeper of the leaves
A deep green God of young love stained memory
We used to meet by him far from the hustling town
I loved you now they've come to cut you down, down
He was the guardian of days we held the same
Beneath the shade he gave shelter from the rain
Oh Lord how it's empty now with nothing save the breeze, I love you
Now they've come to burn the leaves, don't burn the leaves
And if my mind breaks up in all so many ways
I know the meaning of the words, I love you
And if my body falls inside an early grave
The forest and the evergreens are coming to take me back
So slowly as I roll down the track
The forest and the evergreens are coming to take me back
The forest and the evergreens are coming to take me back, back
Please take me back
He was the King of trees keeper of the glades
The way he lightened my life makes me so amazed
We used to meet by him many years ago, I loved you
Now they've come to lay the road, don't lay the roadEmbed
