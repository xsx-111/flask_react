Sun/C79 LyricsSun is the reason
And the world it will bloom
'Cause sun lights the sky
And the sun lights the moon
Sun is the reason
All the happy trees are green
And who can explain
The light in your dream
Sit you down, sit you down young gentleman
There's something I want you to know
You keep on asking me
You keep on asking me why, why are we here?
It started a long time ago
Me and your Mum on the night
Yeah yeah yeah, we met
I was on the road again
She was in C79
I'll never, never forget
I'll never forget that night, no no
We met in a back road behind the stage
She had the best figure by far
A thousand hours I've looked at her eyes
But I still don't know what color they are
Me and your Mum on the night
Oh Lord, we met
I was on the road again
She was in C79
She was a junkie then
And I was having a good time
Back on the road again
Oh Momma I was on the road again
Back in suite 79
I'll never never forget
I'll never forget that time
Back on the road again
Oh I'm traveling that line
I was a pop star then
I'm still having a good timeEmbed
