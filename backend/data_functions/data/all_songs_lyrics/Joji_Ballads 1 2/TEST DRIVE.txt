TEST DRIVE Lyrics
She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She just wanna feel alive (She just wanna feel alive)
She just wanted more time (She just wanted more time)
I'm looking for a long ride (Looking for a long ride)
She just want a test drive (She just want a test drive)
Dying on the west side (Dying on the west side)
I'll see you in the next life (See you in the next life)

What do you want, babe? (What do you want, babe?)
I don't like when you taunt me (I don't like when you taunt me)
You've been calling the wrong name (Calling the wrong name)
I said what do you want, babe? (What do you want, babe?)
I'm working on my aim (Working on my aim)
I'm hoping you do the same (Do the same)
You got me afraid again (Got me afraid again)
So let me just pray again (So let me just pray again)

You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you
She don't wanna tell lies
She don't wanna tell lies
She just wanna feel alive
She just wanted more time
I'm looking for a long ride
She just want a test drive (What do you want, babe?)
Dying on the west side (What do you want, babe?)
I'll see you in the next life (Who do you want, babe?)

Waiting on a sacrificial life
Waiting on the ones who didn't fight
I told you not to waste my fucking time
I told you never sing that song, you lied

You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you

She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She don't wanna tell lies (She don't wanna tell lies)
She just wanna feel alive (She just wanna feel alive)
She just wanted more time (She just wanted more time)
I'm looking for a long ride (Looking for a long ride)
She just want a test drive (She just want a test drive)
Dying on the west side (Dying on the west side)
I'll see you in the next life (See you in the next life)84Embed
