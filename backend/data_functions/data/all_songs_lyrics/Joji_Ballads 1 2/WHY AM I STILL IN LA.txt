WHY AM I STILL IN LA Lyrics
Girl, you choke me sitting airtight (Airtight)
Ziploc right now
Will you let me win a fair fight?
Can't think right now
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right, I feel right
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right

I don't wanna live forever, no, L.A
I don't wanna live like that no more, L.A
Only when we sleep
A promise that you'll keep
That you will never weep
Until you fail to breathe
So sleep tight
You were right all my life

Falling for your red eyes (Red eyes)
Both dying right now (Right now, right now)
Got me back on my old life
You're not my gal
You're not mine, you're not mine
I'm not cool, you're not fine
My last line, they ask, "Why?"
Like they can't die (They can't die)
I don't wanna live forever, no, L.A
I don't wanna live like that no more, L.A
Only when we sleep
A promise that you'll keep
That you will never weep
Until you fail to breathe
So sleep tight
You were right all my life

Girl, you choke me sitting airtight (Airtight)
Ziploc right now
Will you let me win a fair fight?
Can't think right now
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right, I feel right
I can't lie, on my mind
I feel right...19Embed
