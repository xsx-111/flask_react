R.I.P. Lyrics
There's no more time
Just lay it on me
If I lost my life
You can blame it on me
Are you ready or not?
We can start right here
Take you on them rocks
So crystal clear

Oh, oh, oh
Are they talkin' 'bout us?
Are they talkin' 'bout us? (Yeah)
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
Are they talkin' 'bout us?
Are they talkin' 'bout us?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Tryna find your love, put your love above
Baby all we need is trust, no one know but us
No one know but us
No one know but us, yeah

Me and you, you and I
I would die for you
Do or die for you
Suicide for you
R.I.P., I would die for you
R.I.P., huh, I would die for you
R.I.P., huh, I would die for you
R.I.P., huh, I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you, ayy
There's no more time
Just lay it on me
If I lost my life
You can blame it on me
Are you ready or not?
We can start right here
Take you on them rocks
So crystal clear

Woah, I would die for you
I would die for you, yeah
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you
R.I.P., R.I.P., I would die for you
You, you19Embed
