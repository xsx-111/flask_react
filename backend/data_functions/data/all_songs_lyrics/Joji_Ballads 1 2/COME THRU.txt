COME THRU Lyrics
Won't you come through?
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimming like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default

No, red rocks so bright (So bright)
You can open your eyes
Hell all rise
Make you so blind (So blind)
With a thousand teeth like a Leviathan
Biting tightly on my wrist, it look like heaven
Weighing tightly on my neck until it breaks
If I lived too long, you'd kill me with a stake
No mistake, no mistake, no mistake
No mistake
The reflection never point the same way
ABBA on repeat, yeah
Diamonds like a dancing queen, so...

Won't you come through?
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimming like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default
Won't you come through?
Water on me
We gon' walk right through
And I'm swimming like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default28Embed
