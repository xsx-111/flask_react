Down on the Street Lyrics
Well, down on the street where the faces shine
Floatin' around, on a real O-Mind
I see a pretty thing - ain't no wall
I see a pretty thing - ain't no wall

No walls!
No walls!
No walls!

Yeah, deep in the night, I'm lost in love
Yeah, deep in the night, I'm lost in love
A thousand eyes
Look at you
A thousand lights
Look at you

I don't!
I'm lost!
I'm lost!
Yeah!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
*Grunt*
Come on, come on!
Yeah!
Yeah!

*Grunt*
Oooh, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

Where the faces shine
A real O-Mind
A real O-Mind
I'm a real O-Mind
A real O-MindEmbed
