Fun House Lyrics
Blow right on it, now!
Blow, Steve!
I feel alright
Yeah, I feel alright
Let me in
Hey, let me in
'Ey, bring it down

Callin' from the fun house with my song
We been separated, baby, far too long
A-callin' all you whoop-dee pretty things
Shinin' in your freedom, come and be my rings

Hold me tight, callin' from the fun house
Hold me tight, callin' from the fun house

Yeah, I came to play and I mean to play around
Yeah, I came to play and I mean to play real good
Yeah, I came to play
Alright
Hey, let me in
Take it down
I feel alright
A-take it down
Little baby girlie, little baby boy
Cover me with lovin' in a bundle o' joy
Do I care to show you what I'm dreamin' of
Do I dare to whoop y'all with my love
Every little baby knows just what I mean
Livin' in division in a shiftin' scene

Hold me tight, callin' from the fun house
Hold me tight, callin' from the fun house

Blow
Yeah, I came to play
I came to play
Blow, Steve!
Hey
Hey now
Let me in
One more time
Take it down
Take it down
A-take it down
We been separated
We been separated
A little too long
Blow
Yeah, I came to play
Yeah, fun house, boy, will steal your heart away
Yeah, fun house, boy, will steal your heart away
Steal
Yeah
I came to play
I came to play
I came to play
This is it
Baby
Yeah, I came to play
I came to playEmbed
