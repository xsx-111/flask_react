1970 Lyrics
Whoo!
Whoo!

Out of my mind on Saturday night
1970 rollin' in sight
Radio burnin' up above
Beautiful baby, feed my love

All night 'til I blow away
All night 'til I blow away
I feel alright, I feel alright

Whoo!

Baby, oh baby, burn my heart
Baby, oh baby, burn my heart
Fall apart, babe, fall apart
Baby, oh baby, burn my heart

All night 'til I blow away
All night 'til I blow away
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright, feel alright
Whoo!

Out of my mind on Saturday night
1970 rollin' in sight
Radio burnin' up above
Beautiful baby, feed my love

All night 'til I blow away
All night 'til I blow away
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel! Feel! Blow! Blow!
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Blow! Blow! I feel alright
Feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
So... Whoo! So...19Embed
