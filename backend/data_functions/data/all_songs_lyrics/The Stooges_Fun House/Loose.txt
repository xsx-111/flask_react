Loose LyricsNow look out!

I took a ride through the pretty music
I went down and baby you can tell
I took a record of pretty music
Now I'm putting it to you straight from hell

I'll stick it deep inside
I'll stick it deep inside
Cause I'm loose

I feel fine to be dancin', baby
I feel fine, I'm a shakin' leaf
I feel fine to be dancin', baby
Cause it's love, yeah I do believe

I took a ride through the pretty music
I went down and baby you can tell
I took a record of pretty music
Now I'm putting it to you straight from hell

And I'll stick it deep inside
And I'll stick it – hey!
Well I'm loose
Well I'm loose
Well I'm looseEmbed
