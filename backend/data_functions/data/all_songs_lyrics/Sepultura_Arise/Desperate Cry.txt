Desperate Cry Lyrics
Sacrifice is pleasure
When life ends in pain
Conceive the last mistake
Which belongs to all

Creation of insane rules
All we hear
Desperate cry

Death: the coldest wind
Seeps into your pores
A nation born of hate
Forgotten distant time

Creation of insane rule
All we hear
Desperate cry

Endless empty maze
Despair, distress and silence
A poison vacuum, infinity
Life, lies, deceit
Mute souls end in silence
Oceans tainted with blood
Empty promises of hope
Buried deep, infected ground

Creation of insane rule
All we hear
Desperate cry

Cry!Embed
