Meaningless Movements Lyrics
Born with remorse
To a cold barren place
Battle between minds
Hungry for words of prey

Contradictory truth
Secrets in lies
Meaningless movements

Icons review their sins
Faith cheaper than thou
Doubting your ideals
Torment shreds your brain
Fearful fantasy respects the unknown
Turning your heart red
A requiem to celebrate you

Words I cannot understand
Shrieks in my moment of pain
Impostor hides behind a mask
My words against your lies

Turn my head
To see what I know
A shadow without form
Painted on the wall

Born with remorse
To a cold barren place
Battle between minds
Hungry for words of prey
One moment's mistake
False steps in the ground
Laws made by the blind
Ruling reign of light

Contradictory truth
Secrets in lies
Meaningless movementsEmbed
