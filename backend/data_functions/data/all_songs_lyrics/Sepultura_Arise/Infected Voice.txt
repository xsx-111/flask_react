Infected Voice Lyrics
Fear ties you up
And you don't grow
Being wrong and lost
No one admits the defeat

Conscience is fair
Unfaithful words
Betrayal and greed
Past thoughts to win alone

Envy - still strong
Hatred - still alive
From beyond - an empty world
Infected voice - a scream alone

Infected voice

My throat is dry
A last cry tries to escape
Guilt and frustration
No time to turn around
Looking behind, I'm not alone
Are they friends or enemies?
Going insane without a cure
Scarring my eyes, vision's lost


Remorse for the human race
Fear of becoming them
Envy - the strongest feeling
Hatred - still in their heart

Envy - still strong
Hatred - still alive
From beyond - an empty world
Infected voice - a scream alone
