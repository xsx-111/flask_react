Hawaii Lyrics
Do you want to go straight to Hawaii, Hawaii?
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Or do you want to come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you want to come along with me?)

I heard about all the pretty girls
With their grass skirts down to their knees
All my life I wanted to see
The island called Hawaii

Go to Hawaii, Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Oh, do you want to come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you want to come along with me?)

Now, I don't know what town you're from
But don't tell me that they got bigger waves
Because everyone that goes
Comes back with nothing but raves
That's in Hawaii, Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
That's in Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Oh, do you want to come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you want to come along with me?)

Now, pretty soon this Winter
They'll hold the Surfing Championship of the year
Surfer guys and girls
Will be coming from far and near

Go to Hawaii, Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Go to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Oh, do you want to come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you want to come along with me?)1Embed
