South Bay Surfer Lyrics
Look out here come those South Bay surfers
California's getting hot
There they go cruising down that coastline
Looking for their favorite spot
We'll find the big one
Oh, the boys are rough
And ready to handle anything
They take the big one
They've got to be the best thing going
South Bay surfers really swing
Okay, rock out
Oh, Chicago can't you hear them
Hear that shore pound slam
You're going to eat it
Smash
It rumbles clear to New York City
Detroit back to old Miami
Philly back to Alabama

You'll catch them surfingEmbed
