Surfers Rule Lyrics
It's a genuine fact that the surfers rule

It's plastered on the walls all around the school, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Becoming just as common as a golden rule, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Take it or leave it but you better believe it
Surfers rule

They burnt it in the grass on the football field, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Just try to make them cool it and they'll never yield, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Take what you've heard, now and go pass the word now
Surfers rule


A woody full of surfers pulling long side a wagon
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
The hodaddies sitting while the surfers are dragging
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
The surfers are winning and they say as they're grinning
Surfers rule
Surfers rule
(Four seasons, you better believe it)Embed
