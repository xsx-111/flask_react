I Love Her All the Time Lyrics
She comes into my mind
Twisting through my nerves
I don't understand
A word she says
She's on my side

I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time

She comes into my mind
Twisting through my nerves
I don't understand
A word she says
She's on my side

I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the time
I love her all the timeEmbed
