This song this song this song is called
This song okay
This song is called justice is justice is might
Okay it's about it's about it's about sonic life
It's about it's about sonic life
It's about sonic life that's right
You have a genius you have a genius and a sex maniac
Living together taking lots of drugs and and
Fucking all day and as it's just it's just it's just like
It's like it's like staying at home and risking your life
This song okay this song this song is called justice
This song is called justice is might

I know it's wrong
But that is allright
As long as it's strong
It's just that it might
Justice is might Embed
