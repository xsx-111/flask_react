Slow Lyrics
Time winding down
Slowly, slowly
Just one more try
Slowly, slowly

I'm almost on my way
Cracking, snapping, little footsteps
Beaks all break
Slowly, slowly

Searching, still searching
Slowly it falls, slowly it dies
Slowly it crumbles right under my eyes
And it takes so long

And I wonder
Just how long it took
To get there, to get there
I guess I'll wait
How much longer? Any day
How much further must I wake?
I guess I'll wait
I guess I'll wait
I guess I'll wait
I guess I'll wait
Slowly falls, slowly dies
Slowly it crumbles right under my eyes
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly
Slowly, slowly, slowly... slowly
Stood up, shot
Between the eyes
S'just consolation
Slowly, slowly
Slowly, slowly
Slowly, slowly
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly2Embed
