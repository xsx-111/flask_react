Dethroned LyricsDefaced, dethroned
The fate, unknown
Unsure, unkempt
His pride: none left
Snatched with rage, his gift was thrown
Blindly into the depths below
Irretrievable under the stone
Almost stopped on the brink
Well, somehow he still thinks
Today is just a blip
The footnote that ends his entry at the centre
Of all self respecting encyclopedias
That face he will not see again
Will always be with him, will nеver leave
Will mock him in sleep, rеmind him
In every reflection
Translucent and shimmering
Those marbles appearing to make him
Weightless as ever, forever weak...
Forever ever needing a distraction to speak
Elephant eyeballs hovering
Over all thought with lips ever
Puckered, aimless fishes within...
Within, within a reflection
He'll never tell anyone
And no one will ever find out
It will always be with him no doubt
He wants to feel sympathy for'm
But he'll come back again and again3Embed
