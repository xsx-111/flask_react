Chondromalacia Patella Lyrics
Losing grip, another drip
A new cold
Air passing through a new hole
On the white rocks of the pink mould
Air passing through a new hole
On the white rocks of the pink mould

No strength left to pull the cord
Of the morning bell
A million diamonds sing inside
An empty shell
A million diamonds sing
A million diamonds
On the white rocks

Always crashing, screaming, relentlessly bashing
Incessant, repulsive, backtracking hypotheses
And we're seldom finished
Oh, the beasts of the nighttime
Canfrenkin borentis a sotzkee, potzkee borree

My fingertips folding, deep in their burrow
Black creatures make nests no needle can rupture
My fingertips folding, deep in their burrow
Black creatures make nests no needle can ruptureEmbed
