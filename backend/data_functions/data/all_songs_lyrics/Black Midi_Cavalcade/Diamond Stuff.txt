Diamond Stuff LyricsAnd only when the sun is ours
Didn't take long to find out
I'm a- I'm a husk
Made up of diamond stuff
I don't seem to bleed this time, this time
Hair slicked back to a black slick
The red river pulls me up to scratch an itch
On an anthracite field I am laid out
And a diamond drill takes my feet off
Hair slicked back to a black slick
The red river pulls me up to scratch an itch
On an anthracite field I am laid out
And a diamond drill takes my feet off
Hair slicked back to a black slick
The red river pulls me up to scratch an itch
On an anthracite field I am laid out
And a diamond drill takes my feet offEmbed
