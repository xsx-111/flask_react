Prisoner Lyrics
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly (Honestly)
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say (I say) that I would be nothing without your love ('Out your love)
I feel the rush and it's amazing

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place (Up in this place), yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (I want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
'Cause I know (Ooh, yeah), all I know (Ooh, yeah), all I know (Ooh, yeah)

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

(Ah-ah)
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (For too long)
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch (Out the touch)
I feel the rush and it's amazing, hmm

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
'Cause I know (Ooh, yeah), all I know (Ooh, yeah), all I know (Ooh ,yeah)
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo (Ohh)
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold (Empty and so cold)
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams115Embed
