Angel Lyrics
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, hey, yeah

Angel, oh-oh-oh-oh
Knew you were special from the moment I saw you (Saw you)
I saw you, yeah
I said, angel, oh-oh-oh-oh
I feel you closer every time I call you (Call you)
I call you

'Cause all I see are wings
Well, I can see your wings
But I know what I am and the life I live (Life I live)
Yeah, the life I live
And even though I sin
Maybe we are born to live
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this
Yeah, if we're meant for this
And if we're not

I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah
Said, angel, woah-oh-oh-oh
You'll probably never take me back and I know this (Know this)
Yeah, I know this, aw, baby
I said angel, woah-oh-oh-oh
I'm so desensitized to feeling these emotions (Emotions)
Yeah, no emotions, baby

'Cause all I see are wings
Well, I can see your wings
But I know what I am and the life I live (Life I live)
Yeah, the life I live
And even though I sin
We are born to live
But I know time will tell if we're meant for this
Yeah, if we're meant for this
And if we're not

I hope you find somebody (Ooh)
I hope you find somebody (Ooh)
I hope you find somebody (Ooh)
I hope you find somebody to love
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And even though we live inside
A dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring the light
You always seem to bring the light
And even though we live inside
A dangerously empty life
You always seem to bring me light
You always seem to bring me light

I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody
I hope you find somebody to love
Somebody to love (Somebody to love)
Somebody to love
Yeah, yeah, oh

I hope you find somebody (I hope you find somebody, baby)
