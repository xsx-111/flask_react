Once It Was Alright Now (Farmer Joe) Lyrics
Farmer Joe, I'm the meanest woman you know, woman you know, she said
Farmer Joe, I'm the meanest ol' woman you know, woman you know
Whoa, I let you slide about an hour ago, now

Farmer boy, get your gun, run, run, run
Farmer boy, get your gun, run, run, run, run, run, run
Farmer boy, get your gun, run, run, run
Farmer boy, get your gun and run

Run, run like a son of a gun from love, love, love, love, love, love
Running from the mindreader, run baby, run
Black out

Got a date with the town shoe maker you know, baby you know
She said, I can't wait for your cornfields, baby, to grow, baby to grow
Whoa, baby, whoa baby, give me my bags and let the good wind blow
Give me my bags and let the good wind blow
Give me my bags and let the good wind blow
I've got to see about a, about a man I know baby, whoa baby

Fire, flames of gold rush my mind
Fire, flames of gold rush my mind
Sock it to the railroad, baby
Woo, baby, there's a train whistle coming
Woo, baby, there's a train whistle coming
Ooh, baby, there's a train whistle coming

Once it was alright, alright, baby
Once it was alright, alright, baby
Once it was alright, nowEmbed
