The Never-Played Symphonies Lyrics
Reflecting from my deathbed
I'm balancing life's riches against the ditches
And the flat gray years in between
All I can see are the never-laid
That's the never-played symphonies

I can't see those who tried to love me
All those who felt they understood me
And I can't see those who very patiently put up with me
All I can see are the never-laid
Or the never-played symphonies
You were one, you meant to be one
And you jumped into my face and laughed
And kissed me on the cheek and then were gone forever
...not quite
Black sky in the daytime
And I don't much mind dying
When there is nothing left to care for anymore
Just the never-laid, the never-played symphonies
You were one, you knew you were one
And you slipped right thru my fingers
No not literally but metaphorically
And now you're all I see as the light fadesEmbed
