Let Me Kiss You Lyrics
There's a place in the sun
For anyone who has the will to chase one
And I think I've found mine
Yes, I do believe I have found mine, so

Close your eyes
And think of someone
You physically admire
And let me kiss you, ohh
Let me kiss you, ohh

I've zig-zagged all over America
And I cannot find a safety haven
Say, would you let me cry
On your shoulder
I've heard that you'll try anything twice

Close your eyes
And think of someone
You physically admire
And let me kiss you, ohh
Let me kiss you, ohh
But then you open your eyes
And you see someone
That you physically despise
But my heart is open
My heart is open to you1Embed
