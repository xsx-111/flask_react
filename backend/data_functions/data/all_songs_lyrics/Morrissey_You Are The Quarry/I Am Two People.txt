I Am Two People LyricsI love you - it's murder
I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I love you - it's pointless
In my soul
If I live or die
This night
I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I have two faces
One of which you know
The other one for your sake I never will show
It's just because I love you
I cannot bear to be around you
And if only one or the other
Of us would
Drop
Down
