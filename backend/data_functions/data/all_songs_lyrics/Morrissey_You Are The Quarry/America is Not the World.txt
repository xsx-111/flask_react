America is Not the World Lyrics
America your head's too big
Because America, your belly is too big
And I love you, I just wish you'd stay where you belong

In America
The land of the free, they said
And of opportunity
In a just and a truthful way
But where the president, is never black, female or gay,
And until that day
You've got nothing to say to me
To help me believe

In America, it brought you the hamburger
Oh well America you know where you can shove your hamburger
And don't you wonder why in Estonia they say
Hey you, big fat pig, you fat pig, you fat pig
Steely blue eyes with no love in them scan the world
And a humourless smile, with no warmth within, greets the world
And I, I have got nothing, to offer you
No-no-no-no-no
Just this heart deep and true, which you say you don't need
See with your eyes, touch with your hands, please
Hear through your ears, know in your soul, please
For haven't you me with you now?
And I love you, I love you, I love you
And I love you, I love you, I love you2Embed
