Welfare Mothers Lyrics
People, pick up on what I'm putting down now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Down at every laundromat in town now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
While they're washing, you can hear this sound now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Divorcee!

Hard to believe that love is free now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Out on the street with the whole family now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Hard to believe that love is free now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Divorcee!
People, pick up on what I'm putting down now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Down at every laundromat in town now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
While they're washing, you can hear this sound now
Welfare mothers make better lovers
Divorcee!Embed
