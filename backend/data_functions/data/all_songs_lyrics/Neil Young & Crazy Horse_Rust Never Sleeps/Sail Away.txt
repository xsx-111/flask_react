Sail Away Lyrics
I could live inside a tepee
I could die In Penthouse thirty-five
You could lose me on the freeway
But I would still make it back alive

As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away

See the losers in the best bars
Meet the winners in the dives
Where the people are the real stars
All the rest of their lives

As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away
There's a road
Stretched out between us
Like a ribbon on the high plain
Down from Phoenix through Salinas
Around the bend and back again

As long as we can sail away
As long as we can sail away
There'll be wind in the canyon
Moon on the rise
As long as we can sail away1Embed
