Ride My Llama Lyrics
Remember the Alamo
When help was on the way
It's better here and now
I feel that good today
I'd like to take a walk
But not around the block
I really got some news
I met a man from Mars
He picked up all my guitars
And played me travelling songs
And when we got on ship
He brought out
Something for the trip
And said, It's old but it's good
Like any other primitive would
I'm going to ride my llama
From Peru to Texarkana
I want to ride him good
In my old neighbourhood
I'm going to ride him good
In my old neighbourhood
He brought out
Something for the trip
And said, It's old but it's good
Like any other primitive wouldEmbed
