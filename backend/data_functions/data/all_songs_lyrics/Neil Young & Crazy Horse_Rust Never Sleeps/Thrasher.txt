Thrasher Lyrics
They were hiding behind hay bales
They were planting
In the full moon
They had given all they had
For something new
But the light of day was on them
They could see the thrashers coming
And the water
Shone like diamonds in the dew

And I was just getting up
Hit the road before it's light
Trying to catch an hour on the sun
When I saw
Those thrashers rolling by
Looking more than two lanes wide
I was feeling
Like my day had just begun

Where the eagle glides descending
There's an ancient river bending
Through the timeless gorge of changes
Where sleeplessness awaits
I searched out my companions
Who were lost in crystal canyons
When the aimless blade of science
Slashed the pearly gates
It was then I knew I'd had enough
Burned my credit card for fuel
Headed out to where the pavement
Turns to sand
With a one-way ticket
To the land of truth
And my suitcase in my hand
How I lost my friends
I still don't understand

They had the best selection
They were poisoned with protection
There was nothing that they needed
Nothing left to find
They were lost in rock formations
Or became park bench mutations
On the sidewalks and in the stations
They were waiting, waiting

So I got bored and left them there
They were just dead weight to me
Better down the road
Without that load
Brings back the time
When I was eight or nine
I was watching my mama's T.V
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode
Where the vulture glides descending
On an asphalt highway bending
Through libraries and museums
Galaxies and stars
Down the windy halls of friendship
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip
The motel of lost companions
Waits with heated pool and bar

But me I'm not stopping there
Got my own row left to hoe
Just another line
In the field of time
When the thrashers come
I'll be stuck in the sun
Like the dinosaurs in shrines
But I'll know the time has come
To give what's mine1Embed
