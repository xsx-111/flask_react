You Better Run LyricsWhat ya tryin' to do to my heart
What ya tryin' to do to my heart
You go around tellin' lies
And now you wanna compromise
What ya tryin' to do to my heart
You better run, you better hide
You better leave, from my side, yeah
What ya tryin' to do to my soul
What ya tryin' to do to my soul
When everything i have is yours
And now I'm closing all the doors
What ya tryin' to do to my soul
You better run, you better hide
You better leave from my side, yeah
I love you, oh I love you so
Can't ya see it, don't ya know
I can't stand your alibis
You're tellin' lies, tell me why, yeah
Say what are you tryin' to do to my head
Say what ya tryin' to do to my head
Well now I'm gonna draw that line
Cause you ain't gonna take my mind
What are you tryin' to do to my head
You better run, you better hide
You better leave from my side
You better run, you better hide
You better leave from my side
I said yeah, yeah
I said go away and leave me alone
I can't stand you no moreEmbed
