Out-a-Touch LyricsI've seen your picture in the paper
On the front page of magazines
I've pulled the trigger right at you
On billboards and movie screens
When I talk, it's to myself
Cause I know your kind, you're like everyone else
Maybe it'll work itself out in time, before I lose my mind
You, you're out-a-touch
All alone in a danger zone, and I think too much
Your out-a-touch
I keep your letters by the mirror
You're the subject of every dream
You're not so invincible, and I'm not what I might seem
When I look, it's in your eyes
And I know your look, you can hypnotize
How long does it have to last like this, a kodachrome kiss
You, you're out-a-touch
All alone in a danger zone, and I think too much
You, you're out-a-touch
You're in my sight all through the night
And I see too much
Your out-a-touch
Can't you see I'm obsessed
I'd do anything, I'm possessed
I'm in a constant rage with your luminary stage
I need you, I need you
I've seen your picture in the paper
On the front page of magazines
I've pulled the trigger right at you
On billboards and movie screens
When I look, it's in your eyes
And I know your look, you can hypnotize
How long does it have to last like this, a kodachrome kiss
You, you're out-a-touch
All alone in a danger zone, and I think too much
Your out-a-touch
I need you (7 times)Embed
