Prisoner of Love LyricsCold hard labor, it's a labor of love
Convicted of crimes, the crimes of passion
Caught in a chain gang, the chain of fools
Solitary confinement, confined by the rules
I'm just a prisoner
An inmate of love
Oh I'm a prisoner
Captured by love
With no escape
No where to go
No place to hide
Hey, I'm a prisoner!
I'm just a prisoner
Mending the wounds, the wounds of lament
The knife cut deep, deep into my heart
The romance is over, my passions remain
Still bound to love by this ball and chain
I'm just a prisoner
An inmate of love
Oh I'm a prisoner
Captured by love
With no escape
No where to go
No place to hide
Hey, I'm a prisoner!
I'm just a prisoner
Oh I'm a prisoner
Hey, I'm a prisoner!
Find an escape, a key to the door
I gotta get out, can't take anymore
Make a clean break, to bury the past
I'll shed these chains and be free at last
I'm just a prisoner
A Prisoner Of Love
I'm just a prisoner
A Prisoner Of Love
Hey, I'm a prisoner
I'm just a prisonerEmbed
