Wuthering Heights LyricsOut on the wiley, windy moors, we'd roll and fall in green

How could you leave me, when I needed to possess you
I hated you, I loved you too
Bad dreams in the night
You told me I was going to lose the fight

Wuthering, Wuthering, Wuthering Heights
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy, I've come home
I'm - so cold, let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy, I've come home
I'm - so cold, let me in your window
Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot falls through without you
I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master

Wuthering, Wuthering, Wuthering Heights
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy, I've come home
I'm - so cold, let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy, I've come home
I'm - so cold, let me in your window
Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away
Ooh, let me have it, let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy, I've come home
I'm - so cold, let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy, I've come home
I'm - so cold, let me in your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy, I've come home
So coldEmbed
