Never Wanna Leave You LyricsNever could say what I wanna say
Never could do what I wanna do
Never could believe you, if it's true
Never could, never would, you make it so hard
I never wanna leave you
I'm always right, you're never wrong
We change the tune but not the song
Over and over
'Til it's done, it's never done, never done
You make it so hard
Never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
Movin' together, comin' apart
You're what I need, I'm what you want
Never could refuse you from the start
Never could, never would, never could
You make it so hard
Never could say what I wanna say
Never could do what I wanna do
Never could believe you, if it's true
Never could, never would, you make it so hard
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
Never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wanna leave you
I never wannaEmbed
