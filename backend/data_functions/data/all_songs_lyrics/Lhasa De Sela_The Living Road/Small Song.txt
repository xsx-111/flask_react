Small Song LyricsI made a small small song
Made a small small song
I sang it all night long
All through
The wind and rain
Until the morning came
This song is my small song
This song is my small song
I sang it all night long
And when
The morning came
I had to start all over again
My song is so so small
My song is so so small
I could get down and crawl
Searching from
Wall to wall
And never see
Anything at all
How could you hate
Such a small song?
How could you hate
Such a small song?
If I was right
I would be wrong
Don't be afraid
It's just a small songEmbed
