Soon This Space Will Be Too Small LyricsSoon this space will be too small
And I'll go outside
To the huge hillside
Where the wild winds blow
And the cold stars shine
I'll put my foot
On the living road
And be carried from here
To the heart of the world
I'll be strong as a ship
And wise as a whale
And I'll say the three words
That will save us all
And I'll say the three words
That will save us all
Soon this space will be too small
And I'll laugh so hard
That the walls cave in
Then I'll die three times
And be born again
In a little box
With a golden key
And a flying fish
Will set me free
Soon this space will be too small
All my veins and bones
Will be burned to dust
You can throw me into
A black iron pot
And my dust will tell
What my flesh would not
Soon this space will be too small
And I'll go outside
And I'll go outside
And I'll go outsideEmbed
