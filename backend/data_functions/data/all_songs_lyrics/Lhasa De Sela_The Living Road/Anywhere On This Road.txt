Anywhere On This Road LyricsI live in this country now
I'm called by this name
I speak this language
It's not quite the same
For no other reason
Than this it's my home
And the places I used to be far from are gone
You've travelled this long
You just have to go on
Don't even look back to see
How far you've come
Though your body is bending
Under the load
There is nowhere to stop
Anywhere on this road
My heart is breaking
I cannot sleep
I love a man
Who's afraid of me
He believes if he doesn't
Stand guard with a knife
I'll make him my slave
For the rest of his life
I love this hour
When the tide is just turning
There will be an end
To the longing and yearning
If I can stand up
To angels and men
I'll never get swallowed
In darkness again
You've travelled this long
You just have to go on
Don't even look back to see
How far you've come
Though your body is bending
Under the load
There is nowhere to stop
Anywhere on this roadEmbed
