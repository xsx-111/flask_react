Baby $hit Lyrics
The world is uncivilized, and these are our works
Champ (What's up? What's up?)
James Brown, nicotine (Yo, yo)
Cocaine (Okay, there we go, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ayy, man, don't never fuck with a nigga that—
That don't get girls (Yeah, yeah)
The nigga always gon' be jealous of you (Yeah)
I swear to God, on my mama, nigga (Yeah)

Yeah, ain't nobody ever gave me shit, I had to take this shit, go get your paper, bitch
Rabbit potty trainin' every mornin', ho, I'm cookin' dope and cleanin' baby shit
Versace robe drapin' like a nigga got a cape, but I can never save a bitch
Fuckin' ball player baby mamas hit me when them niggas play the Lakers, bitch

We don't do no postin' or no name taggin'
California blow, she got a 'caine habit
I don't want the pussy if the gang had it
Was a ho before she got the same habit
Hold on, do no postin' or no name taggin'
Dope and cocaina got my name brackin'
I don't sell a whip, I let the gang have it
Got a pocket full of dead slave masters (Yeah)
Get that white and I beat it up like I'm Mike
Jumper broke man, a nigga can't be like Mike
Share this dick, man, a bitch gotta sacrifice
Diamonds in my shit look like some flashin' lights
Presidential, I flooded that bitch with ice
Cougar pussy, I fuck a rich nigga wife
Doja Cat let me beat from the back-back
Porsche engine, that bitch in the back-back
Louie luggage, that sit in the front trunk
Uncle threw Forgiato on Dodge trucks
Throw VL out the window, I'm mobbed up
Hit that Pyrex until that bitch locked up
Dinner plate, my shit porcelain, rocked up
R.I.P Robert Davis, we chopped up
Screw a bitch in the drop with the top up (With the top up)

Yeah, ain't nobody ever gave me shit, I had to take this shit, go get your paper, bitch
Flew a ho like 20 hours just to have a threesome with my new Australian bitch
Versace robe drapin' like a nigga got a cape, but I can never save a bitch
Every day I get an internet threat, boy, these niggas soft as baby shit

Give them 36's to my side piece
40 millimeter on the timepiece
Take a ho to brunch and get mimosa drunk
She give me sloppy toppy on massage seats
Keep on ducking bitches from around me
Feel like Usher, ho, 'cause you remind me
Of a bitch I used to fuck with when I was broke
But now my 750 got massage seats, uh
Get that white and I beat it up like I'm Mike
Jumper broke man, a nigga can't be like Mike
Share the dick, man, a bitch gotta sacrifice
Diamonds in my shit look like some flashin' lights
Presidential, I flooded that bitch with ice
Cougar pussy, I fuck a rich nigga wife
Doja Cat let me beat from the back-back
I'll be right back
Yeah, ain't nobody ever gave me shit, I had to take this shit, go get your paper, bitch
Rabbit potty trainin' every mornin', ho, I'm cookin' dope, be cleanin' baby shit
Versace robe drapin' like a nigga got a cape, but I can never save a bitch
Critics tryna judge a nigga music, tell the pussy niggas suck a baby dick, bitch

Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah yeah (Kane train)
(Nothin' else to say, bitch, gang)
(Yeah, yeah)

You know why I love to sell a ton of drugs in Harlem, Bumpy?
It's not 'cause of the money (Why?)
'Cause every miserable street junkie
Every skinny kid who goes to bed hungry because his mama is lookin' for a fix
Every nigga baby born with a habit
Makes me happy, makes my heart sing
Never, never, never, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh11Embed
