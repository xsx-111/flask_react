Babies & Fools Lyrics
Yeah
Kane Train
Toot a lil' somethin', somethin'
Let's smoke a lil' somethin', somethin', yeah
A bitch could never (All of me)
Ha, never, bitch, yeah (All of me)
Yeah, real nigga, what's up?

My first love was football from playin' that Madden shit
My second love was hard drugs, weed and this rappin' shit
Alhamdulillah on the nights that I wasn't havin' shit
I say my prayers but I'm rusty as fuck with Arabic
Lord, take me as I am 'cause I'm gon' come as I'm is
I might die twice if I look down and see my mama in tears

I gave her (All of me), uh
But I ain't gon' never die (All of me), uh
Bitch, I could never, what's up?

I know the Lord watch over babies and fools
I did the fooly with this tool to put my babies through school
I took my last ho out the country, fuck that bitch, we ain't cool
Hit them DMs, a nigga can't swim, but I fucked her friend by the pool
'Cause she was tour pussy, I never needed that bitch
She cussed me out in long-ass texts, but I ain't readin' them shits
She wanted (All of me)
But you could never have (All of me), haha, yeah
Bitch, you could never, what's up?

Uh, James Harden, I had to take a step back from bitches and certain niggas (Yeah)
Sometimes you slip to get the success, then you start hurtin' feelings
Used to have the hardtop, yes, now I convert the ceiling
Friends was tryna count my pockets like I don't deserve a million
Bitch, I deserve a trillion
'Cause I would've did a trillion years for these niggas
Whole bid for these niggas

I gave 'em (All of me)
Nigga, I gave the streets (All of me)
I'm fallin' back, what's up?

Look, my first love was writin' verses and rappin' bars (Yeah)
My second love was sittin' on bandos and trappin' hard (Huh?)
Hospital bed, bullet in my neck and a fractured jaw
Call it crazy, but I always knew I'd bounce back this hard (I always knew)
Who got the matte black MAC? That's to match the car (Uh-huh)
I got that 'cause I been clapped before
Gave these streets (All of me)
Nigga, I gave the streets (All of me)

Uh, I'm on tour, I'm on the road just hustlin' and shit
My baby mama cut me off, she had enough of my shit (She sick of my shit)
I'll Cashapp stacks every now and then, like that's enough
She like, "At least FaceTime, your babies don't see your ass enough" (You right)
Plus my older son is failin' math, that shit ain't addin' up
I guess I ain't around bein' a dad enough, I owe my kids

(All of me)
I owe Demond and Noah (All of me)

Uh, for the mob, you know I give niggas the shirt off my back
Somethin' happen to one of my niggas, I'll be the first to attack
Air out your corner, if I miss, then we circlin' back (Brrt)
Funeral lines, Cadillacs with the hearses to match (Hearses to match)
Huh, I rep my niggas every verse that I rap
Violate, the shots disperse from this MAC (May Block, nigga)

I gave my hood (All of me, you know what's up)
I gave my whole hood (All of me)
That's a fact, nigga5Embed
