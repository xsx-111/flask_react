1985 Lyrics
My brother said, "Don't say that", I said, "Fuck that, I'm gon' get a whoopin' anyway! It don't make no goddamn difference!"
Fuck that
I'm not goin' to find shit
When your mom say? "Take the garbage out, what the fuck?"
(Yeah) Yeah, don't lose the beat motherfucker, take the garbage out
Yeah-yeah, I just upped the flows to the God level, nigga, what
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Finna up the flows to the God level, nigga, what
Yeah, check-check
Yeah, uh, mic check-check
Yeah, nigga, check-check
Yeah, bitch, check-check
Yeah, yeah

Quarter thang to a whole thang, whole gang workin' (Yeah)
Hit a bitch with that extended clip or that revolver
Shit'll serve the same purpose (Bang, bang)
Geekers beamin' up to Scotty in my crack lobby
I can smell the 'caine burnin'
Michael Jordan, 1985, bitch, I travel with a cocaine circus
Put them FNH's on your clown ass
Catch a nigga up and leave him down bad
I go get a pack and take a nigga town
And fuck his bitches with my out-of-town ass
Bomb on niggas like Nagasaki
Rocket next to my pocket, hot like hibachi
Drop the check on the bitch
Man, these niggas be lookin' like baby mamas in these Maseratis
Bitch, I fuck up your face with a razor
How I make sure your motherfuckin' family can't view your body
Nigga thuggin' and shit, put my blood in this shit
Prick my finger, Alfredo, Illuminati (Illuminati)
Joe Pesci, pushing product
You niggas is sweeter than Joe Exotic
On the run like Assata, so fuck the police
As a nigga be chillin' in La Habana (Up in La Habana)
Police caught him with a whole thang
Now they snitchin' man, whole gang workin'
Gangland, made a lane in it, if my name in it, it's a gang murder
All my reps in the crack files, bitch, I got 'em up out the vault
I'm the reason your mama be smokin' that Brillo
And rippin' them car antennas off, yeah (Them car antennas off)
Geekers beamin' up to Scotty in my crack lobby
I can smell the 'caine burnin'
Gangland, if you put a hit on Freddie Kane it'll be a gang murder
1985, Michael Jordan, bitch, I travel with a cocaine circus
Flow God level, like when HOV speak
I make a song weep, I got the game hurt
Bitch, yeah-yeah
Flow God level, like when HOV speak
I make a song weep, I got the game hurt
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, check-check
Check-check, mic check-check
Check-check, yeah, niggas need a check-check, yeah
We got everybody in the house tonight
I'll wait for my DJ to get ready (Nah)9Embed
