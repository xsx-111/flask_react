Look at Me Lyrics
I'm the kind of man that recognize talent
And when I find it, I put it to work

Came through in a clean SS
Bucket seats with the beam on the TEC
Got a thing, Wu-Tang, protect your neck, bitch
Hahaha, ha, take a look at me, bitch, yeah
Take a look at me, ho, yeah
Came through in a Benz S6
Drippin' water, nigga, wrist reckless
Ho was trippin', that was one less bitch, ho
Yeah, hahaha, take a look at me, bitch
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Take a look at me, ho)

Look at me, motherfucker, look at me (Yeah)
And my bitch got her tax check back
She gon' put a real nigga back on his feet (Yeah)
Used to ride in the clean A3
With the wood and the Louis V's on my seat (Yeah)
Motherfuck what you heard, when I ride in the 'Gar
Make a ho clean off her feet (Yeah)
Tell a bitch, "What you looking at?"
Soda with the cocaina, now I'm cookin' that
If that shit ain't locked up then we took it back
Niggas stretch it and press it, we pushin' that
When I stop selling crack, I ain't lookin' back
Yeah, bitch, I ain't lookin' back
Yeah, damn
Came through in a new Porsche, speed
Too much coke'll make a bitch nose bleed
To the floor seats from the nosebleeds, bitch, yeah
Take a look at me bitch, yeah
Take a look at me, ho, ha
Came through in a new Porsche, speed
Too much coke'll make a bitch nose bleed
To the floor seats from the nosebleeds, bitch, yeah
Take a look at me bitch, yeah
Take a look at me

(Yeah, look at me, motherfuckers, look at me, yeah)
You lucky you got away with just a scratch, sucker
(Look at me, motherfuckers, look at me, yeah)
What you got the other night was just the smoke
The fire is yet to come
Got to run him out of the neighborhood
What you'll get is nothing but a whole lot of trouble
You better be careful when you talk about shedding blood in this community2Embed
