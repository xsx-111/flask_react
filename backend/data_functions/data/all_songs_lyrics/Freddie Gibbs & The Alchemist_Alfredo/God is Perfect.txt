God is Perfect Lyrics
Aight, check it out
Uh, gang, gang
Bunny Rabbit insane
Uh, Big Finball, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
It's here (Uh), yeah
(One, two) Yeah, yeah (Kane train, baby), uh
(Hold on, hold on) Yeah, yeah
(One, two, yo, yo, check it out) Yeah, yeah

Microphone check, one, two, mic checka
Still pack that bladadah, Subhan'Allah, I pray to Mecca
All this gang shit in my vein, I got the rank, I got the blessin'
Take some extras out the brick, we press a brick, it ain't no pressure
Sippin' tiki in Waikiki, I'm with Dee-Dee and Vanessa
Top-notch bitches on my roster get the most and nothin' lesser
Poppa met me in the valley, drop the ho off home with nothin'
Take some extras out the brick, we press a brick, it ain't no pressure, yessir

I didn't want to speak on this shit
But it really been rackin' my brain now (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause really I fuck with this rap
But my niggas still sellin' cocaine now (Huh, yeah)
Them crackers they got enough on us
To go start a motherfuckin' case now (Yeah)
A nigga get hit with the R.I.C.O.  
They comin', they snatchin' the gang now
Big sticks long than a bitch, golf ball holes in the shit
Big Finball in this bitch, cuz with Willy brother all in the six
Had a piper, shoulda wore a diaper
When I hit him, left his draws full of shit (Brrt)
Niggas blow at us, they gettin' blown down
But I'll be so proud to put the dope down for the
Microphone check, one, two, mic checka
Still pack that bladadah, Subhan'Allah, I pray to Mecca
All this gang shit in my vein, I got the rank, I got the blessin'
Take some extras out the brick, we press a brick, it ain't no pressure, yessir
Microphone check, one, two, mic checka
Still pack that bladadah, Subhan'Allah, I pray to Mecca
All this gang shit in my vein, I got the rank, I got the blessin'
Take some extras out the brick, we press a brick, it ain't no pressure, yessir

Gangland shit
Fuck around, get gangland hit
I'ma catch a little bitch while he's chillin' with his clique
Nigga, where the whole gang at, bitch?
Where the watch and the chain at, bitch?
Set 'em up, yeah, I drained that bitch
I was fuckin' in the A for like four days straight
But a nigga never claim that bitch
I be talkin' that shit like I'm bulletproof
Fuck a DM, I'm sendin' them killers through
I be fuckin' with the Gs, Crips, Bloods, BDs
Man, this shit get political
Hit the John, I'm whippin' the miracle
Get the spoon and I'm scrapin' the residue
Man, I shop with Colombianos and the Mexicanos
Man, this shit get political
Rock it up then blade that shit
Dog food, nigga, slang that shit
Niggas shot at me and miss with the whole damn clip
Yeah, the bitch couldn't aim that shit
A nigga might get gangland hit
That east side insane-ass shit
Niggas shot at me and miss with the whole damn clip
Yeah, the bitch couldn't aim that shit, fuck nigga
Microphone check, one, two, mic checka
Still pack that bladadah, Subhan'Allah, I pray to Mecca
All this gang shit in my vein, I got the rank, I got the blessin'
Take some extras out the brick, we press a brick, it ain't no pressure, yessir
Microphone check, one, two, mic checka
Still pack that bladadah, Subhan'Allah, I pray to Mecca
All this gang shit in my vein, I got the rank, I got the blessin'
Take some extras out the brick, we press a brick, it ain't no pressure, yessir

Yo, yo, I'd just like to say, you know
My man Kane smoked him, you know?
But it's good to be original when you diss somebody
Don't use somebody else's shit

The thing that's going to change people
It's something that no one will be able to capture on film
It'll just be something that you see and all of a sudden you realize
"I'm on the wrong page"
Or, "I'm on the right page but I'm on the wrong note
And I've got to get in sync with everyone else to understand what's happening in this country"11Embed
