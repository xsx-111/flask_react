N.S.U. - Live LyricsDriving in my car, smoking my cigar
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar
Ahh, ahh
Singing in my yacht, what a lot I got
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
I've been in and out, I've been up and down
I don't want to go until I've been all around
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
What's it all about? Anyone in doubt?
I don't want to go until I've found it all out
Ahh, ahh, ahh1Embed
