Crossroads Lyrics
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Down to the crossroads fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above for mercy, "Take me, if you please"

I went down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Down to the crossroads tried to flag a ride
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

Well, I'm going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrelhouse, baby, on the riverside


Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
Going down to Rosedale, take my rider by my side
We can still barrel house, baby, on the riverside


You can run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Run, you can run tell my friend boy Willie Brown
And I'm standing at the crossroads believe I'm sinking down
Uh, Eric Clapton lead, uh, vocal2Embed
