William, It Was Really Something LyricsOoh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
Wah-ooh
In the summer, I became self parody
I didn't see the sun except to sleep
I did’t notice hurt, but smiling all the time
Dissolving and turning to white wine
And she said, "William, you're terrible"
And I know I'm no good for her at all
"William, well, what went wrong?"
Don’t say I didn't warn you
You know I've been a hazard all along
Am I a villain?
Well, I used to walk the line
Now I'm creepin' back to the scene of the crime
So hungover from hanging out with you
And I'm putting it back together with Duct tape and nails
I do this all the time
"William, you're terrible"
And I know I'm no good for her at all
"William, well, what went wrong?"
Don’t say I didn’t warn you
You know I've been a hazard all along
Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
Wah-ooh
Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
Wah-ooh
And every night I lose at life
And every night I fall at your feet
Loaded alone with your heart to hold
And the weight of the world at your feet
Who’s gonna question our love
Keepin' your distance from me?
Not me, not I
I will watch the dream die
Goodnight, from when we were still peace
Every night I lose at life
Every night I fall at your feet
Loaded alone with heart on for home
And heart that refuses to beat
"William, you're terrible"
And I know I'm no good for her at all
She said, "William, well, what went wrong?"
Don’t say I didn't warn you
You know I've been a hazard all along1Embed
