DRACULADS LyricsBaby, the blood of Jesus Christ is laced upon your lips
I get a step closer to God, and too drunk, each time we kiss
And every night I carve your name into my bloody hand
I take a one night 'fall' in place of 'one night stand'
Anton LaVey on our wedding day, I’ll be Crowley in the sack
Get an all-pink room for our honeymoon and then we'll paint the whole thing black
“And I always wanted to make out with a boy who's in a band"
I take a one night 'fall' in place of 'one night stand'
She is the sweetest pain; sugar poured out on a blood stain
I bleed out and out again
Because I just want to make it worse
You know I love it when it hurts
Cut me down and down again
I crumble like a headstone right down to your feet
You are danger and I am chained to a beauty
Unexplainable, like sunglasses in the rain
She clawed my chest and bit my neck
Smoked a roll up cigarette
Then laughed as hard as you'd expect
As we cheated deathEmbed
