Heaven Help Me LyricsI've been swearing on the Bible
She's been dragging me to hell
I've got a two-year residency at Resentment Hotel
I think it's time we got out
She's all razorblades and roses
It's a beautiful curse
She's got lipstick and a pistol in the back of her purse
I said "I think it's time we got out, 'with all our limbs' intact"
Because I'm way too late to save
A grudge held  right to your grave
I'm a devil too proud to plead
"Heaven help me"
Drinking up your sorrows
I've been drowning in booze
"Do you have to make this harder?"
...Well, how could I refuse?
I said "I think it's time we got out, 'with all our limbs' intact"
Because I'm way too late to save
A grudge held  right to your grave
I'm a devil too proud to plead
"Heaven help me"
4am, it's late again
And she's got her black dress on
Mourning wear can be such a turn on
But like a rose on a grave, we wilt awayEmbed
