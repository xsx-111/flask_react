Waltz #1 Lyrics
Everytime the day darkens down and goes away
Pictures open in my head of me and you
Silent and clich√©
All the things we did and didn't say
Covered up by what we did and didn't do
Going through every out I used to cop
To make the repetition stop
What was I supposed to say?


Now I never leave my zone
We'e both alone, I'm going home
I wish I'd never seen your fa-a-ace3Embed
