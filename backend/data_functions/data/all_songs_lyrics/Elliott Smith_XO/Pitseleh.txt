Pitseleh Lyrics
I'll tell you why I don't want to know where you are
I got a joke I've been dying to tell you
A silent kid is looking down the barrel
To make the noise that I kept so quiet
Kept it from you, Pitseleh

I'm not what's missing from your life now
I could never be the puzzle pieces
They say that God makes problems just to see what you can stand
Before you do as the Devil pleases
Give up the thing you love
But no one deserves it

The first time I saw you
I knew it would never last
I'm not half what I wish I was
I'm so angry
I don't think it'll ever pass
And I was bad news for you just because
I never meant to hurt you6Embed
