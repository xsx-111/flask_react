Bottle Up and Explode! Lyrics
Bottle up and explode over and over
Keep the troublemaker below
Put it away and check out for the day
In for a round of overexposure
The thing mother nature provides
To get up and go
Bottle up and explode, seeing stars surrounding you
Red white and blue

You look at him like you've never known him
But I know for a fact that you have
The last time you cried
Who'd you think was inside?
Thinking that you were about to come over
But I'm tired now of waiting for you
You never show
Bottle up and go, if you're gonna hide, it's up to you
I'm coming through

Bottle up and go
I can make it outside
I'll get through
Becoming you
Becoming you
Becoming you1Embed
