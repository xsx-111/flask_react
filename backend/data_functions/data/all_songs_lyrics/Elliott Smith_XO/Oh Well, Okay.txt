Oh Well, Okay Lyrics
Here's the silhouette, the face, always turned away
The bleeding color gone to black, dying like a day
Couldn't figure out what made you so unhappy
Shook your head to say, "No, no, no"
And stopped for a spell, and stayed that way

Oh well, okay

I got pictures, I just don't see it anymore
Climbing hour upon hour through a total bore
With the one I keep, where it never fades
In the safety of a pitch-black mind
An airless cell that blocks the day

Oh well, okay

If you get a feeling next time you see me
Do me a favor and let me know
Cause it's hard to tell, it's hard to say 'oh well, Ok'

Oh well, okay
Oh well, okay
Oh well, okayEmbed
