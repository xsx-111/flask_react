Some Song Lyrics
Hello, hello, hello
(This is a rock song)
Loud, loud, loud

It's a junkie dream, makes you so uptight
Yeah it's halloween tonight and every night
See you scratch your skin
Your sandpaper throat
You're a symphony, man, with one fucking note
Charlie beat you up week after week
And when you grow up you're going to be a freak
Want a violent girl who's not scared of anything

Help me kill my time
'Cause I'll never be fine
Help me kill my time

You went down to look at old Dallas town
Where you must be sick just to hang around
Seen it on TV, how to kill your man
Then like Gacy's scene a canvas in your hand
Better call your mom, she's out looking for you
In the jail and the army and the hospital too
But those people there couldn't do anything
For you
Help me kill my time
'Cause I'll never be fine
Help me kill my time
Help me kill my time
Help me kill my time
'Cause I'll never be fine
Help me kill my time2Embed
