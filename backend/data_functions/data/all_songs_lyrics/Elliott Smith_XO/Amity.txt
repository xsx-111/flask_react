Amity Lyrics
Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity
Amity, Amity, Amity
Caught stars in her arms
Hello, hello kitty happy in New York City
Amity walking like a lucky charm
I'm a neon sign and I stay open all the time
So let's go
Go, go, go

Amity, Amity, God don't make no junk
But it's plain to see that he still made me
He told me so
I'm good to go
I'm ready to go

‘Cause you laugh and talk
And ‘cause you make my world rock
I'm so
So, so, so
Amity, Amity, Amity, Amity
Amity, Amity, Amity
Good to goEmbed
