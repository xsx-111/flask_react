Miss Misery LyricsI'll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnnie Walker red
Send the poison rain down the drain
To put bad thoughts in my head
With two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?
A man in the park
Read the lines in my hand
Told me I'm strong and hardly ever wrong
I said, "Man, you mean you"
I had plans for both of us
That involved a trip out of town
To a place I seen in a magazine
That you'd left lying around
I don't have you with me
But I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?
I know you'd rather see me gone
Than to see me the way that I am
But I am in the life anyway
Next door, the TV's flashing
Blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy of errors, you see
It's about taking a fall
To vanish into oblivion
Is easy to do
And I try to be, but you know me
I come back when you want me to
Do you miss me, Miss Misery
Like you say you do?12Embed
