How to Take a Fall LyricsIt's one word cover to cover
It's an endless fuse
Chain repeater never seems to get any smarter
I'm always marking pages so
That I don't get confused
End up in a fight I never had any part of
Listen naive plaything
Coming over clueless every time you call
An accident just waiting to happen
Still hasn't found out
How to take a fall
Make me a present, make it something sweet
Small enough to go unnoticed and big enough to compete
With this massive past that keeps blocking up my street
Looking for a new contender to disassemble
Listen naive plaything
Coming over clueless every time you call
An accident just waiting to happen
Still hasn't found out
How to take a fall
How to take a fall
How to take a fallEmbed
