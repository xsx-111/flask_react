Sweet Adeline Lyrics
Cut this picture into you and me
Burn it backwards, kill this history
Make it over, make it stay away
Or hate'll sing the ending that love started to say

There's a kid a floor below me saying, "Brother, can you spare sunshine for a brother, Old Man Winter's in the air."
Walked me up a story, asking how you are
Told me not to worry, you were just a shooting star

Sweet Adeline
Sweet Adeline
My Clementine
Sweet Adeline

It's a picture-perfect evening and I'm staring down the sun
Fully loaded, deaf and dumb and done
Waiting for sedation to disconnect my head
Or any situation where I'm better off than deadEmbed
