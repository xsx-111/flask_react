Independence Day Lyrics
Future butterfly
Going to spend the day higher than high
You'll be beautiful confusion
Ooh, once I was you

I saw you caught between
All the people out making a scene
And the bright ideal tomorrow
Ooh, don't go too far, stay who you are

Everybody knows
Everybody knows
Everybody knows
You only live a day
But it's brilliant anyway

I saw you at the perfect place
It's going to happen soon, but not today
So go to sleep, make the change
I'll meet you here tomorrow
Independence Day
Independence Day
