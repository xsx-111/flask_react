The Enemy Is You LyricsYou got your head turned 'round
Walking upside down
Through the sunken dream
Through the crushing crowd
You don't know what it means
'Cause you're a broken machine
You won't lisp it out
You're dressing up your man
But it's all second hand
It's all hindsight
You don't understand
It's just an empty scene
Still an empty scheme
You wanna block it out
Well I know what I'm going to do
With this big doubt
I'm going to make it
Go away
When you go walking out
In the Rose City
Without a fucking clue
With an attitude
Knowing what you need
What you will not do
The enemy is you
You beat up on yourself
'Cause there ain't no one else
Feels quite as good
To put straight through hell
You know yourself well
Know what you're about
Just want to block it out
Well, I know what I'm going to do
With this big doubt
I'm going to hide my face away
Block it out
Well, I know what I'm going to do
With this big doubt
I'm going to make it
Go away1Embed
