Waltz, No. 2 (XO) Lyrics
First the mic, then a half cigarette
Singing "Cathy's Clown"
That's the man she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed, so she is, I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll

I'm never gonna know you now
But I'm gonna love you anyhow

Now she's done and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
'Cause I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is, the revenge to the tune
"You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good"
Can't you tell that it's well understood?

I'm never gonna know you now
But I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
I'm tired, I'm tired

Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong
XO, Mom
It's okay, it's all right, nothing's wrong
Tell Mr. Man with impossible plans to just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes

I'm never gonna know you now
But I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now
But I'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now
But I'm gonna love you anyhow24Embed
