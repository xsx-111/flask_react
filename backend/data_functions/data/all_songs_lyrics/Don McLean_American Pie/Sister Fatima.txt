Sister Fatima LyricsThe spirit of Fatima still rules the earth
She knows your future, she knows what it's worth
Sister Fatima has God-given powers
And on 42nd Street, a shop that sells flowers
Is her palace
Come and be healed
And she knows all your business, your health and your ills
She'll counsel your weddings, divorces, and wills
For full restoration, five dollars an hour
And with each consultation, a free holy flower
And if she likes you, why, you can have two
And I came from nowhere, like you and your friend
My searching and wandering went on without end
My future was dim, my spirit was crushed
In one sacred moment, my questions were hushed
I'm a servant of fate in this garden of truth
A humble recruit of the taffeta booth
Where all things are known, but few are revealed
Where sins are forgotten, and sickness is healed
For five dollars
The flower is freeEmbed
