Turkey Dinner LyricsYou're my turkey dinner
You're good enough to eat
Open up that oven
Your juices smell so sweet
They smell so sweet
I'll provide the gravy
It's a family recipe
The secret is in the stuffing
And I'm sure you'll agree
You will agree
Oh, Thanksgiving
Thanks for giving her to me
Oh, Thanksgiving
Thanks for giving her to me
Thanks for giving her to me
Will I choose a drumstick?
Or start with a wing?
Maybe eat some white meat?
I want everything
Everything
I want everything
Everything
Everything
Because you're my turkey dinner
And you're my heart's desire
You're my, you're my one reason for living
One reason for thanksgivingEmbed
