Hayride to Hell LyricsCharlie was a driver and he hardly spent a night at home
He never saw his family
Trucking loads those long weeks on the road, oh
And Charlie would drive (And Charlie would drive)
For miles and miles (For miles and miles)
Alone, whoa
Charlie had a teenage daughter he thought of as a little girl
But one day he came home
His little girl had grown-up news to tell, well
"Oh, Daddy," she cried ("Oh, Daddy," she cried)
"Oh, Daddy, I tried" ("Oh, Daddy, I tried")
But on the hayride, how I fell
That was a hayride bound for Hell
Now, Billy Jackson was the father
But he wasn't man enough to own
And his daddy was the mayor who told Charlie
"Why don't you leave my Billy-boy alone?"
Billy had to hide (Billy had to hide)
There was guilt inside (There was guilt inside)
And you can't hide from yourself
That's just a hayride bound for Hell (Hell)
Hell
Charlie's daughter died whilst giving birth to Billy Jackson's child
And Billy Jackson ain't been seen around these parts
For quite a while
And Charlie would drive (And Charlie would drive)
For miles and miles (For miles and miles)
And his tail-lights say farewell
Just like a hayride bound for
And his tail lights, they say farewell
He's a hayride bound for Hell
Bound for Hell (Hell)
He's bound for HellEmbed
