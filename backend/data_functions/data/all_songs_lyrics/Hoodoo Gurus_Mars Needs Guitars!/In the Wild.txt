In the Wild Lyrics
I will drive down Highway One
It's the end that's just begun
And I'm cruising 110
Going nowhere, the road is my best friend
White line fever has got in my blood
I'm a river running full flood

One road all around this land
Like the lifeline in my hand
Out from nowhere the radio sings
Of distant memories that tug on my heartstrings
I feel twisted, feeling uptight
As her face keeps fading from sight

In the wild, in the wild, in the wild
In the wild, in the wild, in the wild


See me spinning out in the Sun
I will burn on Highway One
Now, I'm just burning in the Sun
I can't stop 'til she comes
In the wild, in the wild, in the wild
In the wild, in the wild, in the wild

So wild and I'm dry
It's so dry, oh
And it's so dry
And it feels so dry, it's so dry
So dry, it's so dry
So dry, it's so dry
It's so dryEmbed
