The Other Side of Paradise Lyrics
I took my love out for a walk into the rain
The time had come when we should talk things out again
(Where did you go?) I can't recall
(What did you do?) Not much at all
The other side of paradise
Paradise

If we were perfect we would know perfect love
But we're so different, we can't go like a hand fits in a glove
(Where did you go?) I can't recall
(What did you do?) Not much at all
The other side of paradise
Paradise
Paradise

The other side, the other side of your love
Well, I'll cross that line
But that's not enough
It's too much


The other side, the other side of your love
Well, I'll cross that line
But that's not enough
No, it's too much
But in the end it will depend on you and me
And if you still call yourself my friend, you soon will see
It's in the way we treat ourselves and those all around
We must believe that we could help if we could
Fight against our prejudice and try to straighten out this mess
(What did you do?) I cannot recall
(Where did you go?) Not far at all
The other side of paradise
Paradise
Paradise
Oh-oh, ahEmbed
