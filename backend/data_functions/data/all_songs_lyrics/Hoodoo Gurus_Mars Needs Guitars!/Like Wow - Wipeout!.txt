Like Wow - Wipeout! Lyrics
I kiss the ground on which you walk
I kiss the lips through which you talk
I kiss the city of New York
Where I first met you

You're my darlin', don't forget it
'Cause I'm the guy who will regret it
I love you more than when I said it
When I first met you

I love the way you talk (Ah-ah-ah)
You walk (Ah-ah-ah)
You smile (Ah-ah-ah)
Your style (Ah-ah-ah)
Like, now
Like, wow
Wipe-out
No doubt
That I was gone the moment I laid eyes on you

You'll never be a beauty queen
Won't feature in no magazine
But you're the best that's ever been
I'm glad that I met you
Take every day now as it comes
You take the cake, I'll keep the crumbs
I only hear the sound of drums in my heart
That means that I get you

I love the way you talk (Ah-ah-ah)
You walk (Ah-ah-ah)
You smile (Ah-ah-ah)
Your style (Ah-ah-ah)
Your dress (Ah-ah-ah)
Your caress (Ah-ah-ah)
Well, yes, yes, yes, yes
I'm impressed
And I was gone the moment I laid eyes on you


I love the way you talk (Ah-ah-ah)
You walk (Ah-ah-ah)
You smile (Ah-ah-ah)
Your style (Ah-ah-ah)
Like, now
Like, wow
Wipe-out
No doubt
That I was gone the moment I laid eyes on you
I laid eyes on you
I laid eyes on youEmbed
