Bring The Hoodoo Down Lyrics
When shadows fill the sky
And evil's all around
Don't call a preacher
A different creature
Bring the hoodoo down

Beside a sacred fire
That's where he will be found
Somewhere in Haiti
Baron Samedi
Bring the hoodoo down
Bring the hoodoo down

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's a river of blood and a river of tears
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's a river of love

I know you'll die to see
That zombie jamboree
The dead will tango
Until the mambo
Bring the hoodoo down
Bring the hoodoo down
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's a river of blood and a river of tears
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
It's a river of love

We're gonna learn to dance
And fall into a trance
And picking cotton
Will be forgotten
Bring the hoodoo down
Bring the hoodoo down
Bring the hoodoo downEmbed
