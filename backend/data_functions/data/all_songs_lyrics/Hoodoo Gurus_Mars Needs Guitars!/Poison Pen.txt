Poison Pen Lyrics
"Dear John," so begins the famous old story
"Goodbye, au revoir, thanks for the memory"
Keep it short and sweet if you really care

D-I-vor-C-E can be so hurtful
It makes public property of things that are personal
All the friends and family get their share

Ink is black, as black as night
Black as thoughts that shun the light
Truth will out and maybe then
You'll put down that poison pen
That poison pen

Everyone enjoys sharing a rumour
But when it's aimed at you it loses its humour
Sometimes words so innocent cut so deep

Ink is black, as black as night
Black as thoughts that shun the light
Truth will out and maybe then
You'll put down that poison pen
That poison pen
That poison pen
Everybody's telling me talk is cheap
Sometimes words so innocent cut so deep
Cut so deep
They cut so deep
So deep

Ink is black (Ink is black)
As black as night (As black as night)
Black as thoughts (Black as thoughts)
That shun the light (That shun the light)

Ink is black, as black as night
Black as thoughts that shun the light
Truth will out and maybe then
You'll put down that poison pen
Poison pen
That poison pen
That poison pen
Poison pen

Black as night (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just black as coal
Black as thoughts (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
That cast a shadow right across my soul
I thought that you were my friend
'Til you picked up that poison pen
That poison pen, yeah
