She Lyrics
In the valley
Hidden valley
Secret world below
Is her kingdom
Glowing crimson
By the lava flow
I was captured
Bound, enraptured
Kneeling at her feet
Then she beckoned
In a second
My life was complete

Is she my girl?
She
She is my girl
She

On the mountain
Springs a fountain
Of eternal youth
I was taken
To awaken
To an ancient truth
She's the dreaming
With no meaning
In the light of day
And my senses
Sleep defenceless
As she slips away
Is she my girl?
She, she
She is my girl
She, she
She, she


Is she my girl?
She, she
She is my girl
She, she
She, she
SheEmbed
