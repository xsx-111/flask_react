In The Wild - Live Lyrics
"This one, you need some really wide treads for this song. Best heard in the back of a... I don't know, a panel van, I guess, with a, a good set of speakers on the wall.. some nice fluffy dice on the front of the dashboard. "If this van's rockin' don't bother knockin'" In The Wild"

I will drive down Highway One
It's the end that's just begun
And I'm cruising 110
Going nowhere, the road is my best friend
White line fever has got in my blood
I'm a river running full flood

One road all around this land
Like the lifeline in my hand, my hand
Out from nowhere the radio sings
Of distant memories that tug on my heartstrings
I feel twisted, kinda uptight
As her face keeps fading from sight

In the wild, in the wild, in the wild
In the wild, in the wild, in the wild


See me spinning out in the Sun
Now, I will burn on Highway One
'Cause, I'm just burning in the Sun
I can't stop until she comes
In the wild, in the wild, in the wild
In the wild, in the wild, in the wild

It's so dry
This is what I cry
It's so dry
And it's so dry
It's so dry, it's so dry
So dry, it's so dry
So dry
It's so dryEmbed
