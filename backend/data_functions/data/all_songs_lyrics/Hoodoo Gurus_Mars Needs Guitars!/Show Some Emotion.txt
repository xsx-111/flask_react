Show Some Emotion Lyrics
Show me some emotion
I need to know right now
How can I read your mind?
Truly, my love is blind

You must know I've fallen hard for you
But you don't react as if you do
And your eyes just seem to look straight through
But I see you

Show me some emotion
I cannot understand
There is no need to hide
All that you feel inside
Show some emotion
Why are you waiting for?
How can I read your mind?
Truly, my love is blind

Did somebody hurt you once before?
There are other friendships left for you to explore
You play your cards close to your chest
What you're thinking, I can only guess
Here is my request, it's just this
Show me some emotion

Show me your emotion
How can I read your mind?
Truly, my love must be blind

My love is blind
My love is blind
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)
(Uh-huh)Embed
