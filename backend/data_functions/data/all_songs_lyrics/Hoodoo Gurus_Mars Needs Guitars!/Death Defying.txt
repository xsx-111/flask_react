Death Defying Lyrics
Ever since the world began, ooh-ee
Men have sailed to foreign lands, ooh-ee
And the fortune that they've found, ooh-ee
Are now buried in the ground, ooh-ee

Some would say the ocean roars, ooh-ee
As it stumbles to the shore, ooh-ee
But to me, it only sings, ooh-ee
Of the sorrow that it brings, ooh-ee

All my friends are dead or they're dying
And our laughter turns into crying
It's death-defying

Well, I barely learned to swim, ooh-ee
Just enough to save my skin, ooh-ee
Now I'll never sail alone, ooh-ee
And my harbour is my home, ooh-ee

All my friends are dead or they're dying
And our laughter turns into crying
It's death-defying
Hey-hey-ey
Hey-ey
If there's one thing that I've learned, ooh-ee
It's the point of no return, ooh-ee
And if that's to be our fate, ooh-ee
Now's no time to hesitate, ooh-ee

Now's no time to hesitate
Now's no time to hesitateEmbed
