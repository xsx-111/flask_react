Teenage Head - Live LyricsI'm a monster
I got a revved-up teenage head
Teenage monster
California born and bred
Half a boy and half a man
Half at sea and half on land, oh my
Oh my
I got a woman
Yes, she's my hopped-up high-school queen
Yeah, she's my woman
She's a teenage love machine
She knows how to turn me on
She gets me high and get it on and on
Yeah, she does, oh
If you see me
You better turn your tail and run
Because I'm angry
And I'll mess you up for fun
I'm a child of atom bombs
And rotten air and Vietnam, I'm you
You are me
You are me
You are meEmbed
