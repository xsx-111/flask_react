Doors of Heaven LyricsOpen up the doors of heaven and let me in
I think I'm finally tired of living, let me in
I'm going to walk into glory
Tell everyone my story
So open up the doors of heaven and let me in
I've tried to live my life in a righteous way
I tried to do my best from day to day
But no matter how hard I try
It seems all I do is cry
So open up the doors of heaven and let me in
Someone told me there's a better place than this
Where I can go and receive my mother's kiss
A place so full of love
Somewhere up above
So open up the doors of heaven and let me in
I hear them say that this life is a gift
That it's precious as a baby's breath
They can talk to a door
When my time has come
Open up the doors of heaven and let me in
Open up the doors of heaven and let me in
I think I'm finally tired of living, let me in
I'm going to walk into glory
Tell everyone my story
Open up the doors of heaven and let me in
Open up the doors of heaven and let me in
Open up the doors of heaven and let me in
Open up the doors of heaven and let me in
Open up the doors of heaven and let me inEmbed
