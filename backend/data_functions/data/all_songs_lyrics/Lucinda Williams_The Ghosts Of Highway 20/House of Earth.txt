House of Earth LyricsCome to my House of Earth
If you would like for me to give your old time feelings back
Come here to my house of good rich earth
If you would like me to teach your wife a thing or two
Come here to this illegal place for joys
And teach your wife this way to grow new boys
I'll take you by your hand and show you whirls
Of these same feelings that grow pretty girls
I'll wash your feet a couple of times a day
Till all of your old time sorrow melts away
You'll leave some drops of honey on my couch
I'll leave a couple dollars in your pouch
My House of Earth is the richest land in town
I pity those dead ones that at me frown
So come to my House of Earth and learn its worth
A few green folded bills to learn of birth
I kiss you in such odd unnatural ways
Your wife will then find out that kissing pays
Two times a day, I'll wash you in my tub
Ten times a day, I'll pat your skin and rub
Call me a prostitute and a whore too
I'll do these tricks your wife refuses to
I swear by all my Bibles you won't regret
I've never seen a man who's sorry yet
I love you once to teach you all your life
The things to do when you are with your wife
Your wife should be quite glad and proud of me
For waking both of you up to these things, you see
My House of Earth runs down with wine and rum
Lots of different ways that you can come
And if you do come, I will be glad to see you
And if you don't come, I'm glad you don't need me
I'll furnish red hot kisses and the hole
That wakes a sleeping sickness in your soulEmbed
