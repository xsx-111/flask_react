Ghosts of Highway 20 Lyrics
I know this road like the back of my hand
Same with the stations on the FM band
Farms and truck stops, firework stands
I know this road like the back of my hand
Southern secrets still buried deep
Brooding and restless 'neath the cracked concrete
If you were from here you would defend me to the death
Along with the ghosts of highway twenty
I went through hell when I was younger
Deep in the well you'll see the hunger
To find the strength I've got within me
To wrestle with the ghosts of highway twenty
Been sixty years, I don't want for nothing
But my tears they keep on coming
And my fears continue to haunt me
Along with the ghosts of highway twenty

Who I am now  is who I was then
I knew some how I'd come back again
No doubt about it, I'm next of kin
To all the ghosts along highway twenty
Run down motels and faded billboards
Used cars for sale and rusty junkyards
This two lane blacktop will never let me
Let go of the ghosts along highway twenty
And I have seen the signs that say
We're closing in on the final days
But I got nothing to repent
My saving grace is with the ghosts of highway twenty

Every question, every breath
Every exit leaves a little death
In its wake a memory
That will wander with the ghosts of highway twenty

And I have seen the signs that say
We're closing in on the final days
But I've got nothing to repent
My saving grace is with the ghosts of highway twenty
My saving grace is with the ghosts on highway twenty
My saving grace is with the ghosts on highway twentyEmbed
