Bitter Memory LyricsGo away bitter memory
I figured finally you'd stay away from me
But I was wrong
You're still strong
Go away bitter memory
Yeah go away bitter memory
You keep on bothering me
Why won't you let me be
You made my cry
Why won't you die
Go away bitter memory

Well bitter memory
You're a thorn in my side
Bitter memory
You're the trouble on my mind
Find a new place to call home
You're not welcome anymore
Let me show you to the door bitter memory
Go away bitter memory
Why do you have to be a source of misery
Leave me alone
Let me live on
Go away bitter memory
Yeah go away bitter memory
And quit constantly interrupting me
Don't come around you lonesome sound
Go away bitter memory

Let me show you to the door bitter memory Embed
