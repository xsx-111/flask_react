Place in My Heart Lyrics
There's a place in my heart
I got room to spare
There's a place in my heart
I made you room for you there
Even though you make me blue
I've got room enough for you
No matter what you do
I want you to know that
You have a place in my heart

You'll always have somewhere to call home
No matter the circumstances
Wherever you are you're never alone
So don't laugh and say, "what are the chances?"

Will you be welcome and will I let you in
When the sky is raining and thundering
As sure as winter turns to spring
You're asking yourself and wondering

Is there a place in my heart?
Do I have room to spare?
Yeah, there's a place in my heart
I made you room for you there
Even though you make me blue
I've got room enough for you
No matter what you do
I, I want you to know that
You have a place in my heart
Even though you take my love for granted
I'm pretty strong when I admit it
You might be surprised at what I can manage
But don't you ever forget

That there's a place in my heart
I got room to spare
There's a place in my heart
I made room for you there
Even though you make me blue
I've got room enough for you
No matter what you do
I, I want you to know that
You have a place in my heartEmbed
