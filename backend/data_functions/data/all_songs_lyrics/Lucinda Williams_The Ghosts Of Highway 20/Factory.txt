Factory Lyrics
Early in the morning, factory whistle blows
Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes
He takes his lunch and walks out in the morning light
It's the working, the working, it's the working life

Through mansions of fear, through the mansions of pain
I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain
Factory takes his hearing, factory gives him life
It's the working, the working, just the working life

End of the day, factory whistle cries
Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes
You better believe, boy, somebody's gonna get hurt tonight
It's the working, the working, just the working life

Early in the morning, factory whistle blows
Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes
He takes his lunch and walks out in the morning light
It's the working, the working, just the working life
It's the working, the working, just the working life
It's the working, the working, just the working lifeEmbed
