Death Came LyricsI was called to the rolling banks by the water
To bathe in the river of truth
The river tried to pull me under
And refused to turn me loose
I was called to read from the bible of life
And I read from beginning to end
Every page and every line
Still I could not comprehend

Death came, death came
And gave you his kiss
Death came, death came
And took you away from this
Oh, I miss you so and I long to know
Why death gave you his kiss
I tasted the fruit from the tree of knowledge
And I ate from dawn till dark
I was sated, but not satisfied
Until I carved my name in the bark
I was called to drink and was seduced
By the sweetest, ripest berry
I quenched my thirst with the red juice
Still I found no sanctuary
Death came, death came
And gave you his kiss
Death came, death came
And took you away from this
Oh, I miss you so and I long to know
Why death gave you his kiss
Death came, death came
And gave you his kiss
Death came, death came
And took you away from this
Oh, I miss you so and I long to know
Why death gave you his kiss
I miss you so and I long to know
Why death gave you his kissEmbed
