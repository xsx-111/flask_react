I Know All About It LyricsYou've been living on the jazz side of life
Carrying your pain in your back pocket like a sharp-edged knife
And somebody told me there's the man you've been seeing
But I know he ain't your lover and I know he ain't your friend
And I can tell by the way you look
You ain't been treating yourself right, girl and you've been hooked
And if I could, I would I come to your side
But I know you wouldn't want me to, it would only hurt your pride

Why do you act like you don't know me at all?
Why do you, why do you turn your face to the wall?
Girl, don't try to run away like that
I know about the pain and all that jazz
You lean against the bar with that look on your face
The leather is worn on your boots and your blouse is tattered lace
You pawned your guitar and you busted again
Your Chevy's broken down and you're looking for a ride with him
You lie on your bed and stare at the plaster peeling
And wonder where your spirit went, that wild, abandoned feeling
Something you always knew about, something you almost forgot
Hidden in a place somewhere deep down in your heart
Why do you act like you don't know me at all?
Why do you, why do you turn your face to the wall?
Girl, don't try to run away like that
I know about the pain and all that jazz
I know all about the pain and all that jazz
I know all about it
I know all about it, girl
I know all about it
I know all about it, girl
I know all about it
I know all about it, girl
I know all about it
I know all about itEmbed
