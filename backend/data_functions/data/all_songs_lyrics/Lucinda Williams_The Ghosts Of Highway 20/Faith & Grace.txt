Faith & Grace Lyrics
With a little more faith and grace
To help me run this race
That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
Just a little more faith and grace
Is all that I need

My burden seems hard to bear
No one to help me share
But I know I can make the call
'Cause I know God will hear
It seems like every door locked
I know He's gonna hear me knock
I know I will stand right
'Cause I'm standing on the rock

With just a little more faith and grace
To help me run this race
That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
Just a little more faith and grace
Is all that I need
My burden seems hard to bear
And no one to help me share
But I know I can make the call
I know God will hear
It seems like every door locked
And I know He's gonna hear me knock
And I know I will stand right
'Cause I'm standing on the rock

With just a little more faith and grace
To help me run this race
That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
Just a little more faith and grace
Is all that I need

That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
That's all, that's all, all I need
Faith and grace
Help me run this race
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
Some faith and grace
I need some faith and grace
I need a little more faith and grace
We all need more faith and grace
Everybody on faith and grace
Just a little more faith and grace
To help me run this race
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
A little more faith and grace
I need
C'mon faith and grace, yeah
I know I can make a call
I know God will hear
I know I can make a call
I know God will hear
I'll be standing right
I'll be standing on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
Stand on the rock
