Dust Lyrics
It's a sadness so deep the sun seems black
And you don't have to try to keep the tears back
No you don't have to try to keep the tears back
Cause you couldn't cry if you wanted to
You couldn't cry if you wanted to
Couldn't cry if you wanted to
You couldn't cry if you wanted to

Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust

So you stare at the ceiling
And wish the world would mend
Try to recall some better feeling
To no good end
Try to recall some better feeling
To no good end

But
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
It's a sadness so deep the sun seems black
And you don't have to try to keep the tears back
No you don't have to try to keep the tears back
Cause you couldn't cry if you wanted to
You couldn't cry if you wanted to
Couldn't cry if you wanted to
You couldn't cry if you wanted to

Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dust
Even your thoughts are dustEmbed
