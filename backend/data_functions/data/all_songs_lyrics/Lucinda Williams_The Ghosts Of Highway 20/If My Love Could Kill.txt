If My Love Could Kill LyricsIf my love could kill
If my love could kill
I would kill this
I would kill this
Slayer of wonders
Slayer of words
Murderer of poets
Murderer of songs
Who robbed me of your memory
Who robbed me of your time
Made her way into the symphony
Of your beautiful mind
Of your beautiful mind
If my love could kill
If my love could kill
I would kill this
I would kill this
Destroyer of brilliance
Destroyer of hope
Invader of skin
Invader of bone
Who robbed me of your memory
Who robbed me of your time
Made her way into the symphony
Of your beautiful mind
Of your beautiful mind
If my love could kill
If my love could kill
I would kill this
I would kill this
I would kill this
I would kill this
If my love could kill
If my love could kill
If my love could kill
If my love could killEmbed
