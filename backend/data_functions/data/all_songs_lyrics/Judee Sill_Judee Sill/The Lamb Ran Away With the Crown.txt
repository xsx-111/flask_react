The Lamb Ran Away With the Crown Lyrics
Once I heard a serpent remark
"If you try to evoke the spark
You can fly through the dark with a red midnight raven
To rule the battleground"

So I drew my sword and got ready
But the lamb ran away with the crown
So I drew my sword and got ready
But the lamb ran away with the crown

Though the beast within me's a liar
He made me glow with a strange desire
And I rode on the fire, with a blue sacred opal
To bless the battleground

But I turned to see its reflection
And the lamb ran away with the crown
But I turned to see its reflection
And the lamb ran away with the crown

Once a demon lived in my brow
I screamed and wailed and I cursed out loud
And I sailed through the clouds on ten crested cardinals
To guard my battleground
 (repeat to fade out)
But I laughed so hard I cried
And the lamb ran away with the crown
But I laughed so hard I cried
And the lamb ran away with the crown2Embed
