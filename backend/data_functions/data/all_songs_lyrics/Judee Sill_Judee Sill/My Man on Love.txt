My Man on Love Lyrics
One star remains in the false darkness
Have you met my man on love?
One truth survives death's silent starkness
Have you met my man on love?

No sorrow is like yours my friend
Though silence is your tomb
I'd take your every agony to
Save you from this doom

But one star remains in the false darkness
Have you met my man on love?
One truth survives death's silent starkness
Have you met my man on love?

In your eyes is an echo of
What once was passion, my friend
If I cried out loud, could you hear these words
Resurrection waits within

'Cause one star remains in the false darkness
Have you met my man on love?
One truth survives death's silent starkness
Have you met my man on love?
No sorrow is like yours my friend
Though silence is your tomb
I'd take your every agony to
Save you from this doom

But one star remains in the false darkness
Have you met my man on love?
One truth survives death's silent starkness
Have you met my man on love?

Most high, most high, my man on love
Most high, most high, my man on loveEmbed
