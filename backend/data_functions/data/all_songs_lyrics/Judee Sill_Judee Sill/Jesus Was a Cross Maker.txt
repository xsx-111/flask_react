Jesus Was a Cross Maker Lyrics
Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down fly in low for me
One time I trusted a stranger
'Cause I heard his sweet song
And it was gently enticing me
Though there was something wrong
But when I turned he was gone

Blinding me, his song remains, reminding me
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker

Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down fly in low for me
He wages war with the devil
A pistol by his side
And though he chases him out windows
And won't give him a place to hide
He keeps his door open wide

Fighting him, he lights a lamp inviting him
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down fly in low for me

I heard the thunder come rumbling
The light never looked so dim
I see the junction get nearer
And danger is in the wind
And either road's looking grim

Hiding me, earthly desire dividing me
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker

Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down fly in low for me

One time I trusted a stranger
'Cause I heard his sweet song
And it was gently enticing me
Though there was something wrong
But when I turned he was gone
Blinding me, his song remains, reminding me
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker

Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker...1Embed
