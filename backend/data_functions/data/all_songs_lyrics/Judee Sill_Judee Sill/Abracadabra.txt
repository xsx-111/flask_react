Abracadabra Lyrics
Here's to the man
Who forgot his way home
Who silently narrates
The confusion of his fight

He fears the great truth
That would free him with its mercy
He hates his own darkness
Dare he hide from this light?

Abracadabra, here's the key to the kingdom
See through the eyes that be behind yoursEmbed
