Lady-O Lyrics
While you sit and seek
A crescent moon is layin’ at your feet
With hope that’s made of sand
You don’t think you can
But you would held it all in your hand
Lady-O

I’ve been tryin’ hard to keep from needin’ you
But from the start
My heart just rolled and flowed
I’ve seen where it goes
And still somehow my love for you grows
Lady-O

So on my heels I’ll grow wings
Gonna ride silver strings
But I’ll see you in my holiest dreams
Lady-O


So on my heels I’ll grow wings
Gonna ride silver strings
But I’ll see you in my holiest dreams
Lady-O
I’ve been tryin’ hard to keep from needin’ you
But from the start
My heart just rolled and flowed
I’ve seen where it goes
And still somehow my love for you grows
Lady-O

So on my heels I’ll grow wings
Gonna ride silver strings
But I’ll see you in my holiest dreams
Lady-O

See you in my holiest dreams
