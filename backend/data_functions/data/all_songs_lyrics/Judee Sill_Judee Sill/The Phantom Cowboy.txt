The Phantom Cowboy Lyrics
I have seen the phantom cowboy ride
His trail of dust is in my dreams
With an eagle on his shoulder through the clouds he glides
And sprints across the spacial streams
But the ledge is steep
And the light is dark
Still I see him leap
And he keeps on headin' for a star
That's not very far, he's traveling on a silver filigree

I've been waitin' at the eastern gate
I waved my hand to flag him down
I always hope to catch him but he just can't wait
He's not allowed to reach the ground
But his touch can heal
When the light is dark
Doesn't need a shield
'Cause he keeps on heading for a star
That's not very far, he likes it all just because it's real

Though I'm sitting in the grit and grime
The spark of hope is in me strong
I'm gonna try to get there in the nick of time
And maybe I can ride along
If I have no fear
When the light is dark
I can feel you near
Though you keep on heading for a star
That's not very far, please don't forgit (sic)
If your way is clear, I'll be waitin' hereEmbed
