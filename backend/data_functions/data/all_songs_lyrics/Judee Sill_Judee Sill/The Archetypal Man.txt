The Archetypal Man Lyrics
Fleeter even than Mercury
He flies inside the walls he calls his own
He came hidin' but now I see
He looks like everyone I've ever known
He comes bearin' a sacrifice
I know him by the rose that's in his hand
I've been listenin' to his advice
I hear the words but I can't understand

His moon mirage is shinin'
Shiftin' the things that he can't endure
But all through the darkness his pain is pure

Fleeter than even Mercury
He flies inside the walls he calls his own
He came hidin' but now I see
He looks like everyone I've ever known
He comes bearin' a sacrifice
I know him by the rose that's in his hand
I've been listenin' to his advice
I hear the words but can't understand

His moon mirage is shinin'
Through his veins flows a fool's gold flood
But through the rose in his hand flows bloodEmbed
