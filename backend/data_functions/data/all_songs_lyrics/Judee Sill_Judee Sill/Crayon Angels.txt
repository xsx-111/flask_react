Crayon Angels Lyrics
Crayon angel songs are slightly out of tune
But I'm sure I'm not to blame
Nothing's happened but I think it will soon
So I sit here waitin' for God and a train
To the astral plane

Magic rings I made have turned my finger green
And my mystic roses died
Guess reality is not as it seems
So I sit here hopin' for truth and a ride
To the other side

Phony prophets stole the only light I knew
And the darkness softly screamed
Holy visions disappeared from my view
But the angels come back and laugh in my dreams
I wonder what it meansEmbed
