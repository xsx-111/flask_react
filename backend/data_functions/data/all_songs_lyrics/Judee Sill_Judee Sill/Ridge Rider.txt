Ridge Rider Lyrics
He rides the ridge between dark and light
Without partners or friends
He’s courageous enough to be scared
But he’s too humble to win

Bless the ridge rider
The ridge he’s ridin’ is mighty thin
I guess the ridge rider
Forgits he’s travelin’ with a friend

He comes from under the cryptosphere
Where the great sadness begins
And he doesn’t pretend to be brave
Though the road’s dusty and dim

Bless the ridge rider
The ridge he’s ridin’ is mighty thin
I guess the ridge rider
Forgits he’s travelin’ with a friend

Since the great fall he’s been travelin’ hard
Thinkin’ bondage is sin
Hopin’ someday the path’ll turn gold
And the weight will turn into wind
Bless the ridge rider
The ridge he’s ridin’ is mighty thin
I guess the ridge rider
Forgits he’s travelin’ with a friend

He rides the ridge between dark and light
Without partners or friends
He’s courageous enough to be scared
But he’s too humble to win

Bless the ridge rider
The ridge he’s ridin’ is mighty thin
I guess the ridge rider
Forgits he’s travelin’ with a friendEmbed
