Good Old Desk LyricsMy old desk does an arabesque
In the morning when I first arrive
It's a pleasure to see it's waiting there for me
To keep my hopes alive
Such a comfort to know it's got no place to go
It's always there
It's the one thing I've got, a huge success
My good old desk
My old desk never needs a rest
And I've never once heard it cry
I've never seen it tease, it's always there to please me
From nine to five
Such a comfort to know, it's dependable and slow
But it's always there
It's the one friend I've got, a giant of all times
My good old desk
My old desk isn't picturesque
But it's happy as a desk can be
We never say a word, but it's perfectly all right with me
For when my heart's on the floor, I just open the drawer
Of my favorite guest
And what do I see but a picture of me
Working at my good old deskEmbed
