Little Cowboy LyricsLittle fellow you're so tired
You can hardly lift your head
But you wanna hear a story
Before you go to bed
So if you'll be quiet
And listen patiently
I'll sing you a song
That my mother sang to me
Little cowboy, put your saddle in the barn
Tie your horse up tight, so he'll know no harm
Put your hat and your gun
Beside you on the chair
Don't forget, you've got to say a little prayer
Little cowboy, you'd better hit the sandman trail
Or you'll be late for round-up time you know
If you wanna be a cowboy, you'd better rest a while
Little cowboy baby of the old corral
Little cowboy baby of the old corralEmbed
