Bath LyricsI'm leaving here this morning but I don't know where I've been
I'm going home to take my bath but I'll be back again
Yeah, I'm leaving here this morning with a smile upon my face
I'm beginning to think there's hope for the human race
I'm leaving here this morning but I don't know where I've been
There's a lot of talk about the place but I'll be back again
Yeah, I'm leaving here this morning with my eyes all open wide
And I'm awfully glad you let me come inside
Doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo
Doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo, wa-ha
My eyes are getting heavy and my knees a little weak
My mouth so dry it hurts my throat when I begin to speak
Yeah, but I'm leaving here this morning with a smile upon my face
I'm beginning to think there's hope for the human race
Doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo
Doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo whacka doo, wa-haEmbed
