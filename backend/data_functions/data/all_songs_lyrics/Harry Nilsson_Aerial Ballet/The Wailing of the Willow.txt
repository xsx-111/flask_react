The Wailing of the Willow LyricsListen to the wailing of the willows
Listen to me crying on my pillow
Crying cause I know my love is gone from me
Living in a world of different places
Looking at a million different faces
Yet I see a face in every face I see
Love must lack a sense of humor
It laughs when other people cry
Love, would love to hear the rumor
That you and I have finally said goodbye
I know that every heart was made for breaking
And my love was ready for the takin'
Still I won't complain, for someday love will call again
Must I take a memory as a token
To replace a heart that love has broken
Will the wailing willow always weep for me
Must I see a face in every face I see
Listen to the wailing of the willow treeEmbed
