Together LyricsLife isn't easy
When two are divided
And one has decided to bring down the curtain
And one thing's for certain
There's nothing to keep them together
How does it happen
That two can be tender
And one be the lender
Of love and emotion
That covered the ocean
Of sadness that kept them together
Love when it started
Was easy to measure
Each day was a pleasure
Each night an adventure
Each morning was something
That had to be shared together
Love when it's growing
Is full of surprises
Its temperature rises
From higher to higher
Then turns into fire
That has to be shared together
Then came the sadness
Which follows the laughter
Which, shortly thereafter
The dream had exploded
The promise was broken
Now few words are spoken together
Life isn't easy
When two are divided
And one has decided to bring down the curtain
And one thing's for certain
There's nothing to keep them togetherEmbed
