I Said Goodbye to Me LyricsI said goodbye to me
I looked in the mirror
Then I began to cry
I'll leave my things behind for all to see
And hope that she will understand why
Ending the game is like changing the name of your favorite song
Step out of rhyme for the very first time and the song is gone
There's nothing left to say
I'll pack up my memories
Then I'll walk away
I hope I'm doing right, but by tonight
The horse and coach will be on his way
I said goodbye to me
I looked in the mirror
Then I began to cry
I'll leave my things behind for all to see
And hope that she will understand whyEmbed
