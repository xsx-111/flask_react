Walking the Dog II LyricsWalking alone 'cause the night is dead
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge
How you lost your mind
Your wrist got bruised
You wanted better love
When it was sleeping in your bedroom
Hold on
Stay on my side
Don't go
If you could see me
Whoever I am
It's not like the movies
It's not all skin and bones
So come on love
Come on, come on, go
No, no, no
I will not let you go
I will not let you go
Now I'm walking alone 'cause the night is dead
My feet don't glide like they did back then
When I would call you up so we could shoot the moon
These days I'm left to howl in tune
Hearts do break
I must admit
I got a better set of calls
I might have been faking it
Think I really only cried just once
If you could see me
Whoever I am
It's not like the movies
It's not all skin and bones
So come on love
Come one, come on, go
No, no, no
I will not let you go
After all the shows
After the boys of summer did go
Amid all the confusion
These friends I've been losing
I always thought from the start
I'd be the one moving on
I guess I'll never know
Where all the boys of summer did go
But I'll miss what we made
I know the days were not wasted
There are some things that I may never know
How you lost your mind
And your wrists got bruised
You wanted better love
Sleeping your bedroom
Hold on
Stay on my side
Don't go
I wish you could see me
Whoever I am
It's not like the movies
It's not all skin and bones
So come on love
Come one, come on, go
No, no, no
I will not let you goEmbed
