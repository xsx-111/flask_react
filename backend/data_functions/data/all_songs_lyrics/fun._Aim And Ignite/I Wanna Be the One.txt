I Wanna Be the One Lyrics
Were you named for the river that surrounds
All my biggest mistakes or the way that I made it out
All the muscles in my mouth never smiled or said profound things
Until the day she handed you to me

Now for all the steps you'll take and all you've overcome
I wanna be the one to put it in a song
Take every single tear for all the world to hear
I wanna be the one to put it in a song

Cigarettes are raining hard on the Upper East Side
She brings me a cake we celebrate I have arrived
And I know that it's been sang before
But you're my human holiday
I put my hands to the table
And dare say the love of my life
And your brother with his best friend
Shares the name of an inebriate
Really couldn't bring me down

Now for everything you lost and all you've overcome
I wanna be the one to put it in a song
Take every single tear for all the world to hear
I wanna be the one to put it in a song
And make it last forever
Clever comes in truth when truth begets the past
It sends a call out to the moon
And the moon can see the beauty that
Surrounds your heart as it pounds
It starts the beat inspiring me until I make a sound
I wanna be the one, I wanna be one, I wanna be the one
Now, now, now

Now for everything you lost and all you've overcome
I wanna be the one to put it in a song
Take every single tear for all the world to hear
I wanna be the one to put it in a song3Embed
