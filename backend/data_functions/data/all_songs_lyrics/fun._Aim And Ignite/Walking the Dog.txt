Walking the Dog Lyrics
Walking alone, cause the night is dead
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge
How you lost your mind, and your wrists got bruised
And you wanted better love, well it's sleeping in your bedroom
Hold up, stay on my side, don't go

If you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones
So come on, love (Come on, come one, come all and go)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I will not let you go

Now I'm walking alone, cause the night is dead
My feet don't glide like they did back then
When I'd call you up so we could shoot the moon
These days I'm left to howl in tune
Well hearts do break, and I must admit
I got a better set of chords so I might have been faking it
I think I really only cried just once, so

If you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones
So come on, love (Come on, come one, come all and go)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I will not let you go
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I will not let you go
(After all the shows
After the boys of summer have gone)
Amid all the confusion (These friends I've been losing)
I always thought from the start (I'd be the one moving on)
I guess I'll never know
Where the boys of summer have gone
(But I'll miss what we made) All the days were not wasted
(There are some things I may never know)
How you lost your mind, and your wrists got bruised
And you wanted better love, well it's sleeping in your bedroom
Hold up, stay on my side, don't go

If you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones
So come on, love (Come on, come one, come all and go)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I will not let you go
If you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones
So come on, love (Come on, come one, come all and go)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I will not let you go
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I will not let you go
If you could see me, whoever I am
It's not like a movie, it's not all skin and bones
So come on, love (Come on, come one, come all and go)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na I will not let you go
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na...4Embed
