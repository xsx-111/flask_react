Take Your Time (Coming Home) Lyrics
Din-an-ah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Din-an-ah
Oh, oh
Take your time coming home
Hear the wheels as they roll
Let your lungs fill up with smoke
Forgive everyone
She is here and now, she is home
We had plans, we can't help but make love, love, love
It's a beautiful thing when you love somebody
And I love somebody
Yeah I love somebody, home
Take your time coming home
Hear the wheels as they roll
Let your lungs fill up with smoke
Forgive everyone
I don't think I'd been misled
It was a rock and roll band
I'm still standing
Take your time coming home
Home
See, of everyone who called
Very few said, "We believe in you"
The overwhelming choices
I'm just a boy inside a voice
And if it's true, is it true, if it's true
Then what the fuck have I been doing the last six years?
How did I end up here?
How'd I find love and conquer all of my fears?
See, I made it out
Out from under the sun
And the truth is that I feel better
Because I've forgiven everyone
Now I'm not scared (din-an-ah)
Of a song (din-an-ah)
Or the states (holdin' on-nah)
Or the stages (holdin' on-nah)
I'm not scared (holdin' on-nah)
I've got friends (din-an-ah)
Took my call (ooh)
Came courageous
Now I feel like I am home
Din-an-ah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
One more thing, I keep having this dream
Where I'm standing on a mountain looking out
On the street, and I can hear kids in low-income houses singing
"We're through with causing a scene"
But, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know what it means
But I too, I'm through with causing a scene
Din-an-ah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Din-an-ah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Din-an-ah
Din-an-ah
Holdin' on-nah
Holdin' on-nah
Din-an-ah
Din-an-ah
Oh, oh
She is here and now, I think she's ready to go
For every love that's lost I heard a new one comes
Come on! Come on!
Oh, come on with me, sing along with me (when you love somebody)
Let the wind catch your feet
If you love somebody
You'd better let them know
(Take your, take your)
(Take your time)
To take their time coming home
Hear the wheels as they roll
Let your lungs fill up with smoke
Forgive everyone
Well, I don't think I'd been misled
It was a rock and roll band
I'm here standing
Take your time coming home, oh, oh, oh
I said take your time, coming home
Take your time, coming home
Take your time, coming home
Oh
I said take your time, coming home
Take your time, coming home
I said, take your, take your
Take your time, coming home, oh, oh, oh, oh!
I said I want to hear you!
I said I want to hear you!
I said I want to pass you down
I will shrug my hair
You said, oh, oh, oh!
Take your time!
Oh, it's a beautiful thing when you love somebody
Beautiful thing when you love somebody
And I love, I love, I love, I love somebody, oh, oh, oh...

Feel in your feet
I said, oh, come on with me
Sing along with me
Don't ever let this go!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, to take your timeEmbed
