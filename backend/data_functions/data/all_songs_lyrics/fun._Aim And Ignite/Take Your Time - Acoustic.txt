Take Your Time - Acoustic LyricsOne, two, three, four
Take your time coming home
Hear the wheels as they roll
Let your lungs fill up with smoke
Forgive everyone
She is here and now
She is home
We had plans
We can't help but make love
Oh, it's a beautiful thing when you love somebody
Yeah, I love somebody
Oh, I love somebody
Oh
Take your time coming home
Hear the wheels as they roll
Let your lungs fill up with smoke
Forgive everyone
But I don't think I've been misled
It was a rock and roll band
I'm here standing
Take your time coming home1Embed
