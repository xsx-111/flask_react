Light a Roman Candle with Me Lyrics
Light a roman candle with me
Just a roman candle
You can wear your sandals
And I'll pour you just one cup of tea
Then you can go and rest
You haven't seen my best, so

Just spend an evening with me
Just a lazy evening
Then you could be leaving
Or we could stay and talk until three
I will think it's magic and I'll hope you'll agree, so

Light a roman candle with me
Just a roman candle
Just a perfect apple, oh
Light a roman candle with me
Just a roman candle
Just a perfect apple

If we were honest
And both wrote a sonnet
Together a sandwich with everything on it
At least we would know
That the sparks didn't glow
But we owe it to ourselves to try
So we aim and ignite
So often I call and I plead with you
"Give me a chance!"
It's not often that I understand
The ins and the outs of what's wrong and what's right
Don't think of tomorrow tonight
Oh, I know, it goes on, it gets old
But for now we're young, we smell good, we're alone, so alive
You look for a legend
I'm looking for common ground
Your heart isn't breaking
And mine isn't making a sound, oh

Oh I know, it goes on, it gets old
Oh I know, it goes on, it gets old, so

Light a roman candle with me
Just a roman candle
Just a perfect apple, oh3Embed
