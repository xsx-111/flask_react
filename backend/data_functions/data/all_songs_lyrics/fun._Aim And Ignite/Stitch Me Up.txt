Stitch Me Up Lyrics
It's how we do it!
Our feet in the sand
It's how we do it!
Our heads in our hands
It's how we do it!
I'm not looking for a reason to go
It's how we do it!
We did it, we done it, but never before
Oh, I know

You put the keys in the car and drive
I'm gonna make sure the money is right
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive

It's how we do it!
It's how we do it
If I lose you, I'm losing control
So snap your fingers, pull the trigger
Cause I figure we're better as ghosts
It's how we do it
On a satellite, looking for a signal to space
It's how we do it
We did it, we done it, let's do it again

You put the keys in the car and drive
I'm gonna make sure the money is right
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up
Though I've never been better then when falling apart
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
You put the keys in the car and drive

For all that I know
It's gonna come back tenfold
For all that I know
It's gonna come back tenfold
But darling, oh no
I don't think
That we'll make it out alive
Darling, oh no
We won't make it out alive
Now I'm lost
With each passing day
So if you're coming, then come quick
Cause I'm scared I'm floating away
It's how we do it
For the first time, I don't need a reason to go, yeah
It's how we do it
We did it, we done it, let's do it some more

You put the keys in the car and drive
I'm gonna make sure the money is right
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
I'll find somebody who will stitch me up
Though I've never been better then when falling apart
I know we can do it if we do it all night
You put the keys in the car and drive
You put the keys in the car and drive

You put the keys in the car and drive!5Embed
