Barlights Lyrics
Never in all my life
Have I seen eyes as empty as
These streets of my city on a Saturday night
But the green of your eyes say go
Leave it all behind
But I don't need to be reminded a change is gonna come
I can feel it on the tip of your tongue
And I feel alive, feel alive
We met up once we settled the sun
Between the heat and the work week
The fear is we could use some sleep
But sleep to the superfluous man means better use for beds
And I'll bet I'm coming home alone tonight
I don't need to be reminded that this is how it was
I moved on, I passed a billboard down my block
It asked if I had enough, and aloud I'll say "I had too much"
When the truth is, I'm just getting started

Now all the barlights are blinking in time
To Mexican music it's taunting the pavement
And I feel alive, I feel alive
I feel alive
One of us sings and one of us drinks
And one of us does nothing at all
So they call us all sheep
Well I'm the Little Bo Peep of the bunch
And he swears he's gotta take this call
I'm scared he's gonna leave us too soon
We were the get-rich-quick kids, we never got it right
So we settled for the center of town
Where all the rich white kids is out looking for a fight
Got the blonde one staring me down
And I really wanna take a swing
I can't help but remember James Dean
See we are part of the few who agree
That hey, he lived life fast, but he died
He died, he died
Me, I'm gonna live forever

(I feel alive)
I think I'm gonna live forever
(I feel alive)
I know I'm gonna live forever

Now all the barlights are blinking in time
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement
And for the first time, in a long time
I feel alive
Now all the barlights are blinking in time
To Mexican music, it's taunting the pavement
And for the first time, in a long time
I feel alive
Now all the barlights
To Mexican music
Oh, I feel alive, I feel alive
And for the first time, in a long time
I feel alive, I feel alive6Embed
