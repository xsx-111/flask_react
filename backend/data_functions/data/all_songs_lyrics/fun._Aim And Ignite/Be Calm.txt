Be Calm Lyrics
As I walk through the streets of my new city;
My back feeling much better, I suppose, I
Reclaim the use of my imagination
For better or for worse I've yet to know
But I always knew you'd be the one to understand me
I guess that's why it took so long
To get things right
Suddenly I'm lost on my street; on my block
Oh, why; oh, why?
Oh, why haven't you been there for me?
Can't you see? I'm losing my mind this time
This time, I think it's for real, I can see
All the treetops turning red
The beggars near bodegas grin
And me, I think they want something
I close my eyes, I tell myself to breathe and...

Be calm, be calm
I know you feel like you are breaking down
Well, I know that it gets so hard sometimes
Be calm
I'm scared that everyone is out to get me
"These days before you speak to me you pause."
"I always see you looking out your window."
"After all, you lost your band, you left your mom."
Now every single crack, every penny that I pass
Says I should either leave or pick it up
Oh, with every single buck I've made
I'm saddled with bad luck that came
The moment I was baptized or
When I found out one day I'm gonna die
If only I could find my people or my place in life
And when they come a'caroling
So loud so bright, the theremin
Will lead us to a chorus where
We'll all rejoice and sing a song that goes...

Oh, be calm, be calm
I know you feel like you are breaking down
Oh, I know that it gets so hard sometimes
Be calm
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times
You hate your pulse because it thinks you're still alive
And everything's wrong
It just gets so hard sometimes
Be calm
I don't remember much that night
Just walking, thinking fondly of you
Thinking how the worst is yet to come
And from that street corner came a song
And I can't remember the man
The panhandler or his melody
The words exchanged had far exceeded
Any change I'd given thee

Oh, be calm, be calm
I know you feel like you are breaking down
I know that it gets so hard sometimes
Be calm
Take it from me, I've been there a thousand times
You hate your pulse because it still thinks you're alive
And everything's wrong
It just gets so hard sometimes
Be calm, be calm15Embed
