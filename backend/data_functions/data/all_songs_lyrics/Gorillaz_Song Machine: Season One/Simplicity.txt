Simplicity Lyrics
It's starting to pour
Why don't we get out in it and dance on the pavement? (Yeah)
Abandon your wars
The sky and thunder and lightning and rain are innocent
It's tipping down, I can't see
But I'm not really caring 'cause I'm dancing on the pavement
Oh, say, can you see?
The sky and thunder and lightning and heaven's open for us

Shut in, don't know, no, no, to be shut in
Don't know, not meant to be shut in
Don't know, camera, sicken, now come, you're alive, oh
It's taking me out (Simplicity)

Night time and I go smooth some off
(Little bit of news)
Negative, now it's red and I
Chime in strong
(Little bit of news)
Are you ever really lost?
You cutting cardboard
Watchers waiting, we had names
We had suspects, but a boxset caught your eye
And I was forgotten, I was forgotten
I am the architect of this delusion
The burgeoning load, one billion
These are amazing times
The past is a place where rockets take off
What now, a burnished plaque
Shut in, don't know, no, not to be shut in
Don't know, not meant to be shut in
Don't know, camera, sicken, now come, you're a loss

Simplicity
Wood pigeon, always you
(Save her, save her, save, ooh)
Ingloriously
(Save, save, saving me, oh)
I always hear you, mmm
(Me, oh)
Simplicity
(Save, save, ooh, oh)
Simplicity
(Ooh)
Simplicity
(The sky it could make it rain instead)
