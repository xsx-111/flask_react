Severed Head Lyrics
Severed head
Severed head
Severed head
Severed head

I've been losing everything, yeah
I can't keep a fucking thing, yeah
Do the money, do the fame
It seems like that controls this thing
Guess my head just left the building
Like out the window, missed the ceiling
I cannot explain this feeling
I never learned to speak a zillion
Now I'm stuck, my body left me bleedin' (Severed head)
Roll the train, it's passing fast, it's speeding outside
My body gone, don't need the soul, ey
Just take another breathe or so, ey
Found on my torso
I mean my neck go, but where did my heart go?
I mean my leg go, but where did my mind go?
I guess I only gotta go where the body goes
Geronimo (Stay a little longer)

Paradise has mountains that take a lifetime
To climb in dreams, I fly above them
I'm haunted by what I saw last night
On angelic highways, waiting in the darkness
I'm on a speeding train (Severed head)
I stick my head out of the carriage window (Severed head)
My cheeks inflate, my eyes become watery (Severed head)
Whoosh, my head is severed (Severed head)
Will you stay a little longer?
Condensation makes pathways down a window pane (Severed head)
I don't really wanna watch you drive away
What do you say?
Maybe you could stay for another day
Oh, baby, wait
What exactly did the doctor say?
I've been grinding teeth awake in bed
And my aching head, how could love suddenly be dead?
We could swallow bread, our hunger is not easily fed
I've been waiting for sleep to come
I've been breathing through these aching lungs
I keep waking up, this is worse than ever breaking up
If your time is up, how much more before mine is up?

Yeah, uh, the roundabout (Severed head)
The vibe is nice, we all will die
Yeah, I mean the roundabout (Severed head)
Our life is nice, we all gon' die, right?
Oh, the roundabout (Severed head)
The vibe is nice, we all will die, yeah
I mean the whole roundabout (Severed head)
My life is nice, we all gon' die, yeah
Severed head
