The Pink Phantom Lyrics
You've more or less forgotten me this summer
And I can’t hide my disappointment
I was on my way in the Phantom V
The one you gave away

I tried to tell you that I love you but I'm choked up
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one (Summer lines)
Were you ever really there? Did you ever really care?
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the
Good times we had, long summer nights (Summer lines)
Held you long time, put your name in my rhyme
Refresh your memory of where you wanna be
The phantom's on the way, she’s coming down the street

I tried to get to Atlanta
On a peach blossom highway
I tried to put these pauses out of mind
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world fell silent
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

Summer lines (Everyday, everyday)
Summer lines (Ride where the summer goes)
Summer lines
Every night
Summer lines
I tried to say I love you
But you didn't listen (Summer lines)
I tried to give you everything you might need (Summer lines)
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world is flawless
I'll be waiting for you on the other side

Of summer lines (Summer lines)
Holding me for a long time (Summer lines)
Seems to be I'm in a dream
Behind these summer lines

The phantom is coming
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one
She's crossing over the line
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
Seems to me, I'm in a dream (Long summer nights, held you long time)
(Put your name in my rhyme, refresh your memory)
Behind these summer lines (Of where you wanna be, the phantom's on the way)
(She’s comin’ down the street)
