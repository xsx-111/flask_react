The Lost Chord Lyrics
I see myself going through the streets
Think I must be dreaming
The lost chord
I want you toute ma vie (The lost chord)

(Take me into the garden)
I see rain's coming down
At this time of year, I'm always in need of
Of silent waves (Silent waves)
The pulse on your face

The lost chord
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord (The lost chord)
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder

Music on my mind
Break those chains, baby
I just wanna find myself, (Oh) (Take me into the gardеn)
I'm trying to find (Oh)
The lost chord
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go hardеr, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)

Pump me up heavy (Pump me heavy)
Move me somewhere I can see the sunlight
Take me into the garden
The silent waves (Silent waves)
The pulse on your face (Harder)

The lost chord (Allow me)
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord (The lost chord)
The lost chord
The lost chord
I go harder, harder (Take me into the garden)
The lost chord
Tryna find my way every single day
Tryna find my way
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
Break those chains that bind me, I wanna be free (I wanna be free)
Break those chains, baby
Break those chains that bind me, I wanna be free (Wanna be free)6Embed
