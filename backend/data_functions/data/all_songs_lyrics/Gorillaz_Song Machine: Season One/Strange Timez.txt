Strange Timez Lyrics
Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

I think I've fallen onto silken thread, my head is spinning
Suspended in a twilight web that keeps on giving
The looping dervish in the lodge is lost within the ringing
Far away, I can hear the sound of someone out there singing
I'm speeding through the forest, strange echoes of Belarus
Where presidents pin badges on disconnected youths
What will you be dreaming of? No horseplay, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders reclining
In the golden hallways where we spin, the faithful will be silent

Existing or not
At the same time
Spinning

Spinning around the world at night (Strange timez)
Spin in and out of sight
Spinning around until the sun comes up (I helped you feel good)
Strange time to turn it on
Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

Bottled water world, surgical glove world, beach washing world
I'm twitching in the grimy heat, I think I might be spinning
Unicorn degrading, no horseplay, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders-

Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to turn it on

Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the Sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

Strange time (Strange time) to be alive
Strange time (Strange time) to be alive7Embed
