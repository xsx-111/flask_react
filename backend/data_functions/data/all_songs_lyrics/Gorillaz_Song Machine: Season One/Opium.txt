Opium Lyrics

I've been cooped up for a minute
I've been inside working on me
Hyperbolic chamber I sit
I'm gon' dance my way out of this
Winter lasted for ages
Trouble don't last always
Brand new life, turn the page
Be alright, be okay

Grinding, loving, singing, hugging, living, get it, stack it
Run it, dancing, flying, people, wake up
Come on, keep on, dreaming, don't stop
Loving, trying, growing, don't stop
They gon' try to slow you, don't stop
Never, ever, know I, don't stop
London, Paris, L.A., don't stop

Atlanta, Jamaica, Rio, don't stop
New York, Lagos, Sydney, don't stop
You tried to kill me, created a monster
You tried to end me, but fate said "No, no"
Know why they envy, I got it, it's in me
Been so long since I had new faith
Been so long since I changed my ways
Been so long since I been okay
I met a lady on the side of the road
And her eyes were a story that had never been told
About a life that was lived on hope
And the truth of the inner light that we all hold
She said "Baby, I can hear my train coming
I'll leave with something before I go
Listen child, don't you ever waste time tryna dim nobody shine
Better water your own"
Will we wake up tomorrow?
I feel like we are closer together
Sing for colossal changes
And how we treat each other when we're living in a city of elevations
Is it man or woman feeling some balance today?

Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you (Shining on you)
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you

Grinding, loving, singing, hugging, living, get it, stack it
Run it, dancing, flying, people, wake up
Come on, keep on, dreaming, don't stop
Loving, trying, growing, don't stop
They gon' try to slow you, don't stop
Never, ever, know I, don't stop
London, Paris, L.A., don't stop

Been a long time since I been outside
Don't let it catch up with me
I contact just with me
Tapped in, wrapped up
Bring it in, let me in
Let me all over in between
Leave a toothbrush in your dreams
I ain't worried 'bout the next thing
I'll be with you to the extreme
Ice bounce off the glow of the moonlight
I hope we're still close when the sunrise
I paint the picture clear for ya
I can't hold this in much longer
Searching for this feeling my whole life
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you (Shining on you)
Hope
Hope the radiant light is shining on you
