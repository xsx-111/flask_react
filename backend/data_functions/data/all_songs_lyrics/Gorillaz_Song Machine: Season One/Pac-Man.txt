Pac-Man Lyrics
Alrighty
Prince Paul
Uh-ah

You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can boil my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man livin' in a levelled world
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

You can call me crack, you can call me mad and psycho
You can load my head, and send me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, no stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out, stressin' out

You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lime pit
You can boil my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

Stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out
Stressin' out, stressin' out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out
Don't stress it out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out
Stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out
Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tales?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke, nah
The joke's to try to find the answer to nope (Uh)
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark through my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

(I'm a mad Pac-Man) Suu
(Livin' in a levelled world)

Yo, I been at the top of the top, fell from the ceiling before, I fell
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, with the glow, uh
Walk on the edge, fuck trying to dream in the bed
‘Fore I die on these meds, nigga gon' die in the feds
‘Fore I make it to jail, I'll probably put one in the head
Fuck the judge and prosecutor for hanging me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I’m closer to live, right? Closer to live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the rear lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the black knight
Keep a peace like Buddas, got the whole hood boomin'
I’m like a Crip high student, you on your ass, stuck stupid
You makin' weed look bad, I'll ride the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cop's lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last, every food crumb in it
I had to change my image, the brain don't got limits
You think a mil’ mean winning, pigs out here skinning
His soul ain't authentic, you died and still ain’t livin'18Embed
