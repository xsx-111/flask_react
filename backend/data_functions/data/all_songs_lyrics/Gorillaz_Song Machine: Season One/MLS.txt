MLS Lyrics
Do you know what a beautiful creature
How happy you look?
Do you know what a lazy culture, gorilla?
ハエたちブーン (ちょっとくさい)
It's so fun
いいかんじ beautiful day (ちょっとくさい )
It’s so fun
いいかんじ beautiful day
スーパーゴリラ

How you gon' tell me how to do and how to do it? (Yeah)
Maneuver with this Ruger, these bullets is for the hoopers
You niggas is stupid, Peggy been broke for a long time (For real)
Only dirty niggas around me like my own kind (Grr)
I feel like Tom Jones, (Huh) I feel like Dev Hynes (Yeah)
I got a fresh Gat', I test the new iron
Hold me, chains on my neck like a slave
Fuck a will, better bury me with an O in my grave
(スーパーゴリラ)
I got too much to say, labels tried docking my pay
I’m like, "Ooh"
Compress me or check me, I'm Peggy Bae
Divine, feel like I'm blessed but I never pray
Twisting at my shows, niggas think I'm doing ballet, uh
I wish a nigga would claim that I'm a phase
I'm a wave, (Wave) sayin' that shit that you scared to say (Shit)
(It's nasty)
(Gorilla)
スーパーゴリラ

Clean house, clean bathwater, and clean mind
I’m such a positive nigga, throw up a peace sign
Get to the bridge, give ’em lead time
They be gunning for me (Gunning for me)
Put on a face for the critics 'cause they beneath me (Oh, oh, facts)
Never met an A&R that I wanted to be
(It’s so fun, いいかんじ beautiful day)
Begging for plus ones drink tickets and VIP
These niggas get fat blow money, and lose beefs (Super gorilla)
It's tragic, shake my head when I hit the ballot (Yeah)
Shake my head, niggas got more money than talent
Mmmm, niggas know I shoot above the average (Pssht)
Young Peggy keep whippin' wiggas till I kick the casket
(スーパーゴリラ)
They think I'm fixing matches, the scope came with attachments (Yee)
We at your house, we staking out, we eating rations
Expensive habits, it’s gas
I told that bitch to jump the ship, only room for the captain
(It's nasty)

スーパーゴリラ
It's so fun
いいかんじ beautiful day
スーパーゴリラ
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
スーパーゴリラ
Ooh
Thinkin' bout ooh
Thinkin' bout ooh
Thinkin' bout ooh, thinkin' bout ooh
Thinkin' bout ooh
