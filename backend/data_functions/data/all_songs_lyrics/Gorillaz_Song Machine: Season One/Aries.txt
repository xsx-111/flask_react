Aries Lyrics
Aries

I'm looking out at a volcano
Trying to read the world today
And see where you're at
I never do that
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me
But don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silent

I'm standing on a beach in the distance
And even though you're far away
Can you see my red light?
It's waiting to turn green
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own
So stay by my side
High or low tide

High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me
But don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silent

High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again27Embed
