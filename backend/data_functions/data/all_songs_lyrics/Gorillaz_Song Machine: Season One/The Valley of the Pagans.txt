The Valley of the Pagans Lyrics
Welcome to the land of the permanent sun
Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun
The freeway lizards are feeling so good
On a one-way trip back to West Hollywood, let's go

It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control
It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control

There was spotlights flying through the sky
From the winter wonderland, catching out
The bees hiding in the grounds, no future Batman
Long before Christmas, not very likely
One-hundred million Viagra tablets
Stored in a warehouse… in the valley

It feels so good to have a perfect song (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to have a perfect song (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (Uh-huh)
It's so convincing, but something's missing
The sun is kissing my face and erasing my doubts
I'm going out with a bang, and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Untainted dreams, et cetera and forever
I hope, said no one

She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a hemophiliac with a dying battery life
Candy-colored fingers and Schadenfreude eyes
Thinking airbrushed thoughts with the logo on her mind

It's so delightful, it's so insightful
It's so frightful, and I'm feeling it
Every single fucking day-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's time to party
It's time to party (Woo)

In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
In a valley made of mirrors, oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a Pagan, you can feel like a Pagan
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
In a valley made of mirrors, oh, the light is so bright
You can feel like a Pagan, you can feel like a Pagan
In the valley (Feel like a pagan)
Yeah, I live in the valley
In the valley (Feel like a pagan)
I heard there's a good shaman out in the desert
In the valley (Feel like a pagan)
Getting really transcendental and hiking
In the valley (Feel like a pagan, feel like a pagan)
In the valley
I'm on a cleanse (Feel like a pagan)
In the valley
Yeah, the hot tub is really chill
Feel like a pagan15Embed
