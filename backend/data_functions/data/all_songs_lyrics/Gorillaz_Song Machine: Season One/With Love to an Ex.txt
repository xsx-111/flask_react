With Love to an Ex Lyrics
Hahaha

Where I'm from, they said I live on a cloud
Simply 'cause I just dreamt too much
Black sheep but I am all blue now
It's the start but I've done blew up
I haven't done none, yeah, the travel's tough
Light white sands and the waves too far
They said, "No", I said, "That's too tough"
Went to Google, bombed their systems down

Ex-niggas blowing up my DM
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or a dinner
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
Ex-niggas blowing up my DM
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or a dinner
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya

Ndifun' iPounds, ndifun' iRounds, ndifun' imali
Ndifun' ibuz, ndifun' ibusy, ndifun' ifani
Ndifun' ichange, ndifun'ifun, ndifun' isexi
Ndifun' indoda, ndifun' umfazi, ndifun' ichanji
Ndifun' iPounds, ndifun' iRounds, ndifun' imali
Ndifun' ibuz, ndifun' ibusy, ndifun' ifani
Ndifun' ichange, ndifun'ifun, ndifun' isexi
Ndifun' indoda, ndifun' umfazi, ndifun' ichanji
Ex-niggas blowing up my DM
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or a dinner
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
Ex-niggas blowing up my DM
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or a dinner
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya

Exes be like, "You dream too much, you're out too much
You are too much, I want to munch
I love you but, you've got big butt"
All the boys want, want what I got
(Want what I got)
(Want what I got)

Ex niggas blowin' up my DM
Wanna meet for lunch, breakfast or a dinner
(Want what I've got)
Banesidina, asidiki, sesagqiba
Banehaba, andisoze ndabashiya
(Want what I've got)4Embed
