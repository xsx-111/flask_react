How Far? Lyrics
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Yeah, wah gwan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Like a chameleon, see you change in your color
Crabs in the barrel, wanna hate on each other
Saw my life gets better, whatever the weather
I dance in the rain and I bathe in summer

It's the black Corleone in a button-up shirt
Before we take off you better buckle up first
Fresher than the President, psychedelics got me in my element
All negativity, that's irrelevant
Amber Leaf or ganja leaf, I backstrap when I wrap the sheets
Now I feel to go for a drive, so I grab my keys
Shades on, roof down, tryna catch a breeze
Ride around the hood, got the devil in my ear
Can you smell that? Smells like jealousy in the air
Dunno who they're tryna scare
Looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that I fear
A zombie knows who to frighten
Just know I love the action, but I move in silence
And, right now I'm just takin' what's mine
Till Elizabeth returns the diamond
Wah gwan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Tryna be the boss of life, gets tougher
I hope you're ready for the truth that you're gonna discover
Always gonna be a Judas at the last supper
Stay woke, it's a rocky road on the come-up

Take the shots like Scorsese
More money, more problems and more ladies
Everyday somebody dies, still, mothers give birth to more babies
The Earth spins, the world gets more crazy
You gotta have a suit for the christening
A suit for the wedding and a suit for the court case
Probably wear the same suit to the funeral
Tryna see the bigger picture, man, it's bigger than the portrait
Bigger than me, no, you can't fight off your demons with vitamin C
Have to open your mind, use your vision and see
Keep your eyes on the prize so vigilantly
Love how you live, remember the world full of expensive shit
Can't forget the poor 'cause you're friends with the rich
Stay true to the bone, I ain't ever gonna switch
Yeah, yeah-yeah, wah gwan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Hm, who's that pressing on the buzzer?
Better check the camera, you don't wanna get stuck up
You listen close, you can hear death around the corner
One wrong move and we're all gonna suffer

Ahh, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, oya
È dì dé, è róo òri, è dì dé

How far, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover16Embed
