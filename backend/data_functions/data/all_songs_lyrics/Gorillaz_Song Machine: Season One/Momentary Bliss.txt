Momentary Bliss Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Momentary bliss

We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

Your potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (Ah, ah, ah)
"What was scripted, the day before it happened?"
We all give applause when people open doors
But on the way out it did your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But mining for metal gave you platinum
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

Poster boy (Ayy)
Poster girl (Rita)
In truth, the bills (The bills)
Must be paid (Yeah, yeah, alright)
Poster boy (Yeah, alright)
Poster girl (Ah, that's time)

In truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)
And what is left is sodden cake, typical
Oh, you need to change your face
You're getting sold, it's such a waste
Y'know, we could do so much better than this
Swimming in pools of momentary bliss
Where you gotta bite the bounty 'cause everybody taking it
Meanwhile, you keep on adding
How big you gonna grow?
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita
We could do so much better than this
Perfect little pictures of moments that we missed
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita48Embed
