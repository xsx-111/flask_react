Chalk Tablet Towers Lyrics
Chalk tablet towers, like drawing shadows
Chemical distractions, you are not with me
I departed in the spring, to a distant star
But I could not get back, I had gone too far (O-o-o-oh)

I wanna get drunk
I wanna get stoned
I wanna give up
I wanna go ho-o-o-ome

Watching rockets take off from a parting sea
How will I ever touch you if you are not with me? (O-o-o-oh, out here)
There's only silence (Out here), no form of contact (Out here)
I am dreaming, looking into the darkness (O-o-o-oh)

Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh) (O-o-o-oh)
I won't be back 'til the end of summer, will you still be therе?
I won't give up on you, darling, just tell me that you carе
I don't need no trophies, no cell with a view
There's nothing I wouldn't give one minute with you, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

(You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
(You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
(You, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)4Embed
