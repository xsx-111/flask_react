Friday 13th Lyrics
I been drinkin' and smokin' too much, that shit damages
Give me it all, I can do it myself, I can manage it
Two seconds, I gotta leave, and you know how it is
You and me, we can take on the world, we can be savages

I call my dealer, said, "Share the white with all of us" (Light)
I told him, "We been so nice, don't turn on us" (Don't turn on us)
Isn't it funny how the time flies by (Flies by) so fast?
If we do all of these lines, we go up

(Oh) And if I look into your eyes, and we can realize (Oh, I can realize)

Before I commence and just rhyme to this (Rhyme to this)
(Ayy, go hard as shit man)

It's definitely going down (Down)
Find a Pagan on the strip, spin him 'round (Spin him round)
Big man talking shit 'til we pin him down (Pin him down)
Big man talkin' shit 'til we lick him down (Until I lick him down)
Sure enough, I'ma spin you 'round
Put the big  in your belly then spin it 'round (Spin it 'round)
You can ask Crimbo if I've been about
Free him out (Free him out), I don't need to get the pictures out
I call my dealer, said, "Share the white with all of us"
I told him, "We been so nice, don't turn on us" (Don't turn on us)
Isn't it funny how the times flies by (Flies by) so fast?
If we do all of these lines (These lines), we go up

(Oh) And if I look into your eyes, and we can realize (Oh)

You know that we can be immortal, immortal
Are you loyal? Yeah (Oh, immortal)
I'm just praying that she loyal, is she loyal? Yeah
Recoil, yeah (Is she loyal)
I don't talk too much, man
Have they got mine?
Cryin' out finally, and a little mercy (Oh)
I don't talk too much, man
Came out silent
Came out silent
Came out silent
Came out silent

Oh, it's a beautiful day (Is she loyal?)
Oh, it's a beautiful day (Is she loyal? Is she loyal?)
Oh, it's a beautiful day (Immortal, immortal)
(Oh, it's a beautiful day) I don't talk too much, man
Have they got mine?
Cryin' out finally, and a little mercy
I don't talk too much, man
Came out silent (Immortal)8Embed
