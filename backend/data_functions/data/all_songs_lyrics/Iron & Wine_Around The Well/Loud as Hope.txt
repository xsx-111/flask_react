Loud as Hope Lyrics
Darling behave though your boy has gone or so we've heard
Ophelia would rise if it was her song and say these words
Summer comes with its colors on to take your breath away
Winter turns all the summer's love to gray

Darling behave though the barnyard won't say where he's gone
Ophelia would sing if the orchard let her, what went wrong?
Summer comes yelling loud as hope and takes your breath away
Winter takes what the summer had to sayEmbed
