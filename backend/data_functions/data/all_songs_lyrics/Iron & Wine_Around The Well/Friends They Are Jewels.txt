Friends They Are Jewels Lyrics
Dreamless sleep will fall
Like a deep, poisoned well
On the steeple birds
And this red-light hotel

So lay your pistol down, Granny
The company men never came to you
But don't unknit your brow, Granny
The mice in the yard ate the potted plants you grew

Pour your bitter tea
For our sweet, liquored host
Perfect polished stones
But this breeze beats you both

So lay your pistol down, Granny
The duty of men never fell to you
When you unknit your brow, Granny
Your friends, they are jewels, twice as beautiful and fewEmbed
