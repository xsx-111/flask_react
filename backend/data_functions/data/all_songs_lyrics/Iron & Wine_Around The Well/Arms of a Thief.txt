Arms of a Thief Lyrics
Mr. Henry and the muscle man
Gave her shoes on a night there was no room to stand
Like a letter in a stolen purse
She was bored of her weight, she was bored of her words
The daughter of a soldier told the fallen priest
It's a cold, cold place in the arms of a thief
And reachin' out to touch the steering wheel
She said leave me alone, but just don't leave me here, alright?

Alright, alright

Mr. Henry and another guy
Gave her gold on a night that it fell from the sky
And like a body when the buzzard came
She was bored of her look, she was bored of her name
The daughter of a lawyer told the fallen priest
It's a cold, cold place in the arms of a thief
And dabbin' at the arrow in her heel
She said leave me alone, but just don't leave me here, alright?

Alright, alright
Mr. Henry was a dyin' man
With advice in a tongue that she didn't understand
Like the water when the sea got rough
She was bored of the breeze, she was bored of her luck
The winner and the loser told the fallen priest
It's a cold, cold place in the arms of a thief
And holdin' everything he made her steal
She said leave me alone, but just don't leave me here, alright?

Alright, alrightEmbed
