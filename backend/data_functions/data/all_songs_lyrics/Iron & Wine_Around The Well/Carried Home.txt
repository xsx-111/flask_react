Carried Home Lyrics
The kettle burnt cause I left it too long
When we were kissin' with the radio on
The cat was chokin' on the rattlesnake bone
The town had gathered around the soldier boy

Carried home, carried home

The sick kids ate a bowl of red clay
And every summer there was imminent rain
The late judge teetered in a Jon boat
The town had gathered around the soldier boy

Carried home, carried home
Carried home

The broken window and the pretty blue sky
And cold water for my swollen black eye
We shook some money from your mother's old clothes
When all had gathered 'round the soldier boy

Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried home
Carried home, carried homeEmbed
