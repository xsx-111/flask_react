Such Great Heights Lyrics
I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned
And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death
When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay

I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine but the persistent beat it
Sounded thin upon listenin'
And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down
And this is guiding you home
They will see us waving from such great heights
"Come down now," they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
"Come down now," but we'll stay1Embed
