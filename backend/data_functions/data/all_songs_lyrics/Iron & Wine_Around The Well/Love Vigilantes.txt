Love Vigilantes Lyrics
Oh, I've just come from the land of the sun
From a war that must be won in the name of truth
With our soldiers so brave, your freedom we will save
With our rifles and grenades and some help from God

I want to see my family
My wife and child waitin' for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

You just can't believe the joy I did receive
When I finally got my leave and I was goin' home
Oh, I flew through the sky and my convictions could not lie
For my country I would die and I will see it soon

I want to see my family
My wife and child waitin' for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see

When I walked through the door, my wife she laid upon the floor
And with tears her eyes did soar, I did not know why
Then I looked into her hand and I saw the telegram
Said that I was a brave, brave man but that I was dead
I want to see my family
My wife and child waitin' for me
I've got to go home
I've been so alone, you see5Embed
