No Moon Lyrics
Black dog bit through the keeper's chain
Small and angry when the devil came
Sold my soul like a pocket knife
There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet

Tomcat curled on a rabbit cage
Brittle fingers in the potter's clay
Sold my soul and I laid her down
There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweet

Blue bird laughs on a fallen tree
Sunset burns on a quiet sea
Sold my soul and they ran me down
There was no moon, there'll be no milk as sweetEmbed
