Sinning Hands Lyrics
Midnight and her eyes hide like kittens, new and wet
Mine are sinning hands on her lying on my bed
The river still may rise wild and water take us both
Mine are sinning hands, take our bodies, take our clothes

Bloodless moonlight
May my lady
Give her lovely
Skin and bones

Midnight and my bride treads in distant water now
Mine are sinning hands and my teeth have fallen out
The river still may rise though it took more than it gave
Mine are sinning hands on a broken window pane

Bloodless moonlight
Like my lady
Gave me only
Skin and bonesEmbed
