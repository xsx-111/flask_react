Serpent Charmer Lyrics
There's a woman hater with a broken record player
And a dusty compass off to map the country's new behavior
Strange words and we all roll back into the river
Brave boys in the empty coats of men

There's a kitchen timer, distractions and reminders
That the roly poly's slowly crawling 'cross your family china
Strange words and we all roll back into the river
And dead dogs only want to live again

There's a serpent charmer, pair of shoes and wander
Speeding ticket you got leadin' that last lamb to slaughter
Strange words and we all roll back into the river
Good girls come and kick you in the shin

There's a hopeful hunter with a hapless sense of wonder
And a million claw marks on the rock he hid his money under
Strange words and we all roll back into the river
And made men only want to live againEmbed
