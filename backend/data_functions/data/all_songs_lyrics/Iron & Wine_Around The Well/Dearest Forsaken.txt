Dearest Forsaken Lyrics
To my dearest forsaken. who the earth now has taken
Empty, the bottle drains no more
It is true that I loved you, despite the harm now on you
Wash us, the river has you, boy

Here on the eve of too long, where you'll think I've done wrong
Wakin' in fear of you no more
I put my trust in the savior, fumin' forces of nature
Strength of the stump I tied you, boy

To my dearest forsaken, dearest vow I have broken
Afraid of your angry hands no more
Put my trust in the savior, river may have me later
Sleep with my lost love for you, boyEmbed
