God Made the Automobile Lyrics
God made the automobile
To pass all the pretty girls
That smoke by the side of the road
Their blues loving boys in tow
To drive until the end of the day
And bow to a borrowed flag
Beside all the brave and the blind
And men without men in mind

To pass all the things he made
But then never bothered to name
And no one will tell the truth
And no one will hide it from you
Like birds around the grave

God made the automobile
And I made a little boy
To pass all the blissfully young
The snake with a forked tongue
That preys on the wanting for time
And makes in the sleepless waves
The fear of the Black and the Jew
And blood for the camera crew
Passes the things he made
But then never bothers to name
And no one can tell the truth
And no one can hide it from you
Like birds around the grave1Embed
