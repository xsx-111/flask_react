Low Feels Blvd LyricsLonely in a room of memories
From another life
Waiting and chasing
Moments that elude
Why can't I escape
Waiting and chasing
Memories of moments that are gone
When first she looked at me
And sipped her drink across from me
Newborn hell was it all along
Right there with me, inside
Reflecting on the outside
If it won't die can I
Some days I look at things
As if they never existed
And others it's all right here
I've been thinking aloud
About the way it went
I guess we're having a moment right now
I need a moment right now
I guess we're having a moment right now
I need a moment right...
Best of them all
Best of them all
Best of them all
Best of them all
Waiting and chasing
Memories long gone
Best of them all
Lately I'm thinking
Were they all along
Best of them all
What then
Becomes of
Letters never sent
In stillness you can hear us
Never far awayEmbed
