Dissociation LyricsBy the last time in the car
Then I already knew
At the time I laughed
I didn't know what to believe
Couldn't stay for you
What a strange way to lose
Take you
I couldn't take you
Don't confuse being set free
With being discarded and lonely
I tried to tell you we never change
I let you go
And when I left
I really tried to tell myself
It was for me and not
It was for me and not you
Couldn't stay for you
What a strange way to lose
Finding a way to die alone
Is better than what I was shown
Finding a way to die alone
Is better than what I was shown
Couldn't stay for you
What a strange way to lose
(Finding a way to die alone)
Couldn't stay for you
(Is better than what I was shown)
What a strange way to lose
Finding a way to die alone
Finding a way to die alone
Finding a way to die alone
Finding a way to die alone
Finding a way to die alone
Finding a way to die alone3Embed
