Surrogate LyricsAny thought of moving on
Is a loop without an end
Back to
The beginning
Reliving this over and over and over and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
No comfort in absolutes
No places without time
I am the beginning
And I'm
Reliving this over and over and over and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
Reliving this over and over and over and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
Now
A monumental waste
I refuse to be a crutch for your disease
I refuse to carry on your tragedy
I refuse
All your secrets
Never shared
Programmed into me
Well I'm afraid of how this ends
I never thought such things before
Ignorance is indeed bliss
And knowledge isn't just power it's torture
I see you trying to get to me
But I'm alone even in the most crowded room
Screaming inside like an animal inside
Confused and scared
Trying to survive this place
Over and over and over
Trying to survive this place
Over and over
Trying to survive this place
Oh, over and over and over
Trying to survive this place
Over and overEmbed
