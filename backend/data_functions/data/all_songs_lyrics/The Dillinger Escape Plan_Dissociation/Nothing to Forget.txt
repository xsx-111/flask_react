Nothing to Forget LyricsInnocent angel watching over me
Covering up in a crown of thorns so I could not see
Guilty by birth, a choice that wasn't mine
Seeding me deep with a terror growing over time
Covering up so I could not see
Covering up so I could not see
Covering up so I could not see
Your fingers choking me
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anyone else
Anything just to gain the years I lost
Driven by instinct resolute and I'm the cost
I don't remember existing at all
Only in moments as I struggle not to fall
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anyone else
In darkened rooms
As I try to look for you
I feel out forgotten days
With nothing to light the way
With all your fear
As a fuel to get me here
I climbed out of others' graves
And swam through a tidal wave
In darkened rooms
When I stop looking for you
I'll illuminate the days
And make sure to light the way
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anyone else
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anything
Please let me be by myself, I don't need anyone elseEmbed
