Symptom of Terminal Illness LyricsTo those of you I loved
This pains me to lose
I hate to feel used
I'm frightened in sleep, thinking my world will be gone
Promise me I won't die
I panic in dreams from when I was still young
Please don't turn on that light
I can't see it
To those of you I've lost
That pained me to love
Please know that I tried
Please know that I tried
I'm frightened in sleep, thinking my world will be gone
Promise me I won't die
I panic in dreams from when I was still young
Please don't turn on that light
(please don't turn on that light)
I can't see it
Do you really think
That I would leave you
But I couldn't stand myself
So I had to choose
Still you turn me on, the wild in your eyes
But now I can't trust myself
To keep on the light
For us to see with
I'm frightened in sleep, thinking our world will be gone
Promise me I won't die
I panic in dreams from when I was still young
Please don't turn on that light
I'm frightened in sleep, thinking our world will be gone
Promise me I won't die
I panic in dreams from when I was still young
Please don't turn on that...Embed
