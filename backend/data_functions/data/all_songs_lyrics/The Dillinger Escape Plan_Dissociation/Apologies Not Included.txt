Apologies Not Included LyricsI'm finding nothing
No point, just energy to burn
A pocketful of pointless and faded days
What have you done?
This never-ending heart attack
Is spilling over self-murderous assault
Late hours turn to blur
A boiling inner temperature
Late hours turn to blur
A boiling inner temperature
This never-ending murderous assault
Late hours turn to blur
Crowned waves, torrid sea
Washing years over me
Myself into a knot
In sudden overdose
Myself into a knot
In sudden overdose
Someone is moving
But who is staying still?
Or have we grown apart?
How selfish of you not to find
You didn't look for peace to gain
From being alive
Fucked if I care
It doesn't matter
Ignore
The more things stay the same
Fuck I don't care
The more things never change
I'm not sorry for you
Fucked if I care
It doesn't matter
Ignore
I'm not sorry
You didn't look, but
I'm finding nothing
No point, just energy to burn
A pocketful of pointless and faded days
Make yourself present
Are you hiding?
Do you feel guilt?
Cause mine's dying
Worked through your waste
Now there's nothing
But maybe there's
Still hopeEmbed
