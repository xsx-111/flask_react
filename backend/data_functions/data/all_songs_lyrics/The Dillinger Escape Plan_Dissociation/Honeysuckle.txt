Honeysuckle LyricsI'm lying here wondering am I dying inside?
Am I diseased?
I'm feeling pretty weak
My lungs are full of fluid
Will they continue to fill?
Is this nearly the end?
I used to be so pissed off
Then I forgot
Then I erased
Then I just fucking erased you
Not for nothing
I was born so happy but now it just takes so much to keep me alive
I was born so happy but now it just takes so much to keep me alive
I thought I'd be better without you, the past is always poison to me
Tried to forget
Tried to erase
You!
From the rain that never falls
From the wind that blows away from me
From the waves on other shores
From the taste of air surrounding me
Help
I'm stuck at the corner
Of how long
I'm stuck at the corner
Of how long
So hard to be awake
Like hell to fall asleep
Tried to forget
Tried to forget
So hard to be awake
Like hell to fall asleep
Let me erase
Let me erase
A time and place
I can't forget
I can't forget
Your face
I can't erase
I can't erase
I can't erase
I can't erase
Claw away at the wound inside
Rip into my flesh to find a light
It's suffocating in here
And it's only me
Come a little bit closer pleaseEmbed
