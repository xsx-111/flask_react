Wanting Not So Much to As To LyricsIn a lifeless memory
You're not there
A craving in the street
I'm alive and getting an urge to fill the void
With whatever I need, yeah
With whatever I need
With whatever I need
I
Withdraw
You advance
The move is complete
Are you able to see?
Cause it's getting too bright for me
Over time we'll dissolve
To a feeling we won't recall
Bring all your heroes
Down to their knees
I don't need nothing
I do as I please
Destiny
Overruled
Through distance
I'm losing
Creation
Of your mind
Through distance
I'm losing
Through distance
I'm losing
All night I've been trying to reach out
How people naturally do, when they're young
An attempt to live
To feel weightless and free
In the abyss
(In the abyss, in the abyss...)
For a time
I felt completely alive
Still without legs
We all just sink
In the past
I would have tried harder
But now, I know there isn't anything there
And what you, I, we were reaching for...
Is something I had, in me, all along
For a time
I felt completely alive
Still without legs
We all just sink
We see most clear
From lowest points
We see most clear
From lowest points
We see most clear
From lowest points
We see most clear
From lowest points
Through distance we're losing
Hope for our dignity
Bring all your heroes
Down to their knees
I don't need nothing
Do as I please
(Bring all your heroes
Down to their knees...)Embed
