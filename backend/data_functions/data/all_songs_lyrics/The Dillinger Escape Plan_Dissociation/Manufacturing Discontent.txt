Manufacturing Discontent LyricsDiscarded a broken escape
Fortunate to be in this state
Firing on a boredom innate
Chewing on a ticking grenade
Listening to the comforting shade
Instinctive
I'm supporting a string of destructive habits
And fighting more than I care to admit
Crumbling from
A sudden dead
Weight
Here
Lies
Me
Now what's the meaning?
Here
Lies
Me
Now what's the meaning?
Oh won't you tell
Me
Now won't you tell me the point?
I was trying to find myself
I wasn't looking for you
But you gave me the point
I was trying to kill myself
What else was I
What else was I gonna do?
I had a pretty good time
I had a pretty good time!
A long goodbye
Ascension to demise
A vow to break
A lesson for the wise
I was put here to survive
Why is your burden mine?
Holding space for this
There's a place we must have missed
And they're open real late
And I believe that we should go
As a consolation
But directions are unknown...
Tonight would be the perfect time
For us to reach the peak
It takes a lot to try to care
The truth's below the surface
Beneath the deep
When you live on the thinnest air
And even condescension comes with a fee
Slow to care
Slow to care
Now you tell me the point
I was trying to find myself
I wasn't looking for you
Looking for you
Looking
But you gave me the point
I was trying to kill myself
What else was I gonna do, gonna do
I had a pretty good timeEmbed
