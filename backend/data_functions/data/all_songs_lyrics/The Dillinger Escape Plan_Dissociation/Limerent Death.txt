Limerent Death LyricsI'm amazed at how you reinforce your guard
Cause deep inside, you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you, a lie to persecute you
So thoroughly, it's giving you fits
It's giving you fits!
In your world, make believe
No one knows you
Hold your breath
Count to ten
Staring through a vacant
Glass
That nothing can hope to ever fill
When movement ceases, and
Everything is still
I thought that time was frozen
Instead my resting state
I thought we'd be forever
What was I to say?
Oh! You were never alone
You just didn't know
Where to fucking go
But who will hear you fall
If no one's there at all?
Do you (Are you a-okay?)
Feel fine? (Do you wake up smiling?)
Do you (Do you feel alright?)
Feel fine? (Are you always shining?)
Do you
Feel fine?
Do you
Feel fine?
Do you wake up smiling?
I'm amazed at how you reinforce your guard cause
Deep inside, you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you
A lie to persecute you
So thoroughly, it's giving you fits, it's giving you fits
Giving you fits
Giving you
Fits
Giving you fits giving you fits giving you fits giving you fits
I gave you everything you wanted
You were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted
And you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted you were everything to me
I gave you ...
In your world, make believe
In your world, no one knows you!2Embed
