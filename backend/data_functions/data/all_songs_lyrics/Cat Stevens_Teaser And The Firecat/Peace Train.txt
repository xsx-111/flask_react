Peace Train Lyrics
Now I've been happy lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, I've been smilin' lately
Dreamin' about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Some day it's going to come

Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again

Now, I've been smiling lately
Thinkin' about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Get your bags together
Go bring your good friends, too
Because it's gettin' nearer
It soon will be with you

Now, come and join the livin'
It's not so far from you
And it's gettin' nearer
Soon it will all be true

Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Peace train

Now, I've been cryin' lately
Thinkin' about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating?
Why can't we live in bliss?

Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides a peace train
Oh, peace train take this country
Come take me home again
Oh, peace train soundin' louder
Glide on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Yes, peace train holy roller
Everyone jump on the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah

Come on, come on, come on
Yeah, come on, peace train
Yes, it's the peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah
Come on, now peace train
Peace train
Ooh, ah, ee, ah, ooh, ah5Embed
