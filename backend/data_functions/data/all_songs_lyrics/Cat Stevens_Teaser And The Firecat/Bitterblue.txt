Bitterblue LyricsI gave my last chance to you
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue
No bitterblue
Yes, I've done all one man can do
Don't pass me up oh bitterblue
My bitterblue
Yes, I've been running a long time
On this travelling ground
Wishing hard to be free
Of going round and round
Yeah, yes I've been moving a long time
But only up and down
I gave my last hope to you
Don't hand it back to me bitterblue
My bitterblue
I've done all one man can do
Please help me lose this bitterblue
My bitterblue
'Cause I've been waiting a long time
Aeons been and gone
Looking at the horizon
For my light to dawn
Oh yes I've been living a long time
Looking on and on
I've been running a long time
Summers come and gone
Oh, drifting under the dream clouds
Past the broken sun
Oh yes I've been living a long time
To be back beyond
I gave my last hope to you
Don't hand it back bitterblue
Oh, my bitterblue
I've done all one man can do
Don't pass me up oh, bitterblue
My bitterblue, oh my bitterblue
Yeah, my bitterblue, oh my bitterblue
Oh bitterblue, yeah
I gave my last chance to you
Don't hand it back to me bitterblueEmbed
