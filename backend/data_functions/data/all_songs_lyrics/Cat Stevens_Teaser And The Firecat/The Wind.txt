The Wind LyricsI listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul
Where I’ll end up, well, I think only God really knows
I’ve sat upon the settin' sun
But never, never, never, never
I never wanted water once
No, never, never, never
I listen to my words, but they fall far below
I let my music take me where my heart wants to go
I've swam upon the devil’s lake
But never, never, never, never
I’ll never make the same mistake
No, never, never, never5Embed
