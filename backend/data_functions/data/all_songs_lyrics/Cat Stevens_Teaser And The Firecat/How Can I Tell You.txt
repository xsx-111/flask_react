How Can I Tell You Lyrics
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

How can I tell you that I love you
I love you, but I can’t think of right words to say
And I long to tell you that I’m always thinking of you
I’m always thinking of you, but my words just blow away
Just blow away

It always ends up to one thing, honey
And I can’t think of right words to say
Oh oh oh oh

Wherever I am, girl, I’m always walking with you
I’m always walking with you, but I look and you’re not there
And whoever I’m with, I’m always, always talking to you
I’m always talking to you, and I’m sad that you can’t hear
Sad that you can’t hear

It always ends up to one thing, honey
When I look and you’re not there
I need to know you, need to feel my arms around you
Feel my arms around you like a sea around a shore
Each night and day, I pray in hope that I might find you
In hope that I might find you, because heart’s can do no more

It always ends up to one thing honey
Still I kneel upon the floor

How can I tell you that I love you
I love you, but I can’t think of right words to say
I long to tell you that I’m always thinking of you
I’m always thinking of you

It always ends up to one thing honey
And I can’t think of right words to say
Oh oh oh oh oh oh2Embed
