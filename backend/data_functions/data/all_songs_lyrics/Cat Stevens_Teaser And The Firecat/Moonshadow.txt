Moonshadow Lyrics
Yes I'm bein' followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hoppin' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

And if I ever lose my hands
Lose my plow, lose my land
Oh if I ever lose my hands
Oh i...if, I won't have to work no more

And if I ever lose my eyes
If my colors all run dry
Yes if I ever lose my eyes
Oh i...if, I won't have to cry no more

Yes I am bein' followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hoppin' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

And if I ever lose my legs
I won't moan, and I won't beg
Oh if I ever lose my legs
Oh i...if, I won't have to walk no more
And if I ever lose my mouth
All my teeth, north and south
Yes if I ever lose my mouth
Oh i...if, I won't have to talk...

Did it take long to find me?
I asked the faithful light
Oh did it take long to find me
And are you gonna stay the night?

I'm bein' followed by a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow
Leapin' and hoppin' on a moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow

Moonshadow, moonshadow
Moonshadow, moonshadow2Embed
