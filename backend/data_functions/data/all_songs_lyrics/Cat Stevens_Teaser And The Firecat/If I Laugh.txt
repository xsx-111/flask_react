If I Laugh LyricsIf I laugh just a little bit
Maybe I can forget the chance
That I didn’t have to know you
And live in peace, in peace
If I laugh just a little bit
Maybe I can forget the plans that
I didn’t use to get you
At home with me alone
If I laugh just a little bit
Maybe I can recall the way
That I used to be, before you
And sleep at night and dream
If I laugh, baby if I laugh
Just a little bitEmbed
