Colours Fly And Catherine Wheel Lyrics"Belle"
Never turn your back
Great times attack
Inexpensive thrills
And I said Belle
Of all the friends who care
Some should be seen
But never heard
Colours Fly and Catherine Wheels
Poor girls cry
In the beauty of both worlds
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Fall in love Fell Falling
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Fall in love Fell Falling
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Out of the Sky
"Belle"
When the pulses rise
Love will tranquilize
Just before it kills
And I said Belle
You turn them on
With your reflection
I know so well
Colours Fly and Catherine Wheels
Poor girls cry
In the beauty of both worlds
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Fall in love Fell Falling
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Fall in love Fell Falling
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Out of the Sky
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Fall in love Fell Falling
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Fall in love Fell Falling
Catch a boy Fell Falling
Out of the Sky
Out of the Sky
Colours Fly and Catherine Wheels
Some girl cry
Over her boyfriend
When Colours Fly and Catherine Wheels
So when the colours fly
And when the catherine wheelsEmbed
