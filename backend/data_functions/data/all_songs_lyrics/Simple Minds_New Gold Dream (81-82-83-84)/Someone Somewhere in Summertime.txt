Someone Somewhere in Summertime LyricsStay, I'm burning slow
With me in the rain, walking in the soft rain
Calling out my name
See me burning slow
Brilliant days, wake up on Brilliant days
Shadows of brilliant ways will change all the time
Memories, burning gold memories
Cold of day memories change me in these times
Somewhere there is some place, that one million eyes can't see
And somewhere there is someone, who can see what I can see
Someone; Somewhere In Summertime
Someone; Somewhere In Summertime
Someone; Somewhere In Summertime
Moments burn, slow burning golden nights
Once more see city lights, holding candles to the flame
Brilliant days, wake up on brilliant days
Shadows of brilliant ways will change me all the timeEmbed
