Promised You a Miracle LyricsPromised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering
Chance as love takes a train
Summer breeze and brilliant light
Only love she sees, he controls on love
Love sails to a new life
Promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering
Only love she sees, he controls on love
Life mirrors a cure, everything is possible
With promises, everything is possible
No
I promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering
Chance reflects on them a while
Love screams so quietly
Slipping back on golden times
Breathing with sweet memories
Promised you a miracle
Belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering
Only love she sees, he controls on love
Life mirrors a cure, everything is possible
In the game of life, everything is possible
No
Chance lost pearls of great price
Take care of family
Only aches for love, love waits for fame
In chance, in chance they'll see
I promised you a miracle
Oh, belief is a beauty thing
Promises, promises
As golden days break wondering
Only love she sees, he controls on love
Life throws a cure, everything is possible
In the game of life, a burning dream
You can be Queen, everything is possible2Embed
