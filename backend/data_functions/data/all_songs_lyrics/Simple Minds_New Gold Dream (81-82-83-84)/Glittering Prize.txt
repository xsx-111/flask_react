Glittering Prize LyricsShine on, shine the light on me
In all of my life, so that much more I see
In the light of his love, in the light of reflection
One in all of this world, sometimes, oh, so it seems
Eyes to the sky in the silver gift friendship
A glittering prize is the price of lost love
They can remember quiet side of midnight
They can remember attraction of fame
Like a glittering prize, I saw you up on a clear day
First taking heart, then a last breath away
Always came a time, time was by your side
We were spending time, we were staring out
Catch me in a dream, captured all in heart
We were spending time, we were staring out
Could there ever be ever more than one
Called an act of love, can you you never stop?
Shine on, shine the light on me
In all of my life, so that much more I see
Like a glittering prize, I saw you up on a clear day
First taking heart, then a last breath away
Only on a clear day
Coming into our lives
Only on a clear day
Coming into our lives
We can remember quiet side of midnight
We can remember attraction of fame
Like a glittering prize, I saw you up on a clear day
First taking heart, then a last breath away
See it in the eyes, satellite skies
We were spending time, we were staring out
Take in, take in more, endless breath away
We were staring out, now we're staring in
Could there ever be ever more than one
Called an act of love, can you you never stop?
Shine on, shine the light on me
In all of my life, so that much more I see
Like a glittering prize, I saw you up on a clear day
First taking heart, then a last breath away
Only on a clear day
Coming into our lives
Always on a clear day
Is it the price of love?
Like a glittering prize
Always on a clear day
Crashing into our lives
Is it the price of love?
Like a glittering prize
Only on a clear day
Crashing into our lives
Like a glittering prize
Is it the price of love?Embed
