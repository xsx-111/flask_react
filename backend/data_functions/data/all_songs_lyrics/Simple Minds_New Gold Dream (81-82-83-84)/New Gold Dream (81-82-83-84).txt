New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84) LyricsNew gold dream
She's the one in front of me, siren and the ecstasy
New gold dream
Crashing beats and fantasy, setting sun in front of me
New Gold Dream
And the world goes hot
And the city takes
And the beat goes crashing
All along the way
She is your friend
Until the ocean breaks
She is your friend
Until the ocean breaks
And when you dream
Dream in the dream with me
And when you dream
Dream in the dream with me
81 - 82 - 83 - 84
81 - 82 - 83 - 84
New Gold Dream
Sun is set in front of me, worldwide on the widest screen
Dream in the dream with
And the world goes hot
And the city takes
And the beat goes crashing
All along the way
She is your friend
Until the ocean breaks
And when you dream
Dream in the dream with me
And when we dream
Dream in the lithest dream
81 - 82 - 83 - 84
81 - 82 - 83 - 84
New gold dream
Siren and the ecstasy, she's the one in front of me
New gold dream
Burning bridge in ecstasy, worldwide on the widest screen
A new gold dream
Dream in the dream with me
She is your friend
In the new gold dream
New gold dream
Until the ocean breaks
The new gold dream
She is your friend
Until the world goes hot
And the city breaks
And the beat goes crashing
Until the ocean breaks
New gold dream
Like a new gold dream
Until the world goes hot
Until the world goes higher
A new gold dreamEmbed
