Vicarious Atonement Lyrics
Don't you pretend
That I'm not alive
My bones never ache
Unless she's nearby
Where is your face?
In a safe of dead tongues
I can see your reflection
In your totem first born
I suspect (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You've been carrying a pack of wolves (A pack of wolves, oh, oh, oh)
I regret  (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Not killing you while I had the chance (I know I had the chance, I know I had, no, no, no)

Maybe I will always haunt you
Mark the somnolence with truth
Better hang your dead palace
Than have a living home to lose
In the River Ganges, God damns my name

Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)1Embed
