Meccamputechture Lyrics
Amputechture came
Philistine praise
Bottomless pit of empty names
Incarcerated habits poured from the palms
Severing the breast
Nursing all the young

Beneath those locks
Of dirty red hair
A necklace of follicles with saber tooth monocles
They want a bouquet of black rose gems
Castrating kisses stalactite stems
They went and built a capsule in the cyanide pond
Where the holiest of water would have you to drown
Tomorrow we forget
Cause now has never left
You gotta find my body
In the mechacontext
You give me a corpse
You live in it now
You stir it from a camp nourishment plows
You give me a corpse
You live in it now
You stir it from a camp nourishment plows
Please dismantle all these phantom limbs
It's the evidence of humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments

Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury me

This dirt is turning Christ to make repent again
So I've heard they're cutting all the youngest ones
Said this dirt is turning Christ to make repent his lust
So I've heard that the puppet tugs its pull

Please dismantle all these phantom limbs
It's the evidence of humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury me

Nova meat
The prude slit whispers of bovine heaps
Strapped to unearth of mantis flowers
Prune fingers who tug in a zealot's shroud
I will scald supreme truth
As it touches this house
I will scald supreme truth

Please dismantle all these phantom limbs
It's the evidence of humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments

Scald supreme truth as it touches this house
Scald supreme truth as it touches this house
Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury-
Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury-

It lacks a human pulse
It lacks a human pulse
It lacks a human pulse
It lacks a human pulse
It lacks a human pulse
It lacks a human pulse (Don't know for sure now...)
It lacks a human pulse (Don't know for sure now...)
It lacks a human pulse1Embed
