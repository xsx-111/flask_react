Tetragrammaton Lyrics
Tell me it's over, Rusbel awaits
I've been to the surface and nothing is there
Eyelids sank muffled in the nerve aura sound
But when she awakes, will she still be with us?
My heart is darkclots, leap year is late
How did you get here? Ask all but the bait
From a Christ that went hissing, constricting his cells
We summon by candle, by book and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence

The sermon goes mourning pricking its hail
Slothful the child that preys on the seed
Shall behead the drought, wound under sleeves
I hope you have room in a thicket of vines
Give me a moment to claim what you've stole
The streets will hang high stretched ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate
Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Then so long, dear mnemonic
Assume the form you've given me and I'll spill
Now hold on, just hold my hand
Say that they made you, but you brought your own leash
Tell me no more, no
Tell me no more, no

Outside by the drift
You read my will of thread and itch
Failure to comply as failure to decease
And still you won't know everything
I've built the fall

The sulking drained the fall of my pale will swarming by your steps
Licking the ankles of your blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where the flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe is shaped like Rosalynn Carter
She says my map is home again but torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes to tell you all about

In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

Gas me the hind of your five legged snare
Tooth picks the eye, but nothing's there
Down drags your waltz 'cross the altar top
From a sleep that deprivation knew
Trespass your form, I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look, but the mask stays on
You'll levitate teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath of my instrument

In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

You locked the cuffs, arsenic erupts
Will you drink the shadow of my red hair?
You and your false witness to God
You've one in the chamber, but your finger got stuck
Let slip the sound of a cry for help
But all was lost on the night you walked
Palms speak through eyes, serve your memory lost
I contaminate with insignias
In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Wait 'til I get my hands on you
I won't forget a face that lift me
Just you wait 'til I get my hands on you
I can't, oh, oh, oh
You won't remember

Unwrap my corpse and let it thaw
In the eye of the needle I can't get out
They'll check my wrist, I'll faint a pulse
I'm not the human you thought I was
If you pet the night, sixth pentacle dice
If you roll the seven, St. Michael dies
They'll be no ransom, don't shut my mouth
I scald the answer you're afraid of3Embed
