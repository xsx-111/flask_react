TV Do Tell LyricsIt's a goldmine
TV do tell
Eucalyptus
Mineral drip
It's a goldmine
TV do tell
Eucalyptus
Mineral drip
I like to watch all the packages
Seals and contents, incognizant guise
Colors read and yellow woolen fibers
Between the mellow cypress
It's a goldmine
TV do tell
Eucalyptus
Mineral drip
It's a goldmine
TV do tell
Eucalyptus
Mineral drip
Do you know what I can see
With my own, crystal eye?
It is so practical
Blood red and so factualEmbed
