Can I Get the Real Stuff Lyrics
Molten liquid metal
Glimmering, glitter a
Pigment she'd been teasing
Pang became craving, oh

Can I get? 

Removing the layers
Caked on the surface
An Icon from the modern
Once futuristic, oh

Can I get? 

Personal persona
Can I get the real stuff?
Swimming in the make up
Creature became dreamer

Streak above the eyelid
Sparkled like pastry
She wants the metallics
Tin man like shiny, oh
Can I get 

Personal persona
Can I get the real stuff?
Swimming in the makeup
Creature became dreamer
Can I get the real stuff?
Personal persona
Swimming in the makeup
Creature became dreamerEmbed
