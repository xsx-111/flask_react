Crystal Run LyricsChange the frequency
Move freely
Shift the tone of it
Breathe easy
Raven trained to speak
Never spoke
Coming from the womb
Of cosmos
Shifting
Scaly terrain
The moon suprised
Whirring the hidden
Tripping purpose
Change the frequency
Move freely
Shift the tone of it
Breathe easy
How when
Where and why
Did you visit?
Not an easy trip
From that distance
Jetting forward
Stay in one place
Planet Hunger
Star of the chase
Change the frequency
Move freely
Shift the tone of it
Breathe easy
Raven trained to speak
Never spoke
Coming from the womb
Of cosmos
Shade of black turns to blue
In a new light
Blurring the belief
Like deja vu
Then sinking fingers
Into white rock
Only to withdraw
In a great shock
A secret solvent
Was under the veil
Layer of milk
Not icy shale
And from the crevice
Out flew a lark
Pouring out white
To cover the darkEmbed
