Dog in the Mirror LyricsYou call it "checking out"
But I am checking in me
Right, said it was wrong
To review it religiously
Go backwards into the
Thick layered shading of blue
You call it "checking out"
But I am checking in me
Pawing at the picture
Puzzled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see
Pawing at the picture
Puzzled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see
You see
The dog
You see
In it
You see
Ask not what to the dog
Doesn't think out what he sees
But what to the vision thatâ€™s
Reflecting backward, could be
Pawing at the picture
Puzzled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see
Pawing at the picture
Puzzled by the circle
Start at the end of it
Dog in a mirror
And you see
You see
Well Jill looked in and saw the dog
Behind the glass slinking about
It turned around
And looked right back
The hound it was
But her, in fact
Looking and watching
I think I saw it
Dog in a mirror
She said "I am
I am not one
But in a sense
The all of them
The man, the boy
The girl, the dog"
And as she spoke
They start to nod
Looking and watching
I think I saw it
Dog in a mirror
She said "I am
I am not one
But in a sense
The all of them
The man, the boy
The girl, the dog"
And as she spoke
They start to nod
Looking and watching
I think I saw a
Dog in a mirror
