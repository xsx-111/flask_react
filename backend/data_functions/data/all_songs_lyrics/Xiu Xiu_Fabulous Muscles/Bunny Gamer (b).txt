Bunny Gamer (b) LyricsIt feels retarded
I wonder if you like me
Will you be there tonight?
Do you mean it when you say what you say?
Fixing up my hair
I want to impress you
Today and everyday
Okay, okay okay
Okay
So what do you want?
I want to be careless too
So much waiting
So much sitting alone
When you say what you say
It's not what I thought
It's really nothing at all
I'm not who you want
Alright, alright, alright
Alright
Bunny gamer stand up
Bunny gamer
Where have you been all of my life?
Bunny gamer take me with you
Okay, okay okay
Okay
Bunny gamer sit down
Bunny gamer
Where have you been all night?
Bunny gamer leave me alone
Alright alright, alright
AlrightEmbed
