Little Panda McElroy (b) Lyrics
I can stop lying
I can stop punching my own face
I can stop stealing money
I can stop hating my own heart

I can do it
I can do it
I can do it
Because of you

I can stop scratching up my cheeks
I can stop drinking so much
I can stop wanting to kill myself
I can stop wanting your perfect heart

I can do it
Because of you

I can start listening
I can say, "Hi"
I can feel something good
