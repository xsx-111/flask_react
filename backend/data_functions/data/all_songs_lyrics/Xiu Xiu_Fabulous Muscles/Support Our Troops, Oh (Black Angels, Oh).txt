Support Our Troops, Oh (Black Angels, Oh) LyricsDid you know you were going to shoot
Off the top of a four year old girl's head
And look across her car-seat down into her skull
And see into her throat?
And did you know that her dad would say to you
"Please sir, can I take her body home?"
Oh wait, you totally did know that that would happen
'Cause you're a jock who was too stupid and too greedy
And too unmotivated to do anything else but still be
The biggest and still do what other people tell you to do
You did it to still be a winner
You shot your grenade launcher into peoples' windows
And into the doors of peoples' houses
But you wanted to shoot it into someone
Just to watch them blow up
Why should I care if you get killed?1Embed
