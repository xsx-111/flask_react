Brian the Vampire Lyrics
Brian, tender kisses
Run, run, run is my wish for you
Brian, tender drops of blood
Run, run, run, I am thinking of you

How far does your brother go with you?

Brian, tender growing boy
Stay, stay, stay awake is my prayer for you
Brian, tender clutches
Run, run, run, I am thinking of you

What happens to you when your dad hears your brother pull down your underpants?1Embed
