Clowne Towne Lyrics
Up and down through what you thought would be your future
Became the dark reminder of
What a rash and inconsistent faith you've had
In loving your true self and your true love

Clowne towne no shelter
Clowne towne no anything
Clowne towne single angel
Clowne towne no exit

Your true father smashed his hands through the glass
And failed out of the privileged life of his dream
Your true love has drunk herself into not being able to pay her rent
Or keeping her own word to her own self
Your true brother has betrayed you over and over
And looked you in the eye
Your true self has become weak and alone and annoying
And a true ridiculous dumb-ass

Clowne towne revealing nothing
Clowne towne a flock of coots
Clowne towne a single angel
Clowne towne a big dumb kid
Clowne towne no shelter
Clowne towne no anything
Clowne towne single beauty
Clowne towne no exit3Embed
