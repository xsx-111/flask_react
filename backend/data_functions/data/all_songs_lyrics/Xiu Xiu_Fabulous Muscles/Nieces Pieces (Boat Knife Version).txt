Nieces Pieces (Boat Knife Version) LyricsI can't wait to watch you get older
I can't wait to meet that first boy that breaks your life
I can't wait till you realize the family you've been born into
I can't wait to watch you turn from good to bad
I can't wait to tell your grandpa made your mommy
Play stripper while your uncle watched
I can't wait to tell you I punched your mommy in the chest
In front of her new friends
I can't wait till you realize mommy's heart is broken
I can't wait to watch you grow up around the people who broke it1Embed
