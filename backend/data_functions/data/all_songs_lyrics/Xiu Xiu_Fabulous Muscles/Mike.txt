Mike LyricsDad, what was Nigel supposed to do with your body?
A life I will never understand
Whose false teeth were gently pushed back into your
Mouth by your daughter's husband
What am I supposed to do with this?
I feel like I am not nice because sometimes
It is hard for me to think something happy about you
Except for that dad, I love you
And will always, always miss you
Pull my fingerEmbed
