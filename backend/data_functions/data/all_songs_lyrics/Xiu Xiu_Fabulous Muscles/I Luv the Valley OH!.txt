I Luv the Valley OH! Lyrics
It's a pill and you've got to take it
It's a pill that you've got to take
It's a pill and you've got to take it
I won't rest until you take it
That's a heart that you made
That's a heart and the both of you made it
That's a heart that you made
I won't rest until I break it
It’s the l'histoire de la family
It’s the l'histoire de la femme
It’s the l'histoire de la family

And I won't rest until I forget about it
I won't rest until I don't care
I won't rest until I forget about it
I won't rest until I don't care
La la la la la la la la la

That's a razor and you make a threat
That's a razor, make a million billion threats
That's a razor and you make a threat
And I won't rest 'cause I heard it all before
My behind is a beehive
There's a buzz in my backside
My behind is a beehive
And I won't rest while you break my will
Je t'aime the valley
Je t'aime the valley OH!
Je t'aime the valley
I am an orphan de la vallée
And I won't rest until I forget about it
I won't rest until I don't care
I won't rest until I forget about it
La la la la la la la la la9Embed
