From Black to Blue Lyrics
Several times over several days
I wasn't blind but I acted that way
Causing you pain
Well now I have to explain

As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now

Cooler than me, my confidence high
Reset the scene, no way to deny
Finally I won
And then I was undone

As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now
As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now
As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now
As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right nowEmbed
