The Crying of Lot G Lyrics
What did I miss here?
What can't you take anymore?
Expecting a whisper
I heard the slam of the door
You say that all we do is fight, but I think
Gee, I don't know that that's true
And then I wonder am I right?
Or Is that part of our problem?
Maybe I'm out of my mind
Maybe I'm blocking out the truth
But it seems like it's just a little thing like
You don't want to listen
When I can't shut up

Don't have to smile at me
Don't have to talk
All that I ask is you
Stop and remember
It isn't always this way

You have the problem
It goes with all our private jokes
When you're in a fury
Laughter gets stuck in my throat
I wonder why we have so much trouble
Cheering each other up sometimes
When one or the other of us is down
Instead it's like, you know if you're in a bad mood
I look at you and I think
"Maybe she knows something I don't know
Maybe I should be upset"


The way that I feel
When you laugh
Is like laughing
The way that I feel
When you cry
Is so bad1Embed
