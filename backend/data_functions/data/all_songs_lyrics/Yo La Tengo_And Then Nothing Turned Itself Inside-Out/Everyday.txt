Everyday Lyrics
I want summer's sad songs behind me
I want a laugh a minute without fail
I wanna be Paul le Mat in 1980
Looking to forget tomorrow looking everyday

I wanna see you put your hands together
I wanna cross my heart, I wanna hope to die
I hear Kate Moss talk, she talks to me
She's looking for a new beginning, everyday

When Monday comes, I want nothing
Come Tuesday morning, I want the same
(Everyday)
The days and nights fly by
(Everyday)
Looking to embrace the nothing of the everyday
(Everyday)
(Everyday)
Looking to embrace the nothing of the everyday
(Everyday)
Looking to embrace the nothing of the everyday
(Everyday)
Everyday
