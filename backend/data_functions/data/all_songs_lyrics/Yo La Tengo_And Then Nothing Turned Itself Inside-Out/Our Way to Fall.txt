Our Way to Fall Lyrics
I remember a summer's day
I remember walking up to you
I remember my face turned red
And I remember staring at my feet
I remember before we met
I remember sitting next to you
And I remember pretending I wasn't looking

So try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might, try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

I remember your old guitar
I remember, I can't explain
I remember the way it looked around your neck
And I remember the day it broke
I remember the song you sang
I remember the way you look tonight
And I remember the way it made me feel
We'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might we'll try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

You'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might try and make it ours
Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

Yeah, we're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love2Embed
