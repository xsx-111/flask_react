Tears Are in Your Eyes Lyrics
You tell me summer's here
And the time is wrong
You tell me winter's here
And your days are getting long

Tears are in your eyes
Tonight

You tell me that you haven't
Slept in days
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired
Anyway

Tears are in your eyes
Tonight
Tears are in your eyes
Every night

Although you don't believe me, you are strong
Darkness always turns into the dawn
And you won't even remember this for long
When it ends all right
Please tell me how you'll know tomorrow
Staring at your shoes

Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Every night
Tears are in your eyes
Tonight1Embed
