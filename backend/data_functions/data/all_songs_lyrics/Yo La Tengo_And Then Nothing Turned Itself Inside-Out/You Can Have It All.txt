You Can Have It All LyricsIf you want, want my love
Take it baby
If you want, want my heart
Take it baby
You can have it all
You can have it all
If you want, want my time
Take it baby
And if you want my last dime
Take it baby
You can have it all
You can have it all
Take it baby
Take it baby
Take it baby
Take it baby
Take it baby
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it all
You can have it
You can have it
Have it all
Have it all
You can have it
You can have it
Have it all
Have it all
You can have it
You can have it
Have it all
Have it all
You can have it
You can have it
Have it all
Have it all
You can have it
You can have it
Have it all
Have it all
You can have it
You can have it
Have it all
Have it all
You can have it
You can have it
Have it all
Have it all
You can have it
You can have it
