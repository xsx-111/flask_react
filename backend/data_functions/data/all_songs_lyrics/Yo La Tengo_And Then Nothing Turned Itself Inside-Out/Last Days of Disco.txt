Last Days of Disco Lyrics
Saw you at a party, you asked me to dance
Said music was great for dancing
I don't really dance much, but this time I did
And I was glad that I did this time

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more
Where I belong, where I belong

I wasn't dressed right, I rarely am
You told me that you didn't care
I laughed as you wobbled in your platform shoes
You laughed when I called Andrea True "Anita Ward"

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more
Where I belong, where I belong
And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
It asked "Do you remember?" and I remember
Remember like it wasn't long ago
And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more
Where I belong, where I belong
Where I belong, where I belongEmbed
