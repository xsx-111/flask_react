Night Falls on Hoboken Lyrics
Frightened face
Lonely dream
Break my heart
With your sad scream
Sun is down
Spirits low
Hate my impatience
But here I go

Come on, let's leave our misery
And crawl toward where we want to be
Can't we try? Can't we try?
Come on, sleep one night peacefully
Then I'll yawn all day easily
And rest up my mind

Red-rimmed eyes
Mine the same
Why so worried?
You can't explain

Come on, let's leave our misery
And crawl toward where we want to be
Can't we try? Can't we try?
Come on, sleep one night peacefully
Then I'll yawn all day easily2Embed
