Cherry Chapstick LyricsSomeone else's date in someone else's door
There's a girl with cherry chapstick on and nothing more
It's such a lurid pose and she seems this close
But not to me
Clear as day, crawling home at night
Wondering why the girls don't look at me when I walk by
And the way they make me feel
It's way too real to believe
Night and day the swinger's on the move
Wondering what it would be like if I could be that smooth
I could think about all that I missed out
It's hard to do
Someone else's date in someone else's door
There's a girl with cherry chapstick on and nothing more
It's such a lurid pose and she seems this close
But not to me
Running around in circles all day long
Running around in circles all day longEmbed
