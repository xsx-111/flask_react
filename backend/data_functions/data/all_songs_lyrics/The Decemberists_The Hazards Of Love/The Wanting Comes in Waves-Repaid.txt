The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid Lyrics
Mother I can hear your footfall now
A soft disturbance in the dead fall how
It precedes you like a black smoke pall
Still the wanting comes in waves
And you delivered me from danger, then
Tore my cradle from the reedy glen
Swore to save me from the world of men
Still the wanting comes in waves, in waves, and waves
And the wanting comes in waves
And the wanting comes in waves
And I want this night, and I want this night

How I made you, I wrought you, I pulled you
From ore I labored you, from cancer I cradled you, and now
This is how I am repaid, this is how I am repaid?
Remember when I found you the miseries that hounded you
And I gave you motion, anointed with lotions, and now
This is how I am repaid, this is how I am repaid?

Mother hear this proposition, right:
Grant me freedom to enjoy this night
And I'll return to you at break of light
For the wanting comes in waves, and waves, and waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
And you owe me life, and you owe me life, oh

And if I grant you this favor to hand you
Your life for the evening, I will retake by morning; and so
Consider it your debt repaid, consider it your debt repaid, repaid, repaid!Embed
