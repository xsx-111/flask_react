The Hazards of Love 2 (Wager All) Lyrics
And here I am softer than a shower
And here I am to garland you with flowers
To lay you down in clover bed
The stars, a roof above our heads
And all my life I never felt the tremor
And all my life that now disturbs my fingers
I'll lay you down in clover bed
The stars, a roof above our heads
And we'll lie 'til the corncrake crows
Bereft the weight of our summer clothes
And I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of love
And take my hand and cradle it in your hand
And take my hand to feel the pull, the quicksand
I'll lay you down in clover bed
The stars, a roof above our heads
And we'll lie till the corncrake crows
Bereft the weight of our summer clothes
And I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of love
The hazards of love, the hazards of loveEmbed
