The Hazards of Love 3 (Revenge!) Lyrics
Father I’m not feeling well, the flowers me you fed
Tasted spoiled for suddenly I find that I am dead
But father don’t you fear
Your children all are here
Singing, "Oh the hazards of love!"

Papa turn the water down, the basin’s overflown
The water covers everything and me left all alone
But Papa here in death
I have regained my breath
To sing, "Oh the hazards of love!"
To sing, "Oh the hazards of love!"

Spare the rod, you'll spoil the child, but I'd prefer the lash
My sisters drowned and poisoned, all, and me reduced to ash
And buried in an urn
But father, I return
Singing, "Oh the hazards of love"
Singing, "Oh the hazards of love"
"The hazards of love"
"The hazards of love"Embed
