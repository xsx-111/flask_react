The Hazards of Love 4 (The Drowned) LyricsMargaret arrayed the rocks around the hull before it was sinking
A million stones, a million bones, a million holes within the chinking
And painting rings around your eyes these peppered holes so filled with crying
A whisper weighed upon the tattered down where you and I were lying
Tell me now, tell me this, A forest's son, a river's daughter
A willow on the willow wisp, our ghosts will wander all of the water
So let's be married here today these rushing waves to bear our witness
And we will lie like river stones rolling only where it takes us
But I pulled you and I called you here
(Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I?)
And I caught you and I brought you here
(Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I?)
These hazards of love, never more will trouble us
Oh Margaret the lapping waves are licking quietly at our ankles
Another bow another breath this brilliant chill's come for the shackle
With this long last rush of air we speak our vows and starry whispers
When the waves came crashing down, he closed his eyes and softly kissed her
But I pulled you and I called you here
And I caught you and I brought you here
These hazards of love, never more will trouble us
And these hazards of love, never more will trouble usEmbed
