Annan Water Lyrics
Annan water, you loom so deep and wide
I would cross over if you would stem the tide
Or build a boat that I might ford the other side
To reach the farther shore where my true love lies in wait for me
In wait for me, in wait for me, in wait for me
O gray river, your waters ramble wild
The horses shiver and bite against the bridle
But I will cross if mine own horse is pulled from me
Though my mother cries that if I try I sure will drowned be
Will drowned be, will drowned be, will drowned be
But if you calm and let me pass
You may render me a wreck when I come back
So calm your waves and slow the churn
And you may have my precious bones on my return
Annan water, oh hear my true love's call
Hear her holler above your water's pall
God that I could, that my two arms could give me wing
And I would cross your breadth and rest my breast about her amber ring
Her amber ring, her amber ring, her amber ring
But if you calm and let me pass
You may render me a wreck when I come back
So calm your waves and slow the churn
And you may have my precious bones on my, on my returnEmbed
