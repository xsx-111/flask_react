Margaret in Captivity Lyrics
I have snipped your wingspan my precious captive swan
Here all clipped of kickstand your spirit won't last long
Don't you lift a finger, don't you snap and jaw
Limber limbs akimbo rest till rubbing raw

O my own true love, o my own true love
Can you hear me love, can you hear me love?

Don't hold out for rescue none can hear your call
Till I have wrest and wrecked you behind these fortress walls

O my own true love, o my own true love
Can you hear me love, can you hear me love?Embed
