The Abduction of Margaret Lyrics
And all the while whispering arbors provide cover
What previous witnessed ardors of our lovers
Our heroine here falls prey to her abductor
All a'gallop with Margaret slung rude 'cross withers
Having clamped her innocent fingers in fetters
This villain must calculate crossing the wild riverEmbed
