Magpie Lyrics
It's been five years since you've been gone and now
Oh, how the time has passed me by
But sometimes it's as though you're with me now
I think about you all the time

Julia, she's got so down
Something's got to give to turn things 'round
Julia, she's got so down

And now the world's been catching up to you
And you were gone before your time
So much has changed, so much is new and now
And yet it's still so high to climb

Julia, she's got so down
Something's got to give to turn things 'round
Julia, she's got so down

Julia, she's got so down
Something's got to give to turn things 'round
Julia, she's got so downEmbed
