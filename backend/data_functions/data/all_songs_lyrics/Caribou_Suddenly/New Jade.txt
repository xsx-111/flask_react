New Jade Lyrics
Now you're gone for good
Been through more than anyone should
And in time you'll see
How much better off you'll be

And don't you believe what he said
Locked up inside of his head
And we've got to join with you
To give you the strength to get through

It's like a new first kiss
Yeah, you can start feeling glad
Because you are not gonna miss
Something that you've not had

Don't you believe what he says
It's always lies anyways
We've been waiting for so long
And now he's finally goneEmbed
