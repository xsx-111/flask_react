Never Come Back LyricsAnd you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
I can never forget it
Promise me that you don't regret it
You and I were together
Even though we both knew better
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
I can never forget it
Promise me that you don't regret it
You and I were together
Even though we both knew better
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
And you never come back
And you never come back to
I guess I don't need you
Never will
But he'll be with you
If I leave you
I guess I don't need you
Never will
But he'll be with you
If I leave youEmbed
