Sister Lyrics
Sister, I promise you I'm changing
You've heard broken promises, I know
If you want to change it, you must break it
Rip it up and something new will grow

Brother, you're the one that must make changes
No one else can do it if you don't (The farmer's cat jumped over the...)
Surely, you'll have noticed things are changing
I can't do it all on my ownEmbed
