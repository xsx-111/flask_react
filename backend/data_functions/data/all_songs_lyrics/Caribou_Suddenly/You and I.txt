You and I Lyrics
It's a lie
I can always count on
By my side
For things that I can’t explain
You and I
You were always with me
Like a light
From inside

(I stay silent)
Hey!
Hey!

Now you're gone
And I'm left here waiting
Just your clothes and things
The things I can’t throw away
I can try
But it's so frustrating
It feels like there's a hole inside
That just won't go away

You can take your place up in the sky
I will find a way to carry on down here
(I stay si-, silent, hey)
Just as long as you are near
(I stay silent, I stay silent)
We can only make it if we try
There's a reason that you left us all down here
(I stay si-, I stay silent)
You're a whisper in my ear
(I stay silent)
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
You can take your place up in the sky
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!1Embed
