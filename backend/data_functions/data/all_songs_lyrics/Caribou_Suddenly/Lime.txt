Lime LyricsHoldin' up their hands above their heads
Holdin' up, up, up
Make up your mind
Before it goes away
Don't waste your time
Don't let it slip away
There's something in my eyes again
'Cause you've been telling lies again
You thought you'd left it in the past
But now it's here, it's here to last
Hands above their head
Holdin' up their hands above
Holdin' up
Holdin' up their hands above their headsEmbed
