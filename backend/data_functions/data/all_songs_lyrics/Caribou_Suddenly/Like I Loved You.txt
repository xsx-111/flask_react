Like I Loved You Lyrics
Sometimes it's all too much for me to hide
When everything gets twisted up inside
And I wish that you were there by my side, but still I try
If you find someone else, I'll be glad for you
I have to stop myself from thinking about the things you'll do
But I can't help it, the things I think just might be true, I try

Does he do the things to you that I won't do?
Does he love you like I used to do?
Do you ever miss me like I miss you?
Don't you ever want me too?


Does he do the things to you that I won't do?
Does he love you like I used to do?
Do you ever miss me like I miss you?
Don't you ever want me too?
Does he do the things to you that I won't do?
Does he love you like I used to do?
Do you ever miss me like I miss you?
Don't you ever want me too?2Embed
