Cloud Song Lyrics
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back

When you're alone with your memories
I'll give you a place to rest your head
Time is fading out our melodies
Until there's nothing left unsaid
It stops but won't start over
Drown in the sand beneath the waves
Why can't we catch our lightning
And leave our mark on the page?

If you love me, come hold me now
Come tell me what to do
I'm broken, so tired of crying
Can't seem to find my way to you
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back

No one is granted an eternity
Nothing lasts, it all will fade
And yet it always ends too early
With things unsaid and debts unpaid

If you love me, come hold me now
Come tell me what to do
I'm broken, so tired of crying
Can't seem to find my way to you

If you love me, come hold me now
Come tell me what to do
I'm broken, so tired of crying
Just hold me close to you1Embed
