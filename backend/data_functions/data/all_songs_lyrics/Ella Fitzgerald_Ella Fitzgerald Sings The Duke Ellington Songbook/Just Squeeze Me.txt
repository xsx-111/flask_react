Just Squeeze Me LyricsSqueeze me
But please don't tease me
C'mon and squeeze me
But please don't tease me
Want you to know I go for your squeezing
Want you to know it really is pleasing
Want you to know I ain't for no teasing
(scat)
Treat me sweet and gentle
When you say goodnight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me
I get sentimental
When you hold me tight
Just squeeze me
But please don't tease me
Missing you since you went away
Singin' the blues away each day
Counting the nights and waiting for you
I'm in the mood to let you know
I never knew I loved you so
Please say, you love me too
When I get this feeling
I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me
But don't tease me
Missing you since you went away
Singin' the blues away each day
Counting the nights and waiting for you
I'm in the mood to let you know
I never knew I loved you so
Please say, you love me too
When I get this feeling
I'm in ecstasy
So squeeze me
But please don't tease me
C'mon and squeeze me
But please don't tease me
Hear me honey, talkin'
Squeeze me
But please don't tease meEmbed
