Azure LyricsDrifting, dreaming
In an azure mood
Stardust gleaming
Through my solitude
Here in my seclusion
You're a blue illusion
While I'm in this azure interlude
I'm not wanted
I'm so all alone
Always haunted
By the dreams I own
But though I'm tormented
I must be contented
Drifting, dreaming
In an azure mood
Drifting, dreaming
In an azure mood
Drifting, dreaming
In an azure moodEmbed
