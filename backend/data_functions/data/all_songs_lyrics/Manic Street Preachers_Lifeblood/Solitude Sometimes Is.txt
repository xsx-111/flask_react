Solitude Sometimes Is Lyrics
Solitude sometimes is
The place that I would like to live
Solitude sometimes is
When nothing really seems to fit

If black were truly black not grey
It might provide some depth to pray
To black out all the worlds of men
And demons too, but not even then
Solitude sometimes is
]Verse 2]
Solitude sometimes is
Life that no longer exists
Solitude sometimes is
When there's nothing left to give


Drop your bombs on all I see
Leave this world alone for me
The thing I need to hide behind
It reigns beneath my holy skies

Solitude sometimes isEmbed
