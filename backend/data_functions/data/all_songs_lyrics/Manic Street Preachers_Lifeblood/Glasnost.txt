Glasnost Lyrics
When did life get so, get so complicated
When did time start, start accelerating
Make life slower
Stop life growing

If we can still fall in love
Embrace with us - make your own glasnost

And in defeat, cling to these words so clear
Humiliations not easily understood
Onto the future
Such messages are burned
