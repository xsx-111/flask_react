Cardiff Afterlife Lyrics
If the love between us has faded away
Left in the rain, Scratching at the stains
The paralysed future
The past sideways scrawl
I must give up on this
It makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

In the Cardiff afterlife
In the Cardiff afterlife
We sense the breaking of our lives
In the Cardiff afterlife
In the Cardiff afterlife

And yet I kept my silence
Your memory is still mine
No I will not share them
Acquaintance through denial
For I witnessed splendour
And evil that no-one saw
And I felt kindness
And vanity for sure
