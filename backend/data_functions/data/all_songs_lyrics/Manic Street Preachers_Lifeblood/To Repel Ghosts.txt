To Repel Ghosts Lyrics
When the disappearing begins
The ghosts we kept within
Can break free from inside
And untie our blindfold eyes

To repel ghosts
To repel ghosts

So when the ghosts find you
Be careful but be graceful
For all will be revealed
When ghosts become set free

A soul in pain Has no image to reclaim
To repel ghosts
To repel ghosts

Build bridges and not roads
Make love, make hate, make war
