The Love of Richard Nixon Lyrics
The world on your shoulders
The love of your mother
The fear of the future
The best years behind you

The world is getting older
The times they fall behind you
The need it still grows stronger
The best years never found you

The love of Richard Nixon , death without assassination
The love of Richard Nixon, yeah they all betrayed you
The love of Richard Nixon, death without assassination
Yeah they all betrayed you
Yeah and your country too

Love build around the sandy beaches
Love rains down like Vietnam's leeches
Richard III in the White house
Cowering behind divided curtains

The world is getting older
The times they fall behind you
The need it still grows stronger
The best years never found you
The love of Richard Nixon , death without assassination
The love of Richard Nixon, yeah they all betrayed you
The love of Richard Nixon, death without assassination
Yeah they all betrayed you
Yeah and your country too


The love of Richard Nixon, death without assassination
The love of Richard Nixon, yeah they all betrayed you
People forget China and your war on cancer
Yeah they all betrayed you
Yeah and your country too

"In all the decisions I have made in my public life
I have always tried to do what was best for the nation
I have never been a quitter"Embed
