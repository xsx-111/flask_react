A Song for Departure Lyrics
And all the masks I carry on my face
For you, for another
Some calm and then some grace
But once within a long and broken night
A face like mine, bereft of dreams and white

This is a song 
A song for a departure
This is a song
This is a song 
A song to take you homewards
This is a song

Maybe this strangeness only ever was
To hide ourselves from some kind of happiness
But always the moment it just seems to stay
Tearing it off like so many calendar days


This is a song 
A song for broken lovers
This is a song
This is a song 
A song to take you homewards
This is a song
This is a song 
A song to break your heart to
This is a songEmbed
