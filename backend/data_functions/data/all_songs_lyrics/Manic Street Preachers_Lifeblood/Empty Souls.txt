Empty Souls Lyrics
Empty souls will leave their homes
To find a place where they're alone
Rattling memories and hollow bones
Leaves a taste so bitter and cold

For empty souls will stand alone
Shivering like black-eyed dogs
Waiting to be taken home
Where that is they only know

Exposed to a truth we don't know
Collapsing like the Twin Towers
Falling down like April showers

Colossal endless like a marathon
God knows what makes the comparison 
For the empty souls
For the empty souls
