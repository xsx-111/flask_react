Always/Never Lyrics
Always, never on my mind
Always, always out of time
Always, always letting someone down
Always, always wanting more
Always, always stand-alone
Always, always getting something wrong

Longing for, it's been a long time longing for
To carry the sky away

Always, never said and done
Always, always change my mind
Always, always trying to succeed
Always, never facing you
Always, never being true
Always, always gonna be this way


Always, never
