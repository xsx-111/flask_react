1985 Lyrics
In 1985, I placed a bet and lied
Losing all that I had
At least with all my heart intact
In 1985, Orwell was proved right
Torvill and Dean's Bolero
Redundant as a sad Welsh chapel
In 1985, in 1985

So God is dead, like Nietzsche said
Superstition is all we have left
Circle the wagons, we're under attack
We've realized there's no going back
We've realized there's no going back

In 1985, the Civil War failed why?
Kept hidden like scars of birth
Nature unable to soften the words
In 1985, my words they came alive
Friends were made for life
Morrissey and Marr gave me choice
In 1985, in 1985

So God is dead, like Nietzsche said
Only 16 years of age, he said
See all the tears, for the walking dead
We've realized there's no going back
We've realized there's no going back
In 1985, I placed a bet and lied
Losing all that I had2Embed
