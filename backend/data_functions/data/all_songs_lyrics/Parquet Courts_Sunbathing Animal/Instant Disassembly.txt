Instant Disassembly LyricsMamasita, catch me now as I sink
Into darkness I thought to be extinct
Chilled my eyeballs as the curtains were torn
And shed a light so bright
Shining like the day I was born
Mamasita, take from me what I stole
Oh, I get a look from you that strips me
To a blank page in my soul
Like the left open window ignored
It cuts to my core when I see you cry
Mamasita, I’ve prepared my defense
Flawed as ever in the drunkest tense
Kept repeating, kept repeating myself
In my native tongue the parlance of problem itself
Mamasita, hold me now as I ache
She’s got a real firm grip and she’s rockin’
Trying to shake me awake
Turn on the white noise murmur of the AM band
And the last classic rock band’s last solid record creeps in
A call out of the blue from an old, old friend
Instant, instant disassembly
Mamasita, into pieces I fall
Oh, you did your heart no favors
Darling, when you taught me to crawl
Don’t beseech me for the answers you seek
Oh, I kept explaining that I was too tired
To continue to speak
Mamasita, hear me now I insist
Oh, you’ve got to trust me when I say
Long for something better than this
Kept repeating, kept repeating myself
There’s nothing left to dismantle
The house it just collapsed on itself
Instant, instant disassembly
Mamasita, tie me loose as I flee
Oh, it seems that you’ve got a spotlight
Cast on the dark side of me
I feel a pain so acute like I’m being impaled
And I can’t breathe, can’t breathe, it’s hard to inhale
And it’s worth repeating
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe
It’s hard to inhale yeah
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe
It’s hard to inhale yeah
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe
It’s hard to inhale yeah
When you’re near
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe
It’s hard to inhale yeah
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe
It’s hard to inhale yeah
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe
It’s hard to inhale yeah
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe
It’s hard to inhale yeah
I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe…Embed
