Sunbathing Animal Lyrics
One creature I return to, one habit I neglect
I cannot slow the pace at which I yearn
Frank and unabashed I become a frozen servant
Smiling asking nothing in return
Fang-tooth woman foaming at the mouth as she addressed me
Not with moving lips, but with the rabid wild arresting
Words not yet intended to identify emotion
Scrawling bold and oblique in my head
I’ve hung out at your service jobs
I’ve watched you, waited and be ignored
Bled into the clatter, as they sipped at what you poured
I cling to your perimeter as you float in their margins
Oblivious to being stung, there satellite becomes my son
I’ve flown into that trap before
When things have gotten dark
In the depths of strangers glances lies the most ferocious spark
Most freedom is deceiving
If such a thing exists
When I was young I knew but didn’t care
Faces change and shape to represent the same old beast
I want to flee but I can only stare
It’s the sound a captive heart makes as it sizzles into vapor
The title hum of fondness like a spike-wave oscillator
The rabid UV grin that beckons me into approaching
Grasping as it recedes into space
Who greets me first when I arise
Who breaking into my half shut eyes
It’s in the blaze of your embrace where I feel more real and alive
The bosom of 1000 watts into my skin into my guts
Running circles so proud until he got caught
In his brief emancipation he can feel what I cannot
There’s a patch of light that hits the floor I’ll often occupy
Stretch my arms and legs and close my eyes
I now can hear my pulse alone, this manic pace I cannot slow
I do not miss the child you stole
Frying and abiding, I’m in your control
Like a sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
A sunbathing animal
