Dear Ramona LyricsAn heiress of delusion that no two arms could ever contain
This lady is a hypnosis poet and when she speaks her words weep like rain
She tiptoes through the side streets in the morning and wears dark sunshades at night
However she might be spending her time I don't know you'd have to ask her neighbors
But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)
Not to no one
My dear ramona
Born in some unnatural state that no one father would claim
This daughter saving up commissions from acting but no one's ever seen her play
She fixes breakfast for two in the morning and drinks dark coffee at night
Whoever she might be going to bed with, you can read about that in her Moleskine
But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)
Not to no one
