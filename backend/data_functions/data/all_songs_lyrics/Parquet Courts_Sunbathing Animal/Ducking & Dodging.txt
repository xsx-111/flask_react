Ducking & Dodging Lyrics
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't fit this lock no more
That key you've got won't fit this lock no more
You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't let you in my door
That key you've got won't let you in my door

My eyes have seen the glory and
The sound and image, synchronized
Right there on the silver screen
Heard the sounds suggesting
Lineage of influence, yeah
Saw it there in the motherland
Steps and gables, steeples, stairways
Wind away from origin
In untrampled vintage floats the proof
I cannot be freed
The concert stage, the velvet cage
The glass perimeter of me
All my friends are disappearing
All my letters are in codes
All I ever think and feel
In your shadow, it erodes
Waiting, waiting by the silent phone
I draft my next apology
Burn my letters once they're read
Unalloyed joy, I thrice repeat
Unalloyed joy
Unalloyed joy
Listen to what I just heard
It's written on the sun, jailbird
And just like you
The way it moves
A fog that creeps in, grinning always
In your hair
And in your hallways
Got detained in San Francisco
On your way to get fresh air
The U.S.A. didn't want you there
Juggled oranges, but no one cared
You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more
You've been ducking and dodging but you can't come home no more
You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more
That key you've got won't won't let you in that door
That key you've got won't fit that lock no more

Lady Macbeth, rock me mama
Like my back ain't got no bone
Like clicks heard on the telephone
Like a sudden unhinged moan
That leaks out from your broken structure
Like a wall of unbound stone
They buried the eighth
They buried the ninth
They said the finale was a formal reply
They buried the eighth
They buried the ninth
They said the finale was a formal reply
They buried the eighth
They buried the ninth
Buried everything, I'm telling you guy
Contest prizes, grand pianos
Gagged by comfort, shamed by words
Empty anthems, cloaked in strange fur
Stripes and bars, is it yours?
Stripes and bars
Stripes and bars
Stripes and bars, and are you sure?
Stripes and bars will lock you in
Lock you in or camouflage you
Feel the sun, but cannot walk to
Hear the yelp, but cannot talk to
Trembling, cloaked in what you swore
Were stripes and bars
That's what they're for
You've been ducking, dodging but you can't come home no more1Embed
