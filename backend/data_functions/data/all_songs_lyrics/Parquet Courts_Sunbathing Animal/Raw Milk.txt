Raw Milk LyricsAwake in an unmade nest
Peepers hacking into day
Well, I've heard that sound so many times
It terrifies and comforts me
Scratching at the door
It's time
First she summons, next she feeds
And I'm going back home to my old used-to-be
Chula dances for me like a dervish whirling
In my eyes
Spin around me rabid child
I won't see you for some time...
She gets feisty when she's been drinking
Never can tell what the hell she's thinking
Smiles like she's got one eye winking at you
Dog walkers in the living room
Strange whine in the kitchen
And she's brewing something bitchin'
Just for you
Chula dances for me like a dervish whirling
In my eyes
Spin around me rabid child
I won't see you for some timeEmbed
