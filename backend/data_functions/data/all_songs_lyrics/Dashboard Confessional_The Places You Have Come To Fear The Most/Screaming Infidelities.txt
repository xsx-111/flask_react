Screaming Infidelities Lyrics
I'm missing your bed, I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
I’m cuddling close to blankets and sheets
But you’re not alone and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home
I'm reading your note over again
There's not a word that I comprehend
Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever"

Well, as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder how you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone making out

I'm missing your laugh, how did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you’re pretending
I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets
And I am alone in my defeat
I wish I knew you are safely at home
I'm missing your bed, I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak
And this bottle of beast is taking me home
Well, as for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder how you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone making out

Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities, and taking its wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities, and taking its wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities, and taking its wear
Your hair, it's everywhere
Screaming infidelities, and taking its wear4Embed
