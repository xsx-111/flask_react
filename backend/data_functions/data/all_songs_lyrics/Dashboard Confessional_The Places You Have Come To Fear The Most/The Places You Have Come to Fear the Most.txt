The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most LyricsBuried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And covered with a perfect shell
Such a charming beautiful exterior
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
And perfect posture but you're barely scraping by

But this is one time, this is one time
That you can't fake it hard enough to please everyone or anyone at all
And the grave that you refuse to leave
The refuge that you've built to flee
The places that youâ€™ve come to fear the most
Is the place that you have come to fear the most
Buried deep as you can dig inside yourself
And hidden in the public eye
Such a stellar monument to loneliness
Laced with brilliant smiles and shining eyes
And perfect makeup but you're barely scraping by
