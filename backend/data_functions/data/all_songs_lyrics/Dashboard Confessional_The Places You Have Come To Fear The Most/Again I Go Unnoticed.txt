Again I Go Unnoticed Lyrics
So quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed

Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
Close lipped, another good night kiss
Is robbed of all its passion
Your grip another time is slack
It leaves me feeling empty

Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?
I’ll wait until tomorrow
Maybe you'll feel better then
Maybe we'll be better then
So what's another day
When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you?
This mood of yours is temporary
It seems worth the wait to see you smile again
Out of the corner of your eye
Won't be the only way you'll look at me then

So quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed1Embed
