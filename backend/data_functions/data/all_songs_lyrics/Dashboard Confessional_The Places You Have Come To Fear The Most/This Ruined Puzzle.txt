This Ruined Puzzle LyricsThis ruined puzzle is beige with the pieces all face down
So the placing goes slowly
The pictures of anything other than it's meant to be

But the hours, they creep, the patterns repeat
Don't be concerned, you know I'll be fine on my own
I never said "don't go", “don’t go”

But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that you've marked to find your way back
It says "Does he ever get the girl?"
But what if the pages stay pressed
The chapters unfinished
The stories too dull to unfold?
Does he ever get the girl?
Well, this basement's a coffin, I'm buried alive
I'll die in here just to be safe
Cause you're gone, I get nothing
And you're off with barely a sigh
I never said "Good-bye"

But I've hidden a note
It's pressed between pages that you read if you’re so inclined
"Does he ever get the girl?"

Does he ever get the girl?Embed
