Standard Lines Lyrics
Which of the bold faced lies will we use?
I hope that you're happy, you really deserve it
This will be the best for us both in the end

But your taste still lingers on my lips
Like I just placed them upon yours
And I starve, I starve for you
But this new diet's liquid
And dulling to the senses
And it's crude but it will do

So which of the standard lines will we use?
I've been meaning to call you
I've just been so busy
We'll catch up soon
Let's make it a point to

But your taste still lingers on my lips
Like I just placed them upon yours
And I starve, I starve for you
But this new diet's liquid
And dulling to the senses
And it's crude but it will do
But it will do
I hope it will doEmbed
