Saints and Sailors LyricsThis is where I say I've had enough
And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now
A walking open wound
A trophy display of bruises
And I don't believe that I'm getting any better, any better

Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring
And I'm thinking awful things
I’m pretty sure that few would notice
And this apartment is starving for an argument
Anything at all to break the silence
Wandering this house
Like I've never wanted out
And this is about as social as I get now
And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you
Cause they would never do
I would never do, never


But don't be a liar
Don't say that "everything's working"
When everything's broken
And you smile like a saint
But you curse like a sailor
And your eyes say the joke's on me
I’m not laughing, you’re not leaving
Well, who do I think I am kidding
When I’m the only one locked in this cell
