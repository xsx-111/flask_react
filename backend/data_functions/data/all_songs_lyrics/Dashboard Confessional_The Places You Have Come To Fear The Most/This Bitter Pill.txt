This Bitter Pill LyricsWalking away
It's not the same as running
Is it to you now that you've run this in the ground?
And you say “take this
This medicine is just what you deserve
Swallow, choke, and die”

And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion
Such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you
This feeling of despair
Is never wearing out
It's wearing off
And it's leaving you with such a heavy heart
And a head to match
The bottle is waiting
The cap is twisted
Begging to be used
And so are you

And this bitter pill is leaving you with such an angry mouth
One that's void of all discretion
Such an awful tearing sound
With its measure only equaled by the power of my stare
Glaring over you and over you
This feeling of despair
Is never wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing out
Wearing outEmbed
