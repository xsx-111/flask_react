The Best Deceptions LyricsI heard about your trip
I heard about your souvenirs
I heard about the cool breeze, in the cool nights
And the cool guys that you spent them with
I guess I should have heard of them from you

Don't you see, don't you see
That the charade is over?
And all the "Best Deceptions" and the  "Clever Cover Story" awards go to you
So kiss me hard
Cause this will be the last time that I let you
You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service
To keeping you away
I heard about your regrets
I heard that you were feeling sorry
I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you

I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers
I'll be all right when my hands get warm
Ignoring the phone, I'd rather say nothing
I'd rather you'd never heard my voice
Youâ€™re calling too late, too late to be gracious and you do not warrant long good-byes1Embed
