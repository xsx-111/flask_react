The Brilliant Dance Lyrics
So this is odd
Painful realization
That all has gone wrong
And nobody cares at all
And nobody cares at all

So you buried all your lover's clothes
And burned the letters lover wrote
But it doesn't make it any better
Does it make it any better?
And the plaster dented from your fist
In the hall where you had your first kiss
Reminds you that the memories will fade

So this is strange
Our sidestepping has come to be
A brilliant dance
Where nobody leads at all
Where nobody leads at all

And the picture frames are facing down
And the ringing from this empty sound
Is deafening and keeping you from sleep
And breathing is a foreign task
And thinking's just too much to ask
And you're measuring your minutes
By a clock that's blinking eights
Well, this is incredible
Starving, insatiable
Yes, this is love for the first time
And you'd like to think that you were invincible
Yeah, well weren't we all once
Before we felt loss for the first time?
Well this is the last timeEmbed
