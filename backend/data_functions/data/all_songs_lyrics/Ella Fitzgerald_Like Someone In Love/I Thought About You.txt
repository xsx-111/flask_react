I Thought About You Lyrics
Seems that I read, or somebody said
That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind
What did I find?
I took a trip on a train and I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane and I thought about you
Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, same old dream
At every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue
I peeked through the crack and looked at the track
The one going back to you
And what did I do?
I'll leave it to you
Oh what did I do?
I thought about youEmbed
