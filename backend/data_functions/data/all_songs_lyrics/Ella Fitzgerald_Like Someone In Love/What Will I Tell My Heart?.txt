What Will I Tell My Heart? LyricsI'll try to explain to friends, dear
The reason we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends, dear
But what will I tell my heart
It's easy to say to strangers
That we played a game from the start
It's easy to lie to stranger
But what will I tell my heart
When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring
I could say you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
But what will I tell my heart
I'll try to explain to friends, dear
The reason we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends, dear
But what will I tell my heart
Oh, baby, what will I tell my heartEmbed
