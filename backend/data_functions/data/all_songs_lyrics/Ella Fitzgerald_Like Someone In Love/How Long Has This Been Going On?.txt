How Long Has This Been Going On? Lyrics
I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were tears up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen, sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh I feel that I could melt, into heaven, I'm hurled
I know how Columbus felt finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dance that was before
What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been goin' on?

Let me dream that it's true
Kiss me twice, then once more
That makes thrice, let's make it four
What a break, for heaven's sake
How a long has this been goin' on?Embed
