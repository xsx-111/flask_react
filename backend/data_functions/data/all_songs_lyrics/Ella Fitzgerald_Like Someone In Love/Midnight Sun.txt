Midnight Sun LyricsYour lips were like a red and ruby chalice warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height
Each star it's own aurora borealis suddenly you held me tight
I could see the midnight sun
I can't explain the silver rain that found me or was that moonlit veil
The music of the universe around me or was that a nightingale
And then your arms miraculously found me suddenly the sky turned pail
I could see the midnight sun
Was there such a night? It's a thrill I still don't quite believe
But after you were gone there was still some stardust on my sleeve
The pain of it may dwindle to an ember and the stars forget to shine
And we may see the meadow in December, Icy white and crystalline
But oh my darlinâ€™ always I'll remember when your lips were close to mine
And I saw the Midnight SunEmbed
