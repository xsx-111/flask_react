More Than You Know LyricsWhether you are here or yonder
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you
Give you the break you need
More than you know, more than you know
Man of my heart I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know
Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Man of my heart I'll string along
You need me so
More than you'll ever know
Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But honey I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd sigh
If you got tired and said "Goodbye"
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever knowEmbed
