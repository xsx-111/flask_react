Every Time the Sun Comes Up Lyrics
Pace man for you
Hold my horses patient
Hey, man, tricks can wait
To heal my emotions

Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble

People say I'm a one hit wonder
But what happens when I have two
I washed your dishes
But I shit in your bathroom

Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble

We broke your glasses
But covered our asses
Take time silently
Feel real room high five
When every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Yeah, every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Imagine when
Every time the sun comes up, I see double

Hmmm
Hmmm
Yes, she is
(Maybe something will change haha
Sorry, my headphones fell off)1Embed
