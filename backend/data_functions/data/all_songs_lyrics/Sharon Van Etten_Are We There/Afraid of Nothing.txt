Afraid of Nothing Lyrics
You told me the day
That you show me your face
We'd be in trouble for a long time

I can't wait till we're afraid of nothing
I can't wait till we hide from nothing
Nothing, and you decide
You throw me a lame "wait shit out"
You're a little late
I need you to be afraid of nothing

Turning my way
You show me your face
We've known each other for a long time

I can't wait till we're afraid of nothing
I can't wait till we hide from nothing
Nothing, and you decide
You throw me a lame "wait shit out"
You're a little late
I need you to be afraid of nothing
I need you
To be afraid of nothing4Embed
