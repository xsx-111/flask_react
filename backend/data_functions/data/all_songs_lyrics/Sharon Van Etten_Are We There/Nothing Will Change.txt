Nothing Will Change LyricsMaybe something will change
Maybe something will change
Remember when you saw me on the street
And then you looked in my eyes?
You helped me with the tire change
It had been a while and I thought that you'd forgotten 'bout me
I never could have forgotten you
I will reach you
I will reach you
I will meet you on your street
I won't let you down
Maybe something will change
Maybe something will change
A couple years later when I saw you making western moves
And "pal"ing 'round but I still saw in you
You always believed in me and I always believed in you
Let's not turn the page
I will reach you
I will reach you
I will meet you on your street
I won't let you down
I will meet you
I will meet you
I will meet you, on your street
I don't wanna let you down
Nothing will change
Nothing will change
Nothing will change
Nothing will changeEmbed
