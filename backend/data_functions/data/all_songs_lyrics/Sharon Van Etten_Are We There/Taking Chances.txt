Taking Chances Lyrics
Turn on the charm
Call to response now
Sitting on the porch, looking for a way out
You touched on me deep
That's why I'm still here
Why do we think that we've no plight?

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances
On you
Remember

In the dark
On the way out
It's even in old songs
It's the combination that takes emotions
Why don't we go now?
No need to think on our own now about it

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances
On you
When you love all of you
They know all of you
Be alone and take
And you break for whose sake?
About to leave, about to leave

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances
On you2Embed
