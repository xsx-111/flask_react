You Know Me Well LyricsEveryone will go with you
Listen for the way out as you
Cut me to the chase till I'm
On the other side and when
It all comes out
We're as empty as a brick house that we
Built without the sides
Everyone is crazy with their own life
Lies in existential you ever want to find your way out
Turn into yourself again and reach on out
To become your true self
You know me well
You show me hell when I'm looking
And here you are
Looking
All the skies are fallin' and the sun is movin' up and down
Even when you're in a dark way
Some decisions shield you from the positivity until
You reach out to me
You say why you hate it as you pry your way in
I need another investigative mind
Tell me that you're injured, yourself, and you've been healing
And I will see this through
You know me well
You show me hell when I'm looking
And here you are
Looking
I told you then
I'd hold you when you need it
And there you are
Looking
Away
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well1Embed
