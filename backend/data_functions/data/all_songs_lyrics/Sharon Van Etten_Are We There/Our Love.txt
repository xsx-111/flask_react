Our Love Lyrics
You say I am genuine
I see your backhand again
I'm a sinner, I have sinned
We're a half mast flag in wind

It's our love, it's our love
It's our love, it's our love
It's our love, it's our love
It's our love, it's our love
It's our love

At the bottom of a well
I'm reliving my own hell
Someone throws the ladder down
Still don't know what I have found

In our love, in our love
In our love, in our love
In our love, in our love
In our love, in our love
In our love
It's all love, it's all love
It's all love, it's all love
It's all love, it's all love
It's all love, it's all love1Embed
