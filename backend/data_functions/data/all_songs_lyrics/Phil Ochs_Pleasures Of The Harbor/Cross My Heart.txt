Cross My Heart Lyrics
I don't know
But it seems that every single dream's
Painted pretty pictures in the air
Then it tumbles in despair
And it starts to bend until by the end it's a nightmare

But I'm gonna give all that I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

I don't know
But it's true, so many things you do
Please you so they leave you feeling warm
It's the calm before the storm
For the habit grows and before you know it you're deformed

So I'm gonna give all that I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

I don't know
But I see that everything is free
When you're young the treasures you can take
But the bridge is bound to break
And you reach the end screaming it's all been a mistake
So I'm gonna give all that I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to live

Well I don't know
But it seems that every single dream's
Painted pretty pictures in the air
Then it tumbles in despair
And it starts to bend until by the end it's a nightmare

But I'm gonna give all that I've got to give
Cross my heart, and I hope to liveEmbed
