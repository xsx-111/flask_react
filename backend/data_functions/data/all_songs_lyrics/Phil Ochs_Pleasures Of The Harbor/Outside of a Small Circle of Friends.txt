Outside of a Small Circle of Friends Lyrics
Oh, look outside the window, there's a woman bein' grabbed
They've dragged her to the bushes, and now she's bein' stabbed
Maybe we should call the cops and try to stop the pain
But Monopoly is so much fun, I'd hate to blow the game
And I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody
Outside of a small circle of friends

Ridin' down the highway, yes, my back is gettin' stiff
Thirteen cars have piled up, they're hanging on a cliff
Now maybe we should pull them back with our towing chain
But we gotta move, and we might get sued
And it looks like it's gonna rain
And I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody
Outside of a small circle of friends

Sweating in the ghetto with the colored and the poor
The rats have joined the babies who are sleepin' on the floor
Now wouldn't it be a riot if they really blew their tops?
But they got too much already, and besides we've got the cops
And I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody
Outside of a small circle of friends

Oh, there's a dirty paper using sex to make her sales
The Supreme Court was so upset they sent him off to jail
Maybe we should help the fiend and take away his fine
But we're busy reading Playboy and The Sunday New York Times
And I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody
Outside of a small circle of friends
Smokin' marijuana is more fun than drinkin' beer
But a friend of ours was captured, and they gave him thirty years
Maybe we should raise our voices, ask somebody why
But demonstrations are a drag, besides we're much too high
And I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody
Outside of a small circle of friends

Oh, look outside the window, there's a woman bein' grabbed
They've dragged her to the bushes, and now she's bein' stabbed
Maybe we should call the cops and try to stop the pain
But Monopoly is so much fun, I'd hate to blow the game
And I'm sure it wouldn't interest anybody
Outside of a small circle of friends1Embed
