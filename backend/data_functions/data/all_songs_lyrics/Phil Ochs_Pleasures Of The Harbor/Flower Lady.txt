Flower Lady Lyrics
Millionaires and paupers walk the hungry street
Rich and poor companions of the restless beat
Strangers in a foreign land
Strike a match with a trembling hand
Learn too much to ever understand
But nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady

Lover's quarrel, snarl away their happiness
Kisses crumble in a web of loneliness
It's written by the poison pen
Voices break before they bend
The door is slammed, it's over once again
But nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady

Poets agonize, they cannot find the words
And the stone stares at the sculptor, asks "Are you absurd?"
The painter paints his brushes back
Through the canvas runs a crack
Portrait of the pain never answers back
But nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady

Soldiers disillusioned come home from the war
Sarcastic students tell them not to fight no more
And they argue through the night
Black is black, white is white
Walk away both knowing they are right
But nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady
Smoke dreams of escaping souls are drifting by
Dull the pain of living as they slowly die
Smiles change into a sneer
Washed away by whiskey tears
In the quicksand of their mind they disappear
Still nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady

Feeble aged people almost to their knees
Complain about the present using memories
Never found their pot of gold
Wrinkled hands pound weary holes
Each line screams out you're old, you're old, you're old
But nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady

And the flower lady hobbles home without a sale
Tattered shreds of petals leave a fading trail
Not a pause to hold a rose
Even she no longer knows
The lamp goes out, the evening now is closed
And nobody's buying flowers from the flower ladyEmbed
