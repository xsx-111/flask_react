(They Long to Be) Close to You Lyrics
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?

Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall off from the sky
Every time you walk by?

Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
They decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And put a starlight in your eyes so blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you, all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Aah
Close to you
Aah
Close to you
Aah, aah
Close to you
Aah, aah
Close to you
Aah, aah
Close to you
Aah, aah
Close to youEmbed
