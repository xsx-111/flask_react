Away Lyrics(on Dreams/Linger singles)
Turn away, turn away
From me, from me
And I pray, yes I pray
For thee, for thee, for the-hi-hi
Another world
Wrapped up inside another place
And I hope, and I pray
That the pain goes away
Yes I pray, yes I pray, yes I pra-ha-hay
Turn away, turn away
From me, from me
And I pray, yes I pray
For the, for the, for the-hi-hi
Ba pa pa da, ba da
Ba pa pa-aaa
Ba pa pa da, ba da
Turn away, turn away
From me, from me
And I pray, yes I pray
For the, for the, for the-hi-hi
Ba pa pa da, ba da
Ba pa pa-aaa
Ba pa pa da, ba daEmbed
