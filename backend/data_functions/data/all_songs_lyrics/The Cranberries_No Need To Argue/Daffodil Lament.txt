Daffodil Lament LyricsHoldin' on
That's what I do, since I met you
And it won't be long
Would you notice, if I left you?
And it's fine for some
Cause you're not the one, you're not the one
There
There, there, there...
There, there
All night long, laid on my pillow
These things are wrong
I can't sleep here
So lovely
So lovely
So lovely
I have decided to leave you forever
I have decided to start things from here
Thunder and lightning won't change what I'm feelin'
And the daffodils look lovely today...
And the daffodils look lovely today...
Look lovely today
Through your eyes I can see the disguise
Through your eyes I can see the dismay
Has anyone seen lightning?
Has anyone, looked lovely?
And the daffodils look lovely today...
And the daffodils look lovely today...
Look lovely today
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely (look lovely)
Look lovely
Nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nahEmbed
