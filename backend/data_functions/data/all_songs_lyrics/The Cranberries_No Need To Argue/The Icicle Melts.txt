The Icicle Melts Lyrics
When
When will the icicle melt?
The icicle, icicle
And when
When will the picture show end?
The picture show, picture show

I should not have read the paper today
'Cause a child, child, child, child
He was taken away

There's a place for the baby that died
And there's a time for the mother who cried
And she will hold him in her arms sometime
'Cause nine months is too long, too long, too long

How
How could you hurt a child?
How could you hurt a child?
Now does this make you satisfied, satisfied, satisfied?

I don't know what's happening to people today
When a child, child, child, child
He was taken away (taken away)
There's a place for the baby that died
There's a time for the mother who cried
And she will hold him in her arms sometime
'Cause nine months is too long, too long, too long


There's a place for the baby that died
And there's a time for the mother who cried
And you will hold him in your arms sometime
'Cause nine months is too long, too long, too long (too long)Embed
