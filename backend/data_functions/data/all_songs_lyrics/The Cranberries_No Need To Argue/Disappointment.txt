Disappointment LyricsDisappointment you shouldn't have done
You couldn't have done
You wouldn't have done
The things you did then
And we could've been happy
What a piteous thing, a hideous thing
Was tainted by the rest
But it won't get any harder
And I hope you'll find your way again
And it won't get any higher
And it all boils down to what you did There
There
There
There
There
There
There
There
In the night we fight, I fled you're right
It was exactly there
It was exactly there
I decided
Decided
Decided
Decide
We threw you out
In the night we fight, I fled you're right
It was exactly there
It was exactly there
I decided
Decided
Decided
Decided
But it won't be any harder
And I hope you'll find your way again
And it won't get any higher
But it all boils down to what you did There
There
There
There
There
There
