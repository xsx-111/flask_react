Empty LyricsSomething has left my life
And I don't know where it went to
Somebody caused me strife
And it's not what I was seeking
Didn't you see me? Didn't you hear me?
Didn't you see me standing there?
Why did you turn out the lights?
Did you know that I was sleeping?
Say a prayer for me
Help me to feel the strength I did
My identity, has it been taken?
Is my heart breakin' on me?
All my plans fell through my hands;
They fell through my hands, on me
All my dreams, it suddenly seems, it suddenly seems
Empty
Empty
Empty
Empty
Empty
Empty
