Ridiculous Thoughts LyricsTwister, oh, does anyone see through you?
You're a twister, oh, an animal
But you're so happy, how?
I didn't go along with
You're so happy how?
Na-na-na-na
But you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
Hold on, hold on
Or we're gonna have to move on
We're gonna have to move on
Or we're gonna have to move on
Move on, move on
I feel alright
And I cried so hard the
Ridiculous thoughts, a-ha how
I feel alright, alright, alright, alright
Twister, oh, I shouldn't have trusted in you
Twister, oh, a-na-na-na
It's not gonna happen now
You're not gonna make fun of me
Happen now, a-na-na-na
But you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
Hold on, hold on
Or we're gonna have to move on
We're gonna have to move on
Or we're gonna have to move on
Move on, move on
I feel alright
And I cried so hard the
Ridiculous thoughts, a-ha how
I feel alright, alright, alright, alright
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You should have lied
But I cried so hard the
Ridiculous thoughts, a-ha how
We should have lied, a lied, a lied, a lied
But you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Well, you're gonna have to hold on
You're gonna have to hold on, to me2Embed
