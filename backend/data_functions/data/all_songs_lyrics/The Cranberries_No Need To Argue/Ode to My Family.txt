Ode to My Family Lyrics
Understand the things I say
Don't turn away from me
Cause I've spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree

Do you see me, do you see?
Do you like me
Do you like me standing there?
Do you notice, do you know
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?
Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am

But I miss you, I miss
Cause I liked it
Cause I liked it
When I was out there
Do you know this, do you know
You did not find me
You did not find
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?
Does anyone care?14Embed
