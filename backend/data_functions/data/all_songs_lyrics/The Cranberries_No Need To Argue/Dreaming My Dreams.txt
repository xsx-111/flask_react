Dreaming My Dreams LyricsAll the things you said to me today
Changed my perspective in every way
These things count to mean so much to me
Into my faith you and your baby
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place
That I'd lay down my face
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
It's out there
It's out there
It's out there
If you want me, I'll be here
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place
That I'd lay down my face
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
Dreaming my dreams with you
I'll be dreaming my dreams with you
And there's no other place
That I'd lay down my face
Dreaming my dreams with you
