World of Lies LyricsGo!

Degeneration tears your black skies
The final descent for the last in life
No joy in our tired lives - the torment builds inside
The sun sets forever on a world of lies
World of lies

World of lies
Non-divine
Release me

Demonic vultures feed on your mind
Disarmed of all your pride you die
No life in our alien eyes - the blind lead the blind
The sun sets forever on the non-divine
Non-divine

World of lies
Non-divine
Release me
Final psychotic eclipse
Painted in the colours of war
Final psychotic eclipse
A world drenched in blood

Degeneration tears your blackened eyes
The final descent for the last in life
No joy in our tired lives - the torment builds inside
The sun sets forever on a world of lies
World of lies

World of lies
Non-divine
Release me

"And it's his illusions about what
Constitutes the real world which are
Inhibiting him...
His reality, his reason, his society
These are what must be destroyed"

Final psychotic eclipse
Painted in the colours of war
Final psychotic eclipse
A world drenched in blood of the innocentEmbed
