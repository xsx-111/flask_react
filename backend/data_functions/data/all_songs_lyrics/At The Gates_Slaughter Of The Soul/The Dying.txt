The Dying LyricsReality - she feeds off me
Steal my eyes so that i can't see
Blinding me for all eternity
Distorted dreams of our reality
Building walls around our lives
While we're staring, with eyes that deceive
As the eagle dives again
As daylight is torn
Our sins are reborn
Sweet nihilistic angel of war
Distorted dreams of our reality
Crucified, refusing to die
We are staring blind into a void of lies
As the eagle dives again
As daylight is torn
Our sins are reborn
Sweet nihilistic angel of war
Dying reality
Stereotyped insanity
Sweet nihilistic angel of war
Reality - she feeds off me
Steal my eyes so that i can't see
Blinding me for all eternity
As daylight is torn
Our sins are reborn
Sweet nihilistic angel of war
Dying reality
Stereotyped insanity
Sweet nihilistic angel of war
Together with the vermin of deception
Extinction lives and breathes in us
Degeneration - extinction lives and breathes in us
Degeneration
Degeneration
