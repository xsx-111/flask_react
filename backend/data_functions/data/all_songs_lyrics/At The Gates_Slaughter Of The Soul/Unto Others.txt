Unto Others Lyrics
You hold high the banner of self-deceit
En-caged in the dogmas of life, you join the elite

My Judas-window stays shut
Shut forever more
My Judas-window stays shut
Shut forever more

You mock the weak for not giving you their trust
In your world of make believe, where statues turn to dust

My Judas-window stays shut
Shut forever more
My Judas-window stays shut
Shut forever more

You walk through what is me
Stare blind; cannot see
Your thoughts flee to a different land
They are free, but you are bound
Silenced forever, the walls are closing in
The keys to our damnation
Burial, burial within
My Judas-window stays shut
Shut forever more
My Judas-window stays shut
Shut forever moreEmbed
