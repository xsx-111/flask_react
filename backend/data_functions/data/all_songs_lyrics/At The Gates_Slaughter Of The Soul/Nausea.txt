Nausea Lyrics
Release me from your world of lies
I cannot bear this pain
Degenerate machinery
The monsters we create
The monsters we create

Nausea, oh sweet nausea

Genetic barcode hell
Mental genocide
Repulsive human shells
Choke on the fruits of life
Choke on the fruits of life

Nausea, oh sweet nausea

Cold stare, starving eyes
Blinded, tired lives
Release me from this pain
Unknown to man
Nausea, oh sweet nausea

Cold stare, starving eyes
Blinded, tired lives
Release me from this pain
Unknown to man
Unknown to man

"The family structure
Victory over adversity through the family
Mix the god and country
Add the ten hour day
And you had what was needed"Embed
