Under a Serpent Sun Lyrics
Web of corruption
Thick with deceit
The language of destruction
The slaughter of the meek

Under a serpent sun
We shall all live as one

No rest for the wicked
The children of god
The final retribution
The final curtain torn
Within us, the flames of the end
Survival of the fittest
The hunt for the sacred game

Under a serpent sun
We shall all live as one

Children of chaos
Born of holocaust seed
Inherit the addiction
Angels of genocide breed
Within us, the flames of the end
Survival of the fittest
The hunt for the sacred game
Under a serpent sun
We shall all live as one

Sweetfleshed, hellbent creature
Artist of the fevered soul
Heavenly, venomous rapture
Stricken numb by fear I fall
Sweetfleshed, hellbent creature
Artist of the fevered soul
Heavenly, venomous rapture
Stricken numb by fear I fallEmbed
