Need Lyrics
Open me, with your kiss of steel
End my pain - set me free

For we are enslaved
Forever enslaved

Open me, with your kiss of steel
End my pain - set me free
Live only to die some more
Need - killing yourself to live

For we are enslaved
Forever enslaved

Lay your fears to rest
Fears to rest
Let your dreams awake
Dreams awake

For we are enslaved
Forever enslaved
Lay your hate to rest - open meEmbed
