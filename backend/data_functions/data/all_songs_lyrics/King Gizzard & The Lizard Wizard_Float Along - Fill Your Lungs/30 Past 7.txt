30 Past 7 Lyrics
At 30 past 7, you know I could be better
At 30 past 2, I'll get along with you
I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true

That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you

30 past 7, 30 past 2
30 past 7, 30 past 2
30 past 2, 30 past 2
30 past 2, 30 past 2
I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true

That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you, bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you (bite pieces out of you)
Bite pieces, out of you2Embed
