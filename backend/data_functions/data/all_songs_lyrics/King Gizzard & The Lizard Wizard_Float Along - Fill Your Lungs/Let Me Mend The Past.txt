Let Me Mend The Past Lyrics
Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there

Lock's on the door
Surveillance when you enter in the hall
Such a pointless cause
Her cups on my wall
It's hard to be ignored

Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there
Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

Let me mend the past
Let me mend the past
Let this be the last time I ask
Let me mend the past2Embed
