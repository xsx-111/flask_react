Mystery Jack Lyrics
I am my mother's son
And I'll keep doin' 'till the done gets done
I wouldn't steal for free
And I won't see you next to me

'Cause I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up

'Cause I'm a lonely soul
And I've got no friends on this road
And I'm a mystery Jack
The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track

To die, oh, die
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up


I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up2Embed
