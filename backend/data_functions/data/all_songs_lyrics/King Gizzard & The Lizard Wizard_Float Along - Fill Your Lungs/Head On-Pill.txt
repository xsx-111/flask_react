Head On/Pill LyricsPart I: Head On

Just yesterday, I sat across from my legs
They weren't connected to me
And I couldn't see 'cause my eyes weren't in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on

Just yesterday, I held the cup to my lips
Pouring it deep in my throat
Filling up me like a black enemy
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on
Head on
Head on
Part II: Pill
