48 Lyrics
I lost myself when I looked in your eyes
I tried to disguise myself
Fear inside
Fear inside my love
The suffering moved and breathed
Our hands silhouettes
Against the sky
Against the sky our love

Where were you?
Hope to chain this memory
We could have been the last time
Show me the sight of the side of chance
Hold tomorrow one foot in and one foot out
Are you strong enough?
Are you strong enough, pitiful boy?

I lost myself in your embrace
I saw the lie come clear
Fear inside
Fear inside our love
Fallen now run away
Tried to reveal myself
Fear inside
The lights you make

Where were you?
Hope to chain this memory
We could have been the last time
Show me the sight of the side of chance
Hold tomorrow one foot in and one foot out
Are you strong enough?
Are you strong enough, pitiful boy?Embed
