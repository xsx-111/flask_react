Song About an Angel Lyrics
So I say, still awake
Sleep, close my eyes
An image of your face
Traced in white sand
Underneath, undefined
I lay down
Arms outstretched
I embrace the fall
And all the time
I tried to let you know
Discomfort comes clearly

(Whoa X5)
Sometimes, you see right through me
Words
Words

(You're married to that)
(You're married to that)
Although you hit me hard, I come back
(You're married to your pain)
The earth cries
(You're married to that)
When I call
(You're married to that)
On the inside
(You're married to your pain)
Running behind
Which one will I face?
Run behind
Which one will I...?

Thin comfort
In what I say
My back is turned
I halo my soul
For a while
And all the time
I tried
To let you know
Discomfort
Comes clearly
When Iâ€™ll shout


(You're married to that)
(You're married to that)
Although you hit me hard, I come back
(You're married to your pain)
The earth cries
(You're married to that)
When I fall
(You're married to that)
On the inside
(You're married to your pain)
Running behind
Which one will I face?
Run behind
Which one will I...?5Embed
