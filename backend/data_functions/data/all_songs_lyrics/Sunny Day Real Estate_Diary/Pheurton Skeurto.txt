Pheurton Skeurto Lyrics
How will they know just where to find?
Under this bridge I lie down
See how they run catch butterfly
Trip over words with gifts and garage
Pheurton

How will they learn just where to find?
Down on their knees holding hairpiece
See how they flock ten for some grapes
Trip over words with gifts and garage
Pheurton dance

Doo do do do
How will they learn?
How will they know?
How?
How will they know?
How?Embed
