47 Lyrics
Swallow whole
Lose myself in you
Take a chance
Take a chance with me

Poured out in wine
Chance to run away
Take a breath
Take a breath
Same sign

Hair of gold swims through caught in my mind
Painted picture prized jewels on a crown
Poisoned wine I fall to the floor
Caught a glimpse of truth

Swallow whole
Lose myself in you
Take a breath
Take a breath
Same sign
Hair of gold swims through caught in my mind
Painted picture prized jewels on a crown
Poisoned wine I fall to the floor
Caught a glimpse of truth

Hair of gold
Hair of goldEmbed
