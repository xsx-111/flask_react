In Circles Lyrics
Meet me there
In the blue
Where words are not
Feeling remains
Sincerity
Trust in me
Throw myself
Into your door

(Well, I go) In circles (Running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (Running down)
In circles (Running down)

Meet me there
In the blue
Where words are not
Feeling remains
Ooh, I dream
To heal your wounds
But I bleed myself
Well, I bleed myself
(Well, I go) In circles (Running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (Running down)
In circles (Running down)

Circles
In Circles

(Well, I go) In circles (Running down)
In circles (I'm running down)
In circles (Running down)
In circles (Running down)7Embed
