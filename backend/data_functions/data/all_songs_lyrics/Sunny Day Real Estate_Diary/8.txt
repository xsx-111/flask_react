8 LyricsRain Song
So Beautiful My Dear
Overcome
(Hmmmm...)
Rain Song
So Beautiful My Dear
Overcome
Drives Me Crazy
Who Can Decide?
Will I Decide?
Set In Stone To Split The Night
That I Breathe
Put A Word To These
Put A Word To These
This Thin Line Greased
I Can't See
Fingers Stain My Gold
Sweet Clover (3x)
Sweet...
Whose Side You On?
Which Side You On?
Silence Near The Battle Cry
Hollow Victory
Which Lie Do You Want?
Which Lie Do You Want?
When Lines Divide I Walk Away
Blazing Sun Sets On My Back
Sweet Clover (3x)
Sweet...
(I Can't)
Wait
(Despise Them, Inside Them)
Inside Them I Am (3x)
(I Can't)
Wait
(Despise Them, Inside Them)
Inside You
Help Me God
Whose Side You On?
Whose Side You On?
Silence Near The Battle Cry
Hollow Victory
Which Lie Do You Own?
Which Lie Do You Own?
When Lines Divide I Walk Away
Blazing Sun Sets On My Back
Sweet Clover (3x)
Sweet...
(I Can't)
Wait
(Despise Them
Inside Them)Inside Them I Am (3x)
(I Can't)
Wait
(Despise You, Inside You)
(Him!)Inside Him..
Help Me Mighty GodEmbed
