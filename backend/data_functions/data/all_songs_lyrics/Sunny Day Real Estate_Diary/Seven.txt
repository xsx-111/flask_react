Seven Lyrics
Sew it on
Face the fool
December's tragic drive
When time is poetry
And stolen the world outside
The waiting could crush my heart

Sew it on
Face the fool
The tide breaks, a wave of fear
And brave songs disappear
To the secret voice of dawn
This last time raise my eyes

You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
The right words in time
The right words

Sew it on
Face the fool
The mirrors lie, those aren't my eyes
Destroy them, raise my hand
Reflected in savage shards
A new face, a soul reborn
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
You'll taste it, you'll taste it in time
The right words in time
The right words5Embed
