The Blankets Were The Stairs Lyrics
Lost myself
When pain from your
Heart left its trace
In written words
Held like a seam
I have no hand to heal
I can't imagine
Your emotions
Wrapped around

Inferior
Hold that iron
Inferior

My hand to heal
Your wounds won't heal
My longing for your warm embrace
Why can't it see
The thinking to me
My sense of one is open
Time to run
And drink like Astiocles
So sideways

Late again
My breathing is leaving after yours
Stay one time
Holding things I know you're asking for

You're always there
Inferior
My time to let it go
My brother
Hold that iron
Time to collide
Your face is strong
Your eyes want to unfold
Inside of me


Late again
My breathing is leaving after yours
Stay one time
Holding things I know you're asking for
Throw away
For these things can go no longerEmbed
