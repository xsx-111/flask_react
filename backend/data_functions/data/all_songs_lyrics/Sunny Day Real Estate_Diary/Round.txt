Round Lyrics
I feel wrong
(What's wrong with me?)
Falling through you
Bind myself
(What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong?

Made a sign, well
(What's wrong with me?)
What leads to the heart
While my clothes were damp
(What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong?

Round
Round

We go round
(The suffering said we go around)
We go round
(The suffering said we go around)
I go round
(This happens every time we go around)
We go round
(The suffering said we go around)
Round
(The suffering said we go around)
