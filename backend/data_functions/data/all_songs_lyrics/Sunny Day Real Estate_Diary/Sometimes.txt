Sometimes LyricsSometimes I can't lay down my past
Sometimes I'm too blind to see you laughing at me
Although you hit me hard I come back
Some...
Sometimes
You drag me on
No words to explain
Although you threw away my name
From your mind
I have to try
Although my heart is bruised by your words
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes I can't lay down my past
Sometimes I'm too blind to see you laughing at me
Although you hit me hard I come back
Some...
Sometimes
You drag me on
No words to explain
Although you threw away my name
From your mind
I have to try
Although my heart is bruised by your words
Sometimes
Sometimes
Away now
Take me away
Away right wordsEmbed
