9 Lyrics
Shapes of our bodies imprinted there
While our clothes were damp from rain
One time I
Broke my vow

Holding a sign with no meaning
I read between the lines
One time caught in your web
What is even said?

Laid down a bed of sorrow
When hope is an enemy
One time caught in your web
Broken promises

This rainfall
(still lost inside of them)
Runaway
Wait with them, run to me
(you know exactly who you are)
Wait for me, camouflage
(still lost inside of them)
Wait with them, run to me
(you know exactly who you are)
One time I
Broke my vow
We laid a circle of roses
Symbolize what was forever
One time caught in your web
Broken promises
