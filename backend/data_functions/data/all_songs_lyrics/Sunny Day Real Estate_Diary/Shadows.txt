Shadows Lyrics
In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy
In the shadows the name is unknown to me
In the shadows grey crusaders with tails mother made
In the shadows will to become their pride
Why?

In the shadows I climbed mountains for chairs, don't look down
Try this figure out, memorize their words for hope
In the shadows stood up high for all to see
In the shadows counting these numbers down
Down

No one can take away
Leaf falls short
Dream's over
A lie's the same if I may weep

In the shadows buried in me lies a child's toy
Try and figure out, memorize their words for hope
In the shadows stood up high for all to sing it
In the shadows counting these numbers down
Down
No one can take away
Leaf falls short
Dream's over
A Lie's the same if I may weep
