Million Dollar Houses (The Painter) Lyrics
So what if I was just a painter?
Painting houses on the rich blue coast
Would you ever try to leave me
For somebody who deserves you most?
'Cause darling, I am just a painter
I'm painting houses for the rich old folks
I'm gonna make a million dollars
'Cause nobody's gonna steal you, no
For diamonds and gold
For diamonds and gold

'Cause I've broken bones for you
And for you only
I make money, but we just can't keep this home
Give me your heart and your hand
And we can run
We can run, we can run, baby, run now
We can run, baby, run

She's like a bullet through an ocean
I still remember how you moved so slow
You tried to kill me with a shotgun
Bang, now we're even
We don't stop till someone's bleeding
We don't stop till someone's bleeding
I've broken bones for you
And for you only
I make money, but we just can't keep this home
Give me your heart and your hand
Then we can run
We can run, we can run, baby, run now
We can run, baby run, baby, you're my hope

Permanently yours
Sometimes, the moon looks brighter than the sun
As times like this run up my wrists
She hates all of the guts and blood
Splash around with me
While we move like flames on burning sheets
And your doctor won't stop calling me her medication
But, baby no, sometimes things don't work out the way we've planned
To live is just to fall asleep
To die is to awaken

Maybe we're meant to lose the ones we love
But, I'll fight for you till then
And if he stole you from me
On my arm there's a tattoo of your name
I've broken bones for you
And for you only
I make money, but fuck money
We want love
Give me your heart and your hand
And we can run
We can run, we can run, we can run
We can run, we can run, we can run17Embed
