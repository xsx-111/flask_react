The Boy Who Could Fly LyricsFreeze!

It's time to take you home
It feels so early but I promised I would bring you to your door
Now our lips are numb as we walk sharing warm alcohol
That kiss tastes like summer
I hope you like the stars I stole for you
One hundred million twinkle lights in neon blue
I'll be the brightest someday
I'll be the brightest someday
I'll be the brightest you'll see

Don't rain on my parade
It's gonna glow in the dark
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing
A perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon dreams of sun

Now as the rain falls like shattered pieces of glass from the sky
We bleed like water colors and drunken pastels down the stairways
And I ask myself, why do I still pray
When will it end
And who fucking cares
I swear to God I did what I could
I practically begged you
I pretended everything was fine
A soul sacrifice, an American nightmare
I'd rather be dead
Don't rain on my parade
It's gonna glow in the dark
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing
A perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon hears a nightmare in his head

I'll bet you money as you're running to the bathroom
You barely started drinking but your beauty never stopped you
You died in California by the sulfur and the sea
I guess I never should have loved you
But I do forever cause you loved me
And I break my glasses as I fall in the street
If you were gonna leave this world how could it be without me
Now it's all over my tongue and still it has no taste
Cause without you there is no me

There's no me at all
Sometimes love, love dies like
Dies like a
Love dies like a dog, like a dog, like a dog
So why don't we just let this one take care of itself?
Don't rain on my parade
It's gonna glow in the dark
I like it better when you can't keep warm
Don't ruin a perfect thing
A perfect thing
The boy on the blue moon dreams...

Don't rain on my parade oh
I'm losing a perfect thing
A perfect thing
A perfect thing22Embed
