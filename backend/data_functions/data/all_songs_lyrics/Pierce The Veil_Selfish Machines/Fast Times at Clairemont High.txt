Fast Times at Clairemont High Lyrics
I was saving, I was saving, I was saving
I was saving myself for you
I was saving myself for you
I waited my whole life for you
I was saving myself for you

Tonight we'll be throwing a party
Under the sunset we started to drink
A little faster now
The celebration, so many faces
I say the words as the moon painted us blue

I've been saving myself for you
I've been saving myself for you
I waited my whole life for you
'Cause I was saving myself for you
Now brother, bring that beat back

Now hold on, this is innocent blood, all the beach boys look like sharks
Because without you nothing ever mattered
I scream and wave my arms, but you don't understand me
Now as I watch them feed on you, it's over
If I die, you die too
Because I'm saving myself for you
I've been saving myself for you
I waited my whole life for you
'Cause I was saving myself for you
I just wanted one dance with you

And one night under the smoke alarm
Every single door in this house is on fire
So melodramatic, but it turns me on
I close my eyes it feels just like a movie
I'm convinced that we don't make sense
But, I'd kill anyone who gets close

I've been saving myself for you
I've been saving myself for you
The sharpest thing I find for you
'Cause I was saving myself for you
I've been saving myself for you
I saved myself for you (Oh)
Don't you know I'd die for you
I saved myself for you

Without you, what's the point?9Embed
