Ocean Breakup/King of the Universe Lyrics
It's all making me ready
It's all doing what you gotta do
I know "A"
I see my life come shine

Golden sunrise
Tragic daydream
I am so afraid

King of the Universe
Are you King, King of the Earth?

King of the Universe
Are you King, King of the Sky?

King of the Universe
Are you King, King of the Sky?Embed
