Bluebird Is Dead Lyrics
Little darlin' of my life
You keep movin' 'cross my mind
You gave me a sunny day
Now it looks as if I'll pay

Why do they say - Bluebird is dead?
I can still see her, touch her, my Bluebird
The love that she gave, I don't believe
No, no, I don't believe

Bluebird came to me tonight
Waiting patiently for light
She said, "I know that you will grieve
But my darlin', I must leave."

Why do they say - Bluebird is dead?
I can still see her, touch her, my Bluebird
The love that she gave, I don't believe
No, no, I don't believe

Bluebird say it is not so
Please I cannot hear you speak
It must be that you're so tired
In the darkness of the night

Why do they say - Bluebird is dead?
I can still see her, touch her, my Bluebird
The love that she gave, I don't believe
No, no, I don't believe1Embed
