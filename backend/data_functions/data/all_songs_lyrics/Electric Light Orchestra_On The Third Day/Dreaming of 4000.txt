Dreaming of 4000 LyricsSaviour of the night came
Slowly on the silent river
And the lord of life came following
His sins to be forgiven
While the world sat back
And laughed away the hours
Till the dawning of the daybreak
I heard them laugh, I heard them cry
I saw them praying to the sky
I heard the wind howl in the trees
Down there on bended knee
And I see the light
But I know I must be dreaming
Feel the soul, quiet emotion
Sail on by, helpless devotion
If that's how it feels
It better be real
Take care of your woman
Or you'll never ever see the light
Take heed of the warnin'
Or you know, it's gonna be too late
Too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
Here, there, everywhere
They keep on movin' without fear
They look me up, they look me down
They press my body to the ground
But I see the light
See the light, it's comin' shinin'
And on a summer's day
When thoughts are drifting far away
And life is good and real to see
My world is saved and I am free
But in the night
Still I know I must be dreaming
Feel the soul, quiet emotion
Sail on by, helpless devotion
If that's how it feels
It better be real
Take care of your woman
Or you'll never ever see the light
Take heed of the warnin'
Or you know, it's gonna be too late
Too late, ah, oh
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late, it's too lateEmbed
