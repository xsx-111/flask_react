Ma-Ma-Ma Belle Lyrics
Got love, if that's what you need
I got three or four babies sittin' on my knee
I got good love waitin' for you
I come sneakin' 'round the corner of the avenue

You gotta ma-ma-ma belle, or I will get you
You know you gotta ma-ma-ma belle
I will get you

There's one thing that's on my mind
And that's a-gettin' hold of you before I serve my time
I gotta keep on with my heavy load
'til I see you come a-strollin' down that open road

You gotta ma-ma-ma belle before I get you
Don't you know you gotta ma-ma-ma belle, or I will get you
And you're feeling sorrow, ma-ma-ma belle, I will get you
You know it's all about ma-ma-ma belle, I will get you

I love you, ma-ma belle
That's why I wanna get it all well, I'm sure you can tell
I got good soul runnin' so deep
Gonna get you in the corner so that I can keep
Can't you hear me once ma-ma-ma belle, oh, I will get you
You know I want her, ma-ma belle, oh, I will get you, yeah
And you gotta find ma-ma belle, oh, I will get you, yeah
Gotta show 'em that ma-ma-ma belle, oh, I will get you, yeah
You gotta ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma belle
I'm gonna see you down, down, d-down
Gonna see yo ma-ma-ma-ma belle, gonna see you 'round
'round, year-round, down
Gonna see about ma, no, bell, I won't let you down
Get down, get down
Gonna see about ma-ma-ma belleEmbed
