Showdown Lyrics
She cried to the southern wind
'Bout a love that was sure to end
Every dream in her heart was gone
Headin' for a showdown
Bad dreamer, what's your name?
Looks like we're ridin' on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown

And it's rainin' all over the world
It's rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

She came to me like a friend
She blew in on a southern wind
Now my heart is turned to stone again
There's gonna be a showdown
Save me
Oh, save me
It's unreal, the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown

And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night
(Rainin', rainin')
(Rainin', rainin')

Rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
The longest night

And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

You gotta save me, girl
When I'm ready for savin'
I'm a fool for you
You know I need you, child
Come on and save me
Can't you feel what you're doin' to me now?
I'm on the run again
Gotta save your soulEmbed
