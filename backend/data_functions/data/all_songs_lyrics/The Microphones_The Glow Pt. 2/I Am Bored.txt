I Am Bored Lyrics
You tore a hole so deep
My leak poured out torrentially
But now I'm bored
My bloody flow is slowed
So I can be bored near you
Oh, what a loss
It didn't show its head
Until mine was torn and thrown at you
And back it grew
With glassy eyes
Locked in contact on the couch with you
Oh, boring face
We're losing touch
I reached and my extended hand went through

Now we both know what we have to do2Embed
