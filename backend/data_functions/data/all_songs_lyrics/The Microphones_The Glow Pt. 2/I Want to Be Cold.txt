I Want to Be Cold Lyrics
It's raining on me, I don't want it to stop
I don't want to breathe, anymore
Oooh

I want soggy ground, I want to feel my feet in the sand
I want water to rise and to cover all the land
I want to swim until my arms give out and I come to an end
I hope it happens soon, I can't deal with feeling this bad
Oooh

I want to be cold
And I want it to snow so bad

I hope your flames don't grow
I want to be buried in snow
I hope your flames don't grow
I just want to be cold
I don't want you to know
You drew a heart with an arrow and it shot right pastï»¿...7Embed
