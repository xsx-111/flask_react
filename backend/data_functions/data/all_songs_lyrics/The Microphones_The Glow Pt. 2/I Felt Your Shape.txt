I Felt Your Shape Lyrics
I thought I felt your shape but I was wrong
Really all I felt was falsely strong
I held on tight and closed my eyes
It was dumb, I had no sense of your size

It was dumb to hold so tight
Aaah, but last night
On your birthday in the kitchen
My grip was loose, my eyes were open
I felt your shape and heard you breathing
I felt the rise and fall of your chest

I felt your fall, your winter snows
Your gusty blow, your lava flow
I felt it all, your starry night
Your lack of light
With limp arms I can feel most of you
I hung around your neck independently
And my loss was overwhelmed
By this new depth I don't think I ever felt
But I don't know, my nights are cold
And I remember warmth
I could have sworn I wasn't alone26Embed
