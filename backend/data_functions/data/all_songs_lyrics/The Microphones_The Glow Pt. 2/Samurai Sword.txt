Samurai Sword Lyrics
You're a bear foraging for a kill
Your massive paws press down the snow
I've got bare feet
Touching bark right above you silently
I lower down my icy stare, you smell the air
I've got a samurai sword meant for you, polar bear
I've got a grizzly look in my eye
You aim to drag me back down underground to gorge
You want my blood all over your face
But I'm plummeting through branches towards you now
Feeling still, samurai Phil5Embed
