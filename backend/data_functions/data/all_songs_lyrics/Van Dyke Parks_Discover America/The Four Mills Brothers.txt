The Four Mills Brothers LyricsAmong the singers on the moving screen
The negroes are the best ever heard or seen
Among the singers on the moving screen
The negroes are best ever heard or seen
Morton Downey went to a singing school
But the four Mills brothers are sweet and cool
And I ain't got nobody, nobody cares for me. Nobody cares
For those of you have seen "The Big Broadcast"
Cab Calloway was unsurpassed
From mystery pictures Bela Lugosi
And relax with Mr.Crosby
Mae West, of course, is a fair piece singer
I still prefer to hear the Four Mills Brothers in
"I ain't got nobody, nobody cares for me. Nobody cares"Embed
