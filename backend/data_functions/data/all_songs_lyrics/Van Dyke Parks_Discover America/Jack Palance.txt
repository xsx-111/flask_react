Jack Palance LyricsWell, I'm looking for youth
Not experience
Drinking in the nightclub
With my bosom friend
Who come down to spend the weekend
When I look back, who you think I see
But one of my family
"Good heavens!" I shout
"Mama Jacob, what the France
You doing in a night club?"
Same time the rock and roll start to play
She hold onto a Yankee and break away
I'll tell you, but if you see my woman
Brother, she more than sixty
And I'm sure, without any doubt
She could be my granny
Still, she walkin' bold at night
With she face like Jack Palance
Go to France!
Step aside and give the Sparrow a chance
You know I'm looking for youth
Not experienceEmbed
