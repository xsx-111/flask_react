FDR in Trinidad LyricsWhen Roosevelt came to the Land of the Hummingbird
Shouts of welcome were heard
"Hummingbird, Hummingbird, Hummingbird"
His visit to their island is bound to be
An epoch in local history
Definitely marking the new era
Between Trinidad and America
We understand that the president had just been
On a visit to Brazil and the Argentine
With Mr. Cordell Hull in attendance
There they took part in a peace conference
Struck by his modest style
We were intrigued by the famous Roosevelt smile
In fact everybody was glad
To welcome Roosevelt to Trinidad
We were privileged to see the democratic
President of the great republic
With his charm and his genial personality
And his wonderful urbanity
To stop war and atrocity
And make the world safe for democracy
The greatest event of the century
In the interest of suffering humanity
Port of Spain threw open her gates
To the President of the United States
In fact everybody was glad
To welcome Roosevelt to TrinidadEmbed
