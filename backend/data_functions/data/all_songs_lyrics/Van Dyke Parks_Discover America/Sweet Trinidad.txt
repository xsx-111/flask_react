Sweet Trinidad LyricsSweet Trinidad, sweet sweet Trinidad
Darling keep the home fires burning
Use gas, don't burn any wood
Well, I've traveled the USA from north to south
I didn't meet a single girl to shout about
They worked me very hard but they paid me good
I put on a little weight eating Yankee food
From Miami to New York to Los Angeles
Wherever I play the people mighty pleased
Yankee dollar real appeals to me
Never forget sweet "la Trinity"
I'll remember
Sweet Trinidad, sweet sweet Trinidad
Darling, keep your home fires burning
Use gas, don't burn any woodEmbed
