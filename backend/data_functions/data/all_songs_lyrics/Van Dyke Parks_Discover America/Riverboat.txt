Riverboat LyricsBig wheel just a keep on turning
And the fire just a keep on burning
Big boat just a keep on rocking
Opportunity just keep on knocking
Time dies tryin' to fly by
Gotta grain of love in my eye
On land they're fighting man to man
Tryin' to beat each other if they can
Riverboat just a keep on chuggin'
We just keep right on huggin'
We got love yes we have we got love
Rain just a keep on pouring
Love just a keep on growing
Opportunity knocking
Big boat just a keep a rocking
Riverboat just keep on chugging, listen
We just keep a right on huggin' and kissin'
We got love yes we have we got love
Big wheel just a keep on turning
And the fire just a keep on burning
Big boat just keep on rocking
Opportunity just keep on knocking
Riverboat keep on chuggin' listen
We just keep right on huggin' and kissin'
We got love yes we have we got loveEmbed
