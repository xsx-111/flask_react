Steelband Music LyricsWe have captains like Filo James and Ellie Manette
Arthur Byer, Neville Jules and Junior Pouchette
Kenrick George, David Edwards I must mention
Anthony Williams and Michigan
They are giants musically
And their names ought to go down in history
The steelband music is really sweet
You get that rhythm in every beat
The steel the grater and the oil drum
Will make you jump up and make you hum
As it fades off gradually
The music remains in your memory
(Your memory)
The dominant chord from the guitar man
The prominent notes on the tenor pan
Music in the place
But it's hell to keep up the pace with the bass
(Keep up the pace with the bass)
The dominant chord from the guitar man
The prominent notes on the tenor pan
(Keep up the pace with the bass)Embed
