Bing Crosby LyricsOf all the world's famous singers I have ever seen
On the movie screen
Of all the world's famous singers I have ever seen
On the movie screen
Lawrence Tibbett and Nelson Eddie
Donald Nobis and Morton Downey
Kenny Baker and Rudy Vallee
But the crooning prodigy is Bing Crosby
Bing has a way of singing with his very heart and soul
Which captivates the world
His millions of listeners never fail to rejoice
At his golden voice
They love to hear his "La Di Dah Di dah"
So sweetly with such harmony
Thrilling the world with his melody
I wonder if you heard him singing the song
"May I Be the One to Say I"
I wonder if you heard again
"Everytime It Rains It Rains Pennies from Heaven"
But "Love Thy Neighbor" was a most thrilling song
And "Git Along Little Dogie Git Along"
Unanimously three cheers for
Mr. Bing CrosbyEmbed
