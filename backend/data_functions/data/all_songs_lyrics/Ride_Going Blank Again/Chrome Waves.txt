Chrome Waves Lyrics

One hundred years from now
See the chrome, can't hear it move
I'll meet you on the way down
Wrapped around somebody's hand

(Ah, ah) We've all moved on from here
(Ah, ah) The colour's running dry
(Ah, ah) A drowsy line of wasted time
(Ah, ah) Bathes my open mind


This strange machinery
Is keeping you from seeing me
I'll meet you on the way down
Can't stay, unbearable to go

(Ah, ah) We've all moved on from here
(Ah, ah) The colour's running dry
(Ah, ah) A drowsy line of wasted time
(Ah, ah) Bathes my open mind

Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
