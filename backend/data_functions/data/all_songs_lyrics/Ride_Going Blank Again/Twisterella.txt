Twisterella Lyrics
Any minute she will feel the chemistry
Vibrations in her brain can't ever be explained
Slip away and out of sight, feel the magnets of the night
The circus that you see is where you have to be

If I've seen it all before
Why's this bus taking me back again?
If I don't need anymore
Why's this bus taking me back again?

Feel the weight letting go
Feel more lightness than you've ever known
You can't see when light's so strong
You can't see when light is gone


If I've seen it all before
Why's this bus taking me back again?
If I don't need anymore
Why's this bus taking me back again?
"Look at Twisterella, she hasn't got a fella"Embed
