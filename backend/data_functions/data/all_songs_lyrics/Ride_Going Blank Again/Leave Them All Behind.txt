Leave Them All Behind Lyrics


Wheels turning around into alien grounds
Pass through different times, leave them all behind

Leave them all behind, leave them all behind
Leave them all behind, leave them all behind


Just to see we've got so far to go
Until we get there, just let it flow

Just let it flow, just let it flow
Just let it flow, just let it flow
Just let it flow, just let it flow
Just let it flow, just let it flow
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

Colours shining clear fading into night
Our grasp is broken, there's nothing we can do


I don't care about the colours
I don't care about the light
I don't care about the truth
I don't care about the truth
