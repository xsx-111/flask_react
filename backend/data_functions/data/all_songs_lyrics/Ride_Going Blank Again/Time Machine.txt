Time Machine LyricsWaste no more energy, no more time
Step into the time machine aboard this flight
Time to go, it's sad that you're not here
To open up your eyes and watch me dissapear
Carried away, imaginations are running wild
Losing control, I'm landing back in this year
Did I ever move? Did I dissapear?
If I could move through time
I'd go back and put it right
Carried away, imaginations are running wildEmbed
