Making Judy Smile LyricsThere's a picture on the door, madman smiling from the floor
It's a good day for a drive if you think you will survive
Just my way of saying hi 'cause I knew I wouldn't write
And the seat will fit one more, so there's room enough for four
Your words they flatter me, you fill my head with tea
Please let me take it one more mile
The galaxy may burn if I can't make it turn
I hope I'm making Judy smile
I hope I'm making Judy smileEmbed
