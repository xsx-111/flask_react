Mouse Trap Lyrics

Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Running away, you're lost for words again
Now you've got all what you wanted, are you really satisfied?
Tricky scenes, tricky little dreams
The earth spins, my head spins me back round to you


Ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah-ahEmbed
