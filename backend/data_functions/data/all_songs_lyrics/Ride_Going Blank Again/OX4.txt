OX4 LyricsNever been so far away
I don't think I want to stay in this room anymore
If I crawl across the floor
Then I'd be closer to that door, but it's too far
Never been so far away
Just lost the last thought in my head, what happens now?
Some fantasy you've been
Pick up the pieces in my mind, I'm going...
...I'm going home...1Embed
