Cool Your Boots Lyrics"Even a stopped clock gives the right time twice a day."

Across 50 states of mind, I didn't feel inclined
You waited yesterday, I didn't come your way
Now time is moving on, I know it won't be long
'Til I'm shuffling away with nothing more to say


When I'm printed on your wall, my face won't change at all
The smile beneath my hair hangs lifeless in the air
Like a net in water I'm running through it all
And I'm shuffling away with nothing more to say



It's been preying on my mind and now I'm just resigned
You smile for yesterday, I think I'm in the way
You seem concerned and say I should slow down
But how can I see the stars if my feet are on the ground?
