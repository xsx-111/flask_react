Meadow Meal LyricsMe is a meadow meal
And the guess I get it
And the gate I get it
And the game I get it
A wonderful wooden reason
To stand in line keep in line
Line up
Crash the sound
You lose your hand
To understand
The accident is red
You are a fruit fork
And the money you look up
And the madame you look up
And the middle you look up
A wonderful wooden reason
To stand in line keep in line
Line up
Crash the sound
You lose your hand
To understand
The accident is red
Me is a meadow meal
And the guess I get it
And the gate I get it
And the game I get it
A wonderful wooden reason
To stand in line keep in line
Line up
Crash the sound
You lose your hand
To understand
The accident is redEmbed
