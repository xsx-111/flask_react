N-ER-GEE (Crisis Blues) Lyrics
Uh, it's Christmas, but, but there ain't nobody raisin' much of a fuss
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss
Nobody but me
Haw, haw, haw, haw, haw, haw

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Nobody can do the shing-a-ling like I do
Nobody can do the skate like I do
Nobody can do the boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo

The, the, the end of the rainbow is a, speedin' up news
But the, the, the knot in the, the fuse is the speed that, that you lose?
