Spotted Pinto Bean Lyrics
Spotted Pinto Bean is leaving
Leaving on a midnight streaming
Tears behind him all the way
(Yes, tears behind him all the way)
All the way the arms are folding
Handkerchiefs to pockets holding
Holding yesterday
(Just holding yesterday)


Spotted Pinto Bean is leaving
Leaving on a midnight streaming
Tears behind him all the way
And all the way the arms are folding
Handkerchiefs to pockets holding
Holding yesterday, ohhhEmbed
