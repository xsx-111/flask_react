Guylum Bardot Lyrics
The love that we've been through
Was splintered and sent to
The end of the rainbow today
Now that its over
The grass and the clover
Grow over the ground where I lay
Come back Petonia
Come back I say
I'm hopin' soon you'll
Be with me to stayCome back Petonia
Come back Petonia
Come back I pray
I'm hopin' soon you'll
Be with me to stayEmbed
