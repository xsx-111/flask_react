Boots Lyrics
Boots are made for walkin'
That's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over you
Walk all over you, walk all over youEmbed
