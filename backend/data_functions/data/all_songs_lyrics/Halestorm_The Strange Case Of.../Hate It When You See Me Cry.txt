Hate It When You See Me Cry Lyrics
I hate it when you see me cry
Your t-shirt soaked through from my eyes
When I'm not as tough as I should be
And you see the softest part of me
I hate it when you see me cry (Yeah, yeah)
I hate it when you see me cry (Yeah, yeah)

I hate it when I let you down
When your smile turns around
And I know I'm supposed to be the one that says
"Babe count on me"
I hate it when I let you down

Oh, oh I'm your rock n' roll Joan of Arc
The queen of broken hearts
I'm here to save the world, but who will save supergirl?
What if I'm weak and I need you tonight?
I hate it, I hate it when you see me cry (Yeah Yeah)

I hate that I need you now
To hold my hair, to hear me out
If I wake up on the bathroom floor
Will you still want me in the morning?
Oh babe, I need you now
Oh, oh I'm your rock n' roll Joan of Arc
The queen of broken hearts
I'm here to save the world, but who will save supergirl?
What if I'm weak and I need you tonight?
I hate it, I hate it when you see me cry

I'm your rock n' roll Joan of Arc
The queen of broken hearts
I'm here to save the world, but who will save supergirl?
What if I'm weak and I need you tonight?
I hate it, I hate it when you see me cry (Yeah, yeah)
I hate it when you see me cry (Yeah, yeah)
I hate it when you see me cryEmbed
