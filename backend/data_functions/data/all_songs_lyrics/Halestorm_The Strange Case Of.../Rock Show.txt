Rock Show Lyrics
Little girl
You like it loud
Come alive in the middle of a crowd
You wanna scream
You wanna shout
Get excited when the lights go down

At the rock show
You'll be right in the front row
Heart and soul, they both know
It’s where you gotta be

Little girl, there you are
All the lighters looking just like stars
Sing along, feel the sound
Take a ride on the hands of the crowd
And here it comes, the moment when
You know you’ll never be the same again
Power chord, see the light
You found your place in the world tonight

At the rock show
You'll be right in the front row
Heart and soul, they both know
It's where you gotta be
Yeah, at the rock show
Getting high on the solo
So what if it’s crazy?
That's gonna be me
This goes out to anyone
Whose heart beats like a kick drum
When a bitchin' riff comes
Knows the words to every line, every time
And you know you gotta go get some, get pumped
Find yourself and lose it

At the rock show
I'm looking at the front row
Heart and soul, we both know
It's where we gotta be
Yeah at the rock show
We're reaching for the high notes
So what if we're crazy?
You're coming with me
You're coming with me
You're coming with me
So what if it’s crazy?
It’s where we gotta be
