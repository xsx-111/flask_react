Daughters of Darkness Lyrics
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

We came to battle baby
We came to win the war
We won’t surrender till we
Get what we're looking for
We're blowing out our speakers
There goes the neighborhood
A little scissor happy
Little misunderstood

We can turn you on
Or we will turn on you

Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil, goes a long, long way
We stand together
No, we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

We're all survivors somehow
We just broke out the pack
And I don't need no dogtag
My name is on my back

We can turn you on
Or we can turn on you

Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil, goes a long, long way
We stand together
No, we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Never down, never out
Playing hard, living loud
Keeping up with the boys
Making out, making noise
And you better get me home
Before the sun comes up, up, up

Daughters of darkness
Sisters insane
A little evil goes a long, long way
We stand together
No, we're not afraid
We'll live forever
Daughters of darkness
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

We’re the daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Daughters of darkness
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-naEmbed
