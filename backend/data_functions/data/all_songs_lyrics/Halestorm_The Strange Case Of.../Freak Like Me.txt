Freak Like Me Lyrics
I’m on the train that’s pullin' the sick and twisted
Makin' the most of the ride before we get arrested
We’re all wasted
And we’re not going home tonight

Covered in black we lack the social graces
Just like an animal, we crawl out of our cages
They can’t tame us
So if you’re one of us, get on the bus

If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out
So shout if you’re a freak like me
You were born to burn
This ain't no disease, you don’t need a cure
It’s our time now to come out
If you’re a freak like me
If you’re a freak like me
We’re underground, but we will not surrender
We’re gonna give them something to remember, yeah
So write your name in gasoline
And set that shit on fire

If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out
So shout if you’re a freak like me
Don’t apologize
They can’t hold you down
You were born to rise
It’s our time now to come out

If you’re a freak like me (Hey, hey)
If you’re a freak like me (Hey, hey)
Are you a freak like me? (Hey, hey)
Are you a freak, like me?

If you’re a freak like me
Wave your flag
If you’re a freak like me
Get off your ass
It’s our time now
To let it all hang out
So shout if you’re a freak like me
Don’t apologize
They can’t hold you down
You were born to rise
It’s our time now to come out
If you’re a freak like me
(If you're a freak)
(If you're a freak like me)
If you’re a freak like me
(If you're a freak)
If you’re a freak like me
(If you're a freak like me)
If you’re a freak like me
If you’re a freak like me8Embed
