Beautiful With You Lyrics
I stare at the girl in the mirror
T-shirt, torn up jeans, no beauty queen
But the way that you see me
You get underneath me
And all my defenses just fall away
Fall away

I am beautiful with you
Even in the darkest part of me
I am beautiful with you
Make it feel the way it's supposed to be
You're here with me
Just show me this and I'll believe
I am beautiful with you

I stand naked before you now
No walls to hide behind
So here am I, see all of my scars
Still here you are
I bare my soul and I'm not afraid
Not afraid

I am beautiful with you
Even in the darkest part of me
I am beautiful with you
Make it feel the way it's supposed to be
You're here with me
Just show me this and I'll believe
I am beautiful with you
I've been the strong one for so long
But, I was wrong
Doesn't make you weak if you needed someone
I'm not holding back and I know what I want

I am beautiful with you
I am beautiful with you

You want me for myself
You get me like no one else
I am beautiful with you (With you)
I am beautiful with you
Even in the darkest part of me
I am beautiful with you
Make it feel the way it's supposed to be
You're here with me
Just show me this and I'll believe
That I am beautiful with you1Embed
