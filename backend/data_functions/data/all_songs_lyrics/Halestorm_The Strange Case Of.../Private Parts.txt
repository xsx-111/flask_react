Private Parts Lyrics
Baby forgive me did I do something wrong?
I don't wanna talk, can't we just let it go?
What could be so bad that you'd leave me hanging on?
I'm not doing time, this is not the scene of a crime
I lay in bed at night, contemplating
Why the hell you gotta keep me waiting?

Every time I try to get a little closer
You shut down and the conversation's over
I'm right here, but you leave me in the dark
Show me your private parts
Give it up baby, what are you afraid of?
Love sucks when you don't know what it's made of
We get naked but I can't undress your heart
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts

I can't remember the last time that this felt real
I would've cut you out, if I didn't love you
And how can you blame me for feeling the way I feel?
I'm not blaming you, I'm just trying to figure it out
I can take a little hesitating, I'll wait forever if it's worth the waiting
Every time I try to get a little closer
You shut down and the conversation's over
I'm right here, but you leave me in the dark
Show me your private parts
Give it up baby, what are you afraid of?
Love sucks when you don't know what it's made of
We get naked but I can't undress your heart
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts

They say that silence is gold, but I think that's a lie
You think I already know, but I can't read your mind

Baby forgive me did I do something wrong?
I don't wanna talk
Show me your private parts

Every time I try to get a little closer
You shut down and the conversation's over
I'm right here, but you leave me in the dark
Show me your private parts
Give it up baby, what are you afraid of?
Love sucks when you don't know what it's made of
We get naked but I can't undress your heart
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts
Show me your private parts, show me your private parts
Your private parts, show me your private partsEmbed
