American Boys Lyrics
Friday night boys and their PBR
Chasing Jack, getting wrecked in small town bars
Big city roller in NYC
You're a sharp dressed man just like ZZ
Harley riding biker in a leather jacket
Like riding bitch
You're sitting on the back, yeah
Pretty boys at the university
Watching them walk
In their Levi jeans

Yeah, yeah
I can't help but fall
Yeah, yeah
God bless 'em all

American boys
Gotta love 'em, gotta need 'em
Gotta want 'em, they're my drug of choice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
American boys
Wanna slay 'em, wanna lay 'em
Wanna play 'em, they're my favorite toys
American, American boys
Metalhead boys in the back of a Camaro
Banging to Metallica on the radio
From an all-star stud to a punk like you
We've got so many flavors that I just can't choose

Yeah, yeah
They rock the world
Yeah, yeah
Of this American girl

American boys
Gotta love 'em, gotta need 'em
Gotta want 'em, they're my drug of choice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
American boys
Wanna slay 'em, wanna lay 'em
Wanna play 'em, they're my favorite toys
American, American boys

I've been everywhere
And nothing compares
(American boys)
Ain't nothing like 'em
Rock me like 'em
(American boys)
Come on, make your move
Yeah, yeah
Do what you do

American boys
Gotta love 'em, gotta need 'em
Gotta want 'em, they're my drug of choice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
American boys
Wanna slay 'em, wanna lay 'em
Wanna play 'em, they're my favorite toys
American boys

American boys
Gotta love 'em, gotta need 'em
Gotta want 'em, they're my favorite toys
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
American boys
Wanna slay 'em, wanna lay 'em
Wanna play 'em, they're my favorite toys
American, American boys
