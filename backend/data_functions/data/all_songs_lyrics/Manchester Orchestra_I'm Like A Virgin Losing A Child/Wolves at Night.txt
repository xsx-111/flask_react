Wolves at Night Lyrics
I could have sworn that I saw you knee bent on the bedside
Arms stretched like a kite that time will eventually grow
I'm so sure of it
And I've got a reason, too long, for songs
That tells why your legs and arms are actually able

'Cause I confide in wolves at night

Well have you seen my baby girl?
She's lonely, yeah


I've got to ca-ca-ca-crucify myself if I am gonna believe you
I've got to promise that I'll finish all the things
I said I'd do to begin with too
I've got to ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-make my bed
If I am gonna lay with you
'Cause a disaster's a disaster no matter what Christian language you drag it through

'Cause I confide in wolves at night
Well have you seen my baby girl?
She's lonely, so lonely
'Cause I confide in wolves at night
I'm like a virgin losing a child
So lonely, so lonely, yeah


I swear I did what I could for your rights
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try nothing, try something, try anything
I swear I did what I could for your rights
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try something, for nothing, for something
Something
Bah, bah, bah dah, bah bah
Bah, bah, bah dah, bah bah
Bah, bah, bah dah, bah bah
I swear I did what I could for your rights
You swear you did what you could for my eyes
And I'll try something, try nothing, try anythingEmbed
