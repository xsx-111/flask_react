Sleeper 1972 LyricsWhen my dad died
The worms ate out both his eyes
His soul flew right up in the sky
I cried myself to sleep
My mother lies
Alone on her back at night
Adding up hours till her demise
She counts herself to sleep
When my sister finds
My body closed up like the blinds
I tell her I promise, it's fine
But she cries herself to sleep
The men in black ties
Arrive at the house in surprise
To find a little girl by your side
In the wood box where you're sleeping
I still see you
Inside of this god-awful house
You move awfully quiet now
And I still feel you everywhere
You told me
This has always been worth living
But what's really worth
Living anymore?Embed
