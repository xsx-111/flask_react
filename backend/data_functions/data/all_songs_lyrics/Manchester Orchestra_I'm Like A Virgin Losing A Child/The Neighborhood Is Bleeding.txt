The Neighborhood Is Bleeding LyricsI heard the neighborhood was bleeding
Pressed shirts and raincoats for the cause
5,000 terminated papers
Can you read them, if you're sleeping?
'Cause formulas are for nothing, if I can barely get to sleep
Well I can be lonely if she's happy, after all
I heard that I was close to dying
IVs and dirty drips for the cause
5,000 termination papers
Can you read them? I can see them
'Cause diagnostics are nothing, can you figure out a cure for me
That can finally set me free, after all
I'll find a way out
I'll find a way out
I'll find a way out of here
Do you believe me?
Just watch me
'Cause pillowcases are something, for when reality gets obscene
I'm filling feathers around my teeth, after all
Are stars still dying for nothing? It isn't fair but it's reality
I need a miracle in my veins, after allEmbed
