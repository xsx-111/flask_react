I Can Barely Breathe LyricsWhen the dark flood came
We wrapped ourselves inside a dirty blanket
Citing different opinions
On whether we should move
When the houses came
They ate up everyone like they were fishes
Saying, "Come on, come on
It's the end of the world"
And then I saw your face
You're turnin' skin into a dirty secret
I watched the beauties, watched the fire
And the fire burn the beauty in their eyes
When I took the blame
We laid in ruins tryin' to quote your phrase
We're yelling, "Someone's got the answers
But I'd rather think there's nothing to be found"
If you knew I was dying would it change you?
If you knew I was dying would it change?
If you knew I was dying would it change you?
If you knew I was dying would it change anything?
So when you see me falling backwards
Down the wall that says, I'm still alive
Don't be cautious when I'm cautiously
Approachin' on the other side
Ya everybody has their reasons
That's the reason we're all gonna die
Because if seein' is believin'
Then believe that we have lost our eyes
'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
'Cause when I fly solo I fly so high
I fly so high, don't touch me now
We all deserve
We all deserve something1Embed
