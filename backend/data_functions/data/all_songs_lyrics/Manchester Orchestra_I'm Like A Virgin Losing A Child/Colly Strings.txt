Colly Strings LyricsTake a leaf of paper and draw your mind
Your bourbon brown that can burn my eyes
I lost your presence underneath the bridge
Unlock the door, let's talk it out
Against the wall, hands on my mouth
Could this be it, is it really over now?
You wore a pink t-shirt and khaki pants
You played your songs and you danced your dance
I unwrapped your presents underneath your feet
Nine to eleven you're getting weak
The tile is cold, I can barely speak
And I think she's gone, but I'll be sure for safety's keeping
If you say no, then no it will be
I'll stick it at our skin, pierced with colly strings
Just play it cool yeah, and try to avoid being seen
I'll stick it at our skin, pierced for nothing
Well yeah I saw inside the mirror and your smoking gun
Along in the sign, the hours, the subscribing one by one
And I fell so fast in Seth Ottâ€™s bedroom
You said you saw it coming but you didn't see nothing
Your eyes are on the living room your eyes are on the closet
Don't worry about, don't worry about anything
A pity invitation to an awkward house
For pseudo-boy that would rather wear a blouse
I sincerely saw your skin for the very first time
My curly hair and a voting booth
Confessingly, this is the first time I've loved you
And God I mean it, God I mean it, I hope that I mean it
'Cause like dying young, idols got the best of me
Well don't stop calling, you're the reason I love losing sleep
And the building collapse, we're so shop worn
We're shop worn for something
I'll stick it at our skin, pierced for something
Besides, don't release me until it's over
And besides, you can't believe without bleeding
And besides, you can't believe without bleeding3Embed
