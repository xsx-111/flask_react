Alice and Interiors LyricsWell I swear I tried again, you're never visible on the weekdays
When I need you to do what you can't afford to do
You better watch your tone. You're not invincible you know
I'll do what I gotta do to stop the sound coming
Cause the truth is you're probably not as bad as I make you out to be
To the boys and the girls, that will listen closely. No
I'm the one that is happy. You can write the coolest songs
I was wrong. Yeah I'm always wrong
And my God what have we got here?
I've been trying hard and you've been dying hard for years now
Well I swear I did it all
I'll always be my best flaw
Please just pick up the phone
Am I invincible? You know
I'll do what I've gotta do to stop the sound coming
Cause the truth is you're probably not as bad as I thought that you were being
To the boys and myself, we're just tired of listening. No
I'm the one that is sorry. Help me write the coolest songs
You were wrong. Yeah you're always wrong
Cause the truth is that no one, truly knows what the hell it is you're doing
When we ask are you dead or are you just sleeping. Oh yeah
I'm the one that is happy. I don't like your shitty songs
You were wrong, yeah you're always wrongEmbed
