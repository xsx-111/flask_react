I Can Feel Your Pain LyricsWell I watched your black tied family
Rise up from graves near cemeteries
That I have not been to since your goodbye
And I drank another simile
And compared your Jesus to a thief
He took my bones and turned them into bread
'Cause I can feel your pain
In my bones, in my bones
I was scared to call your mother
For news that you weren't getting better
My God, just what the hell am I supposed to do?
And I ran off and ran on to something
That I swore was everything but beautiful
I only say that word for you
'Cause I can feel your pain
In my bones, in my bones
And I can feel your pain
Deep in my bones, deep in my bones
And hallelujah to the one in our bones
And hallelujah to the one that we loveEmbed
