Jamelia LyricsIf I can't be a man
Tell me what I am
Tell me what I'm here for?
If I can't be the one
Tell her what I've done
What good can I be for?
Did I not do enough
To save the two of us
What more could I give her?
What more could I do
To see her point of view
Why can't I believe her?
You got to make the change
I can't take you no more
These things you know
Do go, oh, ohh
Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away
You can't come
Oh, oh
Sometimes I think they say
I can't take it no more
They think you've gone to far ...
Oh, Jamelia
You got to to go away
You can't come
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
