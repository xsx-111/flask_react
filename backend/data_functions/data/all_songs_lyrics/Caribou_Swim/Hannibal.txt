Hannibal LyricsShe's had four since he last saw her
But she keeps it to herself
He wonders how he's gonna tell her
He wishes he was seeing someone else
He won't tell, but he still needs her
That it helps him go around
When he gets home, the house feels empty
From the bed, from the bedroom to the ground
Sometimes when she goes out
Sometimes she goes, when she goes
She knows, sometimes she goes out
She said she grows old when she goesEmbed
