Odessa Lyrics
Taking it slow, saving up, she
Before she knows it, all I ask before she goes home
She's tired of crying and sick of his lies
She's suffered him for far too many years of her life
Feeling low and scared that he'll say
Do you know how, over time, you drove her away?
Saving up for the day when she goes
The day that she stands up for everything that she chose

She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say
Saving up for the day when she goes
The day that she stands up for everything that she chose
Taking the kids and driving away
Turn around the life she let him siphon away
And I've been with you for all of these years
Tell you what I've got to show for all of my tears
The times you hurt me and treated me wrong
Something had to give to stop this thing from going on

She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say


She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say
She's tired of crying and sick of his lies
She's suffered him for far too many years of her life
And feeling low and scared that he'll say
Do you know how, over time, you drove her away?7Embed
