Kaili Lyrics
She can hold onto her own
If it comes to push and shove
She has kept a lookout on
Over what's left of their love
And he keeps himself held back
For both their peace of minds
But he's no less quick to her
To begrudge of what he finds

Ooh, see I should soon

As they watch themselves grow old
As he helps her into bed
Just a hint of it survives
Just a spark inside his head

Oh, I couldn't tell
How much all they seemed to care
And something in the way she tells me
I wish that I'd been goneEmbed
