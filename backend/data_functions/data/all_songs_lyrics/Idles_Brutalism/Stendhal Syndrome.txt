Stendhal Syndrome Lyrics
Did you see that painting what Rothko did?
Looks like it was painted by a two year old kid

Hot air
Hot air

Ignorance is bliss, yeah?
Well I’m not pleased
Because you spread your opinion like a wretched disease

Hot air
Hot air

Did you see that photo what Billingham took?
He needs to take a leaf out the screensaver book

Hot air
Hot air

If all photos were as you wanted them to be
There would be page three as far as the eye could see
Hot air
Hot air

Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love
Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love

Did you see that selfie what Francis Bacon did?
Don’t look nothing like him, what a fucking div

Hot air
Hot air

Did you see that pink thing what Basquiat done?
Looks like it was drawn by my four year-old son

Hot air
Hot air
Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love
Forgive me you sound stupid
Here lies the one I love

Here he is somehow
Oh, here he is somehow
Hey!Embed
