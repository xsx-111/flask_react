Date Night Lyrics
Date night
Date night

Patience
I've got no goddamn patience
But I tried to shake, shake, shake it up
But I shook myself to boredom
Best friend
I do not like your best friend
And all those shades of grey, ah
They turn my blood so cold, cold, cold, cold

When it comes around
We barely scream or shout
Or rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I, I, I, I, I guess we
Was born to fail
I, I, I, I, I guess we
Was born to fail
No, no, no, you don't
Not a-fucking-gain
With your rhyme and your reason
And your cause
Shepherd?
You want to be a shepherd?
Well, good for you
Go ahead, your life won't be so tepid

But when it comes around
We barely scream or shout
And rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I, I, I, I, I guess we
Was born to fail
I, I, I, I, I guess we
Was born to fail

Whoo
Yak, yak, heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black
Yak, yak, heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black
I, I, I, I, I never lie easy
Work with a migrant crew
I work in a menagerie
I don't give a fuck about me or you
'Cause I'm so cold
I'm so cold
I'm so cold
I'm so cold
'Cause I, I, I, I, I guess we
Was born to fail
I, I, I, I, I guess we
Was born to fail

I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Yes, no
Yes, no
Yes, no2Embed
