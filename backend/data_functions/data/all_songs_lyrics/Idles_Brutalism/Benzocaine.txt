Benzocaine Lyrics
Oh Benzocaine

I think it’s a crime
That when you look in your baby’s eyes
You won’t see mine
You won’t see mine

The memories will stay
The brain will start to fade
Boredom creeps in jade
With God on Benzocaine

Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine

Chalk white
Gobshite
Bleeding gums
I thought the Benzocaine was supposed to numb
Supposed to numb
Supposed to numb
Supposed to numb
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine
Oh Benzocaine1Embed
