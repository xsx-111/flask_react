Heel / Heal LyricsI want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum
I'm done
I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum
I'm done
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I'm done
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum
I'm done
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I'm fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum
Ah
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
Ah
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I want to move into a Bovis home
And make a list of everything I own
And ride into the amber setting sun
Marching to the beat of someone's drum
I'm done
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
What fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
I'm fun
(I'm not saying I'm not like you)
(I'm just saying I don't like you)
