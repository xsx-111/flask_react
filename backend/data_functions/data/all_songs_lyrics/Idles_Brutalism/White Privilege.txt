White Privilege Lyrics
How many optimists does it take to change a lightbulb?
None!
Their butler changes the lightbulb

Always poor
Never bored

The S.L.C. want Timmy’s student loan back
He’d happily oblige but he’s used it all on gak

Always poor
Never bored

One miscarriage
Two abortions
One degree
Seven jobs
Sally danced her socks off as Jesus sobbed

Always poor
Never bored
I could’ve danced with another
'Cause she passed out on your stairs

Always poor
Never bored

Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing
Compensate with humour
Or if really bored then sing

Always poor
Never bored

Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing batter, batter, batter
Swing
Compensate with humour
Or if really bored then sing

Always poor
Never bored
