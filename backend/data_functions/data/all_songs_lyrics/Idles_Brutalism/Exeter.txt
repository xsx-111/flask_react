Exeter Lyrics
(Reversed:) "Ah sure, I've seen Mark, he's— he's got one of those fuckin' cannabis bandannas... He's the future."

Na na na na na na na na
Nothing ever happens

It seems like no one cares
I think I’ll take the stairs
’Cause nothing ever
He punched himself in the face
To prove he wasn’t gay
’Cause nothing ever happens

Over and over and over and over again
Na na na na na na na na
Nothing ever

I dropped onto my knees
And prayed to Jesus please
Will something fucking happen
Then they killed poor George dead
They put a hammer through his head
Now nothing ever happens

Over and over and over and over again
Na na na na na na na na
Nothing ever happens

Steven’s in the bar for a bar fight
Nick’s in the bar for a bar fight
Danny’s in the bar for a bar fight
Grant’s in the bar for a bar fight
Scott’s in the bar for a bar fight
Shit-eyes in the bar for a bar fight
John Gerrard in the bar for a bar fight
Charlie’s in the bar for a bar fight
Andy’s in the bar for a bar fight
Stewart’s in the bar for a bar fight
Gareth’s in the bar for a bar fight
Pimmy’s in the bar for a bar fight
Cranky’s in the bar for a bar fight
Aoife's in the bar for a bar fight
Biker’s in the bar for a bar fight
Over and over and over and over again
Na na na na na na na na
Nothing ever happens1Embed
