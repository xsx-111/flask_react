Faith in the City Lyrics
I got a job in the city
1, 2, 3, 4

There’s no god in the city
Uncle Noel’s got cancer in his brain
Uncle Noel’s got cancer in his lungs and his brain
I thought it would tear that man apart
Luckily, uncle Noel’s got Jesus in his heart
I’m an Aquarius
1, 2, 3, 4

Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Hey

There’s no jobs in the city
Mike lost 116 months
Allegedly all because of Benedictine monks
Bucky couldn’t help him find a job
Luckily Mikey found himself at peace with God
I’m evangelical
1, 2, 3, 4

Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)
Praise the lord (Praise the lord)1Embed
