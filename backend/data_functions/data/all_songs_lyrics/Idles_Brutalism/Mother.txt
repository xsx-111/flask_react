Mother LyricsMy mother worked 15 hours 5 days a week
My mother worked 16 hours 6 days a week
My mother worked 17 hours 7 days a week
The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich
The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich
The best way to scare a Tory is to read and get rich
I know nothing
I’m just sitting here looking at pretty colours
I know nothing
I’m just sitting here looking at pretty colours
I know nothing
I’m just sitting here looking at pretty colours

Sexual violence doesn’t start and end with rape
It starts in our books and behind our school gates
Men are scared women will laugh in their face
Whereas women are scared it’s their lives men will take
