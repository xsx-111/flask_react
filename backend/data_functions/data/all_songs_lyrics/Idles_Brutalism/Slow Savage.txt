Slow Savage Lyrics
It was dark and cold as a knife when we tussled through the pines
You can howl at the bed sheets
Scream at the moon if you like
But it won’t help me some, won’t help me if we die
But it might help me some, might help me if you cry
She said, “Wait! We’ll be better if we wait, better if we wait”
I said, “There’s no amount of time to carry the weight”

La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai
La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai
'Cause I’m the worst lover you’ve ever had
I’m the worst lover you’ll ever have

For two years in a row I forgot your birthday
For two years in a row I thought it was a Thursday
Maybe it was God
Maybe it was coke
Maybe I’m a drunk
I don’t know
But at least now I remember your birthday
'Cause I’m the worst lover you’ll ever have
Hands down, goddamn worst lover you’ll ever have
La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai
La da dai, la da dai, la da dai, la da dai
'Cause I’m the worst lover you’ll ever have
I’m the worst lover you’ll ever have3Embed
