Sixtyniner LyricsThat tiny room at the beach was absolutely the perfect place for my first time
When we came together, I could feel the hairs growing on my chest
I saw my future
I saw my past
For a few minutes, it was like being alive
They lived happily ever after
All my questions had been answered
All my fears disappeared
All that was left was a kiss
Every move we made was a kissEmbed
