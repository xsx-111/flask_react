Daybreak LyricsThis is the daybreak, and this is the love we make
For love is the law here, you've got to know how I love it, yeah
It's more than a mover, you know it takes off fast, or slow
Stone cold wild, bring the love in son, brother, man
True nature child, I think I'll sing it
For Atlanta Georgia, to Longsight Manchester
Everyone ready, so, so willing and able, yeah, yeah, yeah
For the love you make, g'no sis'
She willing to make ya, we all love makers ain't we?
Sister Rosa Lee Parks, lock forever her name in your heart
Forever in my heart
As I sing on this song, someone just got rolled on, hey
Oh hey, yeah, wooh yeah
New York City, to Addis Ababababa
Keep on keeping strong, keep on keeping on
So why no stack for black on a radio station in this, the city?
Been going on so long, level on the line, I'm a leaf on the vine of time
Black bones are the original bones
And so this the whole wide world should know, y'all
I came to sing this song in your city
Ooh, for the dreamers
One more for the dreamers, yeahEmbed
