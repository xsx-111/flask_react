Straight To The Man LyricsSaw this revelation, caused devastation
An initiation, all you'd better beware
Who'll cast the first stone?
Skin to the bone bring it all on home
Bring it all for Jerome
So new castle build a brand new castle
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Straight to the man
On an island of traders
You know they're trying to fade ya
No-one can train you
No-one evade you
No-one can fade you
Saying Don't be late
No the train won't wait
Saying don't be late
No the boat can't wait
Saying Don't be late
No the train nor the boat
Or the train can't wait yeah
Do the do do the do do the do do
Do the do do do the do do do
Do the do do do the do do do do do do do do do the
Heading straight for the man
Oh you know they'll never evade you
So now I stand here
Love cuts down a revolver
Amsterdam is Sodom and Gomorrah
So I'm singing to King Stone
Our teaching it's on
They say it's a fable
Though I was made able
I slipped through the net
Wanna bet it's a ramble, a sandstorm
One slip you know you'll never forget
Who could ever forget?
You know I never forget
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do straight to the man
Oh you know they're trying to fade you
Saw this revelation, caused devastation
I don't need no powder
One kinder, easy blind ya
Yeah the eyes of Grand Bretagne owes a debt
Say the eyes of Grand Bretagne
All the eyes of Grand Bretagne
All the eyes of Grand Bretagne owes a debt
Yeah the eyes of Grand Bretagne
All eyes of Grand Bretagne owes us a debtEmbed
