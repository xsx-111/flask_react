Wasted LyricsWhen I'm looking deep inside myself
And I search in vain
How I've tried to be like someone else
But remain the same
A wasted life
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
When I'm sitting deep inside myself
And it causes pain
Think about in the times I've tried
But I've failed in vain
My life's sometimes
Between the line
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know
I want to know (I want to know
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know

Thank God For Mental Illness version
When I'm looking deep inside myself
And it seems in vain
How I've tried to be like someone else
But remain the same
A wasted life
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
When I'm sitting deep inside myself
And it seems so changed
Think about ? someplace else
And it's feeling vain
I waste my time
I laugh at ?
I want to know
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to knowEmbed
