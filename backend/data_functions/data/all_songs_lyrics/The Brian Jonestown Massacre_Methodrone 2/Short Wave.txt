Short Wave LyricsShe's walking
Right out the door
She's talking
It's not like before
Just to hear you say
It doesn't matter 'bout the thing you say
Just to get your way
It doesn't happen to me every day
Just to hear you say
My hands are ?? already
Just to get your way
I'm ready for it anytime or place
?
I forgot
You don't care
But you talk a lot
You can't have your way
It doesn't matter 'bout the thing you say
You can't get your way
If you got any time or place
Just to see your way
Your eyes are swollen and ? already
Just to get your way
You're ready for it any time you sayEmbed
