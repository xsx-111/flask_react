Visa-age LyricsName the place, for a rendez-vous
Name the time and I'll get to you
Take a train, take a motorway
And take a plane, take it any day
And take a drink, as you leave the ground
Time to think, hearing headphone sound
Close your eyes, you're drifting far away
Realise, that you'll be home today
Visa-age
(I know the place)
Visa-age
(I can't forget)
Visa-age
(I'll go direct)
Visa-age
Leave the trash, of your life behind
It's time to move, shake those ties that bind
Letting go, all that's old and blue
You've gotta know, just where you're going to
So take a chance and take a case in hand
We find romance, it's a far off land
Close your eyes, you're drifting far away
And realise, you could be there today
Visa-age
(A different town)
Visa-age
(Another place)
Visa-age
(Destinations)
Visa-age
I know you from somewhere
I know we've met
Visa-age
(A different town)
Visa-age
(Another place)
Visa-age
(These destinations)
Visa-age
So faint in the distance
A speck on the map
A stamp on my passport
No time to look back...Embed
