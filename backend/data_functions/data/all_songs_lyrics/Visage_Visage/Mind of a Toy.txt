Mind of a Toy LyricsMy painted face
Is chipped and cracked
My mind seems
To fade too fast
Clutching straws
Sinking slow
Nothing less, nothing less
A puppet's motions
Controlled by a string
By a stranger
I've never met
A nod of the head
And a pull of the thread
I can't say no, can't say no
When a child throws out a toy
When I was new you wanted me
Now I'm old you no longer see
When a child throws out a toy
Spiteful girl
Hateful boy
When a child throws out a toy
I'm all dressed up
And nowhere to go
On a music box
That never stops
I'll dance for you
If you want me to
Move in time, move in time
A wooden head
And a broken heart
Used, abused
And torn apart
I gave you my best
And you gave me the rest
It's time to die, time to die
When a child throws out a toy
When I was new you wanted me
Now I'm old you no longer see
When a child throws out a toy
Spiteful girl
Hateful boy
When a child throws out a toy
(Instrumental)
When a child throws out a toy
When I was new you wanted me
Now I'm old you no longer see
When a child throws out a toy
Spiteful girl
Hateful boy
When a child throws out a toy
