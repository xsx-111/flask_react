Blocks on Blocks LyricsReflections, of the river passing by
Reflections, of the place between the sky
It's too black, casting shadows
On the bridges built so close to that aura
Walking to the sign before my eyes
Dreaming it's too late to realise
Stop! You've gone too far this time
You're toying with reality
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Figures, in a doorway in the night
Dancing, moving shadows with the light
Talking, to a stranger
On the bridges built so close to that aura
Standing, on a runway all alone
Listening, to an engine heading home
Crying, on the inside
Wishing I could get away from that aura
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Lying, on the runway all alone
Listening, to an engine heading home
Stop! you've gone too far this time
You're toying with reality
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent sound
Blocks on blocks are all around
Neon lit for silent soundEmbed
