Death Is This Communion LyricsThe site of the last horizons, the minions seek to resurrect a God
The graves hold arcane mysteries, various swamps hide terrible catacombs
The circle of redeemers, the pact is made with human sacrifice
Under storm filled skies, behemoth of the sea awakes, arise
Tremble at the horror in which it writhes
Once they behold and unearth the titans might
Faithful servants pay its ghastly price
Slithering, blasphemous, curse upon all life

Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
The site of the last horizons, the minion seek to resurrect a God
The graves hold arcane mysteries, various swamps hide terrible catacombs
The circle of redeemers, the pact is made with human sacrifice
Under storm filled skies, behemoth of the sea awakes, arise
Tremble at the horror in which it writhes
Once they unearth and behold the titans might
Faithful servants pay its ghastly price
Slithering, blasphemous, curse upon all life
Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
The site of the last horizons, the minion seek to resurrect a God
The graves hold arcane mysteries, various swamps hide terrible catacombs
The circle of redeemers, the pact is made with human sacrifice
Under storm filled skies, behemoth of the sea awakes, arise
Tremble at the horror in which it writhes
Once they behold and unearth the titans might
Faithful servants pay its ghastly price
Slithering, blasphemous, curse upon all life

Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communion
Now you realize
Death is this communionEmbed
