Return to NOD LyricsServe the shadows of mountain peaks under the glass mirrored skies
Sing the psalms of the wailing winds, the entrance seer will provide
Stars reveal the tattered map, a land cursed of time
So speak the words of our challenger seeking the ultimate prize

Speaking the words of the sorcerer's tongue
No one can stop what's already begun
Follow the footsteps and unlock the door
The giant you face has awakened
Speaking the words of the sorcerer's tongue
No one can stop what's already begun
Follow the footsteps and unlock the door
The giant you face has awakened
Fear is invoked by your trembling hands, the foe is deadly and wise
A sight that's filled the eyes of mighty men, the very cost of their lives
Take the aim of the shimmering blade, the vulnerable spot is precise
Swift is the hand of the waking beast, crown of two worlds is the prize

Speaking the words of the sorcerer's tongue
No one can stop what's already begun
Follow the footsteps and unlock the door
The giant you face has awakened
Speaking the words of the sorcerer's tongue
No one can stop what's already begun
Follow the footsteps and unlock the door
The giant you face has awakened
Blood will spill on the warrior's feet, casting the enemies aside
Exalting the hero for evermore, steps to the throne of the eyes
Serve the shadows mountain peaks under the glass mirrored skies
Sing the psalms of the wailing winds, the entrance seer will provideEmbed
