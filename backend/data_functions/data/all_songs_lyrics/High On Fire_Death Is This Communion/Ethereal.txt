Ethereal LyricsThe skill and mind of magic
Holding the mystic doors
Like moths to ancient light
Follow ascend in flight
Fall through the ether lakes
Dimension time and space
I knock on astral walls
Gliding through daemon halls
Its black wings wrap around me
Fires glow red and white
A metamorphosis
Until the end of time
Cocooned and made to slumber
The beings that come from darkness
A resurrection passage
Awakes the armies under earth
I walk the open steps to answer
Abyssious voice leads me onward
A fate unknown by a future
A scepter raised of Hades elders
The skill and mind of magic
Holding the mystic doors
Like moths to ancient light
Follow ascend in flight
Fall through the ether lakes
Dimension time and space
I knock on astral walls
Gliding through daemon halls
Its black wings wrap around me
Fires glow red and white
A metamorphosis
Until the end of time
Cocooned and made to slumber
The beings that come from darkness
A resurrection passage
Awakes the armies under earth
I walk the open steps to answer
Abyssious voice leads me onward
A fate unknown by a future
A scepter raised of Hades elders

I walk the open steps to answer
Abyssious voice leads me onward
A fate unknown by a future
A scepter raised of Hades elders
I walk the open steps to answer
Abyssious voice leads me onward
A fate unknown by a future
A scepter raised of Hades eldersEmbed
