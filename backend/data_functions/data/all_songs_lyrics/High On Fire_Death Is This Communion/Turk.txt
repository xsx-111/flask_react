Turk Lyrics
I cannot grasp this black psychology
My cage's walls are closing in on me
The rage that surfaces is not my soul
It's like a devil taking control
The violence lives in me and will not leave
Live a magician with pain up his sleeve

The sight of God is to unfold
Memories untold
For every poem's a rhyme
The joke is father time

Our delves in twisted sexuality
Substance abuse and immortality
A stark obsession no one else would know
Questions unanswered, how far can this go
The wall of torment, my blood's boiling
Break this shell to do what's so obscene

The sight of God is to unfold
Memories untold
For every poem's a rhyme
The joke is father
The sight of God is to unfold
Memories untold
For every poem's a rhyme
The joke is father time

The sight of God is to unfold
Memories untold
For every poem's a rhyme
The joke is father
The sight of God is to unfold
Memories untold
For every poem's a rhyme
The joke is father timeEmbed
