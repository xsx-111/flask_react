Cyclopian Scape LyricsReptile race crossbred down through the golden age
Human haze
Lemurian throne taken and usurped by the alien drones
Controlled and honed
Atlantian keys sunken and destroyed by catastrophe
Left wandering
Bloodline kings slither down through society's reptoid dreams
Cataclysm to the elder tribes
Aununnaki have survived
Continents underwater shrine
Ocean vaults holding time
Say ye grace unto the serpent line
Unveil curses and their lies
Contemplate the lengths they'll go to rule
As their fangs dig into you
Cataclysm to the elder tribes
Aununnaki have survived
Continents underwater shrine
Ocean vaults holding time
Say ye grace unto the serpent line
Unveil curses and their lies
Contemplate the lengths they'll go to rule
As their fangs dig into youEmbed
