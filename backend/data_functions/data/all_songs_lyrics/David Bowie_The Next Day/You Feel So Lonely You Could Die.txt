You Feel So Lonely You Could Die Lyrics
No one ever saw you moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends, stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms, then vile rewards for you

And I'm gonna tell, yes, I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

Some night on the thrillerâ€™s street
Will come the silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
There'll come assassin's needle on a crowded train
I bet you feel so lonely you could die

Buildings crammed with people, landscapes filled with wrath
Gray concrete city, rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly before you close the door
A room of bloody history, you made sure of that
I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam
I could read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh, see if I care
Oh, please, please make it soon

Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues, my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end
Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely you could die
Feel so lonely you could die
You feel so lonely you could die2Embed
