If You Can See Me LyricsIf you can see me I can see you
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river
Just chutes and ladders
And this is the kiss
American anna fantasticalsation
From nowhere to nothing
And neither way back
Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the light
The beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East
Now you can say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
My love of violence and tenants' sighs
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beast, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow
I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river
I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, drizzle of dark ashes
I will slaughter your kind, descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, the lord of theft
Burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me1Embed
