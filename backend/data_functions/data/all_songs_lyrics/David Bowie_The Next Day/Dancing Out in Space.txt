Dancing Out in Space Lyrics
Cutting through the water
Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
Through the kingdom of the boats
Send your friend away now
Let him sail back home tonight

Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)

Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl, you move like water
You’ve got stars upon your head
You’ve got my name and number
You've got to take the floor
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space2Embed
