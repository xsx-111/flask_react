How Does the Grass Grow? Lyrics
There's a graveyard by the station where the girls
Wear vinyl skirts and sandals from Hungary
The boys ride their Riga 1s upon the little hills
Such sadness and grief, the kids die standing
That's where we made our tryst and struggled with our guns
Would you still love me if the clocks could go backwards?
The girls would fill with blood, and the grass will be green again
Remember the dead, they were so great, some of them

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood

Well I lived a blind life, a white face, a prison
That you made, a life out of nothing, now I ride by
Black roads. I miss you more than you'll never, ever know
Waiting with my red eyes and my stone heart

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
I gaze in defeat at the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you'll sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, bloodEmbed
