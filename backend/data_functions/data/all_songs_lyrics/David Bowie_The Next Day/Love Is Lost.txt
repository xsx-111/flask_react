Love Is Lost Lyrics
It's the darkest hour, you're 22
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent, too
But your fear is as old as the world
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, no love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love
You know so much, itâ€™s making you cry
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?4Embed
