Heat Lyrics
Then we saw Mishima's dog
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow

And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

I can only love you by hating him more
That's not the truth, it's too big a word
He believed that love is theft
Love and war, the theft of love

And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison
But I am a seer, I am a liar
I am a seer, but I am a liar

My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison2Embed
