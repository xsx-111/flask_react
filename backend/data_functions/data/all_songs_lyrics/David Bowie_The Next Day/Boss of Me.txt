Boss of Me Lyrics
Tell me when you're sad
I wanna make it cool again
I know you're feeling bad
Tell me when you're cool again

Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?

You fly through the night
With tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips

Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?

Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?
You looked at me and you weeped for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel the small town dies

Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?

Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?


Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?1Embed
