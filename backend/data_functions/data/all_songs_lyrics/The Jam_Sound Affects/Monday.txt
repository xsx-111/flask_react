Monday LyricsOh baby I'm dreaming of Monday
Oh baby will I see you again
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday, dreaming of Monday
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday
Oh baby will I see you again
Oh baby say I'm dreaming of Monday
Rainclouds came and stole my thunder -
Left me barren like a desert
But a sunshine girl like you
It's worth going through -
I will never be embarrassed about love again
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday
Oh baby when I see you again
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday, dreaming of Monday
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday
Oh baby will I see you again
Oh baby say I'm dreaming of Monday, dreaming of Monday
Tortured winds that blew me over
When I start to think that I'm something special
They tell me that I'm not
And they're right and I'm glad and I'm not
I will never be embarrassed about love again
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday
Oh baby will I see you again
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday, dreaming of Monday
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday
Oh baby will I see you again
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday, dreaming of Monday
Oh baby I'm dreaming of Monday
Oh baby will I see you again
Oh baby say I'm dreaming of Monday, dreaming of MondayEmbed
