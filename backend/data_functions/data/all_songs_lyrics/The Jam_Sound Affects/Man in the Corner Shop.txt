Man in the Corner Shop LyricsPuts up the closed sign does the man in the corner shop
Serves his last and says goodbye to him
He knows it is a hard life
But it's nice to be your own boss, really
Walks off home does the last customer
He's jealous of the man in the corner shop
He's sick of working at the factory
Says it must be nice to be your own boss, really
La la la la la...
Sells cigars to the boss from the factory
He is jealous is the man in the corner shop
He is sick of struggling so hard
He says it must be nice to own a factory
Go to church do the people from the area
All shapes and classes sit and pray together
For here they are all one
For God created all men equal
La la la la la...
Go to church do the people from the area
Go to church do the people from the area
Go to church do the people from the area
For God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know that God created all men equal
They know
La la la la la...Embed
