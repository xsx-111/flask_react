Boy About Town LyricsSee me walking around I'm the boy about town that you heard of
See me walking the streets I'm on top of the world that you heard of
Oh like paper caught in wind
I glide upstreet, I glide downstreet
Oh and it won't let you go
'til you finally come to rest and someone picks you up
Upstreet downstreet and puts you in the bin
See me walking around I'm the boy about town that you heard of
See me walking the streets I'm on top of the world that you heard of
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la laaaa
La la la la
La la la la
There's more than you can hope for in this world
Oh I'm sitting watching rainbows
Sitting here watching the people go crazy
Oh please leave me aside
I want to do what I want to do and
I want to live how I want to live and
Upstreet downstreet like paper caught in wind
Upstreet downstreet it won't let you go
See me walking around I'm the boy about town that you heard of
See me walking around I'm the boy about town that you heard of
The boy about town that you heard of
The boy about town that you heard ofEmbed
