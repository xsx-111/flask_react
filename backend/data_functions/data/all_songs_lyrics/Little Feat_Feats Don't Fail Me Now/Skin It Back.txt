Skin It Back LyricsWell I'm waitin' for something to take place
Something to take me away from this race
'Round city to city, town to town
Runnin' around in the shoes of a clown
And that desperate, no count, desperado
A depot of love, my business is the street
I be shakin' 'em down, oh Colorado
Texas she's nice but Georgia's oh so sweet
Steal away with me darlin', your lovin' just can't be beat
So it seems that the world keeps on turnin' but so what
I don't doubt it, it just keeps on the move
You're a dream and that's all that I ask for
So well now, I'm wonderin' just how I'm gonna tell it to you
Skin it back (skin it back)
Somethin' real, somethin' to feel
I can't find a soul who'll take on this mess
It's those rock and roll hours
Early graves without flowers
Please, please darlin' put my mind at rest
I'm beggin', please darlin' put my mind at rest
So it seems that the world keeps on turnin' but so what
I don't doubt it, it just keeps on the move
You're a dream and that's all that I ask for
So well now, I'm wonderin' just how I'm gonna tell it to you
Skin it back, tell it to you
Skin it back, tell it to you
Skin it back, tell it to you
Skin it back, tell it to youEmbed
