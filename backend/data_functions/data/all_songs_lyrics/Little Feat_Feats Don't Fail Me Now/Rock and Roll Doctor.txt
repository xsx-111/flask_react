Rock and Roll Doctor LyricsThere was a woman in Georgia, didn't feel just right
She had the fever all day and chills at night
Now things got worse, yes a serious bind
At times like this it takes a man with a style I cannot often find
A doctor of the heart and a doctor of mind
If you like country with a boogie beat, he's the man to meet
If you like the sound of shufflin' feet, he can't be beat
If you wanna feel real nice, just ask the rock and roll doctor's advice
It's just a country town but patients come
From Mobile to Moline from miles around
Nagodoches to New Orleans
In beat-up old cars or in limousines
To meet the doctor of soul, he's got his very own thing
Two degrees in be-bop, a PHD in swing
He's the master of rhythm, he's a rock and roll king, yeah
If you like country with a boogie beat, he's the man to meet (he's the man to meet)
If you like the sound of shufflin' feet, he can't be beat (I say he can't be beat)
If you... if you wanna... if you wanna feel real nice, just ask the rock and roll doctor's adviceEmbed
