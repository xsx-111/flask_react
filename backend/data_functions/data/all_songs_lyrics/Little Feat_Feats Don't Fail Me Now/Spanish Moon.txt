Spanish Moon LyricsWell the night that I got into town
Was the night of the rain, it froze on the ground
Down the street I heard such a sorrowful tune
Comin' from the place they call the Spanish Moon
Well I stepped inside and stood by the door
While a dark-eyed girl sang and played the guitar
Hookers and hustlers filled up the room
I heard about this place they call the Spanish Moon
One false step, you get done in
It's a cold situation
If that - that don't - kill you soon
The women will down at the Spanish Moon
Well I pawned my watch and I sold my ring
Just to hear that girl sing, yeah yeah
It don't take long to wake up ruined
You can lose it all down at the Spanish MoonEmbed
