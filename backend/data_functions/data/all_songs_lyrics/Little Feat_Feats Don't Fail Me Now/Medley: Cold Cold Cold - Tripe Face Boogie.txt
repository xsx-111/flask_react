Medley: Cold Cold Cold / Tripe Face Boogie LyricsCold, cold, cold
Cold, cold, cold
Freezing, it was freezing in that hotel
I had no money, my special friend was gone
The TV set was busted so she went along
I called room, room service
I'm down here on my knees
I said a peach or a pear, or a coconut please
But they was cold
Well it's been a month since I seen my girl
Or a dime to make the call
'Cause it passed me up, or it passed me by
Or I couldn't decide at all
And I'm mixed up, I'm so mixed up
Don't you know I'm lonely
All the things I had to do
I had to fall in love
You know she's cold
Cold, cold, cold
Cold, cold, cold
That woman is freezing, freezing cold
Well I tried everything to warm her up
Now I'm living in this cold hotel
'Cause she passed me, up or she passed me by
Or I couldn't decide at all
And I'm mixed up, I'm so mixed up
Don't you know I'm lonely
Of all the things I had to do
I had to fall in love
You know she's cold
Turn your clock back woman when you see me comin' round
My feet don't, feet don't even touch the ground
Yah, ya know she's cold
Oh she's cold (cold)
Ya know she's cold (cold)
Know she's cold (cold)
Cold (cold, cold, cold)
Buffaloed in Buffalo
And I was entertained in Houston
New York, yew nork, you got to choose one
Cause it's a tripe face boogie
Going to boogie my sneakers away
Well I don't want your money
And I don't want your time
Please don't tripe me honey
And I'll give you back your dime
It's a hype face boogie
Going to boogie my sneakers away
Now I don't dig potato chips
And I can't take torts
But you can tripe my guacamole baby (it's a guaca)
Tripe my shorts
'Cause it's a hype case boogie gonna boogie my scruples away
Hype boogie, tripe boogie, hype boogie
All night long
You bring your guitar, I'll bring the wine
Gonna tripe my guacamole baby just a one more time
Cause It's a tripe face boogie
I said look out!
Give tripe face his way
I said lookout!
Give tripe face his day
I said lookout!Embed
