My Beautiful Leah Lyrics
Did you see her walking?
Did she come around here, sir?
Black hair, brown eyes
My beautiful Leah
She was always so needy
Said, "I have no one"
Even as I held her
She went out looking for someone
Looking for someone

She only had nightmares
And her sadness never lifted
And slowly over the years
Her lovely face twisted
Did she come around here, sir?
I swear you would remember
Black hair, brown eyes
Late September

October
November
December
It never leaves my mind
The last words she said
"If I don't find it this time
Then I'm better off dead"1Embed
