Catherine Lyrics
Catherine De Barra
You've murdered my thinking
Gave you my heart
You left the thing stinking
I'd shake from your spell
If it weren't for my drinking
The wind bites more bitter
With each light of morning

I envy the road
The ground you tread under
I envy the wind
Your hair riding over
I envy the pillow
Your head rests and slumbers
I envy to murderous
Envy your lover

Till the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
Till the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
I envy the road
The ground you tread under
I envy the wind
Your hair riding over
I envy the pillow
Your head rests and slumbers
I envy to murderous
Envy your lover

Till the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
Till the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
Till the light shines on me
I damn to hell every second you breathe
Till the light shines on me

Oh my Catherine
Your eyes smiling
Your mouth singing
With time I'd have won you
With wile I'd have won you
Your eyes smiling
Your mouth singing
With time I'd have won you
Oh my Catherine
With wile I'd have won you
With wile I'd have won you4Embed
