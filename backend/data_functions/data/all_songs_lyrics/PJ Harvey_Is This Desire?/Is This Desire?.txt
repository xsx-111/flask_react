Is This Desire? Lyrics
Joseph walked on and on
The sunset went down and down
Coldness cooled their desire
And Dawn said, "Let's build a fire"

The sun dressed the trees in green
And Joe said, "Dawn, I feel like a king"
And Dawn's neck and her feet were bare
Sweetness in her golden hair

Said, "I'm not scared"
Turned to her and smiled
Secrets in his eyes
Sweetness of desire

Is this desire, enough, enough
To lift us higher, to lift above?

"Hour long by hour, may we two stand
When we're dead, between these lands"
The sun set behind his eyes
And Joe said, "Is this desire?"
Is this desire, enough, enough
To lift us higher, to lift above?
Is this desire, enough, enough
Enough inside? Is this desire?3Embed
