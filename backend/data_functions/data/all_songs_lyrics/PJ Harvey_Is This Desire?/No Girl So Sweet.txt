No Girl So Sweet Lyrics
In came the girl with the Saturn eyes
And asked him over again, again
"Was I too weak? Was I a child?"
And "Canâ€™t we leave here and start again?"

Ooh
Oh

Said, "I don't mind if you take me down"
And "I don't mind if you break it all"
But "How much more can you take from me?"
"How much more can you take from me?"

"I'd like to take you inside my head"
"I'd like to take you inside of me"
"You came from heaven" is all he said
"You came from heaven and came here to me"

"And I love you"
"Love you"
He drove it fast to make the night
And looked at his angel, where she lay
Resting her head, and closed her eyes
Outside the heat and the summer fades

Deep in the sky a storm he'd seen
Deep in the sky a storm he'd seen
"There ain't nothing, no girl so sweet"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"

"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"
"Took her from heaven and gave her to me"1Embed
