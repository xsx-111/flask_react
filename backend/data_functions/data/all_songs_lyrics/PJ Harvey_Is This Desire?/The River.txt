The River Lyrics
And they came to the river
And they came from the road
And he wanted the sun
Just to call his own
And they walked on the dirt
And they walked from the road
Till they came to the river
Till they came up close

Throw your pain in the river
Throw your pain in the river
Leave your pain in the river
To be washed away slow

And we walked without words
And we walked with our lives
Two silent birds circled by

Like our pain in the river
And the pain in the river
And the white sun scattered
Washed away this slow
And we followed the river
And we followed the road
And we walked through this land
And we called it a home
But he wanted the sun
And I wanted it all
And the white light scatters
And the sun sets low

Like our pain in the river
Like our pain in the river
Like the white light scattered
To be washed away slow
Like our pain in the river
Like our pain in the river
Like the way life scattered
To be washed away slow3Embed
