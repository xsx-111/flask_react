Electric Light Lyrics
The beauty of her, under electric light
The beauty of her, under electric light

Tears my heart out every time

Dawn there waiting, right outside
Dawn there waiting, right outside

Tears my heart out every time

Siren rising across the sky
Siren rising across the sky

Tears my heart out every timeEmbed
