The Garden Lyrics
And he was walking in the garden
And he was walking in the night
And he was singing a sad love song
And he was praying for his life
And the stars came out around him
He was thinking of his sins
And he's looking at his song-bird
And he's looking at his wings

There, inside the garden
Came another with his lips
Said "Won't you come and be my lover?
Let me give you a little kiss"
And he came knelt down before him
And fell upon his knees
"I will give you gold and mountains
If you stay a while with me"

And there was trouble
Taking place
Trouble
Taking place
There, inside the garden
They kissed and the sun rose
And he walked a little further
And he found he was alone
And the wind it gathered round him
He was thinking of his sins
And he's looking for his song-bird
He was looking for his wings

And there was trouble
Taking place
Trouble
Taking place
And there was trouble
Taking place
Trouble
Taking place2Embed
