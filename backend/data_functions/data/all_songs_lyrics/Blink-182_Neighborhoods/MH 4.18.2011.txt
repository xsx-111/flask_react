MH 4.18.2011 Lyrics

Coming in, coming in, kill the radio
Silence, breakdown in L.A
Giving up, giving in to a feeling of
Violence, there's hell to pay
So let's light another match, stop living in the past
Where nobody can hear me now
Blow the lock off the cage, watch the children come of age
When their parents stop to take a bow

Nothing takes root in this barren soil, nothing takes root
In this barren soil, maybe there's no one there at all

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, and stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

Line 'em up on the wall, coming out with their
Hands up, give 'em all the chair
Let it burn, let it fall, let the end of the
World come, who's left to care?
Nothing takes root in this barren soil, nothing takes root
But we bend in toil, maybe there's no one there at all

Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, and stop living in the shadow of a helicopter


Hold on, the worst is yet to come
Save your money for hired guns
Hold strong when everything you loved is gone
Slow down, and stop living in the shadow of a helicopter

Stop living in the shadow of a helicopter...2Embed
