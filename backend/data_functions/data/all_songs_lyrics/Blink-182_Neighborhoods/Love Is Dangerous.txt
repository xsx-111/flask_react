Love Is Dangerous Lyrics

I have had it with this damn double vision
My hand's swollen, I can't keep holding on
My heart's sinking and stuck in deadly rhythm
I can't fake it, I can't, can't brush it off

Love, love is dangerous
Love, love is so dangerous

I'm back at it, I just don't seem to listen
I see your lips, I just can't hear the sound
It's all static, just like my television
There's still something, her eyes cut through the clouds

I need love, love is dangerous
(Hard times, don't be fooled when she says it)
Love, love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love, love is so dangerous
(Love's cruel, so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous...

I need love, love is dangerous
(Hard times, don't be fooled when she says it)
Love, love is so dangerous
(We'll betray the ones we care about)
Love, love is so dangerous
(Love's cruel, so we all pretend to fuck)
Love, love is dangerous...
