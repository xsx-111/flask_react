Wishing Well Lyrics
Been gone a long time, I kinda lost my way, can't find it
And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange, and a little bit manic

La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah, la da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah, la da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah

I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land

On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading

La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah, la da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah, la da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land


La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah, la da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah
La da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah, la da-da-dah, da-da-da-dah-dah

I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land
I went to a wishing well, it sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
It made its way through my heart, had fun in the promised land5Embed
