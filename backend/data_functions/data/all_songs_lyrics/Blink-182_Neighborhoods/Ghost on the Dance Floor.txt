Ghost on the Dance Floor Lyrics

I'll never let you down, boy, I'll never let you go
Her subtle hint of life is so innocent and scary
"So, tell me that you're here, boy," she says as if she knows
When God took her with time, God made me quite alone
It's like the universe has left me without a place to go
Without a hint of light to watch the movement glow
When our song was slowly starting, your memory felt so real
At first, against my will, but God invented chills

Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal

The kids are in a hurry, and I'm just full of fear
The lights make bodies blurry, it's getting hard enough to hear
It's like the evidence is cared for and evidently clear
If I never leave this dance floor, then I'll never leave you here

Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, the moment felt so real
If your eyes stay right on mine, my wounds would start to heal
I felt your ghost tonight, and God it felt like hell
To know you're almost mine, but dreams are all I feel...

Yeah I, I saw your ghost tonight, it fucking hurt like hell
I felt you here tonight, but dreams can't all be real
I saw your ghost tonight, it fucking hurt like hell
I felt you here tonight, but dreams can't all be real...10Embed
