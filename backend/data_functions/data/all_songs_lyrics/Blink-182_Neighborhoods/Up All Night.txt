Up All Night Lyrics

Everyone wants to call it all around our
Life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with
A friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats, their wants and needs, and
Still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when
The pain begins to start

Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night

Everyone's cross to bear the crown they wear on
Endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes
Life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to
Celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we
Die alone some day
Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night, they keep me up all...
