Mean Mistreater LyricsShe's a mean mistreater
She mistreat me all the time
She's a mean mistreater
Little gal mistreat me all the time
I just had to quit you, baby
Heavy on my mind
She's a mean mistreater
And she don't mean me no good
She's a mean mistreater
And she don't mean me no good
I don't blame you, baby
I'd be the same way if I could
Remember the Monday morning
You were laid out across my bed
Drinkin' moonshine, baby
And talking all out of your head
Remember, remember, baby
When you were layin' out across my bed
You know you were drinkin' moonshine, baby
And talking all out your head
Oh yeah
And you're lonesome, baby
When you're stupid by yourself
The one you love will never settle down
And you're lonesome and you're lonesome
When you're sleeping by yourself
The one you're in love with
Goes to lovin' someone elseEmbed
