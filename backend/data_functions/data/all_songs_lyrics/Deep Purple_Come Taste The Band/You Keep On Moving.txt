You Keep On Moving Lyrics
You keep on moving
Far away, far away
You keep on moving
Far away, far away
Everyday wheels are turning
And the cry still returning

Dawn will soon be breaking
The day has just begun
You put your arms around me
Like a circle around the sun
Dance across the seasons
To a place that no one knows
Where angels fear to tread


Dawn will soon be breaking
The day has just begun
You put your arms around me
Like a circle around the sun
Dance across the seasons
To a place that no one knows
Where angels fear to tread
You keep on moving
Far away, far away
Everyday wheels are turning
And the cry still returning
