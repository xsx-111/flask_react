Dealer Lyrics
If you fool around
With the dealer
Remember soon
You'll have to pay, yeah
He'll creep behind you
Like a hunter
Just to steal your soul away
I don't want no one
Messing with my woman
But just the same
I don't wanna see nobody
Fooling with you
If you're snow blind
Madonna can hold you
But if you don't understand
There is nothing she can do for you

Running from the dealer
Trying to save your soul

I can feel the fire
Coming from inside you
I know what it's like
Because I've been burned before
Ain't no mercy in the hunger
You're a fool to yourself
Because your dealer keeps you begging for more

In the beginning all you wanted
Was the calm before the storm
If the bluebird plays the eagle, yeah
He finds his song will turn to stone, dealerEmbed
