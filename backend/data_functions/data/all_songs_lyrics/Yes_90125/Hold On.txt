Hold On Lyrics

Justice to the left of you, justice to the right
Speak when you are spoken to, but don't pretend you're right
This life's not for living, it's for fighting and for wars
No matter what the truth is, hold on to what is yours


Jigsaw puzzle traitors, sent to spill the beans
Constitution screw up, shattering the dreams
Blood flows in the desert, dark citadels burn in two
Watch, look over your shoulder, this one is strictly for you

Hold on, hold on
Wait! Maybe the answer's looking for you
Hold on, hold on
Wait! Take your time, think it through
Yes, I can make it through


Hold on, hold on
Sunshine, shine on through
Hold on, hold on
Sunshine, shine on you
See it through

Talk the simple smile, such platonic eye
How they drown in incomplete capacity
Strangest of them all, when the feeling calls
How we drown in stylistic audacity
Charge the common ground
Round and round and round, we living in gravity
Shake - We shake so hard, how we laugh so loud
When we reach, we believe in eternity
I believe in eternity

Hold on, hold on
Sunshine, shine on through
(Wait! Take your time, see it through)
Hold on, hold on
Sunshine, shine on through
(Wait! Maybe a chance is looking for you)


Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Sunshine, shine on, shine on you
Sunshine, shine on through
Sunshine, shine on, shine on through
Sunshine, shine on you
Sunshine, shine on, shine on you
(Hold on, hold on)
Sunshine, shine on through
(Wait! Take your time, see it through)
Sunshine, shine on, shine on through
(Hold on - Hold on)
Sunshine, shine on you
(Wait! Maybe the answer's looking for you)1Embed
