Our Song Lyrics
Toledo was just another pit stop along the good king's highway
My fortification took me by surprise and hit me, sending me sideways
Spellbound - Roundly - Good for sunshine
Can't help thinking
Singing Rule Britannia
And this is where it grabs ya
There's method in the key of C
Toledo's got to be the silver city
In this good country

Our song, it gives us a reason
Our song, that good remedy
Music has magic, that stuff of syncopation

Ever tried driving it to golden heights just simply jiving it
My mystification, it got a jewel skies crazy spacing it
Hot sun - Crowded - Screams, high voices
Singing speechless
Touching of the healing heart
So this is where we really start
Music is a shout of foregone conclusions
As long as music plays its part
Good good part
Our song, it gives us a reason
Our song, that good remedy
Music and magic, it's good clear syncopation

Treat it good, treat it rightly
And if you get it flowing, the harmony is glowing
So get ready, so get ready
Don't go Toledo, Toledo don't go
Music - Good to you
Music - Good to youEmbed
