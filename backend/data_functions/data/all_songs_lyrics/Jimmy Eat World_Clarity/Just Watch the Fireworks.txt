Just Watch the Fireworks Lyrics
Here, you can be anything
And I think that scares you
I think that scares you
Here, I've been here before
But only by myself
Myself

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now
I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

What giving up gives you
And where giving up takes you
I've had and I've been
Here, in center frame
Here, there's only air
And just enough space to fit

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now
I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now
I said, said, said it out loud over and over
Said, said, said it out loud, but what do I know?
Said, said, said it out loud over and over
Yeah
I said, said, said it out loud over and over
Said, said, said it out loud, but it did not help
I'll stop now
Just enough so I can hear you
I'll stay up as late as it takes

I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now
I promised I'd see it again
I promised I'd see this with you now

I said, said, said it out loud over and over
Said, said, said it out loud, but it did not help
I'll stop now
Just enough so I can hear you
I'll stay up as long as it takes

I'll stay up as late as it takes
I'll stay up as late as it takes
As late as it takes
As late as it takes
As long as it takes, takes, takes
I'll stay up as late as it takes
As long as it takes3Embed
