A Sunday Lyrics
On a Sunday, I'll think it through
On the drive back, I'll think it through
What you wish for won't come true
Live with that – with that

And on a Sunday, she thought it through
Now as I drive back, there's thirty-six less hours
I have to change the course I send myself
I gotta live with that – with that

The haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
The haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
On a Sunday

On a Sunday, go once around
'Cause when the ride's done, the hopes that you have carried
They fall out from your hands back to the ground
Live with that – with that
They fall out from your hands back to the ground
Live with that – with that

The haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
The haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
On a Sunday
Learn as the drugs leave
Learn as you lose it
You will

And the haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
The haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
On a Sunday
Yeah, the haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
On a Sunday
Yeah, the haze clears from your eyes on a Sunday
On a Sunday
On a SundayEmbed
