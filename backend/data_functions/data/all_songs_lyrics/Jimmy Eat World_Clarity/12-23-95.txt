12/23/95 Lyrics
I didn't mean to leave you hanging on
I didn't mean to leave you all alone
I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to say

Merry Christmas, baby
(Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas, baby
(Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas, baby
(Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas, baby
(Merry Christmas, baby)
Merry Christmas1Embed
