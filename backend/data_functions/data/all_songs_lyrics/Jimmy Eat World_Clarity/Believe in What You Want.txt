Believe in What You Want Lyrics
Well, don't bother going through your motions
Nothing that makes sense ever works out
And don't kid yourself, you know they want money
Well, nothing can be good on its own, it's just a merit

Spinning and spinning
Do you believe in what you want?
Dancing in plastic, shake-up snow
Do you believe in what you want?

Put your trust in simple acts
Make the flyers, get them up all over town
And don't kid yourself, you know it's for money
Well, please keep in sight what makes you care, you have it always

Spinning and spinning
Do you believe in what you want?
Dancing in plastic, shake-up snow
Do you believe in what you want?

Your camera flash (Your camera flash)
On us, meaningless (On us, meaningless)
Your camera flash (Your camera flash)
On us, meaningless
You cannot waste a single night
What you ignore is priceless to me â€“ to me!

Spinning and spinning
Do you believe in what you want?
Dancing in plastic, shake-up snow
Do you believe in what you want?Embed
