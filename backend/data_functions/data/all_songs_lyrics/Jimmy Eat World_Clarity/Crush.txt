Crush Lyrics
Faintest snow keep falling
Hands around your waist
Nameless, standing cold
Standing cold

Like a breath
Like a breath
Take in restraint like a breath
My lungs are so numb from holding back

Walk close to the fence
Feel it hit your clothes
Turn and smile nice
Smile, say goodnight
Say goodnight

In a breath
In a breath
Simple discourse breaks you clean
Simple discourse breaks you clean in half

Regret
Do try it once but then you know
It's your move
Settle for less again
Like a breath
Like a breath
Like a breath
Like a breath
Take in restraint like a breath
My lungs are so numb from holding back
Yeah, from holding backEmbed
