Goodbye Sky Harbor Lyrics
Is tomorrow just a day like all the rest?
(How could you know just what you did?)
Like all the rest
(How could you know just what you did?)
So full of faith, yet full of doubt

I ask again
I shall ask you this once again
He said
"I am but one small instrument." (Do you...)
Do you remember that?

Time and time again you said, "Don't be afraid."
(If you believe, then you can do it)
"Don't be afraid."
(If you believe, then you can do it)
The only voice I want to hear is yours

Again
I shall ask you this once again
He said
"I am but one small instrument." (Do you...)
Do you remember that?
So here I am above palm trees so straight and tall
You are smaller, getting smaller
But I still see youEmbed
