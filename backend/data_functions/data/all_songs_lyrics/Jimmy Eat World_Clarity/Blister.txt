Blister Lyrics
"Take advantage of these times," you said
You let me down, It hasn't been the first time
As I'm falling in the pit of fire
My mind's made up: I'm never coming back here

And how long would it take me
To walk across the United States all alone?
The west coast has been traumatized
And I think I'm the only one still alive

Is it just a coincidence
To see you by yourself with no direction?
Now it's time to move on
And don't you know that things aren't getting better?

And how long would it take me
To walk across the United States all alone?
The west coast has been traumatized
And I think I'm the only one still alive

When the world caves in whatcha you going to do?
When the world caves in whatcha you going to do for me?
When the world caves in whatcha you going to do?
When the world caves in whatcha you going to do for me?
Don't try and stop me because I'm falling fast
(When the world caves in whatcha you going to do?)
Into this pit of fire which surrounds us all
(When the world caves in whatcha you going to do for me?)
In a blanket of fear that I've been wrapped in for years
(When the world caves in whatcha you going to do?)
Don't try and stop me, you can't stop me
(When the world caves in whatcha you going to do for me?)

And how long would it take me
To walk across the United States all alone?
The west coast has been traumatized
And I think I'm the only one still alive
And how long would it take me
To walk across the United States all alone?
The west coast has been traumatized
And I think I'm the only one still aliveEmbed
