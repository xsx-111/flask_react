Clarity Lyrics
I'll take your words as if you were talking to me
So say what I know you'll say
Say it through your teeth

Now in the deep and down, your heart moves
Now in the deep and down
I don't know how, but I know I want out

Wait for something better
Will I know when it can be us?
Wait for something better
Maybe that doesn't mean us
Wait for something better?
I shouldn't, it's not enough
Pull one excuse from another

And with pride, keep every failure in
And with pride, hold on to your sinking

Now in the deep and down, your heart moves
Now in the deep and down
I don't know how, but I know I want out
Wait for something better
Will I know when it can be us?
Wait for something better
Maybe that doesn't mean us
Wait for something better?
I shouldn't, it's not enough
Pull one excuse from another
This time it means stop
Pull one excuse from another
This time it means us
Wait for something better
Will I know when it can be us?
Wait for something better
Maybe that doesn't mean us
Wait for something good?
No, I shouldn't, it's not enough
Pull one excuse from another
This time it means stopEmbed
