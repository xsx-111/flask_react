Table for Glasses Lyrics
Sweep the dirty stairs
The ones I waited on
This is just for me
I felt it watching her

And it happens too fast
To make sense of it, make it last
It happens too fast
To make sense of it, make it last

Where do you intend to go
With your dirty dress?
Lead my skeptic sight
To the table and the light

It happens too fast
To make sense of it, make it last
It happens too fast
To make sense of it, make it last

Lead my skeptic sight
Lead my skeptic sight
Not asking of me anything
Saying nothing about what it means
Without anybody telling me
How I should feel
Lead my skeptic sight
To the table and the light2Embed
