Your New Aesthetic Lyrics
We're lowering the standard in a process selective
The formula's too thin
But it takes more than one person
So everyone jump on
I'll miss you when you're just like them

Imitate and water down
(Selection breathes on its own)
Before the crash, I'll write it out
(Selection breathes on its own)
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
(Take back the radio)

I remember back then thinking
Easy comes but doesn't stay
What comes easy never stays
But the politics need means
And business never leaves
You better sing now while you can
(Better sing now while you still can)

Imitate and water down
(Selection breathes on its own)
Until we crash, I'll write it out
(Selection breathes on its own)
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
(Take back the radio)
Sing now while you can, while you can
Sing now while you can, while you can

Imitate and water down
(Selection breathes on its own)
Until I crash, I'll write it out
(Selection breathes on its own)
Make them open the request line
Let selection kill the old
(Turn off the radio)

But it takes more than one person
So everyone jump on
I'll miss you when you're just like themEmbed
