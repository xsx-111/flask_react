Lakeside Park Lyrics
Midway hawkers calling "Try your luck with me"
Merry-go-round wheezing the same old melody
A thousand ten-cent wonders, who could ask for more?
A pocketful of silver, the key to heaven's door

Lakeside Park, willows in the breeze
Lakeside Park, so many memories
Laughing rides, midway lights
Shining stars on summer nights

Days of barefoot freedom, racing with the waves
Nights of starlit secrets, crackling driftwood flames
Drinking by the lighthouse, smoking on the pier
Still we saw the magic was fading every year

Lakeside Park, willows in the breeze
Lakeside Park, so many memories
Laughing rides, midway lights
Shining stars on summer nights

Everyone would gather on the twenty-fourth of May
Sitting in the sand to watch the fireworks display
Dancing fires on the beach, singing songs together
Though it's just a memory, some memories last forever1Embed
