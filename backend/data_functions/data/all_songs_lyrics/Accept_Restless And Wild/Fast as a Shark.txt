Fast as a Shark Lyrics
Heidi, heido, heida
Heidi, heido, heida
Heidi, heido, heida
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Fog in the streets, a church clock beats
Midnight, darkness all around
You better beware, you better take care
Be prepared for the shock

The time has come and he's the one
Who's breathing down your neck
Coming from behind, now it's your time
A loser will die

Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way, track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's on the attack

Surprise attack, coming from the back
An expert of the deadly knack
Just take care, just beware
Be prepared for the fight
Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way, track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's on the attack


Watch out, watch out

Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way, track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's on the attack

Fast as a shark, he'll cut out of the dark
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart
On a one way, track and you're not coming back
'Cause the killer's, 'cause the killer's
'Cause the killer's on the attack, attack, attack
Attack, attack, attack, attackEmbed
