Neon Nights Lyrics

When the day is done the night rolls in
Lonely lovers come alive
Like a heartbeat In a world of sin
Cruising around hungry eyes

Like a midnight train going nowhere
Fading dreams of the city
Penthouse beds, sweet love affairs
Crimes of passion for the pretty
Man in blue on his beat
Unseen faces in the streets

Neon nights, neon nights, endless flame
Neon nights, neon nights, never change
Neon nights, neon nights, endless flame
Neon nights, neon nights

Red-eye whisky and Lady Luck
Have always been good friends
Their love is pain, the same old stuff
Always alone in the end
Could they be me and you?
Watching how the nights move
Neon nights, neon nights, endless flame
Neon nights, neon nights, never change
Neon nights, neon nights, endless flame
Neon nights, neon nights


Neon nights, neon nights, endless flame
Neon nights, neon nights, never change
Neon nights, neon nights, endless flame
Neon nights, neon nights

Neon nights...Embed
