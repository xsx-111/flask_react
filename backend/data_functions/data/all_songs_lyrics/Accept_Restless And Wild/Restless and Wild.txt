Restless and Wild LyricsOkay
Okay, it's restless
Restless, restless
Restless and wild
They're running wild
They're on a down hill ride
Like a rebel they look for more
Too young to die, oh, yeah
Now you know your dreams are useless
And their lies, you'll never tell
'Cause you're so restless (restless and wild)
Restless (restless and wild)
Restless (restless and wild)
Restless, restless and wild
Star born lovers
Angels in the night on a highway
They don't look back
Everybody's lost the way
The little girl wants to be an actress
Young boys are easy riders
They live so restless (restless and wild)
Restless (restless and wild)
Restless (restless and wild)
Restless, restless and wild
Stay down, time will roll on
How do you feel when the night is gone?
Stay down, time will come 'round
You are the man made for highway life
For the highway life
City lights moving on
No tomorrows, no destinations
Like a wheel turning on and on
You're a man born to run
Every world that you have seen was senseless
Keep moving on, there's no other way
'Cause you're so restless (restless and wild)
Restless (restless and wild)
Restless (restless and wild)
Restless, restless and wild1Embed
