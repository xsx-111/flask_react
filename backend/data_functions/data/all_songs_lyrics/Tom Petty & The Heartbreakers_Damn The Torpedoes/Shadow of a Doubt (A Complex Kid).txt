Shadow of a Doubt (A Complex Kid) Lyrics
There goes my baby
There goes my only one
I think she loves me
But she don't want to let on

Yeah, she likes to keep me guessing
She's got me on the fence
With that little bit of mystery
She's a complex kid
And she's always been so hard to figure out
Yeah, she always like to leave me with a shadow of a doubt
Oh!

Sometimes at night, I
Wait around 'til she gets out
She don't like working
She says she hates her boss

But she's got me asking questions
She's got me on defense
With that little certain something
She's a complex kid
And she's always been so hard to get around
Yeah, she always likes to leave me with a shadow of a doubt
Just a shadow of a doubt
She seldom keeps me running
I'm trying to figure out
If she's leading up to something
Oh!


And when she's dreaming
Sometimes she sings in French
But in the morning
She don't remember it

But she's got me thinking about it
Yeah, she's got me on the edge
With that little bit of mystery
She's a complex kid
And she's always been so hard to live without
Yeah, she always like to leave me with a shadow of a doubt

Well, a shadow of a doubt
A shadow of a doubtEmbed
