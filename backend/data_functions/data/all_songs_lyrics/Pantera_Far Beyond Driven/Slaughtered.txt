Slaughtered Lyrics
One's own Kingman
Christ person, woman God
At battle with a mass astringent
The bond that blends
The weak to the wise

It's a safe assumption
You'd want to save me now
I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left
Slaughtered, slaughtered

Brainwashed by me
Myself influence I
Bird brained, world saver
Fake God dead inside you

It's a safe assumption
You'd want to save me now
I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left
Slaughtered, slaughtered
System destroyed, exposed and unployed
The fruit of intention
Cry for their dead, but turning their head to ignore reality's claw
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your arm is your ounce of prevention
Give what you made and
Under your name on your grave is salvation
A big fucking joke
Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king for your own restoration
God is in your chest and faith kills what is precious
For death is unanswered

Slaughtered, slaughtered

Do sin, do sin
Do sin, do sinEmbed
