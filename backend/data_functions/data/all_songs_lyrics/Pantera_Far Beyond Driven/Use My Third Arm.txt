Use My Third Arm Lyrics
Enlight your sense of thought
Of touch, of real, a shield
An underground for this coward

Building
Blood in water scent
It's like a raping
Without judgement
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Serve and protect you
His dick his gun, his brain his badge

A faster way to kill them all would
Take too goddamn long
Absorb through pores the great escape

Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal his displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past
Of what the fuck we live for
Ourselves, ourselves
Ourselves, ourselves
Arm yourself, a branch
A third arm
Expand your health
Crawl inside euphoria

Building
Blood in water scent
It's like a raping
It's entrapment
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Perverted handle
His getting by is a fisted fuck

A faster way to exterminate them
Takes too fucking long
Absorb through pores the great escape

Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal his displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past
Of what the fuck we live for
Ourselves
Half-assed for most his life
Piss poor little ham
Narc boy, a fake fuck limp dick
Sucking up to the man and the world
We need another Cold War

Building
Blood in water scent
It's like a raping
Without judgement
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Perverted handle
His dick his gun, his brain his badge

Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal your displeasure now
Stab his ass, a reminded past
Of what the fuck we're living for

Our fucking selves3Embed
