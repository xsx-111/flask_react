Throes of Rejection Lyrics
This is feeding what I am
It's like salt poured into a deep, infected wound
It's the type of pain you really dig and long for
I've always been insecure to open up and show love
Some pretty girl with long hair, some bald guy writhing

Rejection
The kind that's self induced
Rejection
The tongue that's bitten through
Rejection
The nauseating stab
Rejection
Is feeding what I am

A short fuse
If there really is a God, then it's punishing me constantly
She let me taste that sugarhole and of course, I wanted more
But no, I'm reduced to a Rohypnol snort and a lot of drinks
This shit goes on and on, just look down my pants

Rejection
It ain't a fucking game
Rejection
My human dick to blame
Rejection
A sociopathic plan
Rejection
Is feeding what I am
Rejection
Takes life away from eyes
Rejection
Will give you to the skies
Rejection
It makes me more than a man
Rejection
Is drowning what I amEmbed
