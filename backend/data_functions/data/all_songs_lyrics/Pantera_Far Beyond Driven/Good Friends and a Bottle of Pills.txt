Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills Lyrics
I fucked your girlfriend last night
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love
She called me Daddy
And I called her baby when I smacked her ass
I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight
And I slept with her all over me
From forehead to rib cage I dripped her ass
Sometimes I thought you might be spying
Living out some brash fantasy, but no
You were knocked out
But we were all knocked out you know
In a way

I'm out of my fucking mind
I serve too many masters

We didn't know you'd break the bottle
That the magic came in to use those jagged shards
To cut our wrists and neck
And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude
But you wouldn't know what you were doing
Because I didn't
Your girlfriend could have been a burn victim
An amputee, a dead body
But god damn I wanted to fuck
I'm losing what's left of my fucking mind
I serve too many fucking masters
I fucking told you
I'm losing that fucking every fucking bit
Of a motherfucking mind, you fuck

I told you. I told you motherfucker4Embed
