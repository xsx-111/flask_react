Becoming Lyrics
A long time ago I never knew myself
Then the memory of shame birthed its gift
No more the small one, the weak one, the frightened one
Running from beatings, deflating
I'm becoming more than a man, more than you ever were
Driven and burning to rise beyond Jesus

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I found my life was slipping through my hands
Perhaps through death my life won't be so bad
I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you
Staring through your eyes
Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me
To realize my saving grasp
I of suicide, I the unlord

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize
Godsize!
