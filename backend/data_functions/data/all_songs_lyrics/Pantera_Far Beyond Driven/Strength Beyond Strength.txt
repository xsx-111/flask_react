Strength Beyond Strength Lyrics
There is nothing
No education
No family life to open my arms to
You'd say that my job is today, yet gone tomorrow
I'll be broke in a gutter
I know the opinion
A broken record
Fuck you and your college dream
Fact is we're stronger than all

You're working for perfect bodies
Perfect minds and perfect neighbors
But I'm helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets
And I'm making a fortune
You're muscle and gall
Naive at best
I'm bone, brain and cock
Deep down stronger than all

A sad state of affairs
A crippled America
A pipe dream
Buttfucked
Immune
Stronger than all
We've grown into a monster
An arrogant, explosive motherfuck
Hard as a rock
Shut like a lock
The president in submission
He holds out his hand on your television and
Draws back a stump
It's too late for some, far too late
Far too late!


Hail kings
The new Kings
Stronger than all

A simple process to legalize
There would not be a choice but to take our side
Be there no question of certain strengths
Know this intention
Forever stronger than all
Stronger than allEmbed
