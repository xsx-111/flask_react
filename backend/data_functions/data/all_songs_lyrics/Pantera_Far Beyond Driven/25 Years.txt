25 Years Lyrics
I vent my frustration at you, old man
After years your ears will hear
You screamed, you tried
It's words of a weakling
And promises made by a liar, drunken liar
Now you pick up that splintered chair
That was aiming for your head
A head that should have been long ago kicked in by me
Alone
I won't lose a second of sleep for this
Not again

Don't touch me
No
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me

Orphaned to the dope and drinks
I learned my lesson well, somehow from you
No tears, can't clutch my regrets
But these years of detachment
Have left me with demons now surfacing
I'm becoming more than nothing
You never knew the answers to any of my questions, did you?
You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence
But now you don't have to dump me off
Not again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck no

Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck no
Don't touch me
Never again

I vow, lest I die tomorrow

You'll never be the father I am
The bastard father to the thousands
Of the ugly, criticized, the unwanted
The ones with fathers just like you
We're fucking you back
I'm shoving my life right down your throat
Can I find the guts? Can I feel the heart?
Look at the ground as you choke me up
Does it taste like tequila?
Or failure?
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
We're fucking you back
Fucking you backEmbed
