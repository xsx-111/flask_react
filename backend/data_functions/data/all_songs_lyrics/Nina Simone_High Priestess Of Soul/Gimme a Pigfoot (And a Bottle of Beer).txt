Gimme a Pigfoot (And a Bottle of Beer) Lyrics(1933) wesley "sox" wilson
Up in harlem on a saturday night
Were the highbrows get together, it's just to tight
We all gather at the harlem strut
And what we do is tut tut tut
Ol' hannah brown, from way cross town
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down
Just at the break of day
You could hear old hannah say
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me daddy, cos I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Give the piano player a drink
Cause he brought me down
He just send me right off to sleep
Check all your razors and your guns
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me cos I don't care oh no
Send me cos I don't care
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me daddy, cos I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Give the piano player a drink
Cause he brought me down
He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet
He moves me right off to sleep
Check all your razors check your guns
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me cos I don't care oh no
Send me cos I don't careEmbed
