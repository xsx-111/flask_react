Porgy I Is Your Woman Now LyricsPorgy:
Bess, you is my woman now
You is, you is!
An' you mus' laugh an' sing an' dance
For two instead of one
Want no wrinkle on yo' brow
Nohow
Because de sorrow of de past is all done done
Oh, Bess, my Bess!
Bess:
Porgy, I's yo' woman now
I is, I is!
An' I ain't never goin' nowhere 'less you shares de fun
Dere's no wrinkle on my brow
Nohow
But I ain't goin'! You hear me sayin'
If you ain' goin', wid you I'm stayin'!
Porgy, I's yo' woman now!
I's yours forever -
Mornin' time an' evenin' time an'
Summer time an' winter time
Porgy:
Mornin' time an' evenin' time an'
Summer time an' winter time
Bess, you got yo' man
Bess, you is my woman now and forever.*
Dis life is jes' begun
Bess, we two is one
Now an' forever
Oh, bess, don't min' dose women
You got yo' Porgy
I knows you means it
I seen it in yo' eyes, Bess
We'll go swingin'
Through de years a-singin'
Bess:
Mornin' time an' evenin' time an'
Summer time an' winter time
Porgy:
Mornin' time an' evenin' time an'
Summer time an' winter time
Bess:
Oh, my Porgy, my man, Porgy
Porgy:  My bess, my Bess
Bess: From dis minute I'm tellin' you, I keep dis vow: Porgy, I's yo'
Woman now
Porgy: 
From dis minute I'm tellin' you, I keep dis vow:
Oh, my Bessie, we's happy now. We is one now
*Sung as Bess repeats her part from 'Porgy, I's yo' woman now...'
Through 'I's yours forever -'Embed
