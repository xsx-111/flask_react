Baubles Bangles And Beads LyricsWright, Forrest
Baubles bangles hear how they ring ching-a-lingle
Baubles bangles bright shiny heads sparkles spangles
My heart will sing sing-a-linge
Wearing baubles bangles and beads
I glitter and gleam so make somebody dream
So that some day he may buy me
A ring a-ling a-ling a-ling a-ling
A-ling a-ling a-ling a-lingle
I've heard that's where it leads
Wearing baubles bangles and beadsEmbed
