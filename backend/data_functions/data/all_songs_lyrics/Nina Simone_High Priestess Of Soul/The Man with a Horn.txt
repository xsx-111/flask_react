The Man with a Horn Lyrics
You'll always find me near the man with a horn
Find me there from dark until dawn
'Cause that's a place where music is born so fine

So sweetly he plays and says it so well
Completely, you'll find that you're under his spell

So if you're in the mood for music and love
Just forget the stars up above
For my friends, you'll find you'll be drawn
To the man with a hornEmbed
