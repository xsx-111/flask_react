Blackbird LyricsWhy you wanna fly Blackbird
You ain't ever gonna fly
Why you wanna fly Blackbird
You ain't ever gonna fly
No place big enough for holding
All the tears you're gonna cry
Cause your mama's name was lonely
And your daddy's name was pain
And he called you little sorrow
Cus you'll never love again
Why you wanna fly Blackbird
You ain't ever gonna fly
Why you wanna fly Blackbird
You ain't ever gonna fly
You ain't go no one to hold you
You ain't got no one to care
If you'd only understand dear
Nobody wants you anywhere
So why you wanna fly Blackbird
You ain't ever gonna fly
So why you wanna fly Blackbird
You ain't ever gonna fly
You ain't go no one to hold you
You ain't got no one to care
