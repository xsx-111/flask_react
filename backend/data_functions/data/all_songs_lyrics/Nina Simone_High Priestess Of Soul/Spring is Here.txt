Spring is Here Lyrics
Spring is here
Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here
Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me

Spring is here
Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear
Why doesn't the night excite me?
But maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
Spring is here
Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here
Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here
Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear
Why doesn't the night invite me?
But maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hearEmbed
