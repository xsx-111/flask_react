Bitter-Sweet LyricsWell this is such a sad affair
I've opened up my heart
So many times
But now it's closed
Oh my dear every salted tear
It wrings bittersweet applause
But when the show's in full swing
Every once in a while
High stepping chorus lines
Mean I'm forgetting
Mein lullaby Liebchen
How rich in contrast love can be
Sometimes I'm quite amused
To see it twist and turn
To taste both sweet and dry
These vintage years
Lovers you consume, my friend
As others their wine
Nein, das ist nicht das Ende der Welt
Gestrandet an Leben und Kunst
Und das Spiel geht weiter
Wie man weiß
Noch viele schönste... Wiedersehn
And now, as you turn to leave
You try to force a smile
As if to compensate
Then you break down and cryEmbed
