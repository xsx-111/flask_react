Free Xone Lyrics
Free...
Next song?
Oh boy
Mama Yoke
That used to be my nickname

He was on the airplane
Sitting next to this guy
Said he wasn't too shy
And he seemed real nice
Until he found out he was gay
That's so not mellow

Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
(Now make it mellow)
(Now make it mellow)

Free style
Zone One
(Now make it mellow)
Boy meets boy, boy loses boy
Boy gets cute boy back
(Now make it mellow)
Girl meets girl, girl loses girl
Girl gets cute girl back
(Now make it mellow)
One rule, no rules
One love, free zone
Now, let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
(Now make it mellow)
(Now make it mellow)

Free style
Zone Two
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl
Boy gets cute girl back
Girl meets boy, girl loses boy
Girl gets cute girl back
(Now make it mellow)
Free to be who you really are
One rule, no rules
(Now make it mellow)
One love, free zone

Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
Let's get free
(Now make it mellow)
(Now make it mellow)

Free style
Zone Three
Love your sister
Love your brother
Love yourself
Remember
One rule, no rules
One love, free zone
Free zone, free zone
One rule, no rules
One love, free zone
Free zone, free zone
