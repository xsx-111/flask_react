My Need Lyrics
My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like

I know you know
What exactly is on my mind
I can't help myself
Part of how I feel tonight
Won't make excuses
I just want you inside, baby
We don't need to
Talk about no promises

My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like

Let's just pretend
That we have no more tomorrow
Can we make love
Like it's our last time baby
Let's not get too
Soft and gentle with it 'cause
I am not feelin'
In no mood to play around
My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like

I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
I need you
Like the blues need the pain
I need you
Like the stars need the night
I need you
Like the waves need the sea

My love, my need
Tonight, I feel so tight
My love, my need
Tonight, just how I like

I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
And I need you
Like the blues need the pain
And I need you
Like the stars need the night
I need you
Like the waves need the sea
My love, my love
My love, my love
I need you
Like the flowers need the rain
And I need you
Like the blues need the pain
Like the stars need the night
I need you
Like the waves need the sea2Embed
