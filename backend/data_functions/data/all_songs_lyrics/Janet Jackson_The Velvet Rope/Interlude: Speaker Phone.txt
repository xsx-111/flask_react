Interlude: Speaker Phone Lyrics
Hello?

Hi, it's me

You got me on that damn speaker phone

Yeah, I do

What you doin' with your hands that you can't pick up the phone?

Don't you worry about it, I'm taking care of my business. What you doing?

Hold on. Let me just, okay, here we go, I'm back

I'm going out tonight maybe. Wait hold on...

Your coochie gon' swell up and fall apartEmbed
