Velvet Rope Lyrics
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope

We all wanna feel special

This special need that's within us
Brings out the best, yet worst in us
Follow the passion that's within you
Living the truth will set you free

We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope
We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope
Put others down to fill us up
Oppressing me will oppress you
Outside leave judgment, outside leave hate
One love's the answer you'll find in you

We have a special need (Have a special need)
To feel that we belong (Belong, belong)
Come with me inside (Come with me, come with me)
Inside my velvet rope


We have a special need
To feel that we belong
Come with me inside
Inside my velvet rope4Embed
