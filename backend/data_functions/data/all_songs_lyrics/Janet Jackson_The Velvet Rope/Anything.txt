Anything Lyrics
Hold me
Kiss me
Show me
You wanna be with me
Feel me
Taste me
And maybe
I'll let you have me

When you do convince me
Can't turn back
I'll be your best
You know that good things don't come easy

(Hold me)
So are you ready
(Kiss me)
To journey
(Show me)
Within me
(Feel me)
I'll satisfy you
(Taste me)
I will do anything
(Have me)
You ask me to
(Ask me)
Anything
(With me)
Anything
When you do convince me
Can't turn back
I'll be your best
You know that good things don't come easy

(Hold me)
So are you ready
(Kiss me)
To journey
(Show me)
Within me
(Feel me)
I'll satisfy you
(Taste me)
I will do anything
(Have me)
You ask me to
(Ask me)
Anything
(With me)
Anything
(Hold me)
So are you ready
(Kiss me)
To journey
(Show me)
Within me
(Feel me)
I'll satisfy you
(Taste me)
I will do anything
(Have me)
You ask me to
(Ask me)
Anything
(With me)
Anything
When you do convince me
Can't turn back
I'll be your best
You know that good things don't come easy

(Hold me)
So are you ready
(Kiss me)
To journey
(Show me)
Within me
(Feel me)
I'll satisfy you
(Taste me)
I will do anything
(Have me)
You ask me to
(Ask me)
Anything
(With me)
Anything

So are you ready
I will do anything
For you3Embed
