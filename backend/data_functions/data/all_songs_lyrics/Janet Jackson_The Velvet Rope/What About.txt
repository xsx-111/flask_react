What About Lyrics
We walked along the beach, what a moon lit night
He held my hands in his, he kissed me, he said
"I wanna spend my life with you, I want you for my wife"
Just then I thought:

What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?

I took a pause then a deep sigh
He looked right into my eyes as he said
"I know I didn't say somethin' wrong"
I didn't have the courage to say but then I thought:

What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you hit my face?
What about the times you kept on when I said, "No more please"
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you shamed to me?
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head
What about that, what about that?
Don't wanna live my life in misery
Don't tell me you did it cause you love me
I don't believe, I'm sick and tired, your deceptive games
Wonder, where you have been, I can't live life wondering

My heart was poundin' but the time had come
To stop lettin' my whisperin' heart control me
And tellin' my screamin' mind what to do
I looked him straight in the eyes and then I said:

What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you hit my face?
What about the times you kept on when I said, "No more please"
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you shamed to me?
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you lied to me?
What about the times you said no one would want me?
What about all the shit you've done to me?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you yelled at me?
What about the times I cried? You wouldn't even hold me
What about those things?
What about that, what about that?
What about the times you shamed to me?
What about the times when you said you didn't fuck her?
She only gave you head
What about that, what about that?1Embed
