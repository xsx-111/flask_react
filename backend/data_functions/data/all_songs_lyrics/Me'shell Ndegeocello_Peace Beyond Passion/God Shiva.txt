God Shiva Lyrics
God Shiva is imminent love and transcendent reality
God Shiva my supreme reality

I am here no longer a vision birthed into my body
I accept praise, blame, joy, sorrow
I realize we are in truth the truth we seek god
Perfect this very moment

God Shiva (my love supreme) is imminent love and transcendent reality
God Shiva my supreme reality

So desire no more what you already possess
You are already free
Your divine nature is to love
My soul identical to god
On a journey to return to my creator
To a peace far beyond passion
A state of bliss

God Shiva is imminent love and transcendent reality
(My love, how sweet the fruits of his love)
God Shiva my supreme reality
You are my mind of the mind
My eye of eye
The life of my life
You are my mind of the mind
My eye of eye
Do you my soul I have realized
Free me from this life

God Shiva is imminent love and transcendent reality
God Shiva my supreme reality

You are truth
The truth you seek
Beyond truth
The truth you
You are in truth
The truth you seek
Free me from this world
Free me from my body
Free me from this world
My supreme reality
Imminent love
Is imminent love
Is imminent love
Transcendent reality
Is imminent love
My supreme realityEmbed
