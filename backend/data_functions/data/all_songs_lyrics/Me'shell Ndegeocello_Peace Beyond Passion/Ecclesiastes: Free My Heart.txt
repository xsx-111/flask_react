Ecclesiastes: Free My Heart Lyrics
The sun rises and the sun goes down and hastens back to the place Where it rose that from thence it may rise again
Finding all things wearisome unsatisfied my eyes not satisfied with Seeing, my ears unsatisfied with hearing
Wondering of that which is now that which has been and that which is to be
For my time on earth I pay dearly for the past
Confusion embraces my heart for to know self is to forgive self my On my sojourn of truth

Free my heart so my soul may fly
Free my mind of my worldly wants and desires
I look towards heaven with my arms open wide
Take my hand come and take my hand

Sadness fills my heart
Too weak to get by, slave to discontentment and self-pity
One generation passes and another generation comes
But change abides forever
I come forth from my mother's womb and naked shall I return to the earth to go as I came
Taking nothing of this supposed worldly gain
I'm so ready to go

Free my heart so my soul may fly
Free my mind of my worldly wants and desires
I look towards heaven with my arms open wide
Take my hand come and take my hand
Free my heart so my soul may fly
Free my mind of my worldly wants and desires
I look towards heaven with my arms open wide
Take my hand come and take my hand
Come and take my hand


Free my heart so my soul may fly
Free my mind of my worldly wants and desires
I look towards heaven with my arms open wide
Take my hand come and take my hand
I'm so ready to go
Free my heart so my soul may fly
Free my mind of my worldly wants and desires
I look towards heaven with my arms open wide
Take my hand come and take my hand

Come and take my hand
Come and take my hand
Come and take my hand
Come and take my hand
Free my heart
Come and take my hand, babyEmbed
