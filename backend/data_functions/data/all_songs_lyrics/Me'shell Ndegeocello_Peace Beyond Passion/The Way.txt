The Way Lyrics
Jesus cured the blind man so that he could see the evils of the world
Perchance blindness is but a dark thought overcome by the light
Maybe Judas was the better man and Mary made a virgin just to save face
I too am so ashamed on bended knees
Prayin' to my pretty white Jesus

They say you're the way, the light
The light is so blinding
Am I not to question
Your followers condemn me
Your words are used to enslave me
Hear my prayers
My sweet Jesus
I heard that you can save me

Dear Brother John Paul convinced himself of his wisdom to judge to forgive to condemn
Mother Mary full of grace I'm so confused by his pale white face
God so loved the world he gave his only son
While many mothers bear children martyrs of greed bitter love
While the so called chosen, they make war
So many die in the name of god their faith at a closed door

They say you're the way, the light
The light is so blinding
Am I not to question
Your followers condemn me
Your words are used to enslave me
Hear my prayers
My sweet Jesus
I heard that you can save me
The way
So blinding
Condemn
Hear my prayer
Na na na hey
Na na na hey
Na na na hey

They say you're the way, the light
The light is so blinding
Am I not to question my love
Your followers condemn me
Your words are used to enslave me
Have you forsaken me?
They say you're the way, the light
The light is so blinding
Tell me why
Your words enslaved those before me
Have you forsaken me?
My sweet Jesus
I heard that you could save me
My sweet Jesus
I heard that you could save me
My sweet savior save me
I heard that you could save me
