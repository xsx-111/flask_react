A Tear and a Smile LyricsWhen we make love I feel it so deeply
When we make love I cry
When you kiss me my lips they burn with fear
For even a love that crowns may crucify
In the cradle of creation between the hand of love I died and there you were
I was warmed amidst the gaze of your eyes, our minds wounded
By The need for understanding, our bodies betrayed by time
Do you hear me can you taste my pain for love has no other desire but to fulfill itself
But to deny yourself the pleasure of that pain is to love selfishly
I stood there
Your heart lay captive in a cage fashioned by your fears not knowing what to say
You have many lovers and yet I alone love you far beyond any lily white fairy tale
I would not exchange the sorrows of my heart for the joys of the multitude
And I would not have the tears that sadness makes to flow from my every part turn into laughter
I want the hunger for your love and beauty to fill me from the depths of my spiritEmbed
