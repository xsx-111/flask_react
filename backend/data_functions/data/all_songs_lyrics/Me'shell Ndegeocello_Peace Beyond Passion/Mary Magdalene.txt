Mary Magdalene Lyrics
I often watch you the way you whore yourself
You're so beautiful
You flirt, tease, enviously I wish you'd flirt with me
Perhaps I'm enticed by what you are
I imagine us jumpin' the broom, foolish I know
'Cause that's not the life you live
You live alone, in a crowded bed
Never remembering faces, conversations
Just the body for the lonely
Spend one night with me, satisfy me for free
I'll love you endlessly
Yourself and that you
Give them what they want
So give me what I want

Tell me I'm the only one, give me
I want to marry you
Tell me I'm the only one
Forgive me for what I want
Tell me I'm the only one, give me
I want to marry you
Tell me I'm the only one, baby

In a harlot's dress you wear the smile of a child
With the faith of Mary Magdalene
Yet you wash the feet of unworthy men
Come and I'll set you free
Into an endless valley of fruits both sweet and sour
And whatever displeases your palate
My kisses will wash away, stay
If you must dance, dance for me
So blessed are the pure at heart
For they shall see God
So close your eyes and dream
For the world will blind you
And I'll judge not
So that I may not be judged
Give me what I want
Tell me I'm the only one, give me
I want to marry you, babe
Tell me I'm the only one, the only one
Yes babe, tell me

Give me
Tell me

Tell me I'm the only one
I'm the only one, give me
(Satisfy me for free)
I want to marry you
Tell me I'm the only one, give me
Satisfy me for free
Tell me
Tell me I'm the only one
Satisfy me for free
Satisfy me for free
Tell me, tell me I'm the only one
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
So blessed are the pure in heart
Satisfy me for free
Close your eyes
Tell me I'm the only one
Satisfy me for free
Tell me I'm the only one
Satisfy me for freeEmbed
