Who Is He and What is He to You Lyrics
A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground
I don't know who he is but I think that you do
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?

I have something in my heart and in your eyes
Tell me, he's not someone just passin' by
And when you cleared your throat, was that your cue?
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Who is he and what is he to you?

Now when I add the sum of you and me
And I get so confused, I keep coming up with three
Now, you're too much, too much, too much for one
But not enough for two
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?

Well I know you think I'm one not much for my intuition
Is that what you're really thinkin'
Or are you wishin'?
Before you wreck your old home, be certain of the new
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Yeah
Who is he and what is he to you?
You, you, come here, let me talking to you
Who is he and what is he to you?
Let me know what's going on
Who is he and what is he to you?
Tell me, tell me, you gotta let me know
Who is he and what is he to you?
You gotta let me know
Who is he and what is he to you?
Tell me, tell me, who is he?
Who is he and what is he to you?Embed
