Leviticus: Faggot Lyrics
Hey faggot, better run learn to run cause Daddy's home
Daddy's sweet lil' boy, just a little too sweet
Every night the man showed the faggot
What a real man should be
But the man and the faggot will never see
For so many can't even perceive a real man, tell me
Not that the faggot didn't find a woman
Fine and beautiful, he admired, desired their desires
He wanted love from strong hands
The faggot wanted the love of a man

His mother would pray
Save him, save him, save him from this life
His mother would pray (pray)
Save him, save him from this life
Save him, save him from this life
(mama what you gonna do now)

Go to church boy, faggot, you just a prisoner
Of your own perverted world
No picket fence, stop acting like a bitch
That's all he sees, ain't that what faggot means
No love dreams, only the favors sweet
Michael performed for money to eat
Cause the man kicked the faggot
Out the house at 16, Amen Mother, let it be
Before long, he was crowned queen
For all the world to see, his bloody body face down
All hail the queen, the wages of sin
Are surely death, child, that's what Mama used to say
So there was no sympathy
His mother would pray
Save him, save him, save him from this life

Let he without sin
Walk amongst the hated and feared
And know true trial and tribulations
See my dear, we're all dying for something
Searchin' and searchin'

His mother would pray
Save him, save him, save him from this life

Beautiful angels, dance around my soul
As I rideEmbed
