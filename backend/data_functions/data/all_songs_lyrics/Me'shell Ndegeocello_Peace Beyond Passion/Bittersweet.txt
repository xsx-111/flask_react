Bittersweet LyricsYou enchant me so my bittersweet flower
Mystery of the sages come into my realm of imagination let me digest you
You enchant me so my bittersweet flower
Shall we make love feel the waves of the ocean come to rest in the eye of a storm
I cry myself to sleep over you
You come then you go
The more I fall the more you let go
The sweet taste of you stains my lips
Even through the pain it's only you I miss
Unlike those before I wanna free you
Let the sweetness of your kiss rush over me
I search so many lifetimes
Let my soul rest in your arms
And I'll let you insideEmbed
