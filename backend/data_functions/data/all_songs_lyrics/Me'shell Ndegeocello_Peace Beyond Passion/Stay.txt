Stay Lyrics
I want you, I can't get you off my mind
Ooh, you turn me on, stay
I want you, I can't get you off my mind
Ooh, you turn me on, stay

I know you think it's wrong being here alone with me
But I wanna understand you and the way you feel
You must feel something or you wouldn't have let me get this far
So don't be afraid just give in

Ooh baby, come on and just let me
Ooh baby, come on and just let me

I want you, I can't get you off my mind
Ooh, you turn me on, stay
I want you, I can't get you off my mind
Ooh, you turn me on, stay

If you let me have you just this once
I promise never to want you anymore
'Cause what's happening here just feels so good
I must admit the forbidden always arouses my temptations
Ooh baby, come on and just let me
Ooh baby, come on and just let me

I know you want me to lie to you, to myself
And pretend that I don't care
You just don't understand
You're all I ever think about
I'm thinking about you

I want you, I can't get you off my mind
Ooh, you turn me on, stay
(I'm wishing I had you)
I want you, I can't get you off my mind
Ooh, you turn me on, stay

Do you think about me?
Do you feel the way I do?
I want you

I want you, I can't get you off my mind
Ooh, you turn me on, stay
Yeah baby, it's like you seem to understand me
I want you, I want you
I want you so bad, I can taste youEmbed
