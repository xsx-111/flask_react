The Creeper Lyrics
Oh, listen to my story:

Life is getting stranger baby
As I travel on
People don't know the difference no more
Between right and wrong

Say it's going to be a cold dark night
When the creeper comes along
Watch out for the steel blade, baby
All shiny and long

I say it's going to be a cold dark night
Oh, when the Creeper come along. Yea

He's tall, he's short, he's fat, he's thin
He's out for vengeance, he's out to win
The road he walks is dark and dim
Don't let him catch you out on a limb
He'll cut your throat, baby
He'll stick you in the back
Drive off in your Cadillac
He's more trouble than you think
He'll kill you sugar, leave you in the drink

Yea the enemy of society
Hurts the people everyday
The law's out to catch him, baby
But there just ain't no way

I say it's gonna be a cold dark night
When The Creeper come along
Watch out for the steel blade, baby
All shiny and long
I say it's gonna be a cold dark night
Lord, when The Creeper come along
