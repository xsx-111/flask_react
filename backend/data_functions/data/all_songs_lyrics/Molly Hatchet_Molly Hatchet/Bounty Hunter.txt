Bounty Hunter LyricsMy horse is kicking dust up off the trail
I'm just getting back from a trip to HELL
My six gun she's strapped by my side
Thunder is the horse that I ride
And it seems to me this is one hell of a way
For a man like me to earn that pay
Chorus:
Outlaws on the loose
Running, running from the noose
Blue steel flashing, hot lead flying
I wonder what they feel like when they're dying
Someday soon it might be my turn
Is it worth the money I earn?
And it seems to me this is one hell of a way
For a man like me to earn that pay
Chorus:
Outlaws on the loose
Running, running from the noose
I'm a bounty hunter, I'll hunt you down, yeah, I will
LEAD BREAK
Did you know $500 will get your head blown off?
It will....ha, ha, ha
Blue steel flashing, hot lead flying
I wonder what they feel like when they're dying
Someday soon it might be my turn
Is it worth the money I earn?
And it seems to me this is one hell of a way
For a man like me to earn that pay
Chorus:
Outlaws on the loose
Running, running from the noose
(REPEAT)
I'm a bounty hunter going to hunt you downEmbed
