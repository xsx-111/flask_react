Gator Country Lyrics
Well, I've been to Alabama people, ain't a whole lot to see
Skynyrd says it's a real sweet home, but it ain't nothing to me
Charlie Daniels will tell the good lord lives in Tennessee (Ha!)
But I'm going back to the gator country where the wine and women are free

There's a gator in the bushes, he's calling my name
And a saying come on boy, you better make it back home again
Many roads I've traveled they all kind of look the same
There's a gator in the bushes, Lord, he calling my name

Old Richard Betts will tell you Lord he was born a Ramblin' Man
Well he can ramble back to Georgia but I won't give a damn
Elvin Bishop out struttin' his stuff with little Miss Slick Titty Boom
But I'm going back to gator country to get me some elbow room


There's Marshall Tucker riding a rainbow searching for a pot of gold
Well they can take the highway, baby, and they can take all they can hold
The Outlaws down in Tampa town it's a mighty fine place to be
They got green grass and they got high tides and sure looks good to me

Oh gator country
A little bit of that chomp chompEmbed
