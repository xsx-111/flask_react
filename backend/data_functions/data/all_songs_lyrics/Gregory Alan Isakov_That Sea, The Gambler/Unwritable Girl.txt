Unwritable Girl LyricsWanna write one for you..
The unwritable girl
Who sleeps in my hand
In this interstate world
Who leaves me for dead
In my ghost town grey
And returns like color t.v
And I've tried to run
My little miles
Stumble over my sin
You'll never find me out
It's been just one dream
We're living in
But you're still, and you're bright and you're quiet
In the heart of it1Embed
