Raising Cain LyricsLast night I dreamed I was Brooklyn on my own
Last night I dreamed I was Brooklyn on my own
Lord I couldn't see the shadows all in me
I dreamed I was in Brooklyn on my own
Now those demons had there face bright as gold
Those demons had their faces bright as gold
They came and shook my hand, fingers crossed behind their back
Those demons had their faces bright as gold
So I'm sittin' by my lonesome in the light
I'm sittin' by my lonesome in the light
I don't know what I see, that light plays tricks on me
I'm sittin' by my lonesome in the light
And I don't know what's ahead up comin' next
The wind shakes me feet, rattles my head
There's no tellin' home, just a sign up all alone
Sayin' oh, oh Elizabeth
And that season came in quiet with the rain
And loving you was just like raising Cain
It was strong and bound for glory, and cursed with a thousand stories
Oh that season came in quiet with the rain
So I'm pickin' up the pieces where I went wrong
Oh, I'm pickin' up the pieces where I went wrong
And there's somethin' so familiar, like an old bedtime song
I'm pickin' up the pieces where I went wrongâ€¦Embed
