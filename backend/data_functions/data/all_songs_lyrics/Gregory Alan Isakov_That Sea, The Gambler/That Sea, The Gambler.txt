That Sea, The Gambler LyricsCurse at your captain and stow me below
Hold me amongst all your cards
Oh we were sea bound and aimless at best
Clutching to the wheel and those charts
But that sea was just a gambler at heart
Oh there we were; the sun hit the starboard
And we were as free as we could be
We waited for land; oh we waited for thee
We aimed to stay calm and cool
But that sea was just a gambling fool
Come to me, Mary come; you know you once were queen
The ocean is holding all the kings
And tossed aside the weary
How I'd love to steer you straight into those waters
While those daunting clouds above began to pour
And when we're found, we'll kiss that ground
And roll around on that lovers floor
Come to me, Mary come; you know you once were queen
The ocean is holding all the kings
And tossed aside the weary
The ocean holding everything
And tossed aside the weary
Aw that dreadful, gambling sea2Embed
