The Moon Was Red and Dangerous LyricsWater street is just the same
Oh, honey come back to me
You see it's lonely and grey in the city
But oh the sun will surely rise
Warm my clothes, and warm your eyes
From the treacherous night
How the moon was red and dangerous
Come back ya hear
All the loneliest stories will fade
I still see your face…on the ground
Now there's no one around
All the birds and whispers play
Oh, honey come back to me
You know that treacherous ride in the city
And oh the sun is surely risin'
It came as no surprise
And the hills on the countryside are singin'
What kind of crime
Must we give out this time to know
How the lines move across this place
But there's nobody else
There's nobody else…
