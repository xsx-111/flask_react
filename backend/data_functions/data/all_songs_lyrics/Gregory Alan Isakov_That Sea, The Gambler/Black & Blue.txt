Black & Blue LyricsI see boxes…
Fills up a room
All the things I never told you still glooming
And I try though, I try though
Talking never seems to do it
I miss the taste of you, red hearts and the dust of June
Oh I miss the taste of you…
The night now, its as dark as the crows
That call me in the discernment above…
Still they won’t let me be
Two hearts gone black and blue
Oh they won't let me be … closer to you
I miss the taste of you
Red hearts and the dust of June
Oh, I miss the taste of you
Red hearts gone black & blue
Everything you ever do
Is a sigh and a cry
A cry
