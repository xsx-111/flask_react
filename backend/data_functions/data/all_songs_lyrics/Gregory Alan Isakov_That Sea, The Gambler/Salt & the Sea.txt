Salt & the Sea LyricsTrain station, I know you all too well
Tainted in salutation
And iâ€™m going back where I belong
With the salt and the sea and the stones
Save them all for me
Train station, I know you all too well
From the boarding we all came and fell
Into your room
The tracks raced beneath our feat
Through square windows, so clean
Well I could see them walking away
I belong with the salt and the sea and the stones
Save them all for me
As you lay sleeping on the cloth seat beside me
I stood awake there dreaming
Some other form to be
And the words you could say
That would always keep me near
Is stay..stay
I belong with the salt and the sea and the stones
Save them all for meEmbed
