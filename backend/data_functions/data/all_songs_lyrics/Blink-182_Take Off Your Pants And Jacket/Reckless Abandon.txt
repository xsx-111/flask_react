Reckless Abandon Lyrics
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on...

I learned a lot today, not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass, kissed every girl in class
Everybody would waste it all to have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun, fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on

And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra-large

Sip a drink of the alcohol, end up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movement's slow, too high, got vertigo
He took a shit in the bathroom tub and fed the dog brownie drugs
Tried hard to not get caught, he fucked a chick in the parking lot
On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on

And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra-large


Break a window and bust a wall, making fun of your friend's mom
Turn the music up way too loud, charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all to have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun, fucked up when it's all done

On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong, this is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song to lead you on

And break the truth with more bad news
We left a scar, size extra-large...6Embed
