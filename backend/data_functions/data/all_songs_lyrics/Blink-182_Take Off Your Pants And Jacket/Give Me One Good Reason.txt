Give Me One Good Reason Lyrics
Mom and dad, they quite don't understand it
All the kids, they laugh as if they planned it
Why do girls wanna pierce their nose
And walk around in torn pantyhose? Oh yeah
I like the ones who say they listen to the punk rock
I like the kids who fight against how they were brought up
They hate the trends and think it's fucked to care
It's cool when they piss people off with what they wear, oh yeah

So give me one good reason, why we need to be like them?
Kids will have fun and offend, they don't want to, and don't fit in

Hate the jocks and preps, the hippie fucking scumbags
Heavy metalers with their awful pussy hairbands
Counting seconds until we can get away
Ditching school almost every single day, oh yeah

So give me one good reason, why we need to be like them?
Kids will have fun and offend, they don't want to and don't fit in

So give me one good reason, why we need to be like them?
Kids will have fun and offend, they don't want to and don't fit in...9Embed
