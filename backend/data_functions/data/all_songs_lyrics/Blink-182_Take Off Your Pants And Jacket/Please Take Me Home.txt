Please Take Me Home Lyrics
Oh no, it happened again
She's cool, she's hot, she's my friend
I'd drive for hours, it's so
You leave me nowhere to go

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

I hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest, this breaks my heart

She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong
Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Why did we have to go date?
It's too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart (Be strong when things fall apart)
Honest, this breaks my heart (It's so hard)
Let's go!

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had12Embed
