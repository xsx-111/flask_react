What Went Wrong Lyrics
I'm sick of always hearing
All those sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over-sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah
I hate our favorite restaurant
Our favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high, and never answer the phone

I can't forgive, can't forget
Can't give in, what went wrong?
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place, it's fucking cursed, and it's plagued
And I can never escape when my heart, it explodes

I can't forgive, can't forget
Can't give in, what went wrong?
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life

I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me, what went wrong
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me, what went wrong
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me, what went wrong
I'm kicking out fiercely at the world around me, what went wrong
I'm kicking...5Embed
