Every Time I Look for You Lyrics
Never found out why you left him, but this answer begs a question
Too blind to see tomorrow, too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid (left wide open)
Hearts are wasted (lives are broken)

One more point of contention, I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions, betray my short attention
Span the distance (bridge the border)
Beg forgiveness ('round the corner)

Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down once more

Will the last one out, please shut the door

More time apart will give you a few more months to argue
Is this too much to live through, it always seems too far to drive
The point home (send more letters)
Pray tomorrow (ends up better)
Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down once more

Will the last one out, please shut the door


I never did do anything that she asked
I never let what happened stay in the past
I never did quite understand what she meant
In spite of everything, in spite of everything

Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down

And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down...5Embed
