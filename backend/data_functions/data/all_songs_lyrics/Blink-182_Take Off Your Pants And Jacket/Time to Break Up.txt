Time to Break Up Lyrics

I guess it's only the men who get fucked now and again
We take our chicks to the mall, we wait in parking stalls, and
When we come home too late, she's pissed that she had to wait
And my excuse not to call, it never worked at all

Time to wake up, where's your daughter?
Hurts to break up, she was stronger
All my friends say, "Please don't love her"
What did I gain? Now I miss her so

I used to hate the lipstick, it stained and tasted so sick
The pantyhose and the bras, she threw on my guitars
Shit, fuck! I made a mistake, I thought I needed a break
The truth is I'm such a dick, it's broke and can't be fixed

Time to wake up, where's your daughter?
Hurts to break up, she was stronger
All my friends say, "Please don't love her"
What did I gain? Now I miss her so
If you want to call it a heartache
Then I shouldn't regret those things, I miss her
If you want the pain to go away
Better suck up your pride and admit you lost her
Let her go, move on, let her go, move on, let her go

Time to wake up, where's your daughter?
Hurts to break up, she was stronger
All my friends say, "Please don't love her"
What did I gain? Now I miss her so

Move on, let her go, move on
Let her go, move on, let her go, move on, let her go7Embed
