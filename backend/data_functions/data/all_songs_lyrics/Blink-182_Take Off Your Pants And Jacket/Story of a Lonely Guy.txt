Story of a Lonely Guy Lyrics
Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster just in time
I need a drink, cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance, avoided hazards
Checked my engine, I fell behind

Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh, I fell behind
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone, I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm a fuckin' boy

Remember when I was in
The grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh, who fell behind
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storm's gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this, like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm a fuckin' boy


Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh
Duh da, duh da, duh da, duh da duh

She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move, 'cause I'm still just a
Stupid, worthless boy...14Embed
