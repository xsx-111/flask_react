Stay Together for the Kids Lyrics

It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted, it's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home?
I'd read it every day

So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

It's not right...

Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants, then why is there so much pain?
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

It's not right...


So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost?

It's not right...
It's not right...
It's not right...
It's not right...
