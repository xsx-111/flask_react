Roller Coaster Lyrics
Breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here, act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear, can I please go home now?
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in, and there I stayed...

Lay beside me and listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying until the summer comes
I had that dream about you again
Where you drive my car right off a fucking cliff

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time, goodnight

Make me promise that I will never tell
All I remember is the way her bedroom smelled
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in

And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time, goodnight, goodnight...6Embed
