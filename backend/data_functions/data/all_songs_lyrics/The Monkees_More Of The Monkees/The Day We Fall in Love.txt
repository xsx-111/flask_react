The Day We Fall in Love LyricsThere'll be birds singing everywhere
And the wind will be blowin' through your hair
I'll look in your eyes
And wait for the prize
Your lips kissing mine with a love that is real
And you'll look so young and fair
On the day we fall in love
You and me
On the day we fall in love
You'll see
There'll be rainbows reaching across the sky
And we'll both be so happy, we'll cry
We'll walk hand in hand
In snow or in sand
Whether roses are blooming or snowmen stand by
Time will stop for you and I
On the day we fall in love
It will be
On the day we fall in love
You'll see
And if the lines that I say fall apart
It's because I won't know where to start
But you'll understand when I say them to you
'Cause they'll come straight from my heart
On the day we fall in love
You and me
On the day we fall in love
You'll see
You'll see
You'll seeEmbed
