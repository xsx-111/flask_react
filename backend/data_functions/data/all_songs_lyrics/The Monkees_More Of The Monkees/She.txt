She LyricsShe, she told me that she loved me
And like a fool I believed her from the start
She, she said she'd never hurt me
But then she turned around and broke my heart
Why am I standing here
Missing her and wishing she were here
She only did me wrong;
I'm better off alone
She, she devoured all my sweet love
Took all I had and then she fed me dirt
She, she laughed while I was cryin'
It was such a joke to see the way it hurt
Why am I standing here
Missing her and wishing she were here
She only did me wrong;
I'm better off alone
And now I know just why she
Keeps me hangin' 'round
She needs someone to walk on
So her feet don't touch the ground
But I love her
I need her
I want her
Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea! She!
Why am I standing here
Missing her and wishing she were here
She only did me wrong now;
I'm better off alone
Why am I missing her?
I should be kissing her
Why am I missing her?
I should be kissing herEmbed
