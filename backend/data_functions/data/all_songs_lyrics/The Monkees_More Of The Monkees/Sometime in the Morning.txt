Sometime in the Morning LyricsSometime in the morning
A simple thought may occur to you
And you hold her
And tell her all the things you never told her
Your love has shown me things
I never thought I could see
I didn't know (I didn't know)
It could be done so easily
Now I know (Now I know)
You're where it is for me
Sometime in the evening
You're sitting there by the fireside
And she'll touch you
And you'll realize how much you never knew before
How much you couldn't see
You didn't know (You didn't know)
It could be done so easily
Now you know (Now I know)
She's all a girl could be
Now in her childlike eyes
You see the beauty there
You know it was always there
And you need no longer wear a disguise
Sometime in the morning
You'll just reach out and she will be there
Close as the summer air
Sometime in the morning
(She will be there)
She will be there
Sometime in the morning
(She will be there)
She will be there, oh-ohEmbed
