Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow) Lyrics
Look out, here comes tomorrow
That's when I'll have to choose
How I wish I could borrow
Someone else's shoes

Mary (Mary, oh)
Oh, what a sweet girl
Lips like (Berry pie)
Strawberry pie
Sandra (Sandra, oh)
Long hair and beat girl
Can't make up my mind

I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Oh, how I wish tomorrow would never come

Told them (Told them both)
Both that I loved them
Said it (Yes, I did)
And it was true
But I (But I can't)
Can't have both of them
Don't know what to do
I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Oh, how I wish tomorrow would never come

Mary, I love you
Sandra, I love you

Well, I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Oh, how I wish tomorrow would never come, ooh

I love you
Darling
I love youEmbed
