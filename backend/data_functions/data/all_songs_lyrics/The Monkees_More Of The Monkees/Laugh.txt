Laugh LyricsEvery face that I see
Is all wrapped up in frowns
And unfortunately
It kind of gets me down
Laugh
'Cause the music is funny
Yeah, the bass sounds off-beat
Ain't that neat?
Laugh (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
When you lose all your money (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
Or you can't find your shoes (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
To cover your feet (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
It's not so hard to see
Exactly what I'm after
Sometimes a tear should fall
But I require giggles and chuckles (Oh-ho-ho)
Laugh (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
When you're keepin' a secret (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
And it seems to be known (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
By the rest of the world (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
Laugh (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
When you go to a party (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
And you can't tell the boys (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
From the girls (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
Every face that I see
Is all wrapped up in frowns
And unfortunately
It kind of gets me down
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Laugh (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
At the things that are wrong (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
If you thinks it's this song (Yeah, ha-ha-ha. Woo)
Then laugh (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
Then laugh (Oh, ha-ha-ha)
Then laugh (Oh, ha-ha-ha)Embed
