Die Happy Lyrics
So what is this so-so-society?
Still drinking that Kool-Aid like it's free
Still popping that poison, po-po-po
Political you know how it goes

Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?
Is this dystopia?

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the look in your eye)
What will you ask?
(While we wait for the past to arrive)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your head in the sand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)

Die happy
In the summertime
So happy
I could die
This city is thick with common thieves
Still passing around the same disease
Who's running this town and why are we?
Still drinking that Kool-Aid like it's free

In this dystopia
In this dystopia
In this dystopia
In this dystopia

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the look in your eye)
What will you ask?
(While we wait for the past to arrive)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your head in the sand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)

Fame is the bait
(And the switch is your desolate smile)
If I need it
(Though we shelter the thing for a while)
Fame is the bait
(And the switch is the touch of your hand)
Time that we waste
(While we wait for the future to land)
Die happy
In the summertime
So happy
I could die
Die happy
In the summertime
So happy
I could die

Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh
Die happy
Duh duh duh duh duh1Embed
