Risk Lyrics
So you got away, something brought you back
To the kid that you were
For a couple days everything you lacked
You possessed, it was yours

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate

With your hollow eyes, you keep coming back
It begins to transform
Can you spend the night? Can you be the raft?
In the eye of the storm?

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate, the more we accelerate

Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it’s borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words we say to be believed?
I’m already over the thrill of pursuit
Where can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new?

So you're beaten up but you bounce back
It’s all part of the pull
And the story runs like a soundtrack
We repeat 'til we're full

Started slow, started late
Started strong, then we lost faith
Started slow, started to lose control
The more we accelerate, the more we accelerate


Can I send this kiss right to you now?
'Cause the risk belongs with you somehow
Can I return this kiss that you gave?
Already know it’s borrowed anyway
Was the risk I sent to you received?
All the words we say to be believed?
I’m already over the thrill of pursuit
Where can I take the risk I took with you?
Send this kiss to someone new?


So there's no way to hide
Find some daylight
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to try
Find some daylight
Hollow eyes
There's another way to leave the Garden of Eden
And I'm inclined to try1Embed
