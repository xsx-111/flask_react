Underline the Black Lyrics
Underline the black around my eyes
In the dark with heavy chains over my heart
I just look, don't feel like myself at all
And I'm just waiting for the axe to fall
And I'm just waiting for the axe to fall

I came back so late but it was light
And they looked me up and down like an alien arrived
I just walked on by with my old guitar
And they're still waiting for their lives to start
And they're still waiting for their lives to start

I'm not sorry, I don't think of you that often

How can I explain, that feeling remains
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
How can I forget, what reason is left
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
Oh, with the black underlined, oh
Underline the black around my eyes
In the dark with heavy chains over my heart
I just look, don't feel like myself at all
And I'm just waiting for the axe to fall
And they're still waiting for their lives to start
And they're still waiting for their lives to start

I'm not sorry, I don't think of you that often

How can I explain, that feeling remains
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
How can I forget, what reason is left
When I looked at myself, I was somebody else
Mad visions and wild decisions were made
In the alleys that wind through the back of my mind
Oh, with the black underlined
Oh, the back of my mind
Oh, with the black underlined
OhEmbed
