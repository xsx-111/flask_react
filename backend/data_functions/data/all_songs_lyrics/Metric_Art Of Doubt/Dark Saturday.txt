Dark Saturday Lyrics
Somewhere in the South of France
Or the Caribbean sea
She said "I don't need to make a living
Fake diamonds got nothing on me"
I met her in the world below
She's a tourist of the world beneath
I said "everything I built from nothing"
She said "I'm so rich, everything's free"

So dark
It ain't so dark
So dark
It ain't so dark

Forever and never
A torch in search of a flame
To be good, get better
Well I've been feeling this way
Forever and never
A night in search of a day
As anxious as ever
It's such a dark, dark, dark Saturday
What's your name and where you from?
Well I'm worth your weight in gold
While we lie here in the sun
The whole wide world's about to explode
Now our bodies intertwine
And the truth is plain to see
I said "everything I built from nothing"
She said "don't you blame your problems on me"

So dark
It ain't so dark
So dark
It ain't so dark
So dark
It ain't so dark

Forever and never
A torch in search of a flame
To be good, get better
I change by staying the same
Forever and never
A night in search of a day
As anxious as ever
It gets so dark, dark, dark
Shine a light my way
Shine a light my way
Having such a dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday
Shine a light my way

It's such a
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark Saturday2Embed
