No Lights on the Horizon Lyrics
It's true, I'm flawed
It's all my fault
I made every mistake, paper walls break
And it's all falling through

The past, it isn't far away
It's part of all of us, it's here to stay
I'm more than able to follow through
I'm just not for everyone, I might be just for you

If it wasn't for your kindness
I think I might be dead
If it wasn't for the way you said
"Oh, stay with me instead"
No lights on the horizon
No sign of what's ahead
If it wasn't for your kindness lately
I'd never get out of bed

The past, it isn't far away
In spite of all of us, it's here to stay
I'm more than able to follow through
Just not for everyone, maybe just for you
If it wasn't for your kindness
I think I might be dead
If it wasn't for the way you said
"Oh, stay with me instead"
No lights on the horizon
No sign of what's ahead
If it wasn't for your kindness lately
I'd never get out of bed

It's true, I'm flawed
It's all my fault
I made every mistake, paper walls break
And it's all falling through

If it wasn't for your kindness
I think I might be dead
If it wasn't for the way you said
"Oh, stay with me instead"
No lights on the horizon
No sign of what's ahead
If it wasn't for your kindness lately
I'd never get out of bed
Never get out of bed
Never get out of bed
Never get out of bed1Embed
