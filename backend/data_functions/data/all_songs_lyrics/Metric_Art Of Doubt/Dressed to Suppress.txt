Dressed to Suppress Lyrics
And we keep speeding, and we keep speeding
And we keep crashing, and we keep crashing
And we keep reaching, and we keep reaching
And we keep crying 'til we start laughing
Long before my fall from grace
For a piece of me they paid
From the throat, I'm tied to you
All our vows the crowds undo

And the ones in the back cry "wait for me"
And the ones in the front cry "you're too slow, you're too slow"
And the ones who are weak cry "carry me"
And the ones who are strong cry "let me go, let me go"

We reach for the things we idolize
But the rings are just for show
Her beauty is a form of charity
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
(Na na na na na)

Long before my fall from grace
For a piece of me they paid
From the throat I'm tied to you
All our vows the crowds undo

And the ones we ignore cry "come to me" (come to me)
Are the ones we adore cry "give me space, give me space"
And the ones who are cruel cry "beg for me" (beg for me)
And the ones they possess, they love the chase, love the chase

We reach for the things we idolize (idolize)
But the rings are just for show
Her beauty is a form of charity (charity)
Dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress
Dressed to suppress, dressed to suppress all kinds of sorrow

And we keep speeding, and we keep speeding (na na na na na)
And we keep crashing, and we keep crashing (na na na na na)
And we keep reaching, and we keep reaching (na na na na na)
And we keep crying 'til we start laughing (na na na na na)2Embed
