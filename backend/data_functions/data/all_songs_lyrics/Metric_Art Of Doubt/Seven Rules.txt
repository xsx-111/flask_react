Seven Rules Lyrics
Come on, angel, come and save us
Let me see sunrise
Give me something for the one thing
We immortalized
Gaze upon you, turning into
Some desired doll
I'll be there to come and shake you
When your will dissolves

My love
Come out of the woods
Come out of the woods
Now darling
We're out of the woods
We're out of the woods

You're safe in my mind
Some antiquated tune
In my heart some ancient song
A song too blue to even use

Come on inside, it's a long ride
'80s limousine
I'll be tongue-tied, you'll be cross-eyed
On the grainy screen
With a token appreciation
Amateur cigar
Steel-plated, silver-painted
Novelty guitar
For you, well
Isn't it good and isn't it shit?
They lured us away from the beach
And onto the cruise ship

I lied, I lied
And never grew
To be made a lonely child
The seven rules you need to know
In my mind
Some antiquated tune
In my heart some ancient song
A song too blue to even use

I remember the beat and the sound of the bass
When you played all alone
Every possible dream in the head that you held
And the hands that you hold
I remember the beat and the sound of the bass
When you played all alone
Every possible dream in the head that you held
And the hands that you hold
