Now or Never Now Lyrics
It hurts to turn the radio on
My stamina’s gone, my spirit is weak
Because every time I start to move on
Keep hearing that song, I’m brought to my knees
To permanently see in reverse
Take the remorse out of defeat
Because everything that’s under my skin
Where I end and begin still belongs to me

I’m fine to sit and stare at the door
Can’t run anymore, too weary to stand
Abandon the effect with the cause
My life is on pause, it’s out of my hands
To perfectly perform in reverse
There’s no way to rehearse, there’s nothing to plan
Because everything that’s under my skin
Where I end and begin, that’s who I am

Oh, only silence can restore
The sense of place I had before
Oh, only silence can repair
My sense of self I lost somewhere
Oh oh, oh, only silence can restore
The sense of place I had before
Oh, only silence can repair
My sense of self I lost somewhere

Because the last time I let myself feel this way
It was a long, long time ago
And now we get so scared, and we get so scared
To be nowhere left alone
Because the last time you let yourself feel this way
It was a long, long time ago
And now we get so scared, and we get so scared
To be nowhere left alone

Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now
Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now
Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now
Because it’s now or never now
It’s now or never now, now, now, now, now, now, now2Embed
