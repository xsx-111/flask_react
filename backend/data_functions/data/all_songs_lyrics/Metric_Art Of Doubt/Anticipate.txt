Anticipate Lyrics
What did you plan?
What did you anticipate?
All you demand to find
Spiraling down, falling behind
No tomorrow
When you're ahead of your time
What did you want to know?
How does it end? How does it go?

From the bottom I fled
But the stars overhead
Led me away from the ruin
I must say that I was a wreck
Hit the bottom I guess
But the words you once said
Led me away from the ruin
Second sight up ahead

I couldn't withstand
I couldn't anticipate
How low I would go
What did I miss? I didn't know
I didn't know
Now what do you anticipate?
Another catastrophe
Coming around, following me
From the bottom I fled
But the stars overhead
Led me away from the ruin
I must say that I was a wreck
Hit the bottom I guess
But the words you once said
Led me away from the ruin
Second sight up aheadEmbed
