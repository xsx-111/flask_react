California Kids Lyrics
When you wake up, cobwebs on your eyelids
Stuck in rigor mortis
Woah-woah (Wake up)
Just get going 'til you hit the ocean
And you turn Californian
Woah-woah
You don't have to have the answers
Don't you worry
Don't you worry

It's gonna be alright, if you're on a sinking ship (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night thinking about something you did
(Oo-wee-oo)
The California kids will show you the sunshine

In your bare feet in mid-January
Swimming in the mystery
Woah-woah
Second-guessing almost everything
Don't you worry
Don't you worry
It's gonna be alright, if you're on a sinking ship (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night thinking about something you did
(Oo-wee-oo)
The California kids will show you the starlight

All your old friends chilling back in Boston
You never forgot them
Woah-woah

It's gonna be alright, if you're on a sinking ship (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night thinking about something you did
(Oo-wee-oo)
The California kids will show you the sunshine
The California kids will show you the starlight3Embed
