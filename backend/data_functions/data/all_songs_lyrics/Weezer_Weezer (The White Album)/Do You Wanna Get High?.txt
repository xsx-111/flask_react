Do You Wanna Get High? Lyrics (Spoken)
Cue the feedback!
Cue the feedback...

Crush up the blue and inhale through your nose
Scrape every quark from the wood in the floor

She said, "Do you wanna get high? Don’t eat no dinner tonight
I took a road trip to Mexico and scored a hundred count
Do you wanna get high? It’s like we’re falling in love
We can listen to Bacharach and stop at any point"

Now our bones start to ache as we cramp on the pot
And we fall to the floor with our face in a knot

She said, "Do you wanna get high? Don’t eat no dinner tonight
I took a road trip to Mexico and scored a hundred count
Do you wanna get high? It’s like we’re falling in love
We can listen to Bacharach and stop at any point"

Keep on doing what you do ‘cuz I’ll never get tired of you
Don’t need booze, ‘cuz I’ll never get tired of you
Stop the tape, kill the lights, close the drapes
And keep doing what you do, ‘cuz I’ll never get tired of you

She said, "Do you wanna get high? Don’t eat no dinner tonight
I took a road trip to Mexico and scored a hundred count
Do you wanna get high? It’s like we’re falling in love
We can listen to Bacharach and stop at any point"

Sleeping with Mother Theresa, drifting in a lone fantasia
Brahmin you recite the veda, beautiful as euthanasia...7Embed
