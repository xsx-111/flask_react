Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori Lyrics
Oh, she left me there
She left me all alone
Oh, but I don't care
No I don't mind at all
What really happened?
I got distracted
I suck at getting off the phone
Boy in the bubble, saying "I love ya"
I should have written her a note

Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
When I'm feelin' lonely, I don't want to go (oh oh, oh oh)
Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
Wish that they would show me, I can't let them go (oh oh, oh oh)

Oh, she swam away
And flexed her mermaid tail
She was out too deep
When lightning struck the bay
Good witch or bad witch
God is a woman
I wish I hadn't played the prude
She touched my ankle
Paranoid Android
I felt it in my molecules
Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
When I'm feelin' lonely, I don't want to go (oh oh, oh oh)
Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
Wish that they would show me, I can't let them go (oh oh, oh oh)
Slender and tall
They whisked my worries away
Sweet piano melodies play
Feet crushing Sauvignon grapes
I hear them whispering, whispering, out at the pool
Remember when we were only sixteen
You made me believe in God
But when I finally wake
Both girls are gone


Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
When I'm feelin' lonely, I don't want to go (oh oh, oh oh)
Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
Wish that they would show me, I can't let them go (oh oh, oh oh)1Embed
