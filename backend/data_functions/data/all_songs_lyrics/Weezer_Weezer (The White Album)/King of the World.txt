King of the World Lyrics
You walk by the magazines
Sitting on the rack at the CVS
One more sad movie star divorce
Three hundred died in an airplane wreck
And you think of all the people suffering
And you bury that pain
But you can tell me everything
And we'll ride on that wave

If I was king of the world, you'd be my girl
You wouldn't have to shed one single tear unless you wanted to
'Cause, yeah, I know what it's like
If I was king of the world, yeah, girl
We could ride a Greyhound all the way to the Galapagos
And stay for the rest of our lives
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Dad hit you on the hand
Just for holding your chopsticks wrong
Then your Mom locked you in a shed
And Uncle Sam dropped an atom bomb
But you're not alone, you can let it go
And just weep on my breast
And cover me with your tenderness
And that pain will pass
If I was king of the world, you'd be my girl
You wouldn't have to shed one single tear unless you wanted to
'Cause, yeah, I know what it's like
If I was king of the world, yeah, girl
We could ride a Greyhound all the way to the Galapagos
And stay for the rest of our lives
Whoa, whoa, whoa
We are the small fish
We swim together, oh
No Prozac or Valium
We'll face tsunamis together

If I was king of the world, you'd be my girl
You wouldn't have to shed one single tear unless you wanted to
'Cause yeah I know what it's like
If I was king of the world, yeah, girl
We could ride a greyhound all the way to the Galapagos
And stay for the rest of our lives
Whoa, whoa, whoa7Embed
