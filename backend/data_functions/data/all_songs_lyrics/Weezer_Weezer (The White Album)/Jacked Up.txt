Jacked Up Lyrics
If I stay the night
Will I fall in love?
If I stroke your hair
It's gonna hurt so much
Stranded in the Kalahari
Will you share your flask?
If I stay the night
Will I fall in love?

I'm all jacked up
Over you
I'd bury diamonds
Just for you
Oh, why, why, why do my flowers always die?
Why do they die?
I'm all jacked up
Over you

I see you standing there
Without a shred of clothes
And I can break away
From the vein of gold
Come you beautiful alien
Touch me with your light
But if I stay the night
Will I fall in love?
I'm all jacked up
Over you
I'd bury diamonds
Just for you
Oh, why, why, why do my flowers always die?
Why do they die?
I'm all jacked up
Over you

You're the sun that I'm orbiting
I burn in your heat
Supernova and cosmic dust
You spawn galaxies
We'll sleep together
Sleep together
Sleep forever
Sleep together
Sleep forever minus one
Say those forbidden words to me, eagle girl

I'm all jacked up
Over you
I'd bury diamonds
Just for you
Oh, why, why, why do my flowers always die?
Why do they die?
I'm all jacked up
Over you4Embed
