(Girl We Got a) Good Thing Lyrics
Girl, we got a good thing
You know where this is heading (uh-huh)
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing (uh-huh)
Girl, we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?

Jingle, jingle
We're as happy as a couple Hare Krishnas
Dancing, twirling, playing on the tambourine
We'll crush the scene together
Marching onward
Oblivious to all the hate around us
We can self-publish a book of our philosophy
And hand it to the tourists

Girl, we got a good thing
You know where this is heading (uh-huh)
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing (uh-huh)
Girl, we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?
Puerto Rico
Would be perfect for a destination wedding
Or driving to Ventura on the 101
It sounds like fun, to me

You scare me like an open window
Let's chalk it up to Stockholm syndrome
I want to crawl in, crawl into a hole

Girl, we got a good thing
You know where this is heading (uh-huh)
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing (uh-huh)
Girl, we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?
Girl, we got a good thing
Girl, we got a good thing1Embed
