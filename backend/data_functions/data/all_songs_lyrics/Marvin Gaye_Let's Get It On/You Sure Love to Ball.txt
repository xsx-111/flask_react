You Sure Love to Ball Lyrics
Ooh baby, please turn yourself around
Ahh baby, so I can love you
Ohh baby
I'll make you feel so good
Ohh sugar, just like you want me to

Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

Oh honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Ooh baby baby, don't ever go away
Oh, stay with me baby, I'll love you night and day

Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

Ohh now, I just love you that's all
I've got my mind made up baby
There are no doubts (Ohh baby)
That you're my foxy lady, foxy lady
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ball

My lady my baby sure does love to ball
(On my mind there's)
All I know that if we should ever
Ever, ever ever ever part
That one day will surely break my heart
Got to get ready, got to get ready

Ohh baby, you sure love to ball
Ohh baby, you sure love to ballEmbed
