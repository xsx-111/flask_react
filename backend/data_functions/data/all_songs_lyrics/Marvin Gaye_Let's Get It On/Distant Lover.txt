Distant Lover Lyrics
Distant lover, lover (lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover (lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Misery

As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road
Distant lover, ooh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it
Like it was precious a jewel, oh baby
Lord, have mercy

Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say
When you left you took all of me with you
My lord I wonder, do you want to hear me scream?
Please, please, please
Oh please baby
Come back home, little girl
Oh baby please, please3Embed
