If I Should Die Tonight Lyrics
Oh, If I should die tonight
Oh baby, though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar yeah
Because I've known you

Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, darling, have felt their world stand still?

Millions never, they never never
And millions never will baby
They never will

If I should die tonight, love
Darling, far before my time
I won't die blue
Because I've known you

Ooh, I'm so grateful baby
Grateful that you're loving me
My desire
Is to love you 'til
I'm no longer here, and never tire
Love has been so good to me, me now
I'm so thankful
Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, oh darling, have felt their world stand still?
Oh Lord
