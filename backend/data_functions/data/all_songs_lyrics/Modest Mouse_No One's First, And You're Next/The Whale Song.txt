The Whale Song Lyrics
I guess I am a scout
So I should find a way out
So everyone can find a way out
Oh, I guess I am a scout
(They keep us in)
So I should find a way out
So everyone can find a way out
(To pull us out)
I'm rising up
Wish I was sinking down
And it's not like
There was warning
(Well, no one ever got out)
We were happy
(I know I was a scout)
(I should've found a way out)
And it's not like
There was mourning
(Well, no one ever got out)
In the warning

I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone can find a way out
I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone can find a way out
(I know I am a scout)
Instead of seeing, a neighbor out
(I should've found a way out)
(I guess I gotta find a way out)
God, I wish I would've found a way out
(I guess I am a scout)
(So I should find a way out)
It's the last time
(I guess I gotta find a way out)
We were happy
Ever happy

I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone can find a way out
Well, I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone can find a way out
Well, I know I was a scout
I should've found a way out
So everyone can find a way outEmbed
