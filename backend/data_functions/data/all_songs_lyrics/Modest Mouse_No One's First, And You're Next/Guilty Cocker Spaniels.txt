Guilty Cocker Spaniels Lyrics
Well I took off running at the greatest speed
I didn't bother looking to either side of me
Oh I didn't see, I just didn't see
What was really going on

The truth had stopped and the skyline rose
Exchanging comfort for more fashionable clothes
I'd left the hills at this point in time
To run on treadmills in a perfect line

Salad days add up to daily shit
Sparking imagination till the sparks just quit
And if this is fun, why am I so bored with it?
Well, I'll probably never know

Guilty cocker spaniels eatin' table scraps
Well, we rolled over, how our masters clapped
It felt so good, we wanted more than that
But when the program failed they defensively laughed
Saying, "We did things just how you asked
Don't try takin' us to task
You didn't buy a face, nope, just a mask
So happy Halloween!"
I drew a blank, we put it in a frame
Wait, what, you're winning?
You didn't say this was a game
Well, I guess I'll just have to play and play
Until I'm out of cash

Before I could spit it out
I guess the words had burnt my mouth
What can I say?
There's the thought I laid it out
So you could take it out of context either way

We said all along we deserve every bit
And mostly we knew that the supply would quit
But we got going and going just away with it
Until everybody lost their minds

Directly behind being ahead of the time
But don't you worry, it'll fall right in line
Yep, everything just fine, fine, fine
No one's getting blamed this time
Blame me, so blameless
Can we find a way to blame our way out?
Well, I postdated the eulogy
For every blameless body, now now
We are blamelessly teething
On much more than we need now, now now
Blamelessly teething

Well, we're all getting blamed
Cause everyone, every one knew
That's right
Everybody knew everything
Well we're all getting blamed yeah everybody knew
Where to take the blame, blame everybody knew
Well the blame, blame oh, oh everybody knew
Well we're all getting blamed cause everybody knew, everyone2Embed
