Perpetual Motion Machine Lyrics
Daniel read the paragraph
He read until the words ran out
It said, "We're all in trouble now"
Poison in the juice carafe
We drank until our thirst ran out
Oh no, we're in some trouble now

Everyone wants to be a perpetual motion machine
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out

With your teeth to your lips
And your hair to the ground
Well, you hear the fish and they're making this sound
Saying, "We just want to go on walking around
And feel what it's like to fall down"

Patrick ran the race
Yeah, he ran until the tire ran out
Oh no, I'm in some trouble now
Tried to kick it over
I tried until the juice ran out
Oh no, we want more trouble now
Teeth to your lips
And your hair to the ground
Well, you hear the fish and they're making this sound
Sayin', "We just want to go on walking 'round
And feel what it's like to fall down"
I saw
Everyone wants to be a perpetual motion machine
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out
We all try harder as the days run out1Embed
