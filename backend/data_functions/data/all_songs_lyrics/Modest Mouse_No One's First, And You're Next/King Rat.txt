King Rat Lyrics
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, I love this shit)
Well!
Well!
Well!
Well...

We spun like birds on fire
Right down towards the residence
And I, I took all that I desired
Even crooks have to pay the rent
We swam like rats on fire
Right, right down the reservoir
We took all that we could carry
But we tried to carry more

And you know, you know, you know it all went wrong
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong

We choked on straight tap water
Well, I'm going to have to try the real thing
I took your laugh by the collar
And it knew not to swing
Any time I tried an honest job
Well, the till had a hole in it, ha ha
We laughed about paying rent
'Cause the county jails, they're free
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
And you know, you know, you know it was all wrong
Ohh!

Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll, rage of a child
Well, deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll, rage of a child
Oh, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
I said it looks like it's time to use my feet again
Well, I just spent my last one hundred dollars
God, I'll pay my bail again
Oh, I don't care
Oh, I just don't care
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a rag doll shaken and shy
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I went down like a burned out wretch of a child
Well, King Rat has me on his list again
I can never be on the fence again
Well I found out it's all loud open like an organ and he
Talk, talk, talk, talk again
He promised me that when I cheated him
But I could open my eye, well
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
Deep water, deep water, senseless denial
I got fed like a fish full of open smiles
Blue water, deep water, senseless denial
I got fed like a fish on the cardboard smiles

Well, well
What do you have to say for yourself?
I said well, well, well
I said well, well, well, well, well
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky me again
I hardly knew I should use my feet again
(What do you have to say for yourself?
What do you have to say for yourself?)2Embed
