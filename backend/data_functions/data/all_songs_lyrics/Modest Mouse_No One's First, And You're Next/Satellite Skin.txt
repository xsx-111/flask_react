Satellite Skin Lyrics
If you break these moth wing feelings
Powdery dust on your fingers
Well no we're not praying, we're kneeling
Hard enough just to say you believe them
Well, how the heck'd you think you could beat them?
At the same time that you're tryin' to be them
Hard enough just to say you don't need it
When they serve it up, well you will still eat it
Well satellite, and satellite skin

Just to knock just to say you don't visit
Well, everybody's willing to listen
'Cept satellite, satellite skin
You can say what you want, you're forgiven
Well, happy fuckin' congratulations
Where everyone, everyone wins
Just like being my own solar system
Doing good things but then totally eclipse them
Oh, what the use? Oh, what the hell?

If you break these moth wing feelings
Butterfly knife's in the ceiling
Where everyone, everyone's waiting
Detachment gets praised and completed
You can say what you want and not mean it
Well, no one really seems to be waiting
If you sweep up this mess I created
Nothing's left to show I existed
Except satellite, satellite skin
Askin' for a question
Was it easier said than was actually done?
Do you even believe that?
Do you even believe that there's a race to be won?

If you break these moth wing feelings
I have seen it all become satellite skin
Orbiting some eyes
A knack to not that's not  their opinions
Get stacked in all those usual avoided spots
Just to tell you I could not have seen
Through to the gist of those unhappy, happy accidents3Embed
