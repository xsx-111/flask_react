Autumn Beds Lyrics
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds

October came
Our case got stuck with the DA again
They pulled up the welcome mat
So many times they hurt their back
As sure as clocks are bleeding time
We'll show up early just to wait in line

We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping

As August came
Our case is drawing to an end
They said guilty so many times
All I heard was just the buzzing lights
As sure as lead sinks were the same
We're just more laundry that they need to hang
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds

We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping, we won't be sleeping
We won't be sleeping in our autumn beds1Embed
