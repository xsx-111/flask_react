Tailwind LyricsI've done it all out of necessity
Yet still my blues ain’t your growing pains
You make a spark, the whole world's seeing stars
While any trail I leave down here quickly grows faint
But after all, I'm wading in your wake
In my mismatched shoes
The left being my debt to you
The right in your grave
But it just won’t do
You've always done so well
That has been hard to take
Seeing as how I'm judged
By all your mistakes
And any time I've turned around I've found
That you're in vogue and I'm insane
But thanks for all your generosity
Honey it don't mean that much your splashing it 'round
You know I'll be there on all fours
My backside reared up off the floor
Nose to the ground
But after all, you ain’t no charity
Honey’s got a tailwind and her
Wheels off the ground
More like the rocks inside your head
Were made to fill the holes in their’s
But that’s what you do
You’re an excuse
Life gets away with being dull
All thanks to you
You know it’s true
You know it’s true
I know you doEmbed
