Boredom Lyrics
The 'burbs are growing like a fingernail
Slower than the dullest pain
I want the hunger and cold of the nights of old
When there was blood up to the Himalayas
I’m saying farewell to the welfare state
The only comfort is a caliphate
I'm guessing war sure beats any old North Shore beach
Or any Western Suburbs single player
I'm looking for the type of test
A cataclysm make me beat my chest
Man, any kind of 'ism' beats a singing competition
On a TV fat with gnash and wail
They got me singing in a different scale
Don't wanna push no pram or join a bikie gang
Or flip a burger for the infidel
Yeah, no one ever lives to tell
What’s at the bottom of an oil well

Boredom, boredom
I’m gonna take a pic down there
Put my index finger in the air
Boredom, boredom
Gonna tag it with my username
And you can flag it for its guts and brains
Got me a lawyer in the ACT
Got me the fuck out of the PNG
I'm telling y'all failed states, they ain't exactly great
But neither's prison in the Bismarck Sea
Terra’s firmer in the southern lands
And shock and awe is all for stretch Humvees
The casual exhibition of a recent acquisition's
All the intervention they got planned
I miss the hustle of the Baghdad days
It weren’t a shit hole in the late ’80s
That thing with 'W', don’t let it trouble you
It’s all a distant hen’s night anyway
I hear ‘em screaming for a Chippendale
That looks like Eminem, it must be 2:00am
And it’s like nothing here is even real
You’re just so lucky that you get to feel

Boredom, boredom
I didn’t come here for the thrills and spills
I just like the way I don’t get killed
Boredom, boredom
You get the house, land, bang, the whole biz
If you can just remember where it is
Boredom, boredom
Don’t fucking tell me that you ain’t got room
You ever really seen a baby boom?
Boredom, boredom
Man, I was born in the cradle of civilisation
And I plan on dying in its tombEmbed
