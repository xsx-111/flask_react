Private Execution Lyrics
The best songs are like bad dreams
If you can cover all the exits
But one by one they blur
And you’re forgetting all the words
By the time you get to breakfast
A reckoning election
A politician's corkscrew
A credit card mini bar private rental car
And a Western education
12 square feet of dirty day
The whole world made to order
I’m either taking up more space
Than I have taken up before
Or the days are getting shorter
Now I’m smoking in a blindfold
In an Indonesian courtyard
I always thought ‘bout quitting
But then there’s the reptilian
And his business is to die hard

But now I’m feeling kinda free
I’m going straight to DVD
I’m losing my ambition
Going into remission
I've put it all behind me
I want a private execution
Give me a private execution
I want a private execution
For free

The Kuala Lumpur Sunway
Is crammed with koro cases
And destination shoppers
Showing telepathic kindness
And pensioned master races
The carpark of the high court
A former soccer stadium
5 stars full of assholes
Complimentary bathrobes
Fixed civilisation
But what do fish know about water?
I'm probably someone's entertainment
But let's change the topic before I get misanthropic
It's only a vacation
Tell me ‘bout the old days
Was there ever any violence?
Smack-tick-tock-bang onomatopoeia’s
Disappearing into silence
But now I’m feeling kinda free
I’m going straight to DVD
I’m losing my ambition
Going into remission
I've put it all behind me
I want a private execution
Give me private execution
I want a private execution
For free
I want a private execution
A private execution
A private execution
For free1Embed
