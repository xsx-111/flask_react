Shut Down SETI LyricsYou’re going out broadcasting my name
Did god not furnish you with brains?
If they are there they’re there therefore
Their silence may be called for
If they are there they’re there and mute
So maybe we should follow suit
They might know something that we don’t
Something our pride is hiding
I ain’t laying claim to sanity
I’m talking more about vanity
If there were mirrors in the sky
Well then we’d shut down SETI
There is a wilderness more wild
Than anything you can conceive
Straight way up 70 miles
Silence is eternity
It’s not that they could be our kings
It’s more about fuck ups like Nanjing
Do we need an overlord
That finds us underwhelming?
You don’t defend your house and home
By jumping down a rabbit hole
You can’t defend the open sky
Let alone our actions
And all that talk about ET being advanced
Would only mean he wears the pants
High tech don’t mean higher moral standards man
That’s kind of racist
You’re thinking like they’re coming to us to learn
You think maybe they haven’t heard?
They might be little
Might be green
But hardly green with envy
There’s a wilderness more wild
Than anything you can conceive
Straight way up 70 miles
Silence is eternity
There’s a wilderness so wild
You don’t want anybody seeing
Especially those who seem to know
And are willing to forgiveEmbed
