Taman Shud Lyrics
Thud, thud, my heart pumps blood
Whenever someone talks about my Taman Shud

Who ditched that fox-gloved snitch
And loaded him with poison like a puffer fish?
Why don't anybody feel like crying
For the Somerton somebody with the hazel eyes?
Why don't anybody feel like crying
For the Somerton nobody with the hazel eyes?

Thud, thud, my heart pumping blood
Whenever someone talks about my Taman Shud
He's gone and no one even cares at all
The earth won't answer and the sea don't mourn

I don't give a fuck about no Anzackery
I don't care you got it interest free
I ain't gonna fret about "Lest we forget"
Fuck the Murdoch press, I'm saying
I don't get hung up on any carbon tax
Or Ned getting strung up for being a psychopath
I ain't really there with any class warfare
The only thing I care about's the
Thud, thud, my heart pumping blood
Whenever someone talks about my Taman Shud
He's gone and no one even cares at all
The earth won't answer and the sea don't mourn

For all of the probing into whether he exists
The question's still as open as a radar dish
Late 1948 is sending a transmission but it's inchoate
Don't hate me for not caring 'bout you losing your job
I think you're gonna suit being a welfare slob
I don't give a toss about no Southern Cross
Or the gulag Union Jack, I'm saying
I don't give a fuck if you can't stop the boats
I ain't at a loss if Simpson's donkey votes
I don't care about no Andrew Bolt or even Harold Holt
It's clear as mud, mud, my Taman Shud
Everybody mouths off while they’re chewing cud

Thud, thud, my heart pumps blood
When ever someone talks about my Taman Shud

Why did anybody feel the need to lie
'Less that's Warsaw on the seashore on the day he died?
Don't nobody wonder where he's been?
No tags, no wallet and his brains dry-cleaned
I don't give a fuck about "Fuck off, we're full"
I ain't gonna send my kids to private school
I ain't gonna grieve about no BHP
No silver spoons or mining booms
I don't give a fuck about your brick and tile
I don't really care if you're a paedophile
I don't care about no MasterChef
It's as appetising as a whistle blower's doom or any French cartoon
Nothing like a prune to make the death cults bloom
Why you think the whole world's gotta be like you?
Fuck Western supremacy
I ain't sitting around being Gallipolised
One man's barbecue's another's hunger strike
Why'd I give a rat's about your tribal tatts?
You came here in a boat, you fucking cunt
My Taman Shud
Everybody mouths off while they’re chewing cud
Thud, thud, my heart pumps blood
When ever someone talks about my Taman Shud
My heart pumps blood
When ever someone talks about my Taman ShudEmbed
