Then They Came For Me Lyrics
I can hear a Jericho Trumpet
But the sky's perfectly clear
Whether it’s real or recollection
It’s like I'm stranded on a pier
Watching waves of emigration
Being rewound off the beach
While the long road to unconsciousness
Ebbs out at my heels
Now I'm walking the halls of Charles de Gaulle
With a fresh-minted boarding pass
I got a date with Ben-Gurion
Standing in a subway
I'm feeling like I've overstayed
I'm waiting with my sack for the Amtrak
And a ticket out of JFK

(And when they came for him)
I didn't do anything
(And when they came for her)
I didn’t do nothing
(And when they came for him)
I didn’t say a thing
(And when they came for her)
Still not a word
You see that barren blue under the engines
There ain’t a fish left in the Levantine sea
There ain’t a dolphin torch in all the West Bank's flanks
Now they're lit by electricity
The wise man knows that all things flow
Through tubes to their destination
Through the sewers of Athens and the odd BUK missile
And the Underground's tube stations
I never knew the lure of monsters
I’ve never been one for crusades
But now I hear a Jericho Trumpet
You can't be sure you're doing much more
Than playing for some rumoured stakes
So when the pilgrims become bandits on their transits
Well, it's time to make your getaway

(And when they came for him)
I didn't do anything
(And when they came for her)
I didn’t do nothing
(And when they came for him)
I didn’t say a thing
(And when they came for her)
Still not a word
Now the red top rags are all flying black flags
The lowlifes are making gains
You’d be thinking they were staff writers
The gulls in Crete are sharpening their beaks
Seamstresses sew in hell
A tailored cut, a perfect fit
A skull grinding it's teeth on each lapel

(And when they came for him)
I didn't do anything
(And when they came for her)
I didn’t do nothing
(And when they came for him)
I didn’t say a thing
(And when they came for her)
Still not a word
(And when they came for him)
I didn't do anything
(And when they came for her)
I didn’t say nothing
(And when they came for him)
I didn’t say a thing
(And when they came for her)
Still not a word1Embed
