To Think That I Once Loved You Lyrics
Here, the sun's giving way and the last of its shade's
Grown as long as the ache that you gave me
Yeah, you said nothing's perfect, though you came pretty close
But then time's made the most of you lately
Only now you feel more like you're up for the cause
Like you've had second thoughts
And your heart's lost its thrust, you're marooned on the moon
And you need livening up
But why come back for me? I ain't no great beauty
Well, I guess you've got time on your hands
It ain't no big deal, me being lost at sea
'Til you start losing blood on the sand

To think I
To think that I once loved you
To think I
To think that I once loved you

I know that corridor where your nerves pave the floor
And the walls waterfall all around you
You're all made out of glue, just a residue
And I've taken your place and I'm feeling brand new
Yeah, right, nothing here's perfect, I am totally sold
I've been dragged 'cross the coals a lot lately
I don't wanna ruin your fun but you got your refund
And now I'm paid to make rain where you burnt me
To think I
To think that I once loved you
To think I
To think that I once loved you
To think I
To think that I once loved you
To think I
To think that I once loved you


To think I
To think that I once loved you
To think I
To think that I once loved you
To think I
To think that I once loved you
To think I
To think that I once loved youEmbed
