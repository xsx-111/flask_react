Making Contact Lyrics
Step outside—take a look at the stars
Catch a glimpse of the way things are

Making contact, making contact
Making contact, making contact

Smell of sweet fresh oil on skin
When you move on me like the tide coming in

Making contact, making contact
Making contact, making contact

So many ways to understand
One for every woman and man
Been that way since the world began

I hear the drumming of the surf and I have to dance
Stepping to the rhythm of circumstance

Making contact, making contact
Making contact, making contact
I feel so huge—I feel so small
I feel so good I wanna swallow it all

Making contact, making contact
Making contact, making contact

So many ways to understand
One for every woman and man
Been that way since the world began

Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
We move together like the waves
Swimming in an ocean of love
Every night and every day
Swimming in an ocean of love
One world—one human race
Swimming in an ocean of love
One kiss from a smiling face
Swimming in an ocean of love
See that sign coming into view
Swimming in an ocean of love
Mother sea welcomes you
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of love
Making contact
Swimming in an ocean of loveEmbed
