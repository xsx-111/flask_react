Call It the Sundance Lyrics
Under the skin insect glint
A shock, thoughts
Hemispheres of sparks
Eyes that won't close
Observe and doing change all things

False rule of objects
This gathering of accidents Into
Dynastic triumph of things
I long for dawn at end of mind

Traveling like deluge of earth and
Death quiver of events
Trembling to be
Shot into the face of time
Call it the Sundance

Everything you do, everything you say
Whether false or true
In some kind of way touches something
Everything you take, everything you leave
Every move you make
Pulls the fabric of the weave of everything
Call it the Sundance

Everything you do, everything you say
Whether false or true
In some kind of way touches something
Everything you take, everything you leave
Every move you make
Pulls the fabric of the weave of everything
Call it the SundanceEmbed
