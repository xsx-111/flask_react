Yanqui Go Home Lyrics
Yanqui wake up
You know it's time to go
The sun is almost up and we want to be alone
Yanqui head spin
Better get some rest
Tomorrow we can talk about the way you insulted the guests

Ivan's outside
Sulking in the yard
Everyone got bad communication when the time gets hard
Not a nice guy
But he's got troubles of his own
Anyway it's best if you both just leave the rest of us alone

Mmm, Yanqui go home, you had too much
Better go sleep it off
Party's over, time to meditate on it
Time to tally up the cost

Yanqui wake up
Don't you see what you're doing?
Trying to be the Pharaoh of the West bringing nothing but ruin
Better start swimming
Before you begin to drown
All those petty tyrants in your pocket gonna weigh you down
You're my friend but I say
Yanqui go home, you had too much
Better go sleep it off
Party's over, time to meditate on it
Time to tally up the cost
Yanqui go home, you had too much
Better go sleep it off
Party's over, time to meditate on it
Time to tally up the cost
Mmm, Yanqui go home, you had too much
Better go sleep it off
Party's over, time to meditate on it
Time to tally up the costEmbed
