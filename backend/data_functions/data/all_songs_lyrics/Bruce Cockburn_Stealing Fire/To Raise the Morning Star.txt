To Raise the Morning Star Lyrics
Rising like lightspill from this sleeping town
Like the light in a lover's eyes
Rising from the hearts of the sleepers all around
All those dreamers trying to light the sky

Burning—all night long
Burning—at the gates of dawn
Singing—near and far
Singing—to raise the morning star

Rising like lightning in the pregnant air
It's electric—I can feel its might
I can feel it crackling in my nails and hair—
Makes me feel like I'm dancing on feet of light

Burning—all night long
Burning—at the gates of dawn
Singing—near and far
Singing—to raise the morning star

Singing for the yellow and the brown and black
For the red and the white people, too
Dovetailing strong points with the things we lack
Singing for the people like me and you
Burning—all night long
Burning—at the gates of dawn
Singing—near and far
Singing—to raise the morning star

Burning
Burning
Burning
Burning
