If I Had a Rocket Launcher Lyrics
Here comes the helicopter—second time today
Everybody scatters and hopes it goes away
How many kids they've murdered only God can say, hey

If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
I'd make somebody pay

I don't believe in guarded borders and I don't believe in hate
I don't believe in generals or their stinking torture states
And when I talk with the survivors of things too sickening to relate

If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
I would retaliate

On the Rio Lacantún one hundred thousand wait
To fall down from starvation—or some less humane fate
Cry for Guatemala with a corpse in every gate
If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
I would not hesitate

I want to raise every voice—at least I've got to try
Every time I think about it water rises to my eyes
Situation desperate, echoes of the victims cry

If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher
Some son of a bitch would die2Embed
