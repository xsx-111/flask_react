Methods of Dance Lyrics
Here's a new design
The cut and style you know so well
Spins across the floor
It's the same routine
Just one last word before you go
Why should I ask for more?

Then out of the the blue
You're here by me
(Moving)
Taking my chance
(Learning)
Methods of dance
Oh, methods of dance

It's such a price to pay
You sense the doubt inside my mind
But never ask me why
No second chances now
I could be sure if I were to live
At your speed of life

Then out of the the blue
You're here by me
(Moving)
Taking my chance
(Learning)
Methods of dance
(Moving)
Taking my chance
(Learning)
Methods of dance
Oh, methods of danceEmbed
