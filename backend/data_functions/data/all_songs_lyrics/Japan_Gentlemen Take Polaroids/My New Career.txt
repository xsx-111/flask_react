My New Career Lyrics
I never wanted to be on my own
I could be wrong, but
I just slipped away from home
And now I'm gone
Well, way down south
They're having minor ups and downs
But they're moving on ahead
In leaps and bounds

Why, boy
They're playing our song
Outside where no one can hear
Why, boy
They're playing our song
At the start of my new career

Well, it's a different walk of life
That I've come to know
Because at every port of call
Comes a time to go
Well, they say down south
The sun won't set on my home town
It's just driving in this heat
That gets me down
Why, boy
They're playing our song
Outside where no one can hear
Why, boy
They're playing our song
At the start of my new career
My new career

I could never hurt anyone
Least of all you

Why, boy
They're playing our song
Outside where no one can hear
Why, boy
They're playing our song
At the start of my new career
My new careerEmbed
