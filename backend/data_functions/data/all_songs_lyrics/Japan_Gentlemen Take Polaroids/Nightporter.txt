Nightporter Lyrics
Could I ever explain?
This feeling of love, it just lingers on
The fear in my heart that keeps telling me which way to turn

We'll wander again
Our clothes they are wet; we shy from the rain
Longing to touch all the places we know we can hide
The width of a room that can hold so much pleasure inside

Here am I alone again
A quiet town where life gives in
Here am I just wondering
Nightporters go, nightporters slip away

I'll watch for a sign
And if I should ever again cross your mind
I'll sit in my room and wait until nightlife begins
And catching my breath, we'll both brave the weather again

Here am I alone again
The quiet town where life gives in
Here am I just wondering
Nightporters go, nightporters slip away1Embed
