Floating Vibes LyricsForget the second coming
I need you in the here and now
Instead of dreamin' up a way to
Spread your name across the world somehow
When you told me you were leavin'
I wasn't thirsty for revenge
No I wasn't disappointed much at all
Cause you'll be back again
If you're movin' out to the west
Then you'd better learn how to surf
The tide will break in on itself
There are no ghosts to exhume or unearth
If you're gonna do it then do it
Otherwise you just might lose your nerve
I swear that ocean it swallowed me fully
And it might have to follow you home
When you wake up in the morning
And you hear that awful applause
Put it in your fucking napkin
And watch it dissolve
You could seal it in an envelope
Tuck it away in your sleeve
But you can't take it to the bank
And you can't take it back2Embed
