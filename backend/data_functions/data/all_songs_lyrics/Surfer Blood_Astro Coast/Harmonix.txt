Harmonix LyricsWe could have been the best of friends
Now I'll never see this place again
So please, please, please, don't wait for me to try and get it together
Please don't wait for me to reappear, cause I'm not here
Because, I won't wait around for the grass to grow back now
I won't wait around for your vaults to open, let me in somehow
Why think about it every day?
When you could plainly walk away
And I won't wait around, for the ice to thaw out now
I won't wait around for your heart to open, and let me in somehow
And I won't fuckin fold, Oh oh, Oh oh
For perfection's in your own, I hope. Oh oh
And I won't wait around
Oh oh, Oh oh
For you to figure it out1Embed
