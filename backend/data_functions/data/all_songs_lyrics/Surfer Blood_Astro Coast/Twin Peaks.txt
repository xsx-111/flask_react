Twin Peaks LyricsIf I'd known all your ghosts
I never would have come so far
I spend too many hours
Wondering who you really are
Twin Peaks and David lynch
Met on your couch at Syracuse
Your sexual advances
Are unconvincing and untrue
(unconvincing and untrue)
My lover's a carnivore
Her body's an ivory casing
This whimsy has put me to sleep
Why is everything a chore?
I'm too young to be defeated
Let's make fun at the video store
With Blue Velvet and other titles
And I can't believe you at all
So you can keep your holiday spirit
It belonged to both of us
It belonged to both of us
Now we need to redefine
Tell me where to draw the line
Close contact on the couch was fine
Tell me where to draw the line
I know things could be different
If I were older and less afraid
You don't have to make excuses
I'm already on my way
Twin Peaks and David Lynch
Met on your couch at Syracuse
You're growing fainter
Your humor's getting sour too1Embed
