Fast Jabroni LyricsCome pick me up in the morning
I know you've probably thought about it too
Otherwise I'll never leave my oven
My arms and legs they would grow soft with you
Come pick me up in the morning
And we can find a hole to crawl into
We're still pretending to be lightweights
My arms and legs they would grow soft
Behind his smile is nothing
Long hair's a signal to the wandering eye
Anytime I'll leave my coffin gladly
My arms and legs they would grow soft and die
Someone broke into my heart
Or beat it into my head
Several hours to drive home
Or fall asleep instead?
So think it over
Just think it over, don't let me down
So think it over
Just think it over, I'll be aroundEmbed
