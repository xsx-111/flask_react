Slow Jabroni LyricsI'm still waiting for the day
Georgia, Georgia
I'm still waiting for the day
Georgia, Georgia
I'm not going home tonight
I fucked up some appetite
I'm just waiting for the day
Georgia, Georgia
Bridges gonna burn soon
Guitars ring out in living rooms
I just need one special word, Georgia
Went to her apartment
Man you should have seen the look on her face, sometimes i? decide to stay up late
But I am still so wide awake
I don't want to tax my breath
Or fall asleep in your caress
I'm still waiting for the day
Georgia, Georgia
You better take some time to figure it out, cause if you don't you gonna do without
Take some time to figure it out cause if you don't you gonna do without
Take some time to figure it out cause if you don't you gonna do without
Take some time to figure it out cause if you don't you gonna do without
If I knew you'd guard your heart so jealously
Then I'd fight for you
There's nothing in this joyless world to see
There are no places that are left to see
There's just the wilderness, it's shame
If I knew you pushed away so savagely
Then I'd back off
So, take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
Take it easy on me
They lumped us into the same boat
Sinking on the same ship
Gasping with the same breath
They shoutout with the same mouth
Whatever's deep inside me
Erupt from me entirely
Thaw me out completely
And I knew somehow I'd find you there and I hope you'd be with me1Embed
