Song Dance LyricsTeach me a song and I'll dance for you
And I won't mind what you're playing
I must get right for a song dance tonight
Oh, and when it's, it's morning now
I want to show you how
Got to keep on moving, running to the sounds
Well, I might not want you on my troubled times
Strange things passing far behind you â€“ no, no, no, no
'Cause all your rhythm and blues
But I would never play a tune for you
And when it's, it's morning now
I want to show you how
You got to keep on moving, running to the sounds
Rhythm is a song dance
Rhythm is a song dance
Rocking to a song dance
Teach me a song, I'll dance for you
And I won't mind what you're playing for me
I must get right for a song
It's morning now
I want to show you how
Got to keep on moving, running to the sounds
Rhythm is a song dance
Rocking to a song dance
Rhythm is a song dance
Rocking to a song danceEmbed
