Late November LyricsOh, and she wants, she wants it badly
And I can't believe all she said
'Cause she's cool, yes she's cool
She's just like lightning
Take her home, keep her warm in late November
And I can't say why she's so strange now
Nor can I always believe all she said
She came down, held me close
Came down from night skies
Take her home, keep her warm in late November
She just goes to show you never know
What's in your heart, what's in your soul
She just goes to show you never know
What's in your heart, what's in your soul
She's home now, but far away she flies
But she don't know how she came or how she believes
'Cause she's cool, yes she's cool
She's just like lightning
Take her home, keep her warm in late November
She just goes to show you never know
What's in your heart, what's in your soul
She just goes to show you never know
What's in your heart, what's in your soul
She just goes to show you never knowEmbed
