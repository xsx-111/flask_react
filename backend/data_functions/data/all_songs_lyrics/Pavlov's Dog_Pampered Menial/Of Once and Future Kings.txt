Of Once and Future Kings LyricsAll the ladies of court gather round
And join in in heavenly fair
You're gathering promises of future heroes
Showing faith in a song as we go
Red light and green light and men in their armor
And fight for the queen if you dare
It's a long way to go to test out your mettle
Well, a long way to go to go down
We go round and round
We go down
Go down
Courier says we lost our battle
There's 21 left, that's all
We were given no quarter because of thy archers
Leaving us nothing at all
Tell me what will we do, what will we say
They'll be killing us all in a while
Taking our homes, killing wives and children
Leaving us nothing at all
And I'll write them a letter
I'll say, forgive all we've done
But please, first grant this favor, sirs
Forgive us quick all the wrong
All the wrong, all the wrong, all the wrong
Oh, we're wrong
All the ladies of court gather round me
And you're joining in heavenly fair
You're gathering promises of future heroes
Showing faith in a song as we go
Oh, red light and green light and men in their armor
And fight for the queen if you dare
It's a long way to go to test out your mettle
A long way to go to go down, go down
You better go down, down, down
You better go down again, my friend
Oh, you better go down, down, down
Better go down again, my friend
