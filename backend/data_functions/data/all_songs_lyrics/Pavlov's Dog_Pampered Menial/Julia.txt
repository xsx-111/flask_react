Julia LyricsJulia, you've set the standards for me
Walk to your door
Beggin' for it just to be more
And Julia, I couldn't do much better than you
You said so yourself
I wouldn't want anyone else
And I can't live without your love
And I can't live without your love
Well I can't live without you
Julia, oh you're drivin' me crazy
But I'm... I'm a part of your plans
Oh just a man while your dreams be
You're just a part of me
Oh please see how much
Well, how much you mean to me
Oh please see how much
Well, how much you mean to me
Julia
And Julia, straight away you've had me
And I know I've had you
All a part of me too
And I can't live without your love
And I can't live without your love
Well I can't live without you
Julia
And I can't live without your love
And I can't live without your love
Well I can't live without you
