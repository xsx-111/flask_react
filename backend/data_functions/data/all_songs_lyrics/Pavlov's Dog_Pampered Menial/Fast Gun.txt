Fast Gun LyricsWell, and you wear the fast gun
You try and make me run
When the whole town turns its troubles down on you
Well, and you wear your gun down low
And you kiss her when you go
Would a half-breed cowboy lose her?
You never know
When you shot them dressed in black
And you pulled this trigger back
When it happens there's a time when you brought 'em down
Oh, when you're leaving here, let's go
Hey, don't you let your feelings show
'Cause the fast gun's got troubles of his own
Well, and you wear the fast gun
You gonna try and make me run
You think you're going to shoot me down
Well you never will
Because they say you've got no soul
You got a halo without a glow
Would a half-breed cowboy lose her?
Oh you know, you know, you must never know
When you shot them dressed in black
And you pulled this trigger back
When it happens there's a time when you brought 'em down
Oh, when you're leaving here, let's go
Hey, don't you let your feelings show
'Cause the fast gun's got troubles of his own
You wear the fast gun, wear it low
You like to kiss her when you go
You wear the fast gun, wear it low
You like to kiss her when you go
