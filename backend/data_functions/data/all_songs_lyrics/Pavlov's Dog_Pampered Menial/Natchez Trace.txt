Natchez Trace LyricsAll I can hear is the wind shouting though the forest
All I can hear is the song as she's shining
I wish I was home but I'm lost
They say she's waiting by the Natchez Trace
In all her silver thread and coal black lace
When she put you in your resting place
Would you take my gold or leave my soul unscathed
All I can hear is the howling wind and a haunting woman I know
'Cause all the angels in heaven and the devils in hell
I think I'm caught in this rock and roll
When she's waiting by the Natchez Trace
In all her silver thread and coal black lace
When she put you in your resting place
Would you take my gold or leave my soul unscathed
You got to leave me alone
You got to leave me alone
You got to leave me alone
Oh no, no, no
If the woman don't get ya the snakes will
And this road is so long and so dark and so cool
She's one bad woman, one mad woman
Waiting for me, get your hands off me
And she's waiting by the Natchez Trace
In all her silver thread and coal black lace
When she put you in your resting home
No, no, no, no
Oh no, she's one bad woman
You got to leave me alone
You got to leave me alone
She's one bad womanEmbed
