Episode LyricsI caught you walking on a rainy day
And tossing petals into a pool
So keep your mind off passing hours
'Cause I'll be coming for you soon
Make believe you are a dancer
Though perhaps you'd make a better queen
And before you leave you better count roses
And a mad, mad way you want to scream
Or if you want, he'll give you slippers
Or shoot an arrow on past the sun
Or be the keeper always of my mind and heart
Or is it best you go unseen?
Once you were star-struck and now twice you're not
And things go badly as they do
But I want the rainbows out of heaven
I'll only steal them when I can
And me I'm just your head soldier
An heirloom to a basket queen
And all the blisters, and I'm fevered
And only silence killed my dreams
If you want he'll give you slippers
Or shoot an arrow on past the sun
Or be the keeper always of my mind and heart
You think you got control
You don't, you'll never know, you'll never know
You'll be the keeper of the Holy Grail
You seize it quick, you dare not fail
You're the only survivor of your holy quest
Or is it best you go unseen?Embed
