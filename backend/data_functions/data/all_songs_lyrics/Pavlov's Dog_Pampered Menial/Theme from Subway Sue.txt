Theme from Subway Sue LyricsWatch the mountains and take off down the river
Take off twice from where you are
'Cause someday soon we'll take off down the river
And I'll see nothing of you at all
Tell the birds not to show which way I'm going
And tell the leaves to try and hide the way
Well give 'em gold â€“ 'cause gold is nothing special
Tell 'em all to try and hide the way
And someday soon we'll find out where we're going
And someday soon we'll find the way
And if the love that you have for me is going
Well I'll see nothing of you at all
And it's a long road
A very, very, very long road
A very, very, very long road
And I'm doing fine
And I'm wishing you were mine
Take me back to mornings, mornings when she calls me
And take me back to days of brighter springs
Well if you take me back and I don't care
Oh, all your springtimes don't possess me
And I'll see nothing of you at all again
And someday soon we'll find out where we're going
And someday soon we'll find the way
Well if the love that you have for me is going
Well I'll see nothing of you at all
Nothing at all
She's a woman (She's a woman)
That left me nothing at all (Left me nothing at all)
She's a woman (Such a lady)
I've nothing at all (Left me nothing at all)
Well I'm leaving... I'll leave soon
Well I'm leaving now
Nothing at all
And I got nothing at all
I've nothing, nothing at all
No, I have nothing, got nothing at all
I've got nothing, nothing at all
(repeat to end)Embed
