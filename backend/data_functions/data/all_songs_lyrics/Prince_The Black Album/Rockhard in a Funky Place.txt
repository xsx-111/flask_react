Rockhard in a Funky Place Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Does anybody know you're here?
This house of ill-repute (Ooohh honey I'm scared of you)
Trying to deal with all your fears
I guess this is what you get for being cute (Cute, cute)
Soaked in banana cologne
No wonder you're all alone
It's written all over your face
You're just-a rock hard in a funky place

Rock hard in a funky place

Here comes a lady so you cover up
She's a freaked out
Funky electric mama with double cups
You couldnâ€™t cop if you wanted to
Because something near your leg
Is haunting you, such a disgrace
You're rock hard in a funky place, ow!
Rock hard in a funky place

You was working on the line
You could drop on her
But you couldn't concentrate
When your dick so hard
Maybe if you cop a nut in the car (Maybe if you cop a nut in the car)
Maybe you could think
About playing guitar

(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
Oh yeah

Rock hard in a funky place

All you're looking for is love
Or a reason to believe there's a God above
Pretty soon you'll get enough
And head back to a life so tough
I just hate to see an erection go to waste
I'm just-a rock hard in a funky place
Rock hard in a funky place
Say it
Rock hard in a funky place
Rock hard in a funky place
Oohh for rock hard in a funky place
You rock hard in a funky place
Say it, you'all

(Rock, rock)
What? (rock, rock, rock, rock)
We got to go, y'all
Tune in next week (rock, rock)
Same time (rock, rock)
Same boogie (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock hard)
Oohhh yeah (rock, rock, rock, rock)
We will rock, y'all (rock, rock)

But until then keep your finger on the trigger
That's the only way it'll get bigger
(What kind of fuck ending was that?)Embed
