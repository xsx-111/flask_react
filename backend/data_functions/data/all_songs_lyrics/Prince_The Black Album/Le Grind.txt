Le Grind Lyrics
So you found me
Good, I'm glad
This is Prince
The cool of cools
Some of you not know this
But some of you may know
Some of you may not want to know
We are here to do service
Please don't try to stop us
For we come regardless
For we are strong as we are intelligent
So come vibe with us
Welcome to the Funk Bible
The new testament

People get ready, nouveau dance here
All the girls and all the boys
Get close, have no fear (Have no fear)
We're going to do le grind you all
Got you where I want you
Girl it's going to feel so good (Feel so good)
Up and down, up and down, on the beat y'all
Like a pony would, pony would
Le Grind
All the boys, grab a girl, get down on the floor
This funky beat's going to show you
Going to show you what your hips are made for
Nouveau grind, come on
(People) People, it's much to late
It's much to late to be shy
London, what does Big Ben say?
(Time to do the grind) No hear you say
(Time to do the grind) Le Grind

Baby, I got you where I want you
Now I got you where I want you want you
Ce soir, la chantez, all night long (all night long)
Ce soir, la chantez, all night long (all night long)
Hey pretty mama, with the long hair
Is that your boyfriend? Ha, I don't care
'Cause I can do, said I can do
Tricks he can never do
When I get naked, we'll see the real you
Am I getting through? (grind)
I got you where I want you (baby)
Baby, baby
Piano man, put it where it feel good
Grind, grind, grind, grind
Le Grind, grind, Le Grind, grind

This party, this party is gonna last all night
When I give the cue scream, alright?
Party (Party)
Party (Party)
You say it, party (Party)
Clap your hands double time
All the boys say "Yeah Yeah" (Yeah Yeah)
All the girls say "Oh Yeah" (Oh yeah)
Now all you others say "Hell Yeah" (Hell Yeah)
Too sexy, Grind, Grind
(Not yet Boni)

Grind, grind, grind, le grind
Grind, grind, le grind, oh ya

People, get ready, nouveau dance here
Girls and boys, get close, have no fear
(Grind) Doing the grind, doing the grind in here
(Put it where it feels good)
Hey yeah
I do believe that we've... truly touched on something... nouveau
(La la la la la la)
(La la la la la la)
Ooowww, come on, am I in the right place? (La la la la la la la)
(don't move) (La la la la la la)
Ooh, are you sure baby? Are you sure (La la la la la la)
I'm in the right place? (La la la la la la la)
(Don't move, don't move)
(Grind, grind)
Come on (grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind)
Girl put it where it feel good
(Grind, grind, grind)
Not there, not there (grind, grind, grind, grind)
Put it where it feels good (grind, grind, grind, grind)
Slow down (grind)
Slamming
Le Grind
Up and down, up and down, feels so good
Up and down, up and down, like a pony would
Up and down, up and down, feels so good
Up and down, up and down
Like a pony would (Like a pony would)
Like a pony would (Like a pony would)
Like a pony would
Le Grind

Uh, slamming
Grind, grind (serve it up, Frankie)
Slamming
Put it where it feel good
Grind
