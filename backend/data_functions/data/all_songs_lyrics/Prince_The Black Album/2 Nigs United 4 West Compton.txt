2 Nigs United 4 West Compton LyricsServe it up, Frankie
This is precisely what I intend to do, honey
Honey, do you know I let Robert cut my hair this morning?
(Honey, look at this one here) (I'm looking Joe trying to see)
Oh girl, where'd you get those shoes?
You know he had me looking so bad (Honey, she's so free)
I'm so tired
These are "come-and-fuck-me" pumps (Who, Robert?)
Maurice thinks: (Mm, I think that's right, honey)
Go on up to her, say something
Maurice, what, what can I serve you? (You mean he's male?)
Baby, I swear to God if you don't kiss them
I'm going to kick your super natural ass!
Frankie, play something, bitch!
(Squirrel Meat!)
Uh! Don't try it!
Cat, what's happening babe? (Bitch, would you play something?)
Get out of my face! (Honey, it's not that type of party)
(Talk to me, talk to me - do you remember me?)
What cha mean? (Honey, he could teach you the answer to life)
Honey, you see these pumps? (Bitch!)
(Answer? Honey, you ain't gonna quit)
I want to, I want to: (Who you calling bitch? Ho bitch!)
I want you to meet some friends of mine (Bitch!)
(Frankie, play somethig - shit!)
(Who you calling ho bitch? Black ho bitch!)
No, no - You'll like them
They're, they're musicians
