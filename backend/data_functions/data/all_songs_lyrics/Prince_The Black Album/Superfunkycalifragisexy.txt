Superfunkycalifragisexy Lyrics
Ha, ha, ha, ha ha

If your body needs water
Keep on dancing 'cause you oughta
Keep the blood flowin' down to your feet
Brother Maurice will be 'round in a minute
With a bucket, filled in it, squirrel meat
The blood real good if you drink it real fast
But, the aftertaste just lasts and lasts
So, if you kiss somebody, you'll wanna party all night
All right!

Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy

If you do too much, your skin will be sensitive to touch
The first person that touch you, you'll wanna fuck
You take 'em to your crib, and you tie them to a chair
And you make funny faces 'til they get really scared
Then you turn on the neon, then you play with yourself
Til you turn them on
This beat is on time, refined and designed
To make you do the do

Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy

This chair goes round and round, I feel like a clown
'Cause I'm stripped down, It's all fun and games
'Til the very next day
'Til, damn, you don't remember my name
Maybe I'll see you next Thursday night, maybe I won't
But that's alright
'Cause in my possession is a signed confession
That says, I was the best you'd ever had
Too bad

This beat is on time, refined and designed
To make you do the do

Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy
Baby
Keep the blood flowin' down to your feet
Brother Maurice will be 'round in a minute

Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy

This beat is on time, refined and designed
To make you do the do

Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy
In seven measures, I want somebody to scream
Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy

If your body needs water
Keep dancin' 'cause you oughta
Keep the blood flowing down to your feet
Brother Maurice will be 'round in a minute
With a bucket, filled in it, squirrel meat
If you can't beat them, (if you can't beat 'em)
Join 'em (join 'em)
Slammin'!
This beat is on time
All of the time
So refined
Specially designed
To make you do the do (to make you do the do)
Super

In seven measures I want somebody to...Embed
