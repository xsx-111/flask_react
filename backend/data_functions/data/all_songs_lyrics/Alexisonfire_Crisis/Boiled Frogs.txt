Boiled Frogs Lyrics
A man sits at his desk one year from retirement
And he's up for review, not quite sure what to do
Each passing year the workload grows

I'm always wishing, I'm always wishing too late
For things to go my way, it always ends up the same
Count your blessings
I must be missing, I must be missing the point
Your signal fades away and all I'm left with is noise
Count your blessings on one hand

So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
There's so much to dream about, there must be more to my life

Poor little tin man still swinging his axe
Even though his joints are clogged with rust

My youth is slipping, my youth is slipping away
Safe in monotony (so safe!) day after day
Count your blessings
My youth is slipping, my youth is slipping away
Cold wind blows off the lake and I know for sure that it's too late
Count your blessings on one hand
So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
There's so much to dream about, there must be more to my life

Can't help but feel betrayed
Punch the clock every single day
There's no loyalty, and no remorse
Youth stole for a pension cheque
And it makes him fucking sick
He's heating up, he can't say no

So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
There's so much to dream about, there must be more to my life
(So wait up...)
So wait up, I'm not sleeping alone again tonight
Between the light and shallow waves is where I'm going to die

Wait up for me
Wait up for me
Wait up for me1Embed
