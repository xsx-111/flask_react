Thrones Lyrics(x2) I don't need a generation of burning on the ledge
Don't need your ancient wisdom
Two things I'll live with out!
Relax
(as children rest)
Patience people, there's no need to react so desperately tonight
(You don't need to know the things I know)
In fact
(as children rest)
All of you will be sleeping with honesty intact
(our innocence intact)
So just give up, tonight
(If I knew then what I knew now, I'd stay six years old!)
If you lost everything in a moment, would you notice?
Could you rebuild something so hopeless?
Are you hopeless?
And when you wake alone, with no one left to hold
You won't need to know all the things I know
Paradise in every swimming pool
Paradise in every playground slide!
Paradise, fist first in the cookie jar!
If I where you, I would defend my innocence! visually
I would fight all that tried to rob me of that!
Because there's some things you just don't need to know!
Tragedy in the dentist's office
Tragedy in every skinned knee?
Tragedy spilled all over the kitchen floor!
(x2) I don't need a generation of burning on the ledge
Don't need your ancient wisdom
Two things I'll live with out!
When you awake alone, with no one left to hold
You won't need to know, all the things I know
You won't need to know, all the things I know
You won't need to know, all the things I know
(x2) I don't need a generation of burning on the ledge
Don't need your ancient wisdom
Two things I'll live with out!Embed
