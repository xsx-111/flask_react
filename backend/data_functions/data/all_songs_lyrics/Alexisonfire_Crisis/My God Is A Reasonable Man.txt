My God Is A Reasonable Man LyricsI don't care, I won't preach it
My god's a reasonable man
You preach the facts of sacred prayers
But your a terrorist of bigotry
Fueled by text that was written
In dead languages and different times
I don't care, I won't preach it
My god's a reasonable man
I don't care, I won't preach it
My god's a reasonable man
I don't care, I won't preach it
My god's a reasonable man
And your justice, and your lifestyle
My god's a reasonable man
And your faith doesn't speak for us all
'Cause my god's a reasonable man
It's time to separate faith and politics
It's time to realize that in ten-year's time
This song will be all that's left of me
And this song won't need to be sung
Your problem is that
You think it's no use
And swimming in another christian world
Now you have the balls so show the power
So why's the shit back in human rights?
Get what? get back!
My god's a reasonable man
Get what? get back!
My god's a reasonable man
Our hands again
They will get sick
All with your politics
By mixing God
This city war, you take all of your
Convictions to the morgue
Get what? get back!
Get what? get back!
My god's a reasonable man
Get what? get back!
My god's a reasonable manEmbed
