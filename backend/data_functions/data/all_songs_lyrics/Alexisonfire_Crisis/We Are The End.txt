We Are The End Lyrics
Look around, look around
There's no affection, only infection
Search yourself, search yourself
Can I depend on you to surrender?

And we will storm their shores, eyes suffocating all they see
Feet sturdy on the rubble that will soon be dust
And there will be no ruins, no memory, no history
Only our unrelenting march side by side
We'll comb the earth and sweep it clean with hearts and feat unified
The hand of man is no match for our war-less army

Please tell me that this is the end of the world
And we will strike with the hands of God and leave nothing in our wake
It's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
And we will strike with the hands of God, and with a word we'll seize fate
Please tell me that this is the end of the world
And we will strike with the hands of God and leave nothing in our wake
It's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
And we will strike with the hands of God and church in our wakes

Steadfast soldiers with hands of gods and the numbers to succeed
We will persist until all that's left is a perfect sphere
Never a break a chain, never a folly of conviction
And may the traitor's ashes seal the barren landscape
We are the end
We are the end

Please tell me that this is the end of the world
And we will strike with the hands of God and leave nothing in our wake
It's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
And we will strike with the hands of God and with word we'll seize fate
Please tell me that this is the end of the world
And we will strike with the hands of God and leave nothing in our wake
It's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
And we will strike with the hands of God and the church in our wakes

Look around, look around
There's no affection, only infection
Search yourself, search yourself
Can I depend on you to surrender?
Can I depend on you to surrender?

Please tell me that this is the end of the world
And we will strike with the hands of God and leave nothing in our wake
It's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
And we will strike with the hands of God and with word we'll seize fate
Please tell me that this is the end of the world
And we will strike with the hands of God and leave nothing in our wake
It's time that we erase history, without a trace or a memory
And we will strike with the hands of God and the church in our wakesEmbed
