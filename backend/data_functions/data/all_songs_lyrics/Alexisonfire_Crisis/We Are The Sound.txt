We Are The Sound Lyrics
Children roam these empty streets with lust filled eyes and jagged hearts
Narrow frames and crooked teeth, the whole more valuable than each part
And the grasp you have upon this group is as fragile as a pile of ash
They know your lies and weakness with each open hand you bluntly lash
Oh, these soft legged girls and hard faced boys
They know no God, they have no voice

So what is this I see?
There is nothing but anger burning inside of me
(Oh, these soft legged girls and hard faced boys)
Do you wish to feel complete?
Say you want it, you need it
(They know no God, they have no voice)

We are the sound, we don't belong
So raise up your hands and sing along
We are the sound, we don't belong
So raise up your hands and sing along

Girls with fire in their eyes, boys with will and aim that's true
Living in a jilted world, contempt spreads just like the flu
So let's all take some solace in, one thing that we all can trust
Adults can be fucked up too, sometimes even more than us
(Oh, these soft legged girls and hard faced boys)
Do you wish to feel complete?
Say you want it, you need it
(They know no God, they have no voice)

We are the sound! We have no voice!
We are the sound! We have no voice!

We are the sound, we don't belong
So raise up your hands and sing along
We are the sound, we don't belong
So raise up your hands and sing along
And sing alongEmbed
