Rough Hands Lyrics
Was I left behind?
Someone tell me, tell me I survived
And don't look so surprised that I'm home, but just for tonight
With rough hands, and sore eyes
So don't speak; I am tired
Let's just live through this lie

She says I swear too much, she says a lot of things
Well I'd swear every other word if I could, for her I'll make an attempt
Sometimes love isn't about how much someone suits you
But how much you're willing to change to suit them

All my bones are dust
(Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)
And my heart's sealed with rust
(Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)
These hands will always be rough
(Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)
I know this won't count for much
(Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)

One day my hands were too soft
One day she said "I'm tired"
One day her clothes were on my floor
One day, empty bottles
Well I'm not saying she's my last
I'm just saying that she could have been
It doesn't matter how rough these hands get
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm not her man
Rough hands, rough days
Rough hands, rough nights
Rough hands, rough season
Rough hands, rough fights

All my bones are dust (Rough hands, rough days
Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)
And my heart's sealed with rust (Rough hands, rough season
Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)
These hands will always be rough (Rough hands, rough days
Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)
I know this won't count for much (Rough hands, rough season
Two people, too damaged, too much, too late)8Embed
