Drunks, Lovers, Sinners And Saints Lyrics
Alright!
This is from our hearts
Sincerity over simple chords
We made some mistakes
We made some mistakes
But it's a long time coming when you're giving it everything
Alright!
This is from our hearts
Sincerity over simple chords
We made some mistakes
We made some mistakes
But it's a long time coming when you're giving it everything
Alright!
This is from our hearts
And it's been right from the start
There's fire in my guts you just can't put out
Alright!
This is from our hearts (From our hearts)
And there is always going to be a part
Of this crowd who don't understand

Oh, and I feel the same
I won't ever change
Not a jaded hair upon my head
Are you pretending (that you care)?
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending (that you understand)?
Are you even?

Suits to the left
Squares to the right
'Cause my heart, my heart is full
And we ride to fight
Suits to the left
Squares to the right
'Cause my heart, my heart is full
And we ride to fight
Suits to the left
Squares to the right
'Cause my heart, my heart is full
And we ride to fight
Suits to the left
Squares to the right
'Cause my heart, my heart is full
And we ride to fight
We ride to fight

Are you pretending (that you care)?
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending (that you understand)?
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending?
Are you, are you?
(Are you even listening?)
Are you pretending that your heart's in the right place?
Are you pretending?
Are you even listening?
Are you pretending?
Are you even?
There's no need to waste my time
Spending your life jumping from sinking ship to sinking ship
Well I think I'd rather drown
I know I'd rather drown
Oh, and I feel the same
I won't ever change
Not a jaded hair upon my headEmbed
