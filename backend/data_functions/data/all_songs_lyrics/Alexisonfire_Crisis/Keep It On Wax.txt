Keep It On Wax Lyrics
I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
Oh no, oh no
You can always make new friends
But when you sell 'em out, they won't be worth as much
I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
Oh no, oh no
You can always make new friends
But when you sell 'em out, they won't be worth as much

Now this bridge is ashes
It might as well have never been built
It might as well have never been built
Little river that it crossed
Looks like an ocean now, looks like an ocean now

Times change and people change with them
Some people love to play the victim
(Love to play the victim)
You threw caution to the wind
Washed away these few last years for nothing
(Was it all for nothing?)
Keep it on wax
You're not the only one
Who's had to make sacrifices
Who's had to make sacrifices
And time won't heal shit
When you got your hands in my pocket
When you got your hands

Kick, kick, kick
Scream, scream, scream
It won't change a goddamn thing (It don't change)
Kick, kick, kick
Scream, scream, scream (A goddamn thing)
Kick, kick, kick
Scream, scream, scream
It won't change a goddamn thing (It don't change)
Kick, kick, kick
Scream, scream, scream (A goddamn thing)

I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I, I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
I guess, the only thing cheap to you is your friends
Oh, what a fucking shame
Oh, that you had to mess things up this time
Times change and people change with them
Some people love to play the victim
(Love to play the victim)
You threw caution to the wind
Washed away these few last years for nothing
(Was it all for nothing?)

It's gone, it's gone
There's nothing left
(Keep it on wax)
It's gone, it's gone
There's nothing left
(Keep it on wax)Embed
