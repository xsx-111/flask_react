Crisis Lyrics
Yeah, this town is going under

The temperature's through the floor
Your fingers are turning black
There's a crisis knocking at your door
(1-9-7-7, 1-9-7-7)

You'd better try to make it home
The snow is getting too deep to drive
Your car might be a coffin
(1-9-7-7, 1-9-7-7)

We're never gonna see the summer
This season is coming, long and hard
Yeah, this town is going under
This season's going to kill us all

Catch the snowflakes little children
Count them as they bury you alive
Count them as they choke the road ways
A blizzard's coming in the year punk died
(1-9-7-7)
This season has left us all helpless
I can't see and even God is blind
And deaf to all your prayers
(1-9-7-7, 1-9-7-7)

There's nothing that you can do
This weather's stronger than us all
The sky is going to crush you
(1-9-7-7, 1-9-7-7)

This season's growing cold, I fear that this could be the end
And there's no sign of hope, we've got a crisis on our hands

The junkie is stuck indoors
Pretty soon he’s gonna need a fix
But the weather’s not gonna let him
And he's starting to get the itch

The season's holding us all hostage
Better do whatever it demands
Nature knows that we've got a crisis
Weighing on our frostbitten hands
One
There's nothing that you can do, the sky is gonna crush you
Nine
There's nothing that you can do, the sky is gonna crush you
Seven
There's nothing that you can do, the sky is gonna crush you
Seven
There's nothing that you can do, the sky is gonna crush you

This season's growing cold, I fear that this could be the end
And there's no sign of hope, we've got a crisis on our handsEmbed
