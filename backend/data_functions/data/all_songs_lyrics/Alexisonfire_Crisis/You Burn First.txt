You Burn First Lyrics
I said, "Cover me if there is a fire
'Cause I want you to burn first."
She screamed at me, "I want to be desired."
I said, "Easy girl, I know it hurts."

Let's all give thanks that I am a liar
'Cause I've got a feeling I just might get worse
Now there's nothing wrong with you; I'm just tired
And I'm in a mood for a brand new curse

You burn first, you burn first
You burn first, you burn first

"Cover me if there is a fire
'Cause I want you to burn first."
She screamed at me, "I want to be desired."
"Easy girl, I know it hurts."

Let's all give thanks that I am a liar
'Cause I've got a feeling I just might get worse
Now there's nothing wrong with you; I just grow tired
And I'm in the mood for a brand new curseEmbed
