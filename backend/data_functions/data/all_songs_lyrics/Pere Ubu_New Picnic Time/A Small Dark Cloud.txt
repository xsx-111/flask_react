A Small Dark Cloud LyricsFly in the ointment
(What kind of girl is this?)
There's a fly in the ointment
A speck of a fly
But a fly in the ointment
(I see confusion.)
It's a picnic!
Dark cloud
We'll drive out and we'll have fun
(What kind of girl is this?)
Dark cloud. Fly in the ointment
Put out the cloth on the ant hill
What? I see confusion
(What kind of girl is this?)
Wait
We'll sit around and sit around
And wait
(What kind of girl is this?)
Fly in the ointment
The tinniest, tiniest speck of a fly
Ha-ha-ha, huh?
(We'll sit around and sit around and...)
Picnic Time!
(We'll sit around and sit around and... wait.)
Don't rock the boat!
(We'll sit around and sit around and... wait.)Embed
