Make Hay LyricsWhat is it? What is it?
I try, I try, I try
It's so hard
Why is it so hard?
Make hay while the sun shines
Make hay while it shines
See where the time goes
See how it slips away
See where the time goes
See how it slips away
I put its little coat on and tie its shoes
And send it out the door, off to school
I send it on its merry way to you
Booosh! My heart goes out to you
Does it seem strange?
Mark this day, mark this day well
See where the time goes
See how it slips away
Tomorrow, tomorrow is another day
God willing, another day
I get up early and I'll wake you up, too
I live in hope. Live in hope
Make hay while the sun shines
Make hay while it shines
See where the time goes
See how it slips away
Mark this day
Mark this dayEmbed
