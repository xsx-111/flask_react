All the Dogs Are Barking LyricsYou've gotta have happiness
You've gotta have happiness
You've gotta have home
You've gotta have heart
You've gotta have hands
You've gotta have horns
You've gotta have heart
You've gotta have hope
Y'gotta have help!
Today?
Today, I drank beer, boiled water, made a face
Showed no idea
And I had a good time
Help!
Then, one time I thought of youEmbed
