49 Guitars And One Gir LyricsIt was the sound he heard
It was a funny thing to feel
Bubbles! Bubbles of air
Sinking down fast...
I must have been loony
It was the sound he heard
What a funny thing to feel!
Yellow walls. Bad words, yes
Dishes! Dishes! Dishes! All for love of you
I must have been loony
It was the sound he heard
What a funny thing to feel
I oughta talk about...
He had to talk about that funny thing
Don't panic
Here it comes
"Wha's happening?"
"What happened?"
Water's the sound he heard
Water
Water is the sound
All for love of youEmbed
