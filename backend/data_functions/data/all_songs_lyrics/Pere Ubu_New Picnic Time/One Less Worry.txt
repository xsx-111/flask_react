One Less Worry LyricsUnh, unh. No. Nope
Here it goes
Somebody
Help
What me worry?
What?! Nothing
So, thinking back to the left
I was looking back
And I was looking over things
Pretty bleak
I was looking over things
Just wandering back there
Now, there, there, there
Now, there, there. Down there. Now, stop!
Okay. Well. How's it look?
Uh, not too good
Let's try another one
Let's go back over here
No, up a bit. Over to the left
Yeah. That one. There. This one is alright!
David! What?
Oh, no, no, no
I don't think about it any more
Not that one again
Let's turn it over that way
Up three. Down one to the left
Let's take a look at that one
Ooo-oo... not that one! No, no, no
What are they gonna say when they hear me?
David!Embed
