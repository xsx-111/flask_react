Small Was Fast Lyrics(Ongo-tongo-jibberty-jungle)
I waited for you
I waited for you
I waited for you
Yeah. Oh. Yeah
(Ongo-tongo-jibberty-jungle)
Was small, was small
Was small
Was fast
Was small. Was fast
(Ongo-tongo-jibberty-jungle)
I waited years
Talk, talk, talk!
(Ongo-tongo-jibberty-jungle)
Notice the house
Notice the landscape
Hot
The day was hot
The sun went down
The air closed in
I got sleepy
(Ongo-tongo-jibberty-jungle.)
I waited
I waited
I waited for you
I waited for you1Embed
