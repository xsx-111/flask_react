Have Shoes Will Walk (The Fabulous Sequel) LyricsIt's me again. Hey!
Hey, it's me again
Yeah, he walked again
He... Hey!
He had it on the run
Run, run...
Ha ha ha ha!
He hummed and hummed
He hummed that zombie tune
He whistled in the dark
Hummed a zombie tune
He whistled in the dark
Hummed a zombie tune
Put out the cat, put out the fire -
Put out the cat
Put out the cat, put out the fire -
Hey, put out the cat
He had it on the run
It was a dream, it was a tin can -
It was a dream
It was a dream, it was a tin can -
And he kick, kicked that dream Diamond Street
He had it on the run
My, my
My, my, my
He whistled in the dark
Whistled in the dark
He had it on the run
"The rocks, he had it on the rocks."
Put out the cat, put out the fire -
Put out the cat
Put out the ca-a-a-a-a-t!
Kick that, keep that, keep that dream
Abandoned
I feel abandoned
Abandoned
I've been abandoned
Put out the what?
Put out what?
My life depends on this
My life depends on this?
