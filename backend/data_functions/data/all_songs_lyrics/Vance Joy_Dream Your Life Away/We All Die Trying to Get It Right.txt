We All Die Trying to Get It Right Lyrics
Think you're in control until you're not
And you're so in love until you're not
Find a place where we can be alone
Find a place where we can be ourselves
So aim high and aim true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, I'm falling

Like a feather falling past your cheek
Feel the breath of heaven on your face
We all die trying to get it right
We're all gonna die trying to get it right
So aim high and aim true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, I'm falling
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, I'm falling
Aim true
Won't you aim true?
Aim true
Won't you aim true?2Embed
