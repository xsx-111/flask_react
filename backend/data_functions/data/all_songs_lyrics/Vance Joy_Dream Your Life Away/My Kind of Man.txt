My Kind of Man Lyrics
Don't walk too proud, don't talk too loud
And make it up as you go
And take whatever you are given
And leave what you think you know at the door

As she said
You could be my kind of man
And will you do the best you can?
And I could use a little time
I need to straighten out my mind
And I'm gonna break on, break on through
And I close my eyes and think of you

And you said
You could be my kind of man
And will you do the best you can?
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand

You could be my, you could be my
You could be my kind of man
You could be my, you could be my
You could be my kind of man
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing you understand7Embed
