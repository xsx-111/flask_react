Georgia Lyrics
She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul, oh

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"

And I
And I

Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like, oh

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up
And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well, now you've come and gone
I've finally worked it out, I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well, now you've come and gone
I've finally worked it out, I worked it out

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh60Embed
