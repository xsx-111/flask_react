Who Am I Lyrics
Hold me up to the light
Tell me if the sun comes shining through
And I got this heaviness in my chest
Since your love came breaking through

And I wanna know where it's coming from
Where this is coming from, where this is coming from
And I wanna know what you're running from
What are you running from?

Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?

Lay my dreams down at your feet
Baby, watch out where you step
And there's no need for us
Knowing all the answers yet

And I wanna know what you're running from
What are you running from? What are you running from?
And I wanna know where it's coming from
Where this is coming from
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?

You're back for a minute and you're gone
And I never know how close I came
You're back for a minute and you're gone
And I never know how close
You're back for a minute and you're gone
And I'll never know how

Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I?2Embed
