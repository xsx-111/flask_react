Winds of Change Lyrics
I miss you more than you could know
I watch the grass on the back lawn grow
And I will not allow the winds of change to blow
And I hope you decide to come back home

'Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
'Cause I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love

You reach out for me in the night
And an errant finger pokes me in the eye
And I leave your contact lenses on the bedside table
And I'm hoping you decide to come back home

'Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
'Cause I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love

Oh, you went running with my heart
And it's a long, long, long way back
And this right here, well, it just ain't living
Oh, I want you to come back
Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love
Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love2Embed
