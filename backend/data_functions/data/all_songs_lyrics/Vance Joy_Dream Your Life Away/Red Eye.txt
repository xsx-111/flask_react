Red Eye Lyrics
She don’t like small places
Give her highways and by-ways
And don’t get stuck in her head
And it’s been so long
And I will read into everything you don’t say
All of your silent ways

I’m a dog lying down on a warm bit of pavement
Checking this collar, you see what the name is
Think that it’s worth it? Well, I hope that you’re right
You’re falling asleep on the red eye tonight

And you know that you’re looking well
Won’t you come through my door asking, "How was your day?"?
And you know that I’m still a dog
And I’m trusting my nose, will it show me the way?

I’m glad that you’re still here
Won’t you hold up a candle?
I’m stumbling in the dark
And when I needed hope
I remind myself that at least I got one thing right
It'll always be right
I’m a dog lying down on a warm bit of pavement
Checking this collar, you see what the name is
Think that it’s worth it? Well, I hope that you’re right
You’re falling asleep on the red eye tonight

And you know that you’re looking well
Won’t you come through my door asking, "How was your day?"?
Well, you know that I’m still a dog
And I’m trusting my nose, will it show me the way?

Won’t you get out while you can?
Won’t you cover your eyes if you’re tired of seeing?
Won’t you get out while you can?
And try saving yourself

Can we talk in the morning?
Oh, baby, it’s late
Can we talk in the morning?
Oh, baby, it’s late
Can we talk in the morning?
(Tell me when, tell me when)
Oh, baby, it’s late
Can we talk in the morning?
(Tell me when, tell me when)
Oh, baby, it's late
Baby, it's late
(Tell me when, tell me when)
Ooh
(Tell me, tell me when, tell me when)
Ooh
(Tell me, tell me when, tell me when)
Ooh
(Tell me, tell me when, tell me when)
(Tell me)8Embed
