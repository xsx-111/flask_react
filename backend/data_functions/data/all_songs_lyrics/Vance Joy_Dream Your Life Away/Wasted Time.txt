Wasted Time Lyrics
Why, why do you go wasting your time on me?
You’re so beautiful now
There’s so much that’s left for you now
Oh yeah, babe
And why, why do you go flashing those eyes at me?
You know that I'm eager to please
I’ve always been eager to please
Oh yeah, babe

But I've, I’ve got a lot to say
And I'm scared that you’re gonna slip away
And you, you’ve got this wide-eyed gaze
And a smile that you'll carry through your days

Oh, why?
Oh, why?
It’s the easiest way
To know you’re alive
And the beauty you heard
I see her talking with her hands
Well, I don’t think she knows
How she changed all my plans
Why, why do you go wasting your youth on me?
You’re so beautiful now
There’s so much time left for you now
Oh yeah, babe
Why? We look at the faces on your bedroom wall
Nobody’s perfect at all
Well, sometimes it makes you feel small
Oh yeah, babe

Well, I've, I’ve got a lot to say
And I'm scared that you’re gonna slip away
And you, you've got this wide-eyed gaze
And a smile that you'll carry through your days

Oh, why?
Oh, why?
It’s the easiest way
To know you’re alive
And the beauty you heard
I see her talking with her hands
Well, I don’t think she knows
How she changed all my plans
The things that I thought would last
Well, they’re fading, they’re fading
The feelings I used to have
Well, they’re changing, they’re changing
The things that I thought would last
Well, they’re fading, they’re fading
The feelings I used to have
They’re changing, they’re changing, they're changing now

They’re changing, they're changing now
They’re changing, they're changing now17Embed
