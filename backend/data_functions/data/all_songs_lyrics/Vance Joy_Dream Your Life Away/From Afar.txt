From Afar Lyrics
You told me, "Boy, look the other way"
You told me, "Boy, bite your tongue"
Yes, that's not the way
Yeah, that's not the way
Ah, that's just not the way that friends behave
Ah, that's just not the way that friends behave
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You lined me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar

You told me, "Boy, look the other way"
You told me, "Boy, hide those hands"
Well, I've been living on the crumbs of your love
And I'm starving now
And that is just the way that we remain
Oh, that will be the way that we remain
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You lined me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar
You lined me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar

It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
She got darling hazel eyes
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now15Embed
