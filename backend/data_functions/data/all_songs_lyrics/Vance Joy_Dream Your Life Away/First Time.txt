First Time Lyrics
Come over to my house,  jump in the neighbour's pool
It felt nice, felt so nice
And it was getting dark, you wrapped your long legs
Around me, I held on tight
Lying in my bed, the unfamiliar sheets
Were so cool on your skin
When your daddy called, said you were at a friend's
And we walked the long way home

Going on my first impression, I recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest

Breathe me with your hands, show me a safe place
And I'll come down, yeah, I'll come down
And can you recognise the look upon my face?
It's on my lips, it's in my eyes
This bar will never break, won't you say it one more time?
Won't you say my name? Won't you say my name?
This bar will never break, won't you say it one more time?
Won't you say, say my name?
Going on my first impression, I recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest

Ooh-oh, da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, ooh-oh
Da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da, da-da-da
(Ooh, ooh)

Going on my first impression, I recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time

First times always cut the deepest, the first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest, the first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest18Embed
