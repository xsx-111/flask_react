Best That I Can Lyrics
Say I don't look much like a lover
Doesn't mean that I won't try
To set your world on fire every once in a while
We lie on the kitchen floor
Hot air rises and it's going to be hot as hell here soon
We're gonna need some relief

Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said
Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said

Oh, I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying

You can keep moving on like you do
The road goes as far as the eye can see
I won't stand in your way, what's the good in that?
And the flowers in their bed
They're drooping and dying and fading away
This weather's no good for growing things

Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said
Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said
Oh, I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can

Will you keep moving on like you do?
Will you keep moving on?
So, will you keep moving you on like you do?

Oh, I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can1Embed
