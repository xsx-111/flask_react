Chemical Warfare Lyrics
Down at the arsenal they keep the nerve gasses
Guarded day and night by caged white rabbits
Been sitting there for years
I'm gonna have at it
I cut through the fence, run right in and grab it

Go crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

Now I got my own mustard gas in my pocket
Climb on a tree on a branch and drop it
On a country club full of Saturday golfers
So I can watch them die chokin', shakin' in convulsions

Go crazy, crazy!
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy!

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!
Panic in the air, see the headless chickens runnin'
Golf carts head on crashin', crackin' heads wide open
Scratch the grass, mister, you can't breathe
And roll and writhe in a sandtrap starting to heave
Claw those clubs, lemme see you seethe!

Crazy!
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy!

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!

Yellow air! Yellow clouds!
Blowin' down, down, down the fairway
Sensitive to the touch
Mowin' down the putting green
Heading straight for the big clubhouse
Where the stuffed country club
Effervescent ladies, so carefree
Relax, pose by the pool
Limber limp with a dry martini
Until...
Oh shit, what is going on in here?
(coughing)
Come on, move, god damnit, please!
I've got the answers, 
(shouts, screams of agony, babies crying)
Let me out!
(One, two, three, four!)

Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare!
Chemical warfare, warfare, warfare!2Embed
