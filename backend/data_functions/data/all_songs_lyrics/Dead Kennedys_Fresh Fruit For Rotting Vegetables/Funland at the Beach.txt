Funland at the Beach Lyrics
Sunny Sunday at the amusement park
See the fat kids spill their pop, oh babe
Lots of flags and balloons
But someone sabotaged the roller-coaster last night
Ran a turn and then it smashed right down
Thru the crowded haunted house below, oh no!
Human hamburger, no!

And it's crushed little kids
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk

Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk

See the tourists drop their jaws and cones
See the owners smell a big lawsuit, oh, police!
Call your lawyer first!
Make the witnesses go home, and they'll turn on the TV

And see the crushed little kids
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk

Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalk
Crushed little kids adorn the boardwalkEmbed
