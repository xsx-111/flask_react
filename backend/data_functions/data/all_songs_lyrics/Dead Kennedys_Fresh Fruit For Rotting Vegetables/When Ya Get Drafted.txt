When Ya Get Drafted Lyrics
Are you believing the morning papers?
War is coming back in style
There's generals here, advisors there, and Russians nibbling everywhere
The chessboard's filling up with red, we make more profits when we blow off their heads

Economy is looking bad, let's start another war (When ya get drafted!)
Fan the fires of racist hatred, we want total war (When ya get drafted!)

Drooling fingers, panic buttons
Playing with missiles like they're toys
There's easy money, easy jobs especially when you build the bombs that blow big cities off the map
Just guess who profits when we build 'em back up?

Yeah, what Big Business wants Big Business gets, it wants a war (When ya get drafted!)
Trilateral Commission goonies laugh and scheme for more (When ya get drafted!)
Call the Army, call the Navy, stocked with kids from slums (When ya get drafted!)
If you can't afford a slick attorney, we might make you a spy!


Forget your demonstrations, kids today sit on their ass (When ya get drafted!)
Just a six-pack and you're happy, we're prepared for when ya get drafted
When ya get drafted!3Embed
