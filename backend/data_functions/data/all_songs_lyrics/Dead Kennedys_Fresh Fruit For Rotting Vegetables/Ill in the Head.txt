Ill in the Head Lyrics
In a desperate mind
Little gardens grow
They grow very wide
They grow very tall

Why am I alive
Urban wonderland
By the fence I stand
In and out of hand

There are many paths
Dripping dark so dense
Do not enter here
Enter over there

Why am I alive
Urban wonderland
By the fence I stand
In and out of hand

People closing in
Barking at my mind
Shouting "do you mind?"
I want all alone!
I want my own home
I want my own girl
Help me hate the world
Own and love my life

Why am I alive
Urban wonderland
By the fence I stand
In and out of hand!Embed
