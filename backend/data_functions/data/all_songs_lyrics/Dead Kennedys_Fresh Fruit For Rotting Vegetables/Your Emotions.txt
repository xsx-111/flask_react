Your Emotions Lyrics
Your mommy told you this, and your daddy told you that
Always think like this, and never do that
You learned so many feelings, but what is there to that
Which are really yours, or are you just a copycat-ee-at-ee-at-at?
Your school told you this, and your church told you that
Memorize this, and don't you dare look at that
They're all so concerned to make their thoughts into yours
Just a tape recorder, mimicking of the bores

You're so boring boring boring
Always tape machine recording
You're so boring boring boring
I've heard all this before

Planless and mindless, scraps from anywhere
Bunch of used parts from garbage pails everywhere
Frankenstein became a monster, just like you
Your scars only show when someone talks to you

You're so boring boring boring
Always tape machine recording
You're so boring boring boring
I've heard all this before
I've heard all this before
I've heard all this before
Your emotions make you a monster
Your emotions make you a monster
Your emotions make you a monster
Your emotions make you a monster1Embed
