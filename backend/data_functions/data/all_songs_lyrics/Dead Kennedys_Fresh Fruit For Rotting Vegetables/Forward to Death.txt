Forward to Death Lyrics
I don't need your way of life
I can't stand your attitudes
I can do without your strife
I don't need this fucking world, I don't need this fucking world!

This world brings me down
Gag with every breath
This world brings me down
I'm looking forward to death

It seems so unreal to me
So much hate and so much pity
I can't take another day
It's such a bore, it gets me really sore
I don't need this fucking world, I don't need this fucking world

This world brings me down
Gag with every breath
This world brings me down
I'm looking forward to deaaath!

Looking forward to death
Looking forward to deaaaaaath!3Embed
