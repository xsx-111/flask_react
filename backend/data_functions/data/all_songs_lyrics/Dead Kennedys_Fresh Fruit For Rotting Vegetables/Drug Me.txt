Drug Me Lyrics
I don't want to think
Don't make me care
I wanna melt in with the group
I need the balls
To leap out of my shell
And let go with my friends
Can't come up with anything I want to do
I need a project I can finish
My brain needs some stimulation

Drug me!
Drug me!
Drug me!
Drug me!

I'm so fucking tired
I gotta stay awake
I'm runnin' late
I gotta make it through the day
And make my time go by
TV and the stereo and girls are lots of fun
I want the max
I relate better loaded
Gotta see that movie stoned
Drug me!
Drug me!
Drug me, drug!

Drug me with natural vitamin C
Drug me with pharmaceutical speed
Drug me with your sleeping pills
Drug me with your crossword puzzles
Drug me with your magazines
Drug me with your fuck machines
With a fountain of fads
More rock and roll ads
Drug me, drug me, drug me, me, me!

Finally off of work
Unwind and watch the ball game at the bar
Another potato chip weekend
Is here at last
Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away
Leave me alone
So I can't see myself

Drug me!
Drug me!
Drug me!
Drug me!6Embed
