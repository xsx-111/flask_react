Viva Las Vegas Lyrics
Bright light city going to set my soul
Going to set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all waiting, the devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
So Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas

How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
Even if I ran out of speed, boy
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's sonar and nerves of steel
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas

Viva Las Vegas where the neon signs are flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turning day into night
Turning night into day
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
I'm going to keep on the run
I'm going to have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke up well
I'll always remember that I had a swinging time
I'm going to give it everything I've got
Lady luck's with me, the dice stay hot
Got coke up my nose to dry away the snot
Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas
Viva, Viva Las VegasEmbed
