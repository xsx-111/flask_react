Justin Lyrics
Fuck all that bullshit!

You watch me play
I look away
Your light's too bright
You found the light

Take off in space
You and I
Take off in space
You and I

You're gonna die
Wanna meet me, why?
I wish I had your strength
Inside your soul escapes

Take off in space
You and I
Take off in space
You and I
Fly into me!
Tell me something for all!
The kids that die listening to me!
You are alive!

Time off in space
You and I stay
Take off in space
You and I
Take off in space
You and I7Embed
