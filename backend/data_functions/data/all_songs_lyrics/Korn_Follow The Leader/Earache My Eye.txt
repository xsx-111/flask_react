Earache My Eye Lyrics
I said, "I smoke every now and then"
But, when I really need one, I gotta have one
Just dyin', great tricks
Yeah, so?
To the six-nine, that was a double deuce
You said some'n about some'n about, "It's on."
See, that's all
What does this thing do? Oh, there it goes
Where you goin'?
I'm right here
What you doin'?
I'll do black and white trip?
Uh-huh
Oh, gotta get 'em X skin on the black and white. Yeah
You know what it is? Of course
It's like an in-between thing
Oh, I didn't know about this
I'm not Black, I'm not White
Where's, where's the switch?
I'm kind, ya know
Where's the switch?
Where is what switch?
This, the black and white switch?
Oh, you gotta get fixed up? Right over here
You see, this is dust, every, over here is dust
Danny, what up? Is that your lover?
Yeah
Really?
I love BBQ's
So, now that…
The only reason I don't barbecue on Wednesdays is because he 'cause he fuckin', fuckin' falls in the grill! Little beaner! Hehe!
Oh, what was that?
Little' fuckin' tooth
Carlos did it no, hehehe
Carlos?
Hey, now, he can do it on command?
You know as, know well as you do, you can come whenever you want
Tacos
I'm the one who gave Taco his name, you know that?
I said, can you believe that? I said, "We had that barbecue," and he goes, "Oh, you wanna go to Taco?"
Da-nuh-nuh, da-nuh-nuh, dah-dah-dahn
Órale
Where he at?

My mama talk-a to me, tried to tell me how to live
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
My daddy, he disowned me 'cause I wear my sister's clothes
He caught me in the bathroom with a pair of pantyhose
My basketball coach, he just kick me off the team
For wearin' high heels sneakers, 'cause I'm actin' like a queen
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree, to a tree
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree
(Gonna tie his pecker to a tree)
Getcha boogie on
Go, Head!
The earth is comin' to an end, and I don't give a damn
As long as I have my bitch, oh I'ma fuck you
It don't bother me if people think I'm funny
'Cause I'm a big rockstar, and I make lots of money
Money, money, money, money (Are you talkin' pesos?)
Money, ka-ching
Ka-ching
Hahahahahahaha
Lots of money
Lots of money
Lots of money (I'm so bloody rich)
Lots of money
Lots of motherfuckin' money
I get lots

Hahahahahahahaha, I own shopping centers, and parking lots, and stocks, and all that shit!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I own you, ha! You, too!
You three!
For me!
Hee-hee!
Oh-oh!
Groove on!
Get your groove on! Let’s bring down one more time, Jonathan! Jonathan on them drums gettin' even slower
More groovin', slow that shit down
Crazy slow, c'mon, death, right here, slow, ah
Don’t give a fuck, break it out!
You even know, Boy George is on heroin
We don’t give a fuck
Rick James is in a crackhouse
And I’m fuckin' payin', that’s all that matters! Ahhahahahaah!
The bomb is a-fuckin' in house!
Loco, oh-aah-oh
Gimme some, aah
Ha ha ha ha ha haaaaaaaah ha ha!2Embed
