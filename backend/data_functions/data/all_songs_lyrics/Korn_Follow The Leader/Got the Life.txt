Got the Life Lyrics
Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kick off the front floor
Mine, something inside I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real, I'll never ever follow
Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on
Hate, something, someway, each day
Dealing with no forgiveness
Why, this shit inside, now everyone will follow
So give me nothing just feel and now this shit will follow

God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something they took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see so come dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Me!
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, "you'll never see the life", who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
Got the life!
