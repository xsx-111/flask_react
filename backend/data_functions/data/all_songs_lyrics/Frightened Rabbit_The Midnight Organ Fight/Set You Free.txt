Set You Free Lyrics
When I hold you, baby
And your heart beats close to me
I wanna stay in your arms forever
Oh, only love can set you free
When I wake each morning
And the storm beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Oh, only love can set you free

Set you free, dance forever
Set you free, dance forever
Set you free and dance forever
Oh, only love can set you free

When we touch each other
In a state of ecstasy
I want this night to last forever
Oh, only love can set you free
And when I wake each morning
And the storm beats down on me
I know we belong together
Oh, only love can set you free
Set you free, dance forever
Set you free, dance forever
Set you free, dance forever
Oh, only love can set you free

Ah ah yeah, ah ah yeah
Ah ah yeah, ah ah yeah
Ah ah yeah, ah ah yeah
Ah ah yeah, ah ah yeah
Ah ah yeah, ah ah yeahEmbed
