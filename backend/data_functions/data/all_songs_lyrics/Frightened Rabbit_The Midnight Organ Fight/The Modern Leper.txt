The Modern Leper Lyrics
A cripple walks amongst you
All you tired human beings
He's got all the things a cripple has not
Two working arms and legs
And vital parts fall from his system
And dissolve in Scottish rain
But vitally, he doesn't miss 'em
He's too fucked up to care

Well is that you in front of me?
Coming back for even more of exactly the same
You must be a masochist
To love a modern leper on his last leg, on his last leg

Well, I crippled your heart a hundred times
And still can't work out why
You see, I've got this disease
I can't shake and I'm just rattling through life
Well, this is how we do things now
Yeah, this is how the modern stay scared
So I cut out all the good stuff
Yeah, I cut off my foot to spite my leg
Is that you in front of me?
Coming back for even more of exactly the same
You must be a masochist
To love a modern leper on his last leg
Well, I am ill but I'm not dead
And I don't know which of those I prefer
'Cause that limb which I have lost
Well, it was the only thing holding me up, holding me up

Well, I'm lying on the ground now
And you're walking through the only door
Well, I have lost my eyesight like I said I would
But I still know

That that is you in front of me
And you are back for even more of exactly the same
Well, are you a masochist?
You love a modern leper on his last leg
And you're not ill and I'm not dead
Doesn't that make us the perfect pair?
You should sit with me and we'll start again
And you can tell me all about what you did today
What you did today3Embed
