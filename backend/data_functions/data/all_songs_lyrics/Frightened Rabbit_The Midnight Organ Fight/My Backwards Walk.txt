My Backwards Walk LyricsI'm working on my backwards walk
Walking with no shoes or socks
And the time rewinds to the end of May
I wish we'd never met, then met today
I'm working on my faults and cracks
Filling in the blanks and gaps
And when I write them out they don't make sense
I need you to pencil in the rest
I'm working on drawing a straight line
And I'll draw until I get one right
It's bold and dark girl, can't you see
I done drawn a line between you and me
I'm working on erasing you
Just don't have the proper tools
I get hammered, forget that you exist
There's no way I'm forgetting this
I'm working hard on walking out
Shoes keep sticking to the ground
My clothes won't let me close the door
These trousers seem to love your floor
I been working on my backwards walk
There's nowhere else for me to go
Except back to you just one last time
Say yes before I change my mind
Say yes before I...
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it
You're the shit and I'm knee-deep in it4Embed
