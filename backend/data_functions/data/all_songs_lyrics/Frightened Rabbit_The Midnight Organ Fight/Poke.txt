Poke Lyrics
Poke at my iris
Why can't I cry about this?
Maybe there is something that you know that I don't
We adopt brand new language
Communicate through pursed lips
And you try not to put on any sexy clothes or graces
I might never catch a mouse
And present it in my mouth
To make you feel you're with someone who deserves to be with you
But there's one thing we've got going
And it's the only thing worth knowing
It's got lots to do with magnets and the pull of the moon
Why won't our love keel over as it chokes on a bone?
And we can mourn its passing
And then bury it in snow
Or should we kick its cunt in
And watch as it dies from bleeding?
If you don't want to be with me just say and I will go

Ooh
Ooh
We can change our partners
This is a progressive dance but
Remember it was me who dragged you up to the sweaty floor
Well, this has been a reel
I've got shin-splints and a stitch from we
But like a drunken night it's the best bits that are coloured in
You should look through some old photos
I adored you in every one of those
If someone took a picture of us now they'd need to be told
That we had ever clung and tied
A navy knot with arms at night
I'd say she was his sister but she doesn't have his nose
And now we're unrelated and rid of all the shit we hated
But I hate when I feel like this
And I never hated you

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
