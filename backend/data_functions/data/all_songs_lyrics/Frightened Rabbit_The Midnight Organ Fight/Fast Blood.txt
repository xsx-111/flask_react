Fast Blood Lyrics
Good night
It's stroke-time
Let's get paralysed down both sides
Snake hips, red city kiss
And your black eyes roll back
Midnight Organ Fight
Your's gives into mine
It's all right

And the fast blood
Hurricanes through me
And then it rips my roof away with her fire heads
This is the longest kiss
Good night
Oh..

And now I, I tremble
Because this fumble
Has become biblical
I feel like I just died twice
Was reborn again
For all our dirty sins
And the fast blood, fast blood, fast blood
Hurricanes through me
And then it rips my roof away with her fire heads
This is the longest kiss
Good night
Good night
And then I fall down
I stumble
And she said, good night7Embed
