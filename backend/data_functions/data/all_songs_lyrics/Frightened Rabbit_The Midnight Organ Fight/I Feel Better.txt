I Feel Better Lyrics
I left our house without a clue
And left New York City, girl, without you
But the sun does shine in this place some days
And even when there's clouds, there isn't always rain

I'll stow away my greys
In a padlocked case in a padlocked room
Only to be released
When I sing all the songs I wrote about you
This is the last one I'll do

Now I'm free in parentheses
And I'm not sure what I ought to do with it
It sits in the house, bright eyes and raised hands
If I ignore its advances then the hand goes down

I'll stow away my greys
In a padlocked case and in a padlocked room
Only to be released
When I sing all the songs I wrote about you
Oh, this is the last one I'll do
I feel better and better and worse and then better
Than ever, than ever, than ever
I feel much better, and better, and worse and then better
Than ever, than ever, than ever, than ever

I'll stow away my greys
In a padlocked case and in a padlocked room
Only to be released
When I see you walking around with someone new
This is the last song
This is the last song
This is the last song I'll write about youEmbed
