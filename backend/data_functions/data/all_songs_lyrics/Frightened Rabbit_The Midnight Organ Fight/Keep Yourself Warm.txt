Keep Yourself Warm Lyrics
My hole, I'll get my hole
I'll get my hole
Get my hole, get my hole
And I will find out more
It's a choo-choo train
A rocket launch
If we have a hormone race
I'm bound to finish first

Can you see in the dark?
Can you see the look on your face?
The flashing white light's been turned off
You don't know know who's in your bed
It takes more than fucking someone you don't know
To keep warm
Do you really think that for a house beat
You'll find your love in a hole?
No, you won't find love in a
Won't find love in a hole
It takes more than fucking someone
To keep yourself warm
I'm drunk, I'm drunk
And you're probably on pills
If we both got the same diseases
It's irrelevant, girl
And the room fills with steam
Oh, evaporates, disappears
My point of entry
Is the same way that I'll leave

Can you see in the dark?
Can you see the look on your face?
The flashing white light's been turned off
You don't know know who's in your bed
It takes more than fucking someone you don't know
To keep warm
Do you really think that for a house beat
You'll find your love in a hole?
No, you won't find love in a
Won't find love in a hole
It takes more than fucking someone
To keep yourself warm
You won't find love in a
Won't find love in a hole
To keep yourself...

...See in the dark?
Can you see the look on your face?
The flashing white light's been turned off
You don't know know who's in your bed
It takes more than fucking someone you don't know
To keep warm
Do you really think that for a house beat
You'll find your love in a hole?Embed
