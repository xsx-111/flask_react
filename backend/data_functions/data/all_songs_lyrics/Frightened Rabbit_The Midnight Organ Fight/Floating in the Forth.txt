Floating in the Forth Lyrics
So you just stepped out of the front of my house
And I'll never see you again
I closed my eyes for a second
And when they opened you weren't there
And the door shut shut, I was vacuum packed
Shrink-wrapped out of air
And the spine collapsed and the eyes rolled back
To stare at my starving brain

And fully clothed, I float away
(I'll float away)
Down the Forth, into the sea
I think I'll save suicide for another day

And I picture this corpse on the M8 hearse
And I have found a way to sleep
On a rolled up coat against the window
With the strobe of the sun and the life I've led
Am I ready to leap is there peace beneath
The roar of the Forth Road Bridge?
On the northern side there's a Fife of mine
And a boat in the port for me
Fully clothed, I'll float away
(I'll float away)
Down the Forth, into the sea
I'll steer myself through chopping waves
(Through chopping waves)
As manic gulls scream "it's okay"
(It's okay)
Take your life, give it a shake
Gather up all your loose change
I think I'll save suicide for another year4Embed
