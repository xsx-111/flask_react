Old Old Fashioned Lyrics
I'll turn off the TV
It's killing us we never speak
There's a radio in the corner
It's dying to make us see

So give me soft, soft static
With a human voice underneath
And we can both get old fashioned
Put the brakes on these fast, fast wheels

Oh let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with me?

Put the wall clock in the top drawer
Turn off the lights so we can see
We will waltz across the carpet
1-2-3-2-2-3

So give me the soft, soft static
Of the open fire and the shuffle of our feet
We can both get old fashioned
Do it like they did in '43
Oh, let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with me?
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

So give me soft, soft static
We won't need no electricity
If we both get old fashioned
We won't have to rely on our memories

Oh, let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with me?

Oh, let's get old fashioned
Back to how things used to be
If I get old, old fashioned
Would you get old, old fashioned with me?Embed
