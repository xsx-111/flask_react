Strange Reality LyricsWho's this before me
Dressed in rags, soaked in gin
Is it a sign or a warning
Am I now where he's been
Am I losing my way
Strange insanity
It's an illusion away
This reality
You know that could be me, oh yeah
That could be me
Wake every morning
I don't know where I've been
All my excuses
Showing strain wearing thin
Am I losing my way
This strange insanity
It's an illusion away
This reality
That could be me, oh yeah
That could be me
Another day
Another night
Another drink another fight
Somehow it's all the same
And so I wake in my gin
Never knowing where I've been
Still play the game
So strange
So strange
So strange to me
So strange
So strange... reality, yeah
I look to the future
With the eyes of the blind
Can't see much further
Than this haze in my mind
Am I losing my way
Strange insanity
It's an illusion away
This reality
You know
That could be me
Now that could be me
Oh yeah
Another day
Another night
Somehow it's all the same
Another drink
Another fight
Still I play the game
So strange
So strange reality
So strange
So strange to me
So strange
So strange reality
So strange
So strange to me
I'm losing my way
Don't know where I've been
Don't know where I've beenEmbed
