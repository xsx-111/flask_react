Jesus Saves Lyrics[intro to Jesus saves spoken by the bum
"Hey, man, got a quarter?
You ain't got nothin' that's ok man, that's ok
God bless you anyway. Here, I hope I didn't scare you or nothing like that. I, I ain't no bum or nothing
Like that. Yeah, I I use to live uptown once once before too you know. No, no, I did I did really. Use to
Come down here and look at all the characters. Never thought I'd be one of them though. Characters, man a

Use to stand for Down Town Jesus. He use to sell drugs and stuff down there, and they called him - that's
Why we use to call him DeTox. He was one character, one character that made it outa here
Let me tell you about him."]
Jesus was a talker
Out of place New Yorker
Hung out on the boulevard
Sellin' nickel candies
Saving all his quarters
Bought himself a cheap guitar
Started playing' bars
The kids came in their cars
You'd hear them shouting at the stage
Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Jesus started changin'
Things got really strange
He saw his tee shirts everywhere
Started missing shows
The band came down to blows
But Jesus He no longer cared
Things got out of hand
And so he quit the band
But still the critics they would rave
Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Her him cut through the night
On your late night radio waves
So the dice were cast
Today became the past
And Jesus He just disappeared
Headed for New York
Or so his label thought
And there he gave away the years
Last seen drinking wine
Beneath a flashing sign
Promising salvation to strays
Jesus saves
Jesus saves
Her Him cut through the night
On your late night radio wavesEmbed
