Can You Hear Me Now LyricsIf I closed my eyes
Would it all subside
To an echo in the night
Of a distant fading light
Then a stranger's silhouette
A burning cigarette
And somewhere in the haze
A passage through the maze
Can you hear me now
Or are there just too many doors
Between then and now
For me to ever reach on through
Pull you back somehow
That don't happen anymore
Still in the night
I think I hear you calling
I have walked this stage
As the music played
They knew every word
But they never heard
For they never changed
It's all very strange
As I'm standing here
Contemplating years
Can you hear me now
Are there just too many doors
Between then and now
For me to ever reach on through
And pull you back somehow
Well that don't happen anymore
Still in the night
I swear I hear you calling
Can you hear me now
Are there just too many doors
Between then and now
For me to ever reach on through
And pull you back somehow
But that don't happen anymore
Still in the night
I think I hear you callingEmbed
