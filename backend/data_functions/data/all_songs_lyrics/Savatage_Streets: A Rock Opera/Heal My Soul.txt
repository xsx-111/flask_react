Heal My Soul LyricsI've been waiting
Long forgotten
Shipwrecked on a distant shore
Am I driftng
No more wanted
Floating outward evermore?
All the dreams that
I have harbored
In the labrynth
Of my soul
Gone forever?
Not discarded?
Only sleeping
'Til they're whole
In the graveyard
Of my heart now
Sleep the years that
I've long sold
For their markers
Is there nothing?
Only ghosts I cannot hold
Father, hear me
I am tired
Shall I waken in thy home?
Hold me close now
I am trying
Sweet Lord Jesus
