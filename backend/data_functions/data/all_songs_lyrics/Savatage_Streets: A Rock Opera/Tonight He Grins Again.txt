Tonight He Grins Again LyricsNighttime again
Seems I'm my only friend
Wander the streets alone
The lost in search of his own
Once again I've played the clown
Used my friends and let them down
Walk the streets just staring out
Late at night the strange come out
Time, time, time again
I'm just looking for a friend
But no one seems to be around
Just this monkey that I've found
Still he is my only friend
And tonight he grins again
Tonight he grins again
Oh yeah
Tonight he grins again
It's cold this pain
It's burning inside my veins
I walk away
A shadow of Dorian Gray
Once again I've played the clown
Used my friends and let them down
Walk the streets staring out
Late at night the strange come out
Time, time, time again
I'm just looking for a friend
No one seems to be around
Just this monkey that I've found
Still he is my only friend
And tonight he grins again
Tonight he grins again
Oh yeah
Tonight he grins again
Oooh, livin' on the...edgeEmbed
