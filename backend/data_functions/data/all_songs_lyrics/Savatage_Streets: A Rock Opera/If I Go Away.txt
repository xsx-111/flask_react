If I Go Away LyricsSomewhere on that long lonely road
We all stand alone
Looking for clues
From our different views
In the dark I've called out your name
It echoes in vain
Over again
In an empty room
If I go away
What would still remain of me
The ghost within your eyes
The whisper in your sighs
You see
Believe
And I'm always there
Staring down a long empty hall
Pictures on walls
All with your name
But it's not the same
Searching for the chord I can't hear
Been searching for years
It's somewhere inside
But it's well disguised
If I go away
What would still remain of me
The ghost within your eyes
The whisper in your sighs
You see
Believe
And I'm always there
Someday I'll take a chance
You find them where you can
They tend to slip away
Those doors to yesterday
Forever is a long time they say
Maybe some day
I'll meet you there
If you've time to spare
Tell me then
Where I can go
Where they won't know
Who I have been
Can we start again
And if I go away
What would still remain of me
The ghost within your eyes
The whisper in your sighs
You see
Believe
And I'm always thereEmbed
