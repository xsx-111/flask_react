Streets LyricsAs darkness falls so hard
Come and play
Somewhere
Out there
Alone and out of place
Streets of illusion
Sooth the shattered fate
I've been a runner
I've been a sinner
I've been inside my head
I sit here staring
Never quite caring
And this is where it has led
(Chorus)
These streets
Glitter in the dark
Don't sleep
Red eyes sunken and stark
Dream deep
In her arms where you are safe
These streets
Never sleep still never wake
Somewhere out there
Gardens bloom and grow
Children awaken
To a world they know
Somewhere the sun shines
Somewhere the light's kind
Somewhere they seek the day
Somewhere there's no scene
Somewhere the air's clean
But somewhere is so far away
These streets
Glitter in the dark
Don't sleep
Red eyes sunken and stark
Dream deep
In her arms where you are safe
These streets
Never sleep still never wake
Welcome children
From the other side
In the darkness
Your eyes are opened wide
Here there are answers
On the edge dancers
Here the night hides out sins
And if you listen
While the streets glisten
Here's where our story begins
These streets
Glitter in the dark
Don't sleep
Red eyes sunken and stark
Dream deep
In her arms where you are safe
These streets
Never sleep still never wakeEmbed
