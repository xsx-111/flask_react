Somewhere In Time LyricsSo what can I tell you
If life's the length of this play
Perhaps God gave the answers
To those with nothing to say
The years are forgiven
If God's forgiving and kind
Perhaps we'll all find the answers
Somewhere in time
Somewhere in time
I've been changing
Redefining
All the things I thought I knew
So long ago
When I was flying
Through the years that seem so far away
In the back of a reason
In the back of my mind
Where I've piled up the seasons
That I've traded for time
I've been grasping at rainbows
Hanging on till the end
But the rain is so real lord
And the rainbows pretend
The rainbows pretend
I've been changing
Redefining
All the things I thought I knew
So long ago
When I was flying
Through the years
That seem so far awayEmbed
