A Little Too Far LyricsDo you remember? Look at me
At all the things we said we'd be
We'd beat the house, we'd push the odds
We'd take it all, we had the cards
With years to burn and years to trash
Livin' life based on flash
But somehow reachin' for the stars
I think we went a bit too far
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
I never meant to take it this far
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
When everything you touch turns gold
Can weigh you down, can make you old
When metal doesn't ring the same
Reaction from inside your brain
And all the years we offered up
To gods who couldn't get enough
Though we still stay up all night
The mornings aren't quite as bright
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
I never meant to take it this far
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
And all those things we thought we learned
As we watched our bridges burn
While standing in the afterglow
I guess we gave them quite a show
And who's to say what it's about
When John Wayne caught the last train out
And Spock and Kirk have had enough
And no one's left to beam me up
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
I never meant to take it this far
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
Gotta get back
I never meant to take it this far
Yeah, oh
I never meant to take it this farEmbed
