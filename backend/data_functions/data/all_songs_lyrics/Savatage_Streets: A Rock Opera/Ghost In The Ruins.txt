Ghost In The Ruins LyricsGot a limousine
I wanna show it
Future's looking good
I'll probably blow it
Had some parents once
But you'd never know it
Bank roll oversize
So what if I stole it
But who am I foolin'
I'm the king of the ruins
But I'm doin' well tonight
Got dreams to sell tonight
Got to belong
Try to hang on
Got to belong
Ghost in the ruins
I'm runnin' the street scene
Ghost in the ruins
Burnin' like gasoline
Ghost in the ruins
I'm takin' you in deep
Ghost in the ruins
East Side West Side playin' for keeps
See the runaway there on the corner
Just a throwaway but somebody's daughter
Had a pretty face so somebody bought her
Sellin' her soul away so put in your order
She knows what she's doin'
She's a ghost in the ruins
She's doin' it well tonight
She got dreams to sell tonight
She wants to belong
She knows what to do
She's got to hang on
Ghost in the ruins
I'm runnin' the street scene
Ghost in the ruins
Burnin' like gasoline
Ghost in the ruins
I'm takin' you in deep
Ghost in the ruins
East Side West Side
Playin' for keeps
Playin' for keeps
Yeah, yeah
Wants to belong
Knows what to do
You got to hang on
Ghost in the ruins
I'm runnin' the street scene
Ghost in the ruins
Burnin' like gasoline
Ghost in the ruins
I'm takin' you in deep
Ghost in the ruins
East Side West Side
Playin' for keeps
You know
I don't know anymore
I know
I know that you know
I know
I know that you know
I know
I know that you know
I don't know anymore
I know
I know that you know
I know
I know that you know
I know
I know that you know
I don't know anymore
I'm tellin' you
I don't know anymore
No, no
I don't know anymoreEmbed
