She Fell Away Lyrics
Once she lay open like a road
Carved apart the madness that I stumbled from
But she fell away, she fell away
Shed me like a skin, she fell away
Left me holding everything
Seems impossible to me now
Seems impossible to me now
Seems impossible to me now
But once the road lay open like a girl

And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away, she fell away
I did not see the cracks form, as I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no, no, no
Sometimes at night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away, oh she fell away

Walked me to the brink and fell away
I did not see her fall to better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever really there at all, yeah
Yes, she fell away, she fell away
Oh she fell away, oh she fell away1Embed
