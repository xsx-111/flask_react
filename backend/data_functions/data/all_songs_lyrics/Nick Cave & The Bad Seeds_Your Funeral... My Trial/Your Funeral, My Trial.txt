Your Funeral, My Trial Lyrics
I am a crooked man
And I've walked a crooked mile
Night, the shameless widow
Doffed her weeds, in a pile
The stars all winked at me
They shamed a child
Your funeral, my trial

One thousand Marys lured me
Into gullies damp with clover
Bird with crooked wing cast
Its wicked shadow over
A bauble moon did mock
And trinket stars did smile
Your funeral, my trial

Here I am, little lamb
Let all the bells in whoredom ring
All the crooked bitches that she was
Mongers of pain
Saw the moon
Become a fang
Your funeral, my trial
Your funeral, my trial
Your funeral, my trial3Embed
