Honeysuckle Rose LyricsEvery honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me
I don't blame them, goodness knows
My honeysuckle rose
Flowers droop and sigh when you're passing by
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter, goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
I don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's so sweet when you stir it up
On the avenue, people look at you
And I know just why they do
You're much sweeter, goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
Every honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me
You're much sweeter, goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
Oh, flowers droop and sigh when you're passing by
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter, goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
And I don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's so sweet when you stir it up
On the avenue, people look at you
And I know just why they do
You're much sweeter, goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
You're much sweeter, goodness knows
My honeysuckle roseEmbed
