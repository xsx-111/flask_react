On the Phone Lyrics
I'm on the phone once again
I feel like callin' ev'ryone I know
I called my girl twice last night
She always cries when we have a fight

Ooh, I'm down on my luck again
I really don't know what to do
Yes, I'm down on my luck again
And I don't know what to do
But baby, I'll call you as soon as I get home

I'm on my own once again
I feel the need to be with someone
All my friends have been and gone
My girl's at home and she's all alone




Yes, I'm down on my luck again
And I don't know what to do
Yes, I'm down on my luck again
And I don't know what to do
But baby, I'll call you as soon as I get home
Doot doot doo da
Doot doot doo da
Doot doot doo da da da daEmbed
