Space Lyrics
I'm walking in the air
And it feels just like I'm sleeping
You know, I can't touch the ground now
Because you'd hear the creaking

Space is like the heavens
A place of peace and stillness
Space is my heaven, woah

I can see the planets turning
It's like something that's not true
I'm really sure I must be dreaming
'Cause I'm here from out of the blue
