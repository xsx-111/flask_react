Too Late for Goodbyes Lyrics
Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die

But it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes it's much too late for goodbyes

Time has gone since I've been with you
And we've been starting to lie
Now it seems you don't care for me
And I don't understand why

But it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes it's much too late for goodbyes

Ever since you've been far away
I've been wanting to fly
Now I know what you meant to me
I'm the one who should cry

And it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes it's much too late for goodbyes

Ever since you've been leaving me
I've been wanting to cry
Now I know how it feels for you
I've been wanting to die

And it's much too late for goodbyes
Yes it's much too late for goodbyes

Ooh, ah
Dit dit dit dit doo
Ba da ba da ba da ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba2Embed
