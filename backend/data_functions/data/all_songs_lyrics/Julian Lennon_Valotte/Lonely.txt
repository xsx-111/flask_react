Lonely Lyrics
When I wake up in the morning
With the sun above my head
I pull the blinds down slowly
The room seems almost dead

And I'm lonely, and I'm on my own again
Yes, I'm lonely, and I'm on my own again

I get up quickly like a flash of light
I put my clothes on, neat and right
I work all day, I work at night
When do I find out, what I'm doing right


The time has come when I need to change
I don't know what to do, I'm really restless
My nerves are breaking
The lying feeling's coming through
