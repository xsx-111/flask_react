O.K. for You Lyrics
You don't make me feel like I used to do, oh no
'cause I've already seen the other side of you, oh yeah
Look at me while you're smiling through your lies
Swear blind, they ain't nothing you can hide

It's O.K. for you
'Cause it's O.K., O.K
It's O.K. for you
There ain't nothing to disguise
You suck me in, and then you spit me out
It makes me wanna scream, and it makes me wanna shout

I don't need you now like I used to do, oh no
'cause I've found another girl who's completely true, oh yeah
Turn away, try to catch me with your spies
Mirror cracks, see the devil in your eyes
