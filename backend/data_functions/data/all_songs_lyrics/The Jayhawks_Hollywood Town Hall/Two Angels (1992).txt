Two Angels (1992) Lyrics
I hope to find you this morning
Talking to the trees
I could miss you
After what went down

If false love could lie by you
While I'm swinging low
I could steal downtown
Making some sweet time

Two angels, one bad end
This lifetime's easy
Way back home there's a funeral


Think I'll take to the sidewalk
Knowing it's not real
I could steal downtown
Making some sweet time

Two angels, one bad end
This lifetime's easy
Way back home there's a funeral
Two angels, one bad end


Two angels, one bad end
This lifetime's easy
Way back home there's a funeral
Two angels, one bad end
This lifetime's easy
Way back home there's a funeralEmbed
