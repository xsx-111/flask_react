Crowded in the Wings Lyrics
It's taken you so long
Where can you be?
I would've laid my life down for you
Nothing seems real
Nothing seems real
Now that you're gone

Have you seen the sister's blue-eyed curls of gold?
Hell and no one there to be seen
The sunlight looks down
Stripped bare to the ground
Held by the leaves

Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find

Two hundred yards
In front of the man
He could never see his way to another day
This time meant the same
Cold, cold, cold, cold once again
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find

You brought me to
The mother of mountains
You brought me to
And no one reads to you at night
And all your lies came to pass
Just something I said
Made you turn your life in

Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
