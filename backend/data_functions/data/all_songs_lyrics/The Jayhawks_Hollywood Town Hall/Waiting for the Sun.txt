Waiting for the Sun Lyrics
I was waiting for the sun
Then I walked on home alone
But what I didn't know
Was he was waiting for you to fall

So I never made amends
For the sake of no one else
And for the simple reason
That he was waiting for you to fall

It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me

Walking on down the road
Looking for a friend to hang out
Somebody's my soul

So I kept my spirits high
Entertaining passers-by
Wrapped in my confusion
While he was waiting for you to fall
It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me

Walking on down the road
Looking for a friend to hand out
Something might ease my soul


It was not lost on me
It was not lost on me

Walking on down the road
Walking on down the road
Walking on down the road
Walking on down the road

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)Embed
