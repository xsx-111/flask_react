Settled Down Like Rain Lyrics
You came
And you gave
Without taking
The best was yet to come
I know
For I was forsaken

And so
I kept my fingers crossed
To win at any cost
The sound
Of water falling down

Knock me down
Pick me up
Set me in a row

Your words
Hung high in the rafters
And settled down like rain
Remain
Happy ever after
Knock me down
Pick me up
Set me in a row


Knock me down
Pick me up
Set me in a row

You packed
Up your bags and belongings
And crept out through the back
The sound
Of footprints on the ground

Your words
Hung high in the rafters
And settled down like rain
Remain
Happy ever after
Happy ever afterEmbed
