Nevada, California Lyrics
Left his day job behind
Every fool dies trying
To give his back
Kicked around on the burn
Like a child I scolded
For broken toys

Can you help me to find
Nevada, California?
The last thing I did
Was I tried to held her

The stationmaster is gone
I'm your lovesick cousin
That never wins
First your twist, then you turn
You're on life's icy mountain
Dear passenger

Can you help me to find
Nevada, California?
Can you help me to find
Nevada, California?
The last thing I did
Was I tried to held her

Nevada, California
Nevada, California

The stationmaster is gone
Behind the lies, you wonder
There lies a jewel
Could it be something's wrong?
The love that won't talk to you
But seven wins

Can you help me to find
Nevada, California?
Can you help me to find
Nevada, California?
Nevada, California
The last thing I did
Is I tried to hold herEmbed
