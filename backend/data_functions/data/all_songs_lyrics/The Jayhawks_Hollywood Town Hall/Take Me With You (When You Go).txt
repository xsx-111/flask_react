Take Me With You (When You Go) Lyrics
Day is done
Night is returning
Icy black
The muddy waters
I've got to know
Won't you please tell me?
Sinking like a stone
The icy water

Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray

Past the house
Where first they brought you
Carried you to sleep
Protected from harm
And when they're gone
Soon be returning
The ones you lived by
They found a foothold
Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray


Like the sweet
Sweet breeze that brought you
Left by chance
Broke down by your words
What did I know
To ask you to leave me?
Evening will die
Upon my doorstep

Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray
Take me with you when you go
Each night when I go to bed, I pray
