Sister Cry Lyrics
Sister cry
What you needed
Bought yourself things you could not use
Could be some man will come along and claim you
Could be you'll wind up in another town

Sister cry
Count the stars
Is many in the sky that passed you by
Could be up ahead you'll be seeing changes
Somehow the changes made won't belong to you

(Someone come along and carry you down)
And you called my name
I was so hungry then
(Someone come along and carry you down)
You could not see you
(Someone come along and lay you down)
And you don't talk at all
It's the hardest way
(Someone come along)
And carry you down
Sister cry
Been mistreated
Doesn't mean someone won't let you in
Could be some man will come along and claim you
Could be you'll wind up in another town

There's devils knocking at your door
But I could lead them all astray
Just don't matter what people say

(Someone come along and carry you down)
And you called my name
I was so hungry then
(Someone come along and carry you down)
You could not see you
(Someone come along and lay you down)
And you don't talk at all
It's the hardest way
(Someone come along)
And carry you down

Sister cry
Count the stars
Is many in the sky that passed you by
Could be up ahead you'll be seeing changes
Somehow the changes made won't belong to you
Could be up ahead you'll be seeing changes
Somehow the changes made won't belong to youEmbed
