Come On Come On Lyrics
Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past
It's a song that you danced to in high school
It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four in the morning drive
Through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris
At the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera
In the sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were
Then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
It's a need you never get used to
So fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over
The first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone
Seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car
Down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand
Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understandEmbed
