The Hard Way Lyrics
Show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show that things that drew me to you an' stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean something to you

Our hearts are beating while we sleep
But while we're wide awake

You know the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
And what your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard way

Show a little passion, baby, show a little style
And show the knack for knowing when
And the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us
When fear obscures the path
You know we got this far, darling
Not by luck, but by never turnin' back
Some will call on destiny
But I just call on faith

That the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
To what your heart might say
Everything you got, you got the hard way

Caught up in our little lives
There's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes
You're searching for that field of clover

So show a little inspiration, show a little spark
Show the world a little light when you show it your heart
We've got two lives, one we're given
And the other one we make

And the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart, and your heart might say
Everything we got, we got the hard
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Everything we got, we got the hard way
Because the world won't stop
Hang on, babyEmbed
