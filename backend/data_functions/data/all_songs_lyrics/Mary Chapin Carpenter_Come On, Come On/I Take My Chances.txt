I Take My Chances Lyrics
I took a walk in the rain one day
On the wrong side of the tracks
I stood on the rails till I saw that train
Just to see how my heart would react
Now some people say that you shouldn't tempt fate
And for them I cannot disagree
But I never learned nothing from playing it safe
I say fate should not tempt me

I take my chances
I don't mind working without a net
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I sat alone in the dark one night
Tuning in by remote
I found a preacher who spoke of the light
But there was brimstone in his throat
He'd show me the way according to him
In return for my personal check
I flipped my channel back to CNN
And I lit another cigarette
I take my chances
Yes, forgiveness doesn't come with a debt
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I've crossed lines with words and wire
And both have cut me deep
I've been frozen out and I've been on fire
And the tears are mine to weep
But I can cry until I laugh
Or laugh until I cry
So cut the deck right in half
I'll play from either side

I take my chances
I pay my dollar and I place my bet
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get

I take my chances
Yeah, I don't cling to remorse or regret
I take my chances
I take my chances every chance I get
I'll take my chances
I'll take my chancesEmbed
