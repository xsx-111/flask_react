Rhythm of the Blues Lyrics
I can hear the rain come down
I can listen with my heart
I can see you with both eyes closed in the dark
Sleep will come in just a while
But till it does I choose
To listen to the rain
It's the rhythm of the blues

I walk along these streets of home
That once belonged to us
And now, baby, I walk alone and I am lost
In the sound of my own footsteps on the avenues
I guess I'm only walking to rhythm of the blues

I don't want to hear another word spoken
Don't want to hear
I don't want to see another tear shed
Don't want to see
I can't seem to fix what's broken
Like this record, baby, in my head

Lonely looks as bad on me
As lonely looks on you
And still we keep on moving
To the rhythm of the blues
I want a place to call my own
Where you have never been
I want to look around and know
You won't be coming back again
On some pretence paper-thin
That I can see right through
You come and go, baby
Like the rhythm of the blues
You come and go, baby
Like the rhythm of the blues
You come and go, baby
Like the rhythm of the bluesEmbed
