Walking Through Fire Lyrics
When you set a match to your heart
Fueling it with bitterness and doubt
That's the place that once it starts
No amount of tears can put out

I know you're scared, but no one's spared
When you play with matches

You got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire

Maybe you've been burned by lovers
Maybe you've been scarred by the pain
But baby, I'm not like the others
Drawing moths to a flame

Spite is like a spark, crackling in the dark
Consuming all it catches

And you got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire to get to you
You got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire
You can see the toll it's taking
You can feel the faith it's shaking
You can hear the heart it's breaking now

Baby, I've been burned by the fever
I've been scorched by desire
Baby, I am not your deceiver
Or your eloquent liar

Your jealous heart, is tearing us apart
And turning love to ashes

When you got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire to get to you
You got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire
You got me walking through fire
As the flames shoot higher
You got me walking through fire
