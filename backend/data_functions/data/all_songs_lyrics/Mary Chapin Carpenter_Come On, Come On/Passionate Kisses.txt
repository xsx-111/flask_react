Passionate Kisses Lyrics
Is it too much to ask
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff

Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Is it too much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think

Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Do I want too much?
Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
"Give me what I deserve, cause it's my right"

Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have this?
Shouldn't I have all of this, and

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, woh oh oh
Passionate kisses from you

Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from youEmbed
