I Feel Lucky Lyrics
Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack
I opened up the paper to the page in the back
It only took a minute for my finger to find
My daily dose of destiny under my sign
My eyes just about popped out of my head
It said, "The stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed"

I feel lucky, I feel lucky, yeah
No Professor Doom going to stand in my way
Mmm, I feel lucky today

Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito and a Barq's
Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park
The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
I heard a voice above me saying, "Girl, you better get back home"

But I feel lucky, oh, oh, oh, I feel lucky, yeah
No tropical depression going to steal my sun away
Mmm, I feel lucky today
Now eleven million later, I was sitting at the bar
I'd bought the house a double and the waitress a new car
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner trying to catch my eye
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true
Hey the stars might lie but the numbers never do
{Chorus]
I feel lucky
Oh, oh, oh
I feel lucky, yeah
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight

I feel lucky, brr, I feel lucky, yeah
Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
Mmm, I feel lucky todayEmbed
