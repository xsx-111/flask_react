Night Ride Across The Caucasus LyricsRide on through the night, ride on
Ride on through the night, ride on
There are visions, there are memories
There are echoes of thundering hooves
There are fires, there is laughter
There's the sound of a thousand doves
Ride on through the night, ride on
Ride on through the night, ride on
In the velvet of the darkness
By the silhouette of silent trees
They are watching, they are waiting
They are witnessing life's mysteries
Ride on through the night, ride on
Ride on through the night, ride on
Cascading stars on the slumbering hills
They are dancing as far as the sea
Riding o'er the land, you can feel its gentle hand
Leading on to its destiny
Ride on through the night, ride on
Ride on through the night, ride on
Take me with you on this journey
Where the boundaries of time are now tossed
In cathedrals of the forest
In the words of the tongues now lost
Find the answers, ask the questions
Find the roots of an ancient tree
Take me dancing, take me singing
I'll ride on till the moon meets the sea
Ride on through the night, ride on
Ride on through the night, ride onEmbed
