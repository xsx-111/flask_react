Minutes LyricsMinutes seem like hours
And hours they seem like days
When the ones you want are missing
And they've gone their separate ways
Walking in a sunny garden empty like the moon
And birds that once could fly so high
Now sings a different tune
Walking in the park
The leaves are turning now it's fall
The time has come for leaving
In their eyes that says it all
Pictures on the mantle
Tell the tales of better times
Moments from a long long time ago
When things were fine
One fine day
When the wild birds return
We'll look back and say
What a lesson in life I learned
So light a broad wick candle
In the window make it bright
You need to find your way home
In the dark deepest night
And if you're lost and homeless
On a lonely city night
Just follow back that winding road
That leads you to the light
One fine day
When the wild birds return
We'll look back and say
What a lesson in life I learned
Minutes seem like hours
And hours they seem like days
When the ones you want are missing
And they've gone their separate ways
Walking in a sunny garden empty like the moon
And birds that once could fly so high
Now sings a different tune
One fine day
When the wild birds return
We'll look back and say
What a lesson in life I learned
One fine day
When the wild birds return
We'll look back and say
What a lesson in life I learned
One fine day
When the wild birds return
We'll look back and say
What a lesson in life I learnedEmbed
