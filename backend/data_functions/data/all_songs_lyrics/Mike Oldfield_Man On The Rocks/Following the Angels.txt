Following the Angels Lyrics
In that moment, there was peace
No one walked alone on the streets
A migration of dancing light
Gathering, returning home from the night

It came falling down
Following the angels down
Falling down
Following the angels down

As the sun went down over the bridge
And the music and dance reached its pitch
Satellites, they joined the world in the games
Hope was born again, to live in the flame

They came falling down
Following the angels down
Falling down
Following the angels down

If I never live to see another day
I wish that it could always be just that way
Like a symphony of dancing light
Banishing the worldâ€™s woes into the night
They came falling down
Following the angels down
Falling down
Following the angels down

Following the angels down (x16)Embed
