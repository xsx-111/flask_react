Sailing LyricsLet me out, I can't breathe
Gotta get out of this concrete hole
I'm wrecked and I'm decked
I've gotta break free before I lose control
Cast the lines away
From the dock at the harbour bay
All those cares and worries and woes
You can save them for another day
Because we're sailing, sailing
Yes we're sailing, sailing
Give me space, I'm on fire
Banging my head against a hard brick wall
And I'm gone, so long
You can leave a message but I'll never call
Cast the lines away
From the dock at the harbour bay
It's a fine bright day
And the wind is blowing away
Let's go sailing, sailing
Yes we're sailing, sailing
Cast the lines away
From the dock at the harbour bay
There's no cares no worries no woes
And the wind is blowing away
Let's go sailing, sailing
Yes we're sailing, sailing
You know that if you want to come
With me baby you can sail away
Cast the line
If you've got time, come with me baby
Sailing, sailing
Sailing, sailingEmbed
