Castaway LyricsMidnight
All alone in the room
Streetlights
Shadows dance in the gloom
Cold as ice
In the dark at the moon
Soft cries from the silent cocoon
Castaway
Castaway
Dark sounds from the room next door
Heavy fall
I can hear through the wall
Stark light
No answer my call
This fight
There's no victor at all
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway 
One dream
Could be true
One hope
To see this through
One heart
Caught on the ropes
One love
Gone up in smoke
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway 
So now
I just stand at the cross
Which path should I take it be lost
Oh Lord
Can't you give me a sign
So peace of the heart could be mine
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
Castaway
