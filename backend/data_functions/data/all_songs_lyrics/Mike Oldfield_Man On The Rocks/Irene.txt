Irene LyricsIrene, I said
Irene, she's coming
And we're running
We're running running
Irene, she's rolling
There's no controlling Irene
She'll wreck ya
And you bet ya, woah
She's coming, oh
And we're running
Running, running
Irene, she'll take ya
She'll break ya, Irene
We're running
'Cause she's coming, oh
She'll break ya, she'll take ya
Rolling, she's rolling
She's rolling, just keeps rollingEmbed
