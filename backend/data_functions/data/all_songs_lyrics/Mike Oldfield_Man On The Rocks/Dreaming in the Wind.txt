Dreaming in the Wind LyricsYou may see a white bird in a clear blue sky
I'm dreaming in the wind flying high
There's a whispering sound in the air all around
I'm dreaming in the wind as the sun goes down
You may see a bright star in a clear night sky
I'm dreaming in the wind as the earth roles by
There's a silver light as the bird takes flight
I'm dreaming in the wind as the day turns to night
You may hear the wind sigh on a mountain high
I'm dreaming in the wind, I belong to the sky
On a distant shore there's no one no more
I'm dreaming in the wind, I'm at heaven's door
There's a new sunrise in the crimson skies
I'm dreaming in the wind as the white bird cries
See the silver light as the bird takes flight
I'm dreaming in the wind as the day turns to night
Dreaming in the wind
Dreaming, I'm dreaming in the wind
Dreaming in the wind
Dreaming, dreaming in the wind
Dreaming in the wind
Dreaming, I'm dreaming in the wind1Embed
