Moonshine LyricsWalking out on a stormy day
The cold wind the fine sea spray
Looking out over Galway bay
The troubled sky all dark and grey
Far from these shores there stands liberty
So let it be
But every while I would remember
The day we drank moonshine in the rain
And raised our glasses to the wind
The day that we dreamed we could be free
Riding the wings of liberty
So here's one more for our friends
And here's one for our children
Feeling the cold rain on our fingertips
And moonshine on our lips
So we paid our dues and we packed our bags
Made it thought Ellis Island's ranks
Across the waves to America
Hearts and souls to the stripes and stars
Far from our shores we found liberty
So let it be
But every while I would remember
The day we drank moonshine in the rain
And raised our glasses to the wind
The day that we dreamed we could be free
Riding the wings of liberty
So here's one more for our friends
And here's one for our children
Feeling the cold rain on our fingertips
And moonshine on our lips
So we made our way
Through the Cumberland gap
Appalachia never looking back
Through the wind and rain
But nothing evermore would feel the same
All of this life we strive to be free
So let it be
But every while I would remember
The day we drank moonshine in the rain
And raised our glasses to the wind
The day that we dreamed we could be free
Riding the wings of liberty
So here's one more for our friends
And here's one for our children
Feeling the cold rain on our fingertips
And moonshine on our lips
Moonshine in the rain
And raised our glasses to the wind
The day that we dreamed we could be free
Riding on wings of liberty
So here's one for our friends
And here's one our children
Feeling the cold rain on your fingertips
And moonshine on our lipsEmbed
