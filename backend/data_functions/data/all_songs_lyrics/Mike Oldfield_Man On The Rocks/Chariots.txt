Chariots Lyrics
There will be no mistake
'Cause I watch every move you make
There'll be nowhere to hide
When the world knows the other side
Don't try to black my name
'Cause I've got you in my sights again

Suspicion is the game
And it takes you down the road to ruin
Black shadows in the night
And the ranting and raving fight

Put an end to this tyranny
'Cause we're fighting to be free

And there'll be chariots to carry us all
There will be chariots to carry us home
Chariots to carry us all
There will be chariots to carry us home

Thereâ€™s no use to be chained
When you know nothing's to be gained
So break out the army now
We will stand or we'll fall and bow
