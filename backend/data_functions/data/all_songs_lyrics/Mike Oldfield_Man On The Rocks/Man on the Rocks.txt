Man on the Rocks LyricsSo you come to my world, I can show you
Where they lead to the footprints in the sand
On the paths through the valleys and canyons
To the veins in your arm, take my hand
I’m the man on the rocks on the island
The black pearl, the fool on the hill
I’m the gold at the end of the rainbow
If I ask you to follow, you will
So you come to my world to find freedom
Give you wings to the stars, you can fly
Bring you hope and a dream to believe in
As you float through the dark, crimson sky
I’m the man on the rocks on the island
The jewel in the crown of the king
I’m the hope in the hearts of the helpless
The choir where no-one will sing
There’s a trail out of the canyon
There’s a new life waiting out there!
It’ll take you home, out of this chasm
Where there’s blue sky sunlight to share.\
So you come to my world to escape it all
And you’re running from the dragons and the fools!
Through the dark, empty caverns deep in your soul
Chasing the tiger, the jewels.\
I’m the the man on the rocks on the island
I’m the beggar, the loser, the cheat!
So now you come to the gates for redemption
With a ball and chain at your feet
There’s a trail out of the canyon
There’s a new life waiting out there!
It’ll take you home, out of this chasm
Where there’s blue sky, sunlight to share!
I'm the man, on the rocks, on the island x21Embed
