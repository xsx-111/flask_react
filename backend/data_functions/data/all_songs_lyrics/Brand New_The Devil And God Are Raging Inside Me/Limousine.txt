Limousine Lyrics
Kate, it's your ride
Get your petals out and lay them in the aisle
Pretend you're God and grow, and it’s your day to wed
We found your man, he's drinking up, he's All-American
And he'll drive
He's volunteered with grace to end your life
He'll tidy up
It's sad to hold, but leave your shell to us
You explode
You firefly, you tiny boat with oars
Feather oars. The world tilts back and pours and pours
And so, you satellite
You tidal wave, you're a big surprise
And I've one more night to be your mother
The signal interrupted
My baby's frequency not strong enough
Remain in my hands and smile
We will miss you but in time you'll get set up
And we will write

A beauty supreme, yeah you were right about me
Can I get myself out from underneath this guilt that will crush me
And in the choir I saw a sad messiah
He was bored and tired of my laments
Said, "I died for you one time but never again"
(Never again)
(Never again)
(Never again)
(Never again)
(Never again)
(Never again)
(Never again)
Well, I love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Well, I love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
One'll love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Two'll love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Three'll love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Four'll love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Five'll love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Six will love you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Seven loves you so much (Never again)
But do me a favor, baby, don't reply (Never again, never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it (Never again)
Seven loved you so much
We'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth (Never again)
But do me a favor
We'll never have to rot together under the dirt (Never again)
Baby, don't reply
I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd (Never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
Well I should be laughing right now (Never again)
Seven loved you so much
We'll never have to buy adjacent plots of earth (Never again)
But do me a favor
We'll never have to rot together under the dirt (Never again)
Baby, don't reply
I'll never have to lose my baby in the crowd (Never again)
'Cause I can dish it out, but I can't take it
Well I should be laughing right now (Never again)

I don't know what's going on—maybe you could fill me in about the recording9Embed
