Millstone Lyrics
I used to be such a burning example
I used to be so original
I used to care, I was being cared for
Made sure I showed it to those that I love
I used to sleep without a single stir
Cause I was about my father's work

Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

I used to pray like God was listening
I used to make my parents proud
I was the glue that kept my friends together
Now they don't talk and we don't go out
I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed
Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it

Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give
Well, throw me that lifeline
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give
Never hit the brakes
There's no time to save him
He just ran out in the street
Anybody know his name?
I think I recognize him
Sure as hell paid for that mistake
Whoa, whoa
Well, take me out tonight (Whoa)
(I used to be such a burning example)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
(I used to be so original)
I'm my own stone around my neck (Whoa)
(I used to care, I was being cared for)
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give
(Made sure I showed it to those that I love)
Well, save my life tonight (Whoa)
(I used to pray like God was listening)
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
(I used to make my parents proud)
I'm my own stone around my neck (Whoa)
(I was the glue that kept my friends together)
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give
(Now they don't talk and we don't go out)10Embed
