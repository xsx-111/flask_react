Luca (Reprisal) Lyrics
Well I lost my taste for the company of airports and cars
We flew through the year and avoided the dust and the rock
We stood in the way of the tank till we board and we stopped
So never show doubt in your hand
Till you know what they got

Touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been
Well drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait
Well I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake
Shimmering under a moon
 made in anger and haste
Shimmering like a penny
 out of reach in the
 subway grating 
1 2 3 4

5 6 7 8
I was the one who was always repeating it
Shimmering like a coin kept safe away
You never listen to anything
Touch me or don't
Just let me know
Where you've been
Leave it alone
I'm sure there's someone who knows
Where you've beenEmbed
