The Great White Ocean LyricsSwim with me my mama when I dive
In the ocean of death, I will cry
If I am not with my family
You could be my friend eternally
Swim with me my sister when I dive
In the great white ocean, we must try
Try to find a way that we can see
See each others faces in the sea
Swim with me my brother, when I dive
I don't ever want to say goodbye
If you do go first, or if it's me
Ooh, my darling brother, swim with me
Swim to me my father, when I dive
Please remember father, we must try
Try not to forget our family
Ooh, my darling father, rescue me
Try not to forget our family
Ooh, my darling father
We must try
See each other's facesEmbed
