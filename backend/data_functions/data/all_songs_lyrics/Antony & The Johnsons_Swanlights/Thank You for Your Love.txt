Thank You for Your Love LyricsOoh, thank you for your love
Thank you for your love
When all is falling in the seizure of pain
Ooh, thank you for your love
Thank you for your love
Thank you for your love
When I was lost in the darkness
Ooh thank you for your love
I want to thank you, ooh
I want to thank you, ooh
I want to thank you, ooh
I want to thank you, ooh
Thank you, thank you
Thank you for your love
Thank you for your love
When my mind was broken into a thousand pieces
Oh thank you for your love
I want to thank you, ooh
I want to thank you, ooh
I want to thank you, ooh
I want to thank you, ooh
Thank you, thank you
Thank you
I thank you, thank you
I thank you
I thank you, thank you
I thank you
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
I thank you, I thank you
I thank you
I thank you, I thank youEmbed
