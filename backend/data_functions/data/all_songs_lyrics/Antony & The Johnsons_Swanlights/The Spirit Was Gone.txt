The Spirit Was Gone LyricsThe spirit was gone from her body
Forever had always been inside
That shell had always been intertwined
And now were disintwined
It's hard to understand
The spirit was gone from her body
Forever had always been inside
That shell had always been intertwined
And now were disintwined
It's hard to understand, oh
The spirit was gone
The spirit was gone
The spirit was gone
The spirit was gone
The spirit was gone
The spirit was gone
The spirit was gone
And now were disintwined
It's hard to understandEmbed
