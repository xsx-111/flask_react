Swanlights LyricsOoh, I'm living
It's a golden thing
It means everything
I'm gifted by your grace
It's the swanlights
In the water
On that shining face
Ooh, it's such a mystery to me
Ooh, it's such a mystery to me
What I have seen
Faces in my dreams
Ooh, the swanlights
The swanlights
When I close my eyes
And dream swans come
When in love I lean
On the swanlight song
Ooh, it's such a mystery to me
Ooh, it's such a mystery to me
Ooh
I'm dancing with their necks
Dancing neck to neckEmbed
