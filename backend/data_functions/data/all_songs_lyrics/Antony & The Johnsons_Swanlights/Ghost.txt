Ghost LyricsGhost, ghost
Leap from my heart
Leap from my heart
And find your way, your way
Taste the rivers
Chase the sunrise
Do not stay
Open yours, the sky before you
Dance toward a light so gay
Do not waste a thought behind you
Don't pity this useless clay
Snake, snake
Shed your skin
Shed your skin
And go away, away
Leave behind your shadow's memory
Leave me, this is your dayEmbed
