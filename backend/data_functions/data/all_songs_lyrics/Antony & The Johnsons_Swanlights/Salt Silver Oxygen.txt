Salt Silver Oxygen LyricsThe flying horse carries me across the sky
Triumvirate swallows make our breath
Can we grow a sun, a water run
The Great White Water?
Every slum an ox inside it
Sweet crevice for miniature flies?
Dancing with his casket
Christ becomes wife
The easy dust is dancing, too
It splits the waterside in two
Elect the Salt Mother
For she's a selective Christ
Elect the Salt Mother
Elect the Salt Mother
For she's a selective Christ
Punch her ghost
For sure she'll sigh
And watch the window gives rise
Punch her ghost
For sure she'll sigh
And watch the window gives rise
Can we grow a sun, a water run
The Great White Water?
Every slum inside, an ox inside it
Sweet crevice for miniature flies?
Dancing with his casket
Christ becomes wife
The easy dust is dancing, too
It splits the waterside in two
Punch her ghost
For sure she'll sigh
And watch the window gives rise
Punch her ghost
For sure she'll sigh
And watch the window gives rise
Elect the Salt Mother
For she's a selective Christ
Elect the Salt Mother
Elect the Salt MotherEmbed
