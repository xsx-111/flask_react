That Kinda Girl Lyrics
The other night I met a girl and she looked to be so nice (Nice)
I asked her for the digits and she didn't think twice (Twice)
A couple of days later, called her up and asked her out
She said "With you?" I said "With me," and then she said "Without a doubt." (Nice)
I took her to the garden where I guess they grow the olives
She wore a tighter skirt than any I had seen in college (What?!)
She said, "I love to smoke and drink while cursin' like a sailor."
I asked her where she got her mouth and if she had a tailor
Finally, I walked her to the door to say good night (Right)
She said, "I am an apple. Would you care to take a bite?" (A bite?)
Politely, I refused and said, "I'm lookin' for a lady."
So she slapped me *slap* in my face and said, "Boy, you must be crazy."

D-different from the ones before
Different from the ones before
She's that kind of girl
Different from the ones before
'Cause I know she loves the Lord
She's that kind of girl
Virtuous in every way
The kind of girl that makes you say
"I hope she comes my way."

Well, I'm lookin' for a girl who's virtuous
'Cause God laid it on my heart to search for this
So I open up the Word to the book of Proverbs
The 31st chapter tells me all about her
Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain
A woman who fears the Lord, she ain't playin'
Hear what I'm sayin' 'cause I'm sayin' it clearly
She's the kinda girl I gots to have near me
She's that kind of girl (That kinda girl)
Different from the ones before
'Cause I know she loves the Lord
She's that kind of girl (That kinda girl)
Virtuous in every way
The kind of girl that makes you say…

Well, I'm lookin' into hookin' with a lady (A lady)
And not a girly of the worldy that's shady (Shady)
But the kinda girl you meet behind the doors of the church
You see, God will bring her to me so I don't have to search (Go, funky)
Too hard, I've been scarred by the ones of the past (Go, funky)
So put an A.P.B. out on the one that'll last (Ah, last)
A little longer than a roll in the hay for sure (Go, funky) (Ooh!)
But a bonafide lady's what I'm prayin' for (Go, funk—)

When I finally meet her
I'll know how to treat her (Treat her)
By fulfillin' all her needs (I'ma fill her needs)
Love her and respect her
Cherish her forever
She's the kind of girl for me (She's the kinda girl)
She's that kind of girl (That kinda girl)
Different from the ones before
'Cause I know she loves the Lord
She's that kind of girl
Perfect for each other
There'll never be another for me
She's that kind of girl (That kinda girl)
Virtuous in every way
The kind of girl that makes you say (Say, yeah)
"I hope she comes my way." (To the bridge)

Heaven, help me, hear my plea
I know there's one who's perfect for me, ayy-ee

When I finally meet her
I'll know how to treat her (Oh, yeah)
By fulfillin' all her needs (All her needs have been fulfilled)
Love her and respect her (Respect her)
Cherish her forever (Ever)
She's the kind of girl for me (She's the kinda girl)

She's the kinda girl for me (That girl)
The kinda girl for me
She's the kinda girl for me (Yeah) (That kind of girl)
She's the kinda girl for me (That girl) (Ooh)
The kinda girl for me
She's the kinda girl for me
I pray she come's my way (Ah)
She's that kind of girl (That kinda girl)
Different from the ones before
'Cause I know she loves the Lord
She's that kind of girl (That kinda girl)
Virtuous in every way
The kind of girl that makes you say…

She's that kind of girl
Hey, know what I'm sayin'?
Different from the ones before
She's the one that I adore
She's that kind of girl
Hey, the girly ain't playin'
Virtuous in every way
The kind of girl that makes you say (Yeah)
"I hope she comes my way."Embed
