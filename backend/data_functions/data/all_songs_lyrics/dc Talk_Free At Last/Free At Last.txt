Free At Last Lyrics
Young people
Welcome to the Close Cover Before Striking School of Heavy Machinery and Ministry tonight
Won't you please turn in your hymnals to page 333?
Sister Mildred, we're gonna play "Free at Last"
Free at last, thank God Almighty
Free at last, free at last
I thank God I'm free at last
Free at last, free at last
I thank God I'm free at last
Have you heard?
Listen carefully
I can't stop
Ooh ooh yeah oh
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh
Thank You, Lord, oh

Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free
'Cause I'm free (Free), free at last
And I'm free (Free), from my past and I'm free (Free)
Free from sin and I'm free (Free)
And I ain't goin' back again (Thank God I'm free)
Shackles had me down but He gave me a new sound
So reclaim my name from the lost and found
Ya see, something's got me jumpin' and I think it's the way
That He can take a hard man and turn him into soft clay
Out of the darkness, the Father has sparked this
The Spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well, I once was lost but I'm free at last

Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free
'Cause I'm free (Free), free at last
And I'm free (Free), from my past and I'm free (Free)
Free from sin and I'm free (Free)
And I ain't goin' back again (Thank God I'm free)

Oppression was in session and my life was the term
But when I heard about the word I was willin' to learn
About a flavor I could savor and a brighter tomorrow
'Cause this could never be endeavored by a wish on a star
The Father first receives us, the truth then frees us
Forgiven, now I'm livin' like a man full of Jesus
It was Hell until I fell upon my knees and prayed
But now the yoke that I was totin' has been taken away (Aw, yeah)
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free
'Cause I'm free (Free), free at last
(Free) from my past (Free)
Free from sin and I'm free (Free)
I'm down on my knees when my life passed me by
And I ain't goin', ain't goin' back again (Thank God I'm free)

F-R to the E-E
L-A to the S-T

Out of the darkness, the father has sparked this (Huh!)
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well, I was once lost but I'm free at last (Huh!)

I'm here to tell you what He did for me and
I'm here to tell you that He set me free and
I know that He can do the same for you too
He did it, I'm wit' it, so come and get it
Be free at last!
Free, free, I'm free at last (Oh, free)
Thank God Almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free (Thank You, Lord)
Free, free, I'm free at last (Oh)
Thank God Almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free

When all of God's Children, black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics
Will be able to join hands
And sing in the words of the old negro spiritualâ€¦

Free, free, I'm free at last (Whoa oh oh)
Thank God Almighty I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
Thank God Almighty I'm free
'Cause I'm free (Free), free at last
(Free) Yeah (Free at last), 'cause I'm free, yeah (Free)
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free (Free)
I'm down on my knees when my life passed me by (Hallelujah)
And I ain't goin', ain't goin' back again (Thank God I'm free)

Free at last, free at last
Thank God Almighty we are free at last!Embed
