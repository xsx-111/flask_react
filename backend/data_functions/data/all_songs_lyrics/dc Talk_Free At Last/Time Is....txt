Time Is... Lyrics
It's-it's too short—it's too short a time (It's-it's too short—it's too short a time)
I have lots of time
They say "Time waits for no man"
All the time
Wasted time, wasted time
Wait a minute (Wait a minute)
This'll just take a little time
Timeout!

Time is tickin' away (Away)
Time is tickin' (Tick tock!)
Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin' (Away)
Tick tick tick tock tickin'

Here we go again
Straight up rock 'n' roll here
All that hip-hop, word is sport
Don't forget
Let's go, here we go
Everybody
Let's go, here we go
Everybody
Let's go, here we go
Everybody
Let's go, check it out
You got a gift and you best start usin' it (Start usin' it)
'Cause if you don't you're gonna wind up losin' it
Just like the brother who buried it deep (Buried it deep)
The task was simple but the price was steep (Steep)
We got a mission while we're on this Earth
We need to tell people 'bout our second birth (Second birth)
Get busy like a schoolboy makin' a A
'Cause time, my brother, is tickin' away

Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (It's tickin'!)
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (Tick! Tick!)
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (C'mon, it's tickin')
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away

Tick tock, tickety tock
Tick tock, tickety tock
Tick tock, tickety tock
Tickety tickety tickety
Right now is the time that we gotta get wit' it (Get wit' it)
The gift that He's given ain't just an exhibit
But a tool that He's given us to use for His sake (For God's sake)
And just as He's given, He can surely take
The signs of the times are droppin' like flies
The cries of the people around us imply
They're lookin' for an answer that we already know
But time is definitely on the go

All the money in the world (All the time)
Can never stop the hands of time
And a wasted day in your life (All the time)
Is more than a crime
Now kick it

Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (It's tickin'!)
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (Tick! Tick!)
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (C'mon, it's tickin')
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away
Tick tock, tickety tock
Tick tock, tickety tock
Tick tock, tickety tock
Tickety tickety tickety tock

Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin' (Tickin' on an' on an' on)
Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin'
Now break it down

You got a gift and you best start usin' it (Usin' it) (DC Talk, Talk)
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna wind up losin' it (All the time) (DC Talk, Talk)
Get busy like a school boy makin' an A (DC Talk, Talk)
'Cause time, my brother, is tickin' away (DC Talk, Talk) (All the time)

Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (It's tickin'!)
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away (Tick! Tick!)
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away ('Cause it's tickin')
Time is tickin' away
Tick-tick-tickin' away

Is this the last hurrah?

Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'
Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'
Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'
Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'
Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'
Time is…
Time is tickin' away
Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'
Time is…
Time is tickin' away
Time is…
Whoa, wait a minuteEmbed
