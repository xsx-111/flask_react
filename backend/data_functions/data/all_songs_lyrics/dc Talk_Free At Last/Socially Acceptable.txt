Socially Acceptable Lyrics
It's okay, it's alright
It's o—it's okay, it's a—it's alright
Yeah, here we go
DCT is in the house, boy
It's o—it's okay, it's a—it's alright

Whatcha thinkin' (Whatcha think?) doin' the things you do?
Whose opinion are you listenin' to? (Who ya listenin' to?)
Justifyin', you turn it all to gray (All to gray)
Synchronizin' to society's ways

Society has gotten to be all outta whack
And don't bother with excuses, whether white or black
To blame it on a color won't get a result
Because history reveals to me how ethics were lost
In reality, our decency has taken a plunge
"In God We Trust" is an American pun
Funny how it happened so suddenly
Hey yo, fellas, kick the melody

Socially acceptable
It's okay (Is it okay?)
It's alright (Is it alright?)
Socially acceptable
It's okay (Is it okay?)
In whose sight? (Whose sight?)
Socially acceptable
Times are changin' (Times are changin') with morals in decay
Human rights have made the wrongs okay (Wrongs okay)
Something's missin' and if you're askin' me (Askin' me)
I think that somethin' is the G-O-D (G-O-D)

To label wrong or right by the people's sight
Is like goin' to a loser to ask advice
And by basin' your plans on another man's way of livin' life (Life)
Is creatin' a brand of ethics sure to be missin' the punch
No-count morals that are out to lunch
They're slidin' away 'cause everything is okay
It was taboo back then but today you say, "What the hey?"

Socially acceptable
It's okay (Is it okay?)
It's alright (Is it alright?)
Socially acceptable
It's okay (Is it okay?)
In whose sight? (Whose sight?)
Socially acceptable (Yeah yeah)
It's okay (Is it okay?)
It's alright (Is it alright?)
Socially acceptable
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now here we go (Here we go)
A come on (A come on)
Now here we go (Here we go)
A come on (A come on)
Now here we go (Here we go)
A come on (A come on)
Now here we go (Here we go)
A come on (A come on)

Everybody's doin' it
Who's doin' it?
Everybody's doin' it
Yo, who's doin' it?
Everybody's doin' it
Who's doin' it?
Everybody's doin' it?
Yo, yo, yo, who's doin' it?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh, alright
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, come on

We gotta back to the principles found in the Word
A little G-O-D could be society's cure
From the state that we're in 'cause again we're slippin'
So pray for America 'cause time is tickin'
Socially (Socially) acceptable (Acceptable)
It's okay (It's okay)
It's alright (It's alright)
Socially (Socially) (Ayy) acceptable (Acceptable)
It's okay (Okay)
In whose sight?
Socially (Socially) acceptable (Acceptable)
It's okay (Everybody's doin' it)
It's alright (Everybody's doin' it)
Socially acceptable
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh)
It's okay (It's okay)
In whose sight? (Alright)
