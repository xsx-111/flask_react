Word 2 the Father Lyrics
Ah yeah (Yeah)
Here we go! (Yo)
Kick it, T
Yo, man, E-Train is in the house (Yeah)
DC's in the house (Ah, yeah)
K-Max is in the house (Ay, K)
And gon' closin' it out is DC's own (Oh, definitely, play it)
One, two, three, hit it!
Word to the Father (To the Father)
Word to the Father (To the Father, Father)
Word to the Father (To the Father)
Word to the Father

We're here to say word to the Father up in Heaven
A shout out loud (Hey) from me, Mike, and Kevin
Some may wonder what we're talkin' about
When Word is heard, it's like a church that shouts "Amen!"
It breaks down to approval
Those in the pews may find it unusual
We're here to get them to loosen their collars
And use this to say word to the Father

Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!
Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!
It's like that y'all, that y'all, that y'all, that y'all
Better than that is like that y'all
It's like that y'all, that y'all, that y'all, that y'all
Better than that is like that y'all

Once again we're here to drop some science
Standin' up tall in the land of giants
Steadily keepin' our message intact
And the truth is, it's a matter of fact
That this goes out to the One we look to
Hopin' that the message in our jam would hook you
Up in a hurry so that you could be locked in
This is a bond that you oughtta take stock in

This is a shout out to Heaven
From Toby, Mike and Kevin
Straight up propers to the Papa
And can't nobody stop us
'Cause we'll do this like Brutus
We told you we ain't new to this
So jump on it like a hornet
And we got no other word than…
Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!
Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!

When DC talks, He works like this
I love rap music. Can I get a witness?
He's doin' new thangs so the children can live
Without the things of this world that only He can give
We need to talk it out, stop spinnin' around
So let's take it to the Lord if we're Heavenbound
You see, time is tickin' away so we gotta come harder
We're tearin' down walls with a word to the Father

God is always workin' (Workin')
Alleluia
God is always workin' (Workin')
Alleluia (Hit it!)

Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father (To the Father)
Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father (To the Father)
Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father (To the Father)
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!
Word, say word to the Father
Above any other, say word to the Father (To the Father)
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!
Word to the Father (To the Father)
Word to the Father up above
Singin' word to the Father (To the Father)
Word to the Father up above
I give my life to You
Word to the Father (To the Father)
In everything I do
Word to the Father
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!
These words I sing to You
Word to the Father (To the Father)
This love I know will never end (—er end)
Word to the—
Pump, pump, pump, pump it up!
It's a trip
It's got a funky beat
And I can bug out to itEmbed
