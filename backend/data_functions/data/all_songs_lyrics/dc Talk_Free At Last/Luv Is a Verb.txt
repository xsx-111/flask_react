Luv Is a Verb Lyrics
Take this mug for a ride!
Hoo! Bur! Hur! Ha! (Yeah, boy!) Ha-ha!
Down with the DC Talk
D-d-down with the DC Talk
Are you down with the DC Talk?
D-d-down with the DC Talk

(Uh) Pullin' out my big black book (Black book)
(Uh) 'Cause when I need a word defined, that's where I look
(Uh) So I turn to the "L"'s quick, fast, in a hurry
(Uh) Threw on my specs, thought my vision was blurry
(Uh) I looked again but to my dismay
(Uh) It was black and white with no room for gray
(Uh) Ya see, a big "V" stood beyond the word
(Uh) And, yo, that's when it hit me (Ha!) that "love" is a verb

Words come easy but don't mean much
When the words they're sayin' you can't put trust in
We're talkin' 'bout love in a different light
And if we all learn to love it will be just right

(Hoo!) Hey, tell me, haven't you heard? (Haven't you heard?)
"Love" is a serious word (Serious—serious word)
Hey, I think it's time you learned
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you heard
The word "love," (Ha!) "love" is a verb
Down with the DC Talk
D-d-down with the DC Talk
Are you down with the DC Talk?
D-d-down with the DC Talk

(Uh) Thinkin' of a way to explain-o (Explain)
(Uh) 'Cause ya knowin' that I'm flowin' like a bottle o' Drāno
(Uh) Simple and plain (Oh), L-O-V-E
Ain't all that junk that you see on TV
Put soaps on a rope 'cause they ain't worth cope'n
With it's a myth that there ain't no hope and
Love is enough if it's unconditionally
Given now ya livin' out the Great Commission

Words come easy but don't mean much
When the words they're sayin' you can't put trust in
We're talkin' 'bout love in a different light
And if we all learn to love it will be just right

(Bur!) Hey, tell me, haven't you heard? (Haven't you heard?)
"Love" is a serious word (Serious—serious word)
Hey, I think it's time you learned
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you heard
The word "love," (Ha!) "love" is a verb
Down with the DC Talk
D-d-down with the DC Talk
Down with the DC Talk
D-d-down with the DC Talk
Down with the DC Talk
Ooh
D-d-down with the DC Talk
Ooh-ooh
Down with the DC Talk
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
D-d-down with the DC Talk

(Uh) Back—back—back in the day there was a man (A man)
(Uh) Who stepped outta Heaven and He walked the land (Walked the land)
(Uh) He delivered to the people an eternal choice
(Uh) With a heart full o' love and the truth in His voice
(Uh) Gave up His life so that we may live
(Uh) How much more love could the Son o' God give?
(Uh) Here is the example that we outta be matchin'
(Uh) 'Cause "love" is a word that requires some action

Words come easy but don't mean much
When the words they're sayin' you can't put trust in
We're talkin' 'bout love in a different light
And if we all learn to love it will be just right (Come on!)
(Bur!) Hey, tell me, haven't you heard? (Haven't you heard?)
"Love" is a serious word (Serious—serious word)
Hey, I think it's time you learned
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you heard
The word "love," (Ha!) love is a verb
(Boo!) Hey, tell me, haven't you heard (Haven't ya—haven't ya heard?)
(Bur!) "Love" is a serious word (Serious—serious word)
(Bah!) Hey, I think it's time you learned
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you heard
The word "love," (We gotta keep on lovin'!) "love" is a verb

 Hey, hey
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 Tell me, haven't you heard?
 (D-d-down with the DC Talk)
 "Love," "love"
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 Is a serious word
 (D-d-down with the DC Talk)
 Hey, hey
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 I'm think—, I'm thinkin'
 I think, I think
 (D-d-down with the DC Talk)
 What you say, what you heard
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 "Love" is a verb!
 Hey, hey
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 Tell me, haven't you heard?
 (D-d-down with the DC Talk)
 "Love," "love"
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 Is a serious word, come on
 (D-d-down with the DC Talk)
 Hey, hey
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 Hey, hey, hey, hey
 (D-d-down with the DC Talk)
 I'm sayin'…
 (Down with the DC Talk)
 "Love" is a, "love" is a, "love" is a verb!
