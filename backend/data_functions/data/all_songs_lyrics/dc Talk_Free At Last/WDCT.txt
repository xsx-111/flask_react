WDCT Lyrics
Aw yeah, ha ha ha!
W.D.C.T., talk radio
With the sounds that shake them bones
'Cause we're bringin' you the funk, the whole funk, and nothin' but the funk DC Talk style
Oh yeah
Day and night, night and day
And it's me the E flippin' the wax
So kick back, relax, all you little funkadelics 'cause the train's in the house, ha
Kickin the mad styles for ya
So yo, next up is that little diddy off that funky, funky, funky little ablum, "Free at Last."
It's about time
Word, ya know what I'm saying?
Been tellin' me it's been comin' out for two years
Been waitin' on this record, man
It's about time you be flippin' instead of flakin'
Brother be flippin'Embed
