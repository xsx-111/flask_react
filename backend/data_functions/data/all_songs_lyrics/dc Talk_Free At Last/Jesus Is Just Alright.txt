Jesus Is Just Alright Lyrics
Do do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do
Kick it for me one time
Oh, yeah, yeah

Jesus is still all right with me
Jesus is still all right, oh, yeah
Jesus is still all right with me
Jesus is still all right
You know that He's all right

Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up

(Uh) TobyMac, and the Mac is back, no slack
On a DC track that's jacked (Uh)
Beyond comprehension
I believe that I failed to mention (Uh)
That there's a lack of recognition
When it comes to His position (Uh)
'Cause if Christ can't be crossed over
Then I'll keep my beat up nova (Uh)
Jesus is still all right with me
Jesus is still all right, oh, yeah
Jesus is still all right with me
Jesus is still all right
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I don't care what they may say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care what they may say
'Cause Jesus is still all right
All right with me, yeah

(Uh) Back in place
And I'm all up in your face
With a rhyme that I embrace (Uh)
Like a mother to her child
I'm kickin' it Jesus style (Uh)
To the ones that think they heard
I did use the "J" word (Uh)
'Cause I ain't too soft to say it
Even if DJ's don't play it (Uh)

Do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do
Jesus is still all right
Oh, I'm hopin' and I'm prayin'
Jesus is still all right (Right, right, right)
Jesus is still all right, oh, yeah (Uh)
Jesus is still all right (Right, right, right)
Jesus is still all right (Uh)
Whoa whoa yeah
(Uh) Turn it up
(Uh) Turn it up
(Uh) Turn it up
(Uh)
Strike a pose
H-h-how do they do that?
Strike a pose
H-h-how do they do that?
(There's more, get in this, He's all right)

Jesus is all right (I got the power) (All right)
I know He's all right (Get it together for the One that is known)
Jesus is all right (I got the power)
You know He's all right (Get it together for the One that is known)
Jesus is all right (I got the power) (Get it together for the One that is known)
We know He's all right (Get it together for the One that is known)
Jesus is all right (I got the power) (Get it together for the One that is known)
We know He's all right (Get it together for the One that is known)
Now we come to the payoff (Uh, uh)
Down with the one that is known as the Son (Woo)
Of the G to the O to the D, never done (Jesus)
With the flow, in the know, on the go like a pro (Woo)
Not for show 'cause I ain't in the biz for the dough (Uh) (Jesus)
Or the me, or the ray, all the dough's gotta stay (Woo)
'Cause I can't, no, I can't, take it home anyway (Jesus)
Never trite when I write 'cause the Lord is my light (Woo)
And His Word is my bond, so ya know (Know, know, know, know) He's—He's all right

Jesus is still all right with me (All right)
Jesus is still all right, oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Jesus is still all right with me (He's all right)
Jesus is still all right (All right)

I don't care what they may say
I don't care what they may do
I don't care what they may say
'Cause Jesus is still all right
Oh, Jesus is all right with us

Do do do do do
Do do do (To me)
Do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do
Jesus is still all right

Oh, He's all—He's all—He's all—He's all right
Think about itEmbed
