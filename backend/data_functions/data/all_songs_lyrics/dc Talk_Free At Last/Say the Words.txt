Say the Words Lyrics
You gotta say
You gotta say it
Solomon once wrote:
"Better is open rebuke
Than hidden love"
So say the words
(Get into)

Silence is golden but these are the words
That the world needs to hear (Brothers and sisters)
Terms of compassion will cause a reaction
As love drives them near

But still we choose to hide behind the face of pride
Pretending we are blind to the calling (Calling)
This is my point and case, if hate can be erased
With such a simple phrase, why are we stalling?

Say the words, say the words
Say "I love you"
Say the words I long to hear
Say the words, say the words
Say "I love you"
Say the words I long to hear
You gotta say it
You gotta say it, say it
You gotta say it
You gotta say it (Get into)

Some just assume we already know
Of the love that they feel (Brothers and sisters)
Some have a heartfelt emotion
But never the words to reveal

I think we all relate, so why are we afraid
To let our hearts convey what we're feelin'?
There is a world in need with hungry souls to feed
And love can intercede if we're willing, so… (Brothers and sisters)

Say the words, say the words
Say "I love you" (Say "I love you")
Say the words I long to hear (I long to hear them)
Say the words, say the words
Say "I love you" (Say "I love you")
Say the words I long to hear (I long, I long, long to hear them)
You gotta say it
You gotta say it, say it
You gotta say it
You gotta say it (Check this out)

The word "love," (Love) it was once overused
Back in the 70's the word was abused
But I refuse to let love be diluted
We can't allow physical lust to intrude it (Check this out)
Or pollute it cause there ain't no excuse
For the greatest gift of all to be abused
So choose to lose the pride that may tug at you
Don't be afraid of the words "I love you"

Say the words, say the words
Say "I love you" (Love you)
Say the words I long to hear (I long to hear them, oh won't you…)
Say the words, say the words
Say "I love you" (Say "I love you")
Say the words I long to hear

Choose to lose the pride that may tug at you
Don't be afraid of the words "I love you" (So won't you…)
Say the words, say the words
Say the words "I love you" (You've got to say it) (Brothers and sisters)
Say the words, say the words
Say them over and over (Yeah, you've got to say it, say it)
Choose to lose the pride that may tug at you
Don't be afraid of the words "I love you"Embed
