Testimony Lyrics
Hey, yo, yo, T
What's up man?
Why don't you tell em that story bout how you went back in the day, in the hip-hop day?
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, tell 'em that story, man, huh?

We're gonna go back to the basics of the hip-hop scene
Just a loop and some lyrics and a mic. Ya know what I mean?
I was just a mere child in the capital of the nation
When I heard "Sugar Hill" on my favorite station
I dropped all I was doin', took a train to the city
To Douglas Records and the wizz, "Rappers Delight" was the ditty
No scritty for my palitty, no pop for my cicle
And since that day, I was never ever fickle

Ah yeah
Yo, that was smooth, T
That was smooth, that real smooth
I like that story
That was real, that was real, Toby
You better watch that stuff
All wackEmbed
