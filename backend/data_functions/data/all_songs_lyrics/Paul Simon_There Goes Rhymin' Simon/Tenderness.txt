Tenderness LyricsWhat can I do, what can I do?
Much of what you say is true
I know you see through me
But there's no tenderness beneath your honesty
Right and wrong, right and wrong
It never helped us get along
You say you care for me
But there's no tenderness beneath your honesty
You and me were such good friends
What's your hurry?
You and me could make amends
I'm not worried, I'm not worried
Honesty, honesty
It's such a waste of energy
No you don't have to lie to me
Just give me some tenderness beneath your honesty
You don't have to lie to me
Just give me some tendernessEmbed
