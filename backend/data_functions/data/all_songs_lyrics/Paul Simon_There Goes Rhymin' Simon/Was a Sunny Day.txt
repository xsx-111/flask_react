Was a Sunny Day LyricsWas a sunny day, not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard from the peoples passing by
Was a sunny day, all the birdies in the trees
And the radios singing song, all the favorite melodies
He was a navy man stationed in Newport News
She was a high school queen with nothing really left to lose
She was a high school queen with nothing really left to lose
Was a sunny day, not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard from the peoples passing by
Was a sunny day, all the birdies in the trees
And the radios singing song, all the favorite melodies
Her name was Lorelei, she was his only girl
She called him Speedoo but his Christian name was Mr. Earl
She called him Speedoo but his Christian name was Mr. Earl
Was a sunny day, not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard from the peoples passing by
Was a sunny day, all the birdies in the trees
And the radios singing song, all the favorite melodiesEmbed
