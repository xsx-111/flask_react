Something So Right LyricsYou've got the cool water when the fever runs high
You've got the look of lovelight in your eyes
And I was in crazy motion 'til you calmed me down
It took a little time but you calmed me down

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
But the last one to know
When something goes right
Oh it's likely to lose me
It's apt to confuse me
It's such an unusual sight
Oh, I can't get used to something so right
Something so right

They've got a wall in China, it's a thousand miles long
To keep out the foreigners they made it strong
And I've got a wall around me that you can't even see
It took a little time to get next to me

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
But the last one to know
When something goes right
Well it's likely to lose me
It's apt to confuse me
Because it's such an unusual sight
Oh, I swear
I can't get used to something so right
Something so right
Some people never say the words I love you
It's not their style to be so bold
Some people never say those words I love you
But like a child they're longing to be told

When something goes wrong
I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it
But the last one to know
When something goes right
Well it's likely to lose me
It's apt to confuse me
Because it's such an unusual sight
I swear I can't
I can't get used to something so right
Something so right
Something so rightEmbed
