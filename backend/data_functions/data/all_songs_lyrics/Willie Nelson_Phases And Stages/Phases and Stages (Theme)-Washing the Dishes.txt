Phases and Stages (Theme)/Washing the Dishes Lyrics
Phases and stages, circles and cycles
Scenes that we've all seen before
Let me tell you some more

Washing the dishes, scrubbing the floors
Caring for someone who don't care anymore
Learning to hate all the things that she once loved to do
Like washing his shirts and never complaining
Except of red stains on the collars
Ironing and crying, crying and ironing
Caring for someone who don't care anymore
Someday she'll just walk awayEmbed
