Phases and Stages (Theme)/Pick Up the Tempo/Phases and Stages (Theme) Lyrics
Some people are saying that time will take care of people like me
Then I'm living too fast and they say I can't last too much longer
But little they see that their thoughts of me is my savior
And they really should know that the beat ought to go just a little faster

So pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
The singer ain't singing and the drummer's been dragging too long
Time will take care of itself, so just leave time alone
And pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home

Well, I'm wild and I'm mean and I'm creating a scene I'm going crazy
Well, I'm good and I'm bad and I'm happy and I'm sad and I'm lazy
Well, I'm quiet and I'm loud and I'm gathering a crowd and I like gravy
About half off the wall but I learned it all in the navy
