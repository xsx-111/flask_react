Phases and Stages (Theme)/No Love Around Lyrics
I come home last Saturday morning
I come home and found you gone
Well, there was a note tacked on my door
Said your baby don't love you anymore
Well, I got dressed up and I went downtown
I got dressed up and I went downtown
Well, I walked up and I walked down
Well, there weren't no love there weren't no love around

There weren't no love around 

Well, I come home and I lay down
I felt my head spinning round and round
Lord, I poured my dreams
And I drank them down no there weren't no love
