Heaven and Hell Lyrics
Sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell
Sometimes I don't even know
Sometimes I take it as far as I can
And sometimes I don't even go

My front tracks are headed for a cold water well
My back tracks are covered with snow
Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell
And sometimes I don't even know
Play it little sister

And heaven ain't walking
On a street paved with gold
And hell ain't no mountain of fire
Heaven is laying
In my sweet baby's arms
And hell is when baby ain't there

My front tracks are headed for a cold water well
My back tracks are covered with snow
Sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell
And sometimes I don't even know
Sometimes it's heaven, and sometimes it's hell
And sometimes I don't even knowEmbed
