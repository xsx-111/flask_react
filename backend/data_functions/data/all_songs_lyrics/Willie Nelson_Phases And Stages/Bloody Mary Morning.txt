Bloody Mary Morning Lyrics
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight

As we taxi down the runway
With the smog and haze reminding me
Of how I feel
Just a country boy who's learning
That the pitfalls of the city
Are extremely real
All the night life and parties
Temptation and deceit
The order of the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in LA

Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight
Well, our golden jet is airborne
And Flight 50 cuts a path
Across the morning sky
And a voice comes through the speaker
Reassuring us Flight 50 is the way to fly
And a hostess takes our order
Coffee, tea or something stronger
To start off the day
Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
'Cause I'm leaving baby
Somewhere in LA

Well, it's a bloody Mary morning
Baby left me without warning
Sometime in the night
So I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flight

Yeah, I'm flying down to Houston
With forgetting her the nature of my flightEmbed
