Remove Ya Lyrics
Cop: "You wanna go to jail?"
Kid: "Well, for what, for what?"
Cop: "Shut your fuckin' mouth kid!"
Kid: "What am I getting arrested for?"
Cop: "For being a fucking mutt"

I'm a mutt, you a mutt, yeah we some mutts
Weeded up, but nah, we don't got no weed on us
DTs tried to scheme on us
We see the bluff, we see through it, we see you pigs, we see the cuffs
Porky pine, prickly but couldn't stick me this time
With a fine, that I'd find, four months after that shit was signed
For a crime, commited, did it, bullshit quit it
It's a dime, I didn't hurt nobody, I didn't cross no line
Often times, minding my own, on my way home, train waiting, patient
With the weight of the world on my dome
Thinking about how I could change up the city and take up my throne
They break up my zone, chain up my arm, they take me, I'm gone

To the boys in blue, never really liked 'em, rubbed me rude
While I was cruising the nue, vibin' the view
Hear the whoop whoop whoop, "stop don't move"
Hands on the hood, you gave me that look, wearing ya hood
Like a crook, mutt no good
To the boys in blue, rabid rats rip pork to stew
Nork the new, yorks my yard, my lady too
Ya want ya two, fifty all numbers, whats new
Keep the heat off yourself, up ya rank, quota thats due
Bling for ya boo, suckin' kelly and bloom
Off in a room, for summons that loom, to the boys in blue
My city view's subdued by dudes in uniforms of blue
Conform into their rules or you will get torn in two
Remove ya'
I ain't no wise guy, but you're always looking at me crazy
Stop question and frisk me, frisk me cause I'm looking shady
Remove ya'

5-0 running down the block, killin’
Just a cop with his finger on the Glock
Mommas watching babies, victims
Bullets wrongfully shot
People retreat, lay low, down the streets 
N-Y-P-D, miny, moe
Catch a black boy by his toe
Hang him, put him up for show
Take him down, keep up the role
Keep up the role
Oh, uncertain, who do you protect?
I know it ain’t us, no
Who are you serving? Who do you protect?
You want to kill us2Embed
