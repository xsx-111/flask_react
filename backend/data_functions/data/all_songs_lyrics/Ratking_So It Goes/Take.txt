Take Lyrics
Take (x4)
People love to take
'Course and it makes
Them feel good
Feels good to get, but it's harder to give, live
With what decisions you make
Take (x6)
Ask, get, that, take, take
But it's harder to give
Hard to live
With what decisions you make (x8)

Used to hate, now they take and eat it all up (x4)
Only given what I'm given when I give it (x3)

Thank you for you, you beautiful fools
Losing your cool but it's cool
You give me my grace, I give you this food, now eat it
Respect it, digest it and shit it but keep the nutrition
These blessings embedded in recipes rest in my dishes
I'm only given what I'm given when I give it cause it feel good
Ratking illusion fuck you real good
Bitch, nigga
And I ain't using my dick, I mind fuck you to bits
And piece you back to a hieroglyphic scripture scriptured above
These fucks claiming they bad
Hydrogen mask so I don't fall for the gas, you full of shit
That you deserve and a handful of this

Take, take, take, take, take
Give, give, give, give, give
Get, get, get, get, get
Live, live, live, live

Take
Ahhhh
Take
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Take
