Puerto Rican Judo Lyrics (x3)
Get up, wake up, open your eyes
Take up, Puerto Rican judo class (Puerto Rican Judo)x3
That's, the only alternative that, you have to pass
Living the sidelines
Giving the guidelines
That's, Puerto Rican judo
 (x2)
Go ahead go ahead and dance around
Flip my fixed frown
Fuck with my sounds
Taste my nouns
Hold it down down
Don't cuff the mic nor bitch you clown
Throw it the lost 'n' found
Ready for tomorrow and i'ma make it now
Lungs are loud loud
Let's taste lips we could make it raw
Came to feed you saw you starved
Eat to the early morning
Thru noon 'n' night till dawn
Three six five and a full year round
'Till the bum is bound by al
When the charts are fouled
When the crowds go wild
(Wiki)
How did I land? Right in this land
Man-hat-tan
Right were you stand damn
And damn
Right were you stand
Heard some talk that shorty got a man
Trying to foil my plan
Cooking up the oil in the pan
Fed me from your hand
(Princess Nokia)
Butter por-rican
From La Borinquen
And I see you want my hand
Killing me softly with the taste of the old E
Sharing your 40's with a song that you told me
Holy, you and I
You don't even like my peach thighs
You just look me in my eyes
(Wiki)
Brown girl, white boy
Tan soul, tangled
Mouth mangled
But the Ralph dangles
Off everything from my stache to my ankles
You trying figure out what's Pat's angle
Just trying to rap with an angel
Tell me I'm able
Tell me I'm able
(Princess Nokia)
See that Puerto Rican Judo
Hanging off your culo
Papi chulo
Want you as the pain in my culo
See me when I'm spitting and I'm always going duro
You bring out the best in me
Everything you say manifest in me
And I got something for your patty
Be your Puerto Rican misses
Cook you up sofrito and cover you in kisses
(Wiki)
How you look at me like that?
When I got no teeth
Even the folk on my own street
Look at me phony
You hold me like you know me
Hold you like you holy
Watch you like you're posing
You and me going be
You and me going be
Nap time till the sun come up
Rap time till the sun go down
Halftime and you know it's going down
You and me know it's now
Time to get wild
Hold you tight while you kiss my brow
Know you nice and wish you well
Even if you kick me down
Kick pow boom hiya
Wavy got the moves to make you go fire
Marvel off the top with the street fighter style
Like to keep it funky with the boom bap style
Year of the monkey with the shaolin crown
Step into the match it's about to go down
Wang chung, Hong Kong phooey
Boricua samurai, sooky sooky2Embed
