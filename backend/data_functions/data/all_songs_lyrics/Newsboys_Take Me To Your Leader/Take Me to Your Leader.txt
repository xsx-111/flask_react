Take Me to Your Leader Lyrics
Isabelle is a belly dancer
With a kleptomaniac's restraint
Tried stealing Helena's hand basket
Made a fast getaway, but McQueen she ain't
At the courtroom, Joshua judges her ruthlessly
On account of Ruth walking out on him
In the Big House, Isabelle is a-telling all
To the chaplain who's become her friend

She says: "I don't know why you care
I don't know what's out there
I don't know where or how
Just take me to your leader now
Take me to your leader now"

Justin is adjusting to the odor from
Theodore's Evergreen Incense
But aroma therapy don't make him any younger
Than Oliver's All Liver Supplements
His late mate Merrilee merrily said
"Immortality can't be bought in a jar"
This just in: Justin's had enough of cure-alls
Gonna quiz the neighbor kid with the fish on his car
He says: I don't know why you care
I don't know what's out there
I don't know how it's done
Just take me to your leader, son
I see you've got the joy
I've seen you live it, boy
It's real, it's free, it's fun
So take me to your leader, son
Take me to your leader, son

They don't know why we care
They don't know what's out there
They don't know how it's done
Let's take 'em to our leader's son
They see we've got the joy
They see us live it, oi
It's real, it's free, it's fun
Let's take 'em to our leader's son
They don't know why we care
They don't know what's out there
They don't know how it's done
Let's take 'em to our leader's son
They see we've got the joy
They see us live it, oi
It's real, it's free, it's fun
Let's take 'em to our leader's son
Let's take 'em to our leader's son
Let's take 'em to our leader's son1Embed
