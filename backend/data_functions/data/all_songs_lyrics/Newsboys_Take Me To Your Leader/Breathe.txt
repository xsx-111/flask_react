Breathe LyricsTuesday the third
I'll call this entry "Mistake"
Cheap imitation
My life feels like a fake
A people person, some days people annoy me
I'm growin' edgy
Wednesday's title "Avoid Me
Chorus:
Breathe on me
Breathe oh breath of God
Breathe on me
'til my heart is new
Breathe on me
Breathe oh breath of life
Breathe on me
'til I love like you do
Thursday the fifth
I title "Drivers Beware"
Temperamental and I don't really care
I gave til I bled
You laughed when I fainted
Don't want to live this life
Bitter and tainted
