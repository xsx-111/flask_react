Griselda Lyrics
Come won't you walk with me Griselda
Wearing the dress that moonlight shines through
I am a sad and lonely boy
Since your mother said I couldn't see you

Slip into the wood in the dark of the night
Calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light
And lead me to my Griselda

Do you recall last night Griselda?
Learning the lessons nature taught us
Watching the fish jump in the lake
It was lovely till your mother caught us

Slip into the wood in the dark of the night
Calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light
And lead me to my Griselda

Moonflower vines upon the window
Give me a foothold for my finding
I've got a row boat on the lake
Fishing around and all the sun was shining
Slip into the wood in the dark of the night
Calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light
And lead me to my Griselda

I've got a jug of wine Griselda
Why must you waste your time in sorrow?
Hold out your hand; have no fear
If were caught, I'll marry you tomorrow

Slip into the wood in the dark of the night
Calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light
And lead me to my Griselda
Slip into the wood in the dark of the night
Calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light
And lead me to my GriseldaEmbed
