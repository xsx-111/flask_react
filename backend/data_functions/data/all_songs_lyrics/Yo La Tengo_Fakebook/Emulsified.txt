Emulsified LyricsWell oh yeah, do you know how to be emulsified now?
(No)
I'm gonna tell you a little story about being emulsified
(Now? Yes please!)
It goes something like this....
(Alright! Yeah!)
My baby's a real gone chick
(Emulsified)
When she calls me _______ so quick
(Emulsified)
When my baby holds me tight
Don't you know I get emulsified
(Oh yeah)
Yes I do
(Oh yeah)
Yes, it's true
(Emulsified)
Waaaaaaaah yeah!!
(Emulsified)
I'm going crazy 'cause I love my baby's soul
(Emulsified)
Never, never would I let her go
(Emulsified)
She squeezes me when she holds me tight
Don't you know I get emulsified
(Oh yeah)
Yes I do
(Oh yeah)
Yes, it's true
(Emulsified)
Yeah!!
I would go for you baby
And I would tell all the world that I do, ooooh!
Please, please, please baby I don't want nobody but you
(Emulsified)
Come back baby give me one more chance!
(Emulsified)
I want to make up a real romance
(Emulsified)
Squeeze me and hold me tight
(Don't you know I get emulsified)
And um um um um
(Oh yeah)
Everyday
(Oh yeah)
Any old way
(Emulsified)
I'm going crazy 'cause I love her so
(Emulsified)
Never, never, never would I let her go
(Emulsified)
Oh she squeezes me and she holds me tight
(Don't you know I get emulsified)
(Oh yeah)
Everyday!
(Oh yeah)
Any old way
(Emulsified)
Oh yeah
On Monday

Emulsified on Tuesday
(Emulsified)
