Speeding Motorcycle LyricsSpeeding motorcycle
Won't you change me
In a world of funny changes
Speeding motorcycle
Won't you change me
Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart
Speeding motorcycle
Always changing me
Speeding motorcycle
Don't you drive recklessly
Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart
Many girls have taken you out for a ride, hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down
Speeding motorcycle
Of my heart
Speeding motorcycle
Lets be smart
Because we dont want a wreck
We can do alot of tricks
We dont have to break our legs
To get our kicks
Speeding motorcycle
The road is ours
Speeding motorcycle
Lets speed some more
Because we don't need reason and we don't need logic
Because we got feelin' and we're damn proud of it
Speeding motorcycle
Theres nothing you can do
Speeding motorcycle
I love you
Speeding motorcycle
Lets just go
Speeding motorcycle
Lets go, lets go, lets goEmbed
