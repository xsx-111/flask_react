The One to Cry LyricsI told you if i ever caught you fooling round again
That if you were untrue
That you and I are through
But now i've caught you and i know that this should be the end
Though i should tell you so
My heart keeps saying no
Oh if i say goodbye then i am gonna be the one to cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Oh i can't bare to be the one to keep you from my side
How could you be so cruel
You played me for a fool
But if i change my mind then i would throw away my pride
So now what should i do
Oh how i wish i knew
Oh if i say goodbye then i am gonna be the one to cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
So now what should i do
Oh how i wish i knew
Oh if i say goodbye then i am gonna be the one to cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry1Embed
