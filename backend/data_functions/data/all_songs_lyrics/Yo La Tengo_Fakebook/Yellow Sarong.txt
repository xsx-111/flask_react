Yellow Sarong LyricsA man in the moon
Taps at the window
How will we know your silhoutte?
How will we reach you?
Waving his hands
Shouting
Is there anymore to that yellow sarong?
It's more than just a bit of grass
What a landscape
(What a landscape)
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
A man in the moon
Taps at the window
How will we know your silhoutte?
How will we reach you?
(How will we reach you?)
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeahEmbed
