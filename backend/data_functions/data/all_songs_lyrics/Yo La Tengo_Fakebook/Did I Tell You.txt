Did I Tell You LyricsDid I tell you of the dark lonely road
I was counting my steps as I made my way home
Days of nothing but time on your hands, weighing on me
Came to my end, undecided
Whether to count what I felt against what I could say
I try not to wonder, or tell you that I'm not willing to wait
Cause deep in my heart I'm willing, heart's still willing
My brain's impatient, my heart's still willing to wait
Our love is so important to me
Starts wherever you land, walks right over to me
Days of nothing but time in between, obviously
So unwary, so uncaring
I try not to be part of that, well that's easy to say
That I try not to wonder, or tell you that I'm not willing to wait
Cause deep in my heart I'm willing, heart's still willing
My brain's impatient, my heart's still willing to wait
There's a moment to discover no one can take all the blame
And it's finally clear
I try not to wonder, or tell you that I'm not willing to wait
When deep in my heart I'm willing, heart's still willing
My brain's impatient, my heart's still willing to wait
Willing to wait, willing to waitEmbed
