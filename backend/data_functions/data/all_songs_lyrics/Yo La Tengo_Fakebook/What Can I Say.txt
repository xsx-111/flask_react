What Can I Say LyricsWhen we're alone here, just me and you
Why did you tell me you love me too?
And when I hold you, you turn away
I just don't know you, what can I say?
I don't know why you run and hide
I don't know what you feel inside
I try to tell you in every way
I just don't know you, what can I say?
I don't know why you run and hide
I don't know what you feel inside
I try to tell you in every way
I just don't know you, what can I say?
I just don't know you, what can I say?Embed
