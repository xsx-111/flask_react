You Tore Me Down LyricsEverybody knows
That you've been untrue
You've gone and broke my heart
And made me blue
Turn my head around
When you tore me down
If I had a choice
I might be sad
'cause when I hear yr voice
It makes me glad
Baby's not around
But she's leaving town
Baby
Baby
Don't run away
I want you to stay
Im sorry
So sorry
I made you blue
And now you should be sorry too
Should be sorry too
Now Im so alone
Yr far away
I sit here at home
No words to say
To anyone around
'cause you tore me down
Tore me down
Tore me down
Tore me down1Embed
