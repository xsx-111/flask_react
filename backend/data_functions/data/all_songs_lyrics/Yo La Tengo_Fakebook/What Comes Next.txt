Toggle back and forth
Around and around
Taking back the last thing that I say
And it made me wonder
Made me wonder just where I went wrong
On a lazy drive I don't know where
Didn't even care if I got home
And it made me wonder
Made me wonder how I could be good
Time won't wait for you
I'll wait for you always
Some things should never change
And it made me wonder
When you wonder just what happens nextEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
