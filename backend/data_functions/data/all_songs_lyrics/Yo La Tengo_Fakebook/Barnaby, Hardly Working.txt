Barnaby, Hardly Working LyricsFor the moment slipped right through him
Combed his hair, combed his hair
Knew the feeling of contentment
An actors' actor, an actors' actor
She smiled a smile uncomprehending
As he took his time, took his time
Wore a hat, so he'd impress her
Took a ride, took a ride
Says, "I could wait for hours
I could wait and never fall down
Never fall down, never fall down"
Face down beside the river, face down beside the river...Embed
