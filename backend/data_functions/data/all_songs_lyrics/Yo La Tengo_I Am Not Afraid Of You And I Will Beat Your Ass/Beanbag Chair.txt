I've spent my life trying to understand
Just how my life lead to where I am
But it leaves a bitter taste
And it feels like such a waste

I am so totally vague
Betray the dark line, see if I care
I loved you when I was young but no more
So burn down the fireman's fair

Memory plays its tricks on me
In my mind's eye I claim to see
I'm losing every race I run
Making misery out of fun

So bulldoze the new road
They're driving, slash the beanbag chair
You held me for so very long but no more
So burn down the fireman's fair

All those types of things we think we need
But that doesn't make them true
I'm a little afraid I'm falling far and free
I'll leave that up to you
That's up to you

So won't you find me totally vague
A dream has died, see if I care
I loved you when I was young but no more
So burn down the fireman's fair

Fireman's fair
Burn down the fireman's fair
Fireman's fair
Burn down the fireman's fairEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
