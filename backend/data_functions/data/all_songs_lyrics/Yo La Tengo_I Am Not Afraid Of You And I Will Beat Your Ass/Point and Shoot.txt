Point and Shoot LyricsOne of these days
I'm gonna get myself a gun (ahh)
I might just shoot you down (ahh)
We know sometimes justice moves too slow
I'll be the judge, give it a gentle nudge
Don't want to live my life
Compassionate and humane (ahh)
It doesn't hurt to dream (ahh)
For some, love and justice never come
But the blind and both can be unkind
(ahh) love is in the air
Nobody's love is blue (ahh)
All you need is love (ahh)
And to our friends
Thinking of you as we look ahead
And to all the people
That we want dead (ahh)Embed
