I Feel Like Going Home Lyrics
He calls me to the ocean
Takes me wandering through the street
A restless imagination
But for now I move my feet on the ground

'Cause I feel like going home

I can float above the ceiling
I like drifting through the air
I tend to lose my concentration
But right now the clouds don't appeal too much

I feel like going home

Sometimes late at night while running from the rain
Running from the voices filling up my brain
Now I wish they'd leave me alone
And let me be, to go off on my own

Let me be to go home
I feel like going homeEmbed
