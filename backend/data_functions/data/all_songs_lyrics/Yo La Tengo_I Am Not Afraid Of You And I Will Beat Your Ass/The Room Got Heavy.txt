The Room Got Heavy LyricsThe room got heavy with a lamppost looming
We were driving in a circle somewhere near the station
Shoot me near the bushes, my eyes aren't focused
And we passed one parsing through the tunnel
Palisades Park, summer after dark
Hand holding fast to a party invitation
And the room got heavy but only for a minute
While everyone was waiting for you
The room got heavy, all the concrete in the air
And the couple around the corner at the yellow light blinking
She said "I wouldn't do that" but we all know that she did
From the look on her face, her arms slightly folded
And he headed for the door, reach across the floor
Hands in my pocket, my eyes aren't focused
And the room got heavy but only for a minute
While everyone waited for youEmbed
