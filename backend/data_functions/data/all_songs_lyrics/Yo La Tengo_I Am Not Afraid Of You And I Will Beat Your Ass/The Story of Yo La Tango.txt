The Story of Yo La Tango LyricsWe stared at the sun, too long
Until the shapes before our eyes
Turned into the sun, in our eyes
We lied to ourselves for awhile
In our usual style
I wish we could lie
To ourselves again
We made up our minds
To lose and never once looked back
We only looked back
Just once
We opened our hearts, it's true
But not to any of you
Sold out of the myth
Too soon
And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard
We stared at the road ahead
Closed our eyes and then
Sped up to the turn, around the bend
With nothing to lose, we lost
Suffered every cost
It still causes pain to recall
And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard
And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard
And we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
And we ran headlong in our way
We tried so hard
Refused to let go
Of the air
There was something there
Sparks flown with gold
A million strong
We ran four red lights in a row
I'm still flushed from the glow
I'm down on the road
Back home
We stared at the sun, too long
Until the shapes before our eyes turned back into the sun, into the sun in our eyes
We lied to ourselves for awhile
In our usual style
Now I wish we could ride, we wish we could lie to ourselves again
And we tried, we tried, we tried with all our might
We tore the playhouse down
We ran headlong, headlong in our way...
We tried so hard...
We tried so hard...
Yeah we tried so hard...Embed
