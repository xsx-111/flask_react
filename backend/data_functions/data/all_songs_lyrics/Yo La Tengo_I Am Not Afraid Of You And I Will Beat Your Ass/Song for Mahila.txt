Song for Mahila LyricsSix for the frightened child
On the day we die
Five for the search for meaning
In the tears we cry
Le lie le lie
Tonight
Four from the shadows
Hiding just out of sight
Three for the disappearence
In the morning light
Le light le light
Tearing your arms to hold you tight
Tonight
One for the kiss
Before we say goodbye
Six for the frightened child
On the day we die
The light, the light
Tonight, tonightEmbed
