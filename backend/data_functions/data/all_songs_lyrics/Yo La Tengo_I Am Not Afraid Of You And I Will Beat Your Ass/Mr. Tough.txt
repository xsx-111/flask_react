Mr. Tough Lyrics
Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dancefloor
When it's Tiny Tom time?

And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime

And we'll forget about our problems
Ignore them for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner
Leave them in a big big pile
Pretend everything can be alright

Hey Mrs. Blue
Time to think of something new
The Possum's spinning our hips
The old soft shoe

And if you wanna lose the rest of the night
There's nothing better I have to do
And if I tell you something
You won't have to ask if it's true
And we'll forget about our problems
Ignore them for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner
Leave them in a big big pile
Pretend everything can be alright

Alone in our pad on Saturday night
Hemmed in by the room
But hiding at a crowded party
The record's playing for just me and you

Hey Mr. Tough
Don't you think we've suffered enough?
Why don't you meet me on the dancefloor
When it's Toddophonic time?

And if you need to tell me something once
You won't have to say it twice
And if you ask for a nickel
I'm gonna hand you a dime

And we'll forget about our problems
Ignore them for a little while
And leave our worries in the corner
Leave them in a big big pile
Pretend everything can be alright
Pretend everything can be alright
Pretend everything can be alrightEmbed
