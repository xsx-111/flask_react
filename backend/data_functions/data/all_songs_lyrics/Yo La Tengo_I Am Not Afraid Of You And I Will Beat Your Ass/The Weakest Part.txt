The Weakest Part LyricsStars will burn
When the sky
In a day that you realize
Your pain would subside
If not for the weakest part
Of your heart
Of your heart
Bells ring out
When you sleep
Too hard to ignore
But you, like a fool
Just don't see
It preys on the weakest part
Of your heart
Of your heart
If not for the weakest part
Of your heart
Of your heart
Some sunny day
The wind will come along
And scatter the dusty sleep
And you'll open your eyes
Stars could fall right out of the sky
If not for the weakest part
Bells could ring till the end of time
If not for the weakest part
Someday soon it'll be all right
If not for the weakest partEmbed
