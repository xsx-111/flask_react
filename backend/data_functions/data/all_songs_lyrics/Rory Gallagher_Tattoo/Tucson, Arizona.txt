Tucson, Arizona LyricsI can see the painting on the wall
Mixtures of different colors
And I go walking in the Arizona sun
Slow walking peace of mind
The cactus blooms, the sand dunes
No city lights, I can see for miles
And my mind goes on forever
The sun goes to bed
Leaving sky of firey red
Each step takes me closer to heaven
All is full, all is nice, and all is well
But when I turn I can see my fellow man
Fighting in the city streets
And dying where they dwell
Each step takes them closer to heaven
I can see the painting on the wall
Mixtures of different colors
And I go walking in the Arizona sun
Each step takes me closer to heaven
I go walking in the Arizona sun
I go walking in the Arizona sun
I go walking in the Arizona sunEmbed
