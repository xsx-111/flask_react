Just A Little Bit LyricsI don't want it all, I just want a little bit
Well, I don't want it all, just want a little bit
Just a eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit
Of your love
Turn your love down low, just want one bit
Turn your love down low, just want a little bit
I want a eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit
Of your love
Yeah...
Well, I don't want it all, I just want a little bit
Well, I don't want it all, I just want a little bit
I want a eeny weeny bit
A teeny weeny bit
Of your love
Yeah...
Well, I don't want it all, I just want a little bit
Well, I don't want it all, I just want a little bit
I want a eeny weeny bit, and a teeny weeny bit
A eeny weeny bit, and a teeny weeny bit
I don't want it all, I just want a little bit
Well, I don't want it all, I just want a little bit
Just a eeny weeny bit
I want a eeny weeny bit
I want a eeny weeny bit
Eeny weeny bit
I want a eeny weeny bit
Eeny weeny bitEmbed
