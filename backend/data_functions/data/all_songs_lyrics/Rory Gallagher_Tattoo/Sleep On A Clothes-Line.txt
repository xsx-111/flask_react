Sleep On A Clothes-Line LyricsI could sleep on a clothes line
As easy as pie
I can't keep my eyes open
No matter how I try
I gotta sit down
I can't stay on my feet
I been up all night
I been walkin' the street
Oh yeah...
Looking for my baby
But everywhere I've gone
Tell me I just missed her
It's gone on too long
Well, I'd go up on a mountain
And I'd fight a wild cat
Walk over Niagara
And all the way back
Get lost in the jungle
And I'd live up a tree
That's what I would want to do
If you would stay with me
Oh yeah...
Looking for you baby
Gone from pillar to post
Wverywhere I'd just missed you baby
By a minute at the most
Well I'm looking for you baby
In the cafe's and the bar
All the places is glad to know you
And they say you cannot go too far
But you've gone far enough baby
If I find out I've done nothing wrong
Don't have to ask who's the fool
I won't be the one
Owwwww.......not a loser...
Well, I would sleep on the tail-plane
Of a Jumbo Jet
Walk over the Ocean
And I'd never once get wet
Go skating on an iceberg
And that's what I would once do
Lay it down a dozen times
Just to hear you say
"I Love You"
Looking for you baby
But everwhere I go
Tell me I just missed you baby
By a minute at the most
Well, I could
Sleep on a clothes line
As easy as pie
I can't keep my eyes open
No matter how I try
I gotta sit down
I can't stay on my feet
I been up all night
I been walkin' the street
Yeah...
Looking for you baby
Everwhere I go
Tell me I just missed you baby
You know, it's gone on too long
Yeah..
Gone too long baby
Yeah..Embed
