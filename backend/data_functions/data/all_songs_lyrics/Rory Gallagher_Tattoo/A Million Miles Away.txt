A Million Miles Away Lyrics
This hotel bar is full of people
The piano man is really laying it down
Even the old bartender is high as a steeple
So why tonight should I wear a frown?

The joint is jumping all around me
And my mood is really not in style
Right now the blues want to surround me
But I'll break out after a while

Well I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away
Sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay
Yes I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away
Sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay

Why ask how I feel?
Well, how does it look to you?
I fell hook, line and sinker, lost my captain and my crew
I'm standing on the landing
There's no one there but me
That's where you'll see me
Looking out on the deep blue sea
There's a song on the lips of everybody
There's a smile all around the room
There's conversation, overflowing
So why must I sit here in the gloom?

This hotel bar has lost its' people
The piano man has caught the last bus home
The old bartender's asleep in the corner
So why must I still be here, I don't know
Let me tell you

I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away
Sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay
I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away
Sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay
Yes I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away
Sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay

Well I'm a million miles, I'm a million miles, I'm a million miles
Sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay
Ah!
Ooh yeah
