Cradle Rock LyricsIf I was a cradle, then you'd let me rock
If I was a pony, then you'd let me trot
If I was the atom, then you'd split me into three
When I wanna see you baby, don't you lock your door on me
If I was a baby, you wouldn't let me fall
If I was an outlaw, you wouldn't have me caught
If I was a tiger, you wouldn't have me caged
If I was somebody else then you would act your age
You'll miss out if you, leave me out of, of your
Day and night, I been trying to make you see that
Hear what I got to say
It's all about me and you
If I was a blind man, then you'd make me see
If I was a deaf man, you'd give me ears to hear
If I was a lame man, you'd give me your legs to walk
But if you were true to me baby, then listen to when I talk
If I was a cradle, then you'd let me rock
If I was a pony, then you'd let me trot
If I was the atom, split me into three
When I wanna see you baby, don't you lock on me
Would you, would you, let me rock, let me rock? YeahEmbed
