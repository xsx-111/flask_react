20/20 Vision LyricsPeople talk about her like she was a diamond on the shelf
People talk about her like she was a diamond on the shelf
Well, I got 20/20 vision, I can see that for myself
I got a high steppin' baby, you know she's really about as good as gold
I got a high steppin' baby, you know she's really good as gold
She can make my Grandpa, feel like he's six years old
I got 20/20 vision, and that's all I need
Enough to keep my baby here by me
Oooh...whooo...
You know my little baby, she buzz around like a bumble bee
Well, you know my little baby, she buzz like a bumble bee
And I won't complain if she comes around here and stings me
Sting me!
I got 20/20 vision, and that's all I need
Enough to keep my baby good company
Yeah...oooh...whooo...
You know my little baby, I'd recognize her anywhere
If I seen her in a crowd, I'd recognize her anywhere
She can even make my Grandpa, get up out of his wheelchair
All the boys hang around her, she says she don't love no one else
All the boys hang around, she says she don't love no one else
Well, I got 20/20 vision, I can see that for myself
I got 20/20 vision, I can see that for myself
Take me home...Embed
