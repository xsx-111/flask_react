Summer Skeletons LyricsWe were sun-burned and shoeless kids
It was the dead of July
We were skipping stones in the failing light
I smelled the fire place
Although we were miles away
We were infinite
There was no time in those days
When all we knew wasn't stolen
There was nothing real to lose
When our heads were still simple
We'd sleep beneath the moon
You were something
That would always be around
When regrets were nowhere to be found
Lost out among the trees
Our hands scraped the bark
You still had bloody knees
From your spill in the dark
We were both laughing then
While carving bad words in the wood
We had no need to speak
Night, down by the shore
We were down by the shore
When the skies opened up
And all the stars fell into the lake
When the water was warm
Walked in over my head
But you pulled me out by the collar of my shirt
Dirt in our ears, sun in our eyes
Shirts hung in rags, head in the clouds
Our fears had no teeth, hearts were still blind
You barely talked and I didn't mind1Embed
