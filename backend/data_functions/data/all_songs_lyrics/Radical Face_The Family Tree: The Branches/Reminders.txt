Reminders LyricsI wish I had more nice things to say
But I was raised not to lie
I'm either honest, or I'm an optimist
But never both at the same time
And everyone knows the deal
Gotta take what you can
'cause anything I don't steal
Just winds up in someone else's hands
There's only so much good a man can take
When he ain't so good himself
You remind me of what I could've been
But that reminder ain't much help
So it's better if you were on your way
If you were somewhere far from me
So you could dream I turned out well
And I... I could just go to sleep
I wish I had more nice things to say
But I was raised not to lie
I'm either honest, or I'm an optimist
But never both at the same time1Embed
