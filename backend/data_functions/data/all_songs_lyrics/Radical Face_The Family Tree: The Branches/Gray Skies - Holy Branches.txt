Gray Skies / Holy Branches Lyrics



When you were young
You'd bite your tongue
Calm, always did what you were told
Never ran your mouth
Lived life on tiptoes
Only felt peace if by yourself
When mistakes don't count

There's a hole in your chest
From the time that you were born
One that don't get filled
Cause you've always known you're nothing they want

But everybody's bones are just holy branches
Cast from trees to cut patterns in the world
And in time we find some shelter
Spill our leaves and then sleep in the Earth
And when we're there we'll belong
Cause the Earth don't give a damn if you're lost
Now I live alone
Work in the belly of machines
Wring my soot-black hands
And I don't sleep much
Days don't feel different
From the nights
With no goals in mind

There's a hole in my chest
From the time I walked away
One I fill with sweat
So now I know I'm nothing they want

But everybody's bones are just holy branches
Ride the breeze to cut patterns in the leaves
And in time we find some shelter
Spill our seeds and then wait for our turns

But for now we're adrift on the waves of discontent
Trying to carve our place
All in hopes we'll be something they want
But I ain't holding my breath
Trace your fingers down my spine
Make your home behind my eyes
Line my skull with harmless lies
I'll bide my time until I'm something they wantEmbed
