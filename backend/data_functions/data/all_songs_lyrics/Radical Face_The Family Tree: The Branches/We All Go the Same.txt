We All Go the Same LyricsWell, some of us will be revered, and some forgotten
And some of us will sleep out in the rain
And some of us will die lonely
And others' in grace and warmth
But in the end we all go the same
And some of us will be worn down with time
And others' will be famous in their days
Some of us will be dreamers
While others' just fade away
But in the end we all leave the same
And some of us will take everything we can
And others' will just give it all away
And some of us will be beaten
While others' refuse to bend
But in the end we all go the same
And you will live your life full of fear
And I will live mine wishin' you were near
And you will pray to be stronger
And I won't pray at all
But either way we're both gonna fallEmbed
