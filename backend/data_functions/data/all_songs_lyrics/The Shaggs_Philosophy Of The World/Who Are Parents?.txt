Who Are Parents? LyricsSome kids do as they please
They don't know what life really means
They don't listen to what the ones who really care have to say
They just go and do things their own way
Who are parents?
Parents are the ones who really care
Who are parents?
Parents are the ones who are always there
Some kids think their parents are cruel
Just because they want them to obey certain rules
They start to lean from the ones who really care
Turning, turning from the ones who will always be there
Who are parents?
Parents are the ones who really care
Who are parents?
Parents are the ones who are always there
Parents do understand, parents do care
We must remember
Parents are the ones who will always understand
Parents are the ones who really care
Parents do understand, parents do care
We must remember
Parents are the ones who will always understand
Parents are the ones who really care
Who are parents?
Parents are the ones who really care
Who are parents?
Parents are the ones who are always thereEmbed
