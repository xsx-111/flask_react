Sweet Thing LyricsYou're such a sweet thing
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)
But you can be so mean
You're such a sweet thing
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)
You used to make me dream
But then there's times when you are very different
I just don't understand
How a minute you can be so mean
The next minute so grand
You used to make me happy
Now you make me sad
You've told me many lies
I've never told you one
You think you'll fool me
(Fool me, fool me)
So go and have your fun
I'll play it cool and go along with you
You ran around and think that I don't know
You must think you put on quite a show
But your turn's coming
(Coming, coming)
There'll be some girl who will hurt you
(Hurt you, hurt you)
The way you have hurt me
And then you'll be the one who's sad and blue
And then you'll see how you made me feel
In the end you will find
I was only trying to be a friend
In the end you will see
That I'm not the fool
But it's you, yes, you're the fool
Then maybe you'll consider others
And try to be true
If you did that in the first place
You wouldn't be so blue
You were such a sweet thing
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)
But now you are very mean
You were such a sweet thing
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)
But now you'll never make me dream
You'll never make me dreamEmbed
