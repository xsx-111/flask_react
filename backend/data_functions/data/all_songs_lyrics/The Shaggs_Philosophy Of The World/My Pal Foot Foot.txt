My Pal Foot Foot LyricsMy pal's name is Foot Foot (Foot Foot)
He always likes to roam
My pal's name is Foot Foot (Foot Foot)
I never find him home
I go to his house
Knock at his door
People come out and say
Foot Foot don't live here no more
My pal Foot Foot (Foot Foot)
Always likes to roam
My pal Foot Foot (Foot Foot)
Now he has no home
Where will Foot Foot go
What will Foot Foot do
Oh, Foot Foot
I wish I could find you
I've looked here, I've looked there
I've looked everywhere
Oh, Foot Foot
Why can't I find you?
Foot Foot, where can you be?
Foot Foot, why won't you answer me?
Foot Foot, oh, Foot Foot
Wherever you are
I want you to come home with me
I don't have time to roam
I have things to do
I have to go home
Oh, Foot Foot, where are you?
If Foot Foot didn't like to roam so well
He would still have a place to dwell
Foot Foot, please answer me
I know where you are
You're behind that tree
Foot Foot, please come to me
Foot Foot, now that you're here
Won't you come home
Foot Foot, promise me this
That you will never again roamEmbed
