My Companion LyricsMy companion is with me
Wherever I go, it goes too
My companion is with me
No matter what I do
When I ride my horse
I take my companion too, of course
When I go to the beach and run in the sand
I have my companion close at hand
My companion is with me when I drive my car
Even when I go real far
No matter where I am or what I do
My companion is always there, too
When I walk my pets, no wonder then
I take my companion, it never has passed
My companion is with me wherever I go
Even when I go to a show
My companion is, of course
