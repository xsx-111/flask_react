Why Do I Feel? LyricsSometimes I feel funny
And bottled up inside
Then for some reason
I just start to cry
Sometimes I feel happy
And overflowing with joy
Then things change
And I start to worry
Why do I feel the way I feel?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why do I feel the way I feel?
Sometimes I worry over nothing at all
Sometimes I think life's just a ball
When life changes and turns the other way
I try to think of something gay
Why do I feel the way I feel?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why do I feel the way I feel?
There are times when I feel sad
There are times when I feel blue
What makes me feel this way the most
Is when I don't know why I do the things I do
Why do I do the things I do?
Why do I feel the way I feel?
Why do I do the things I do?
There are times when I feel sad
There are times when I feel blue
What makes me feel this way the most
Is when I don't know why I do the things I do
Why do I do the things I do?
Why do I feel the way I feel?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why do I do the things I do?Embed
