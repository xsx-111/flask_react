Things I Wonder LyricsThere are many things I wonder
There are many things I don't
It seems as though the things I wonder most
Are the things I never find out
I wonder about the stars above
I wonder about the birds that fly
I wonder about your love
But most of all I wonder why you make me cry
I wonder, I wonder
I wonder why we have to say goodbye
There are some things I don't understand
There are some things I do
But one thing I don't understand
Is why we have to be so blue
I understand why you feel the way you do
Because I feel the same way too
I wonder why our minds drift astray
I wonder why life goes on this way
I wonder why we have to part
We both know it'll break our heart
There are many things I wonder
There are many things I don't
I'll be glad when I find all these things out
But until I do things won't change with me and you
With me and you things will stay the same
With me and you things won't change
With me and you things will be the sameEmbed
