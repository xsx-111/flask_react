That Little Sports Car LyricsThere was a sports car on the road
(On the road)
I thought I knew the fellow that drove
That little sports car was slippery as an oyster
Following it was like riding on a roller coaster
(Roller coaster)
Around the corners and over the bumps
Every minute, faster and faster, my heart thumped
(My heart thumped)
Well, finally he stopped to get some gas
If I was to catch up I had to move fast
(To move fast)
I stepped on the gas and just made the corner
Wow, I was almost a goner
(Goner)
When I got there he was gone
I don't know where I went wrong
(I went wrong)
The time went fast, it was late
I knew I had no time to waste
(Time to waste)
I turned around and headed for home
I learned my lesson never to roam
I learned my lesson never to roam
Never to roam, never to roam
Never to roam, never to roamEmbed
