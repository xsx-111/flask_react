We Have a Savior LyricsWhy does the world go unholy?
Why does everyone fight more and more?
Don't they know we have a savior?
All we have to do is believe and pray
Why must we go unheathen?
Why does anyone have to run?
Don't they know we have a savior?
Just look up toward the sky
I often sit and wonder
Why people do the things they do
And I can't understand, no I can't understand
Why they don't have faith in the Lord, like I do
Why do the people go on sinning?
Why do they feel sad and blue?
Don't they know we have a savior
Just watching over me and you?
I often sit and wonder
Why people do the things they do
And I can't understand, no I can't understand
Why they don't have faith in the Lord, like I do
Why do the people go on sinning?
Why do they feel sad and blue?
Don't they know we have a savior
Just watching over me and you?
Don't they know we have a savior?
All we have to do is believe and prayEmbed
