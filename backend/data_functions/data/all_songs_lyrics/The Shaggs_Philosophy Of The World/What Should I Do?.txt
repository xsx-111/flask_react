What Should I Do? LyricsWhat should I do?
What should I do?
Tell me, tell me
What should I do?
He's a sad boy
He's a bad boy
He never gives me any joy
Tell me what should I do?
He's a two face
He's a disgrace
He never wins a race
Tell me what should I do?
Should I tell him goodbye?
Should I tell him we're through?
Should I tell him I know he lies?
Won't someone tell me what should I do?
What should I do?
What should I do?
Tell me, tell me
What should I do?
Sometimes he's kind
Sometimes he's cruel
Sometimes he's mean
And other times he's true
Tell me what should I do?
Wish someone would answer me
But don't know who
Wish someone would tell me, tell me
What to do
Don't tell me I've had good times with him
'Cause I know they're true
Don't tell me I still love him
'Cause I know that too
Just tell me what should I do?
What should I do?
What should I do?
Tell me, tell me
What should I do?Embed
