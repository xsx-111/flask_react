Please Pardon Me (You Remind Me of a Friend) LyricsPlease pardon me, but I'm longing to speak
I hope you don't mind my staring
I don't mind, 'cause your face looks so kind
Seldom you'll find someone so daring
You remind me of a friend of mine
Ooo, I've lost (the) time, yeah
Every time I see your face
You remind me of that someone
In fact, it's true, it's you
Runnin' right into you, yeah
I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind
Hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind
Please pardon me, but I'm all into spirit
I hope you don't mind my starin'
I don't mind, 'cause your face looks so kind
And it's seldom you'll find someone so daring
You remind me of a friend of mine
I've lost time, yeah, yeah
Every time I see your face
You remind me of that someone
In fact, it was you, ooo, it's true
Runnin' right into you
I hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kind
Hope you don't mind, you look like a friend of mine
And it's seldom you find a face that's so kindEmbed
