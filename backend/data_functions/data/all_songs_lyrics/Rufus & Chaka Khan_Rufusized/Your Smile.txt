Your Smile LyricsYour smile so very happy
You look familiar
Reminds me of somethin' good
I once felt
Thinking something mellow
I've dreamed of someone like you
Thinking something mellow
I've dreamed of someone like you
Good times, good conversation
I look at myself
Maintained by the completion
Oooooh, of being stoned
I wanna thank you for being what I needed (you)
I've dreamed of someone like you
Thank you for being what I needed
I've dreamed of someone like you
I've dreamed of someone like you
I've dreamed of someone like you
I've dreamed of someone like you
I've dreamed of someone like you
I've dreamed of someone like youEmbed
