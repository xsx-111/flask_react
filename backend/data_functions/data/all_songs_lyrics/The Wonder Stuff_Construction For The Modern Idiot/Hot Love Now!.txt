Hot Love Now! LyricsWe are, we are romanced in fascination
Sinfully sated in every incarnation
Typically farcical in every situation
But look what you can do with a little imagination
Feeling like we've never felt
Smelling like we've never smelt
If only the booze tasted as good as it felt
We'd be holding on to buckled belts for hot love now
We are, we are reeling in our feelings
In love, we trust 'till we go bust, it's heavenly appealing
There's no sense in dressing up
'Cos it's time to get revealing
And look at what you can do when you're swinging from the ceiling
Feeling like we've never felt
Smelling like we've never smelt
If only the booze tasted as good as it felt
We'd be holding on to buckled belts for hot love now
Every painted puckered lip
Every pouting nipple tip
Every time I trip, you trip, we trip
Feeling like we've never felt
Smelling like we've never smelt
Here we come, we don't need no help
We're holding on to buckled belts
Here they come now heaven knows
Trying on their sister's clothes
For hot love now!Embed
