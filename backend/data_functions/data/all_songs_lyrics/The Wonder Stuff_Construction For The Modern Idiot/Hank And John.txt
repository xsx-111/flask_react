Hank And John LyricsThinking now of Hank and John laying in a cali' sun
Said I never wanna get sober again
Neither father's gonna pay neither son can see that way
Said I never wanna get sober again
Every page just beats me up
These words have never seemed so good
So come on and carry me away away
So come on and carry me away away
Heaven was bare without you John
I don't know how they ever got on
Thank you for those presents you gave
My eyes are tired I'll listen still
A wonder up on Bunker hill
Yeah thank you for those presents you gave
Every word just fills me up
Believing never felt so good
So come on and carry me away away
Bunker Hill
And Dago Red
I won't forget
Those words I read
Bring Me Your Love
Ham On Rye
God bless you Hank
