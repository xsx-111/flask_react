Change Every Light Bulb LyricsIntroducing the reverend Hellacious Boom Boom! So good of you to come, I call on the priests, the saints, the dancin' girls and the God-damned reprobates! Our decisions must be final, restoration is impossible. To the ignorant members of the misguided populace, book ends to nothing! Good times on bad times, free us of the modern idiot, cast away the bogey men, detonate your hate bombs! Pick your victims! But take good care of yourselves....Hallelujah!
I have seen every mountain I'm expected to
Climb, but they're not mine
I have seen everything in this light before
Change every light bulb in the house
I have heard, I have listened, I have
Understood for my own good?
I have seen everything in this light before
Change every light bulb in the houseEmbed
