I Wish Them All Dead LyricsI wasn't ready for this
It isn't something you'd miss
I'm gonna spit every word
So that my hate can be heard
It's for the M.B.L.A
I wish them cancerous decay
That puts an end to their days
You know I wish them all dead
I wish them all dead
You know these fucks have the balls
To use municipal halls
To bring their shit into light
It's time to pick up a knife
Or any weapon you like
To see an end to their lives
Pick on someone your own size!
You know I wish them all dead
I wish them all dead
Go find relief in your graves
Yours are not lives I would save
What will they ask of us next?
You know I wish them all dead
I wish them all deadEmbed
