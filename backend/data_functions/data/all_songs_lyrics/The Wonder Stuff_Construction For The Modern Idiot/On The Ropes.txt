On The Ropes LyricsTake these words and stick 'em in your head
Now roll them around until you can't forget what's said
Take this to time to lie about everything
About who you are and who you've been
Don't let the world get in
It's happened to me
It won't happen to everyone
It don't give in, it will repeat, it will repeat, it will
And my central theme, barks like a dog in me
The modern idiot is here and plain to see
I can't kick aside a kick inside
Call off the dogs, I won't admit I changed at all but lied
Just a little bit
Seconds out
Do you wanna know what this fight's about?
Commerciality over art can't win out
I'm alike in a lot of ways
I'm alike in a lot of waysEmbed
