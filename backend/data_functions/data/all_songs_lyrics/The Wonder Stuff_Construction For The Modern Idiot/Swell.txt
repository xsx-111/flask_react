Swell LyricsIn a word it's a dream
The way it's always been
And we're not giving it back
No they're not taking it back
No consequences in dead presidents
Or pictures of the queen
The way it's always been
What can the matter be?
We're in love with everything
It's knowing quite where to begin
And I don't think things look that grim
'Cos we've never had it so
In love with everything
It's knowing quite where to begin
No I don't think things look that grim
'Cos we've never had it so good
Where money's God and ours is not
We'll suffer sanity
And we're not taking it back
No they're not giving it back
Our good is lame, their bad is fame
It's just a circle game
That's regularity, what can the matter be?
Oh it's swell, it's swellEmbed
