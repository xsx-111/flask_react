Cabin Fever LyricsWhile mom's and dad's are screaming over string beans
It doesn't occur to them, they're sounding like two has-beens
Political candidates are spitting kisses over babies
And Hollywood's still making heroes out of crazies
Rewind, backdate, leave your weapons at the gate
Don't call me mate
I'll seal your fate
You work it out, but you're all too late
Kick out the windows, damn place is like a hot house
This cabin fever's got me spinning like a lighthouse
There's nowhere to go but where you know
Rewind, backdate, leave your weapons at the gate
Don't call me mate
I'll seal your fate
You work it out, and you're all too late
I don't want to, I don't need to
Give me something I'll agree to
You're not funny, stuff your money
I couldn't tell you all I've been through
That's all it takes, don't unwind me
Who's on the make? Get behind me!Embed
