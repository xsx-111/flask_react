Your Big-Assed Mother LyricsOh what does she want
When she breaks down in front of me?
A piece of my mind or just some sympathy?
Meanwhile I'm thinking but I won't say a word
They're not of mine she hangs on
Just what's inside of her?
Not much, not much
History comes round the corner sees what's in front of me
It's not for me or your big assed mother
To set you straight or tell you what to say
She set me up, now I'm staked forever
I think you'll find you forced us both together
The baby won't sleep, it's not for meEmbed
