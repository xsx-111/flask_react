Storm Drain LyricsSo you wanna be liked, no I just wanna be safe
To have protection from rejection
Interned without exception
There is fear within these eyes
I can't run but I can hide
No I can't run but I can....
Fit inside this world's disgrace
There are no words to illustrate
A marijuana trip away, confided all I had to say
To only watch it drift away
I don't wanna learn more
I'm already tired by things I'll never do
Inadequacies been disguised
Ambitions have been pushed aside
There is fear within these eyes
I can't run but I can hide
No I can't run but I can....
There is a change in life
There are disguises to be worn
There is a change in life
There are disguises to be worn
I can fit inside this world's disgrace
There are no words to illustrate
A marijuana trip away
Confused the things that I would say
And I can watch it drift away and out of sight
There is no future half as bright
To know your hands have been untied
Confessions have been realised
And wipe the smoke out of my eyesEmbed
