Moving Waves LyricsMoving waves, the wind has left you
And you are still in commotion
Moving waves, the wind has left you
And you are still in commotion
We are still repeating the word it has taught us
It moves our whole being to ecstasy
Waves, why do you only come excited
And then all come together?
Because behind our individual action
There is one impulse working
Because behind our individual action
There is one impulse working
Rising waves, what motive is behind your impulse?
What motive is behind your impulse?
The desire to reach upwardsEmbed
