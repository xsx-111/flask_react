Seen the Light LyricsNow that our eyes have seen the light
Well the world lies twisted and weird
It's like our minds have taken flight
Pedelo rides up to the sun, oh yeah
Well, what you do is up to you
Take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band
Now that our eyes have seen the light
Well the road lies open and clear
It's like our minds have taken flight
Like the river runs down to the sea, oh yeah
Well, what you do is up to you
I'll take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band
Well, what you do is up to you
Take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band
Thankyou very muchEmbed
