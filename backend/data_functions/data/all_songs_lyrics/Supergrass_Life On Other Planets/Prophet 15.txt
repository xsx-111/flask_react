Prophet 15 LyricsI'm lost in a cloud and I can't get out
There's no other way, don't try
I'm caught in a car and I can't get out
I can't explain, I can't drive
Can't drive
And Oscar Wilde and Peter Cook were close by
And Che Guevara and Steve McQueen were right there, oh yeah
I'm lost in a cloud and I can't get out
Floating away, can't fly
Caught in a car and I can't get out
I can't explain, can't drive
I can't drive
And John Belushi and Lady Day were close by
And Joe the Lion and Marvyn Gaye were right there, oh yeah
And Davy Crockett and Joan Of Arc were close by
And David Banner and Roger Moore they're all there, oh yeahEmbed
