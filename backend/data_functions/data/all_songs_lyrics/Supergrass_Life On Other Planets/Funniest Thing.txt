Funniest Thing LyricsBroke on a summer night
Cracked in a room
Planet is over
And I can see it all
I can see it all, yeah
Was the funniest thing that I saw
All these creatures were climbing the walls
While the synergy flows through my brains
That is hard
Venus is growing
Immune to the laze
And in the shade of morphine
I forget it all
Just forget it all, yeah
Was the funniest thing that I saw
All these creatures were climbing the walls
And while the synergy flows through my brains
That is hard
Oh, was the funniest thing that I saw
All these creatures were climbing the walls
And while the synergy flows through my brains
Oh, here she goes
It's what I saw
That is hard
Darling that is hardEmbed
