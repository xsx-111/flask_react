Never Done Nothing Like That Before LyricsWell he sleeping now and lying on the floor
He's never done nothing like that before
And I've been stroking your cat come and give us a paw
Never done nothing like that before
Never before, you don't know what you're talking about
Well I'm blowing my chunks with the kids all three
Never done nothing like that before
Now I'm doing time for the PTA
Never done nothing like that before
Never before, you don't know what you're talking about
La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la
La la la, la la la
Never before, you don't know what you're talking aboutEmbed
