Run LyricsI can see a long way down
Heaven had the time to grow
Heaven had the time to grow
Now the fire's burned down low
Lying in the afterglow
Living in your afterglow
I can make it right for you
Even if you had to go
Even if you had to go
I can walk away from you
Only if you want me to
Tell me that you want me to
Even if you had to run
Even if you had to runEmbed
