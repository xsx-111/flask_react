Grace LyricsWell, we jumped all night on your trampoline
When you kissed the sky it made your sister scream
You ate our chips and you drank our Coke
Then you showed me Mars through your telescope
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money, girl
Well, you sang your songs and you made us laugh
And so we captured you in a photograph
And when the stars came out, your mother called your name
But when the morning comes, we'll get together again
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money, girl
Save your money
Save your money for the
Save your money for the children
You save your money for the children
Ahh
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Oh Grace
Save your money for the children
Oh Grace
Save your money, save your money, girl
Everybody there's lovin' a part in the gameEmbed
