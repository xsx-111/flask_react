Evening of the Day LyricsTis the evening of the day
See the daylight turned away
Then I'm looking up at you
See that everything that's true
I'm a thousand miles away
On another sunny day
As I'm looking at the view
All I'm thinking of is you
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
Is this the parting of the ways
Summer light and daisy chains
As I'm looking up at you
See that everything that's true
On the mountains, on the plains
Railway lines and fierce....
As I'm looking at the view
All I'm thinking of is you
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
Tis the evening of the day
See the daylight turned away
As I'm looking at the view
Feel my heart is growing oh-so
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
(if) she's not on that three fifteen
Then I'm gonna know what sorrow means
He's so stoned
Doesn't really know what he's on about
Maybe he should go and lay down
He's steamed/stoned/pissed
Doesn't really know what he's on about
Maybe he should go and lay down
(Run away!)

(She'll be over here in a minute)
(I'm going before she comes over)Embed
