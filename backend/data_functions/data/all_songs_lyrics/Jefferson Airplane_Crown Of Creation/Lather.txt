Lather Lyrics
(Child)

Lather was thirty years old today
They took away all of his toys
His mother sent newspaper clippings to him
About his old friends who'd stopped being boys (Paper dolls)
There was Howard C. Green
Just turned thirty-three
His leather chair waits at the bank
And Sergeant Dow Jones
Twenty-seven years old
Commanding his very own tank
But Lather still finds it
A nice thing to do
To lie about nude in the sand
Drawing pictures of mountains
That look like bumps
And thrashing the air with his hands

But wait, oh Lather's productive, you know
He produces the finest of sound
Putting drumsticks on either side of his nose
Snorting the best licks in town
But that's all over
(Child)
Lather was thirty years old today
And Lather came foam from his tongue
He looked at me, eyes wide, and plainly say
"Is it true that I'm no longer young?" (Mommy?)
And the children call him famous
What the old men call insane
And sometimes he's so nameless
That he hardly knows what game to play
(Anyone for tennis? Backgammon? Hari kari?)
Which words to say?
And I should have told him
"No, you're not old"
And I should have let him go on
Smiling baby-wideEmbed
