In Time Lyrics
Long time since I climbed down this mountain before
Things I've seen here make me want to go running home

Lean close put your lips next to my face
Look further on past the surface

Orange, blue, red and green
Are the colors of what I feel
And my mind y'know it starts to reel
In time

To know your flesh layin' by my skin
And I wonder whenever I'm in

Warm, soft, nice and now
Are the word things of what I know
And my body y'know it's oh so
In time

I see you at the same place that I play
Ah darlin' tell me what can I say
Dance, sing, sleep and dream
Is the music of what I hear
Among the many things whenever you're near
In time

Come with me my friend
Come on now and take my hand
You can be my friend
Soon be in another countryEmbed
