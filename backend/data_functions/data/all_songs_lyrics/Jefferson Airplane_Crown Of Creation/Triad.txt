Triad Lyrics
You want to know how it will be
Me and him or you and me?
You both stand there your long hair flowing
Eyes alive your mind still growing
Saying to me
"What can we do now that we both love you?"
I love you too

I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three?

You are afraid, embarrassed too
No one has ever said such a thing to you
Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulder
Face like ice, a little bit colder
Saying to you
"You cannot do that, it breaks all the rules
You learned in school"

I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three?
We love each other, it's plain to see
There's just one answer that comes to me
Sister lovers water brothers
And in time maybe others
So you see what we can do is to try something new
If you're crazy too

I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three?Embed
