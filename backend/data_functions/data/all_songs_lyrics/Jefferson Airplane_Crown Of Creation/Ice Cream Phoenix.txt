Ice Cream Phoenix Lyrics
You don't know just
When to stop and when to go
City streets in the dead of winter
Stop your mind with dirty snow

Walk at night and touch your hand to
The golden lights and let them show
You the shadows disappearing
I'll smile and say I told you so

Baby
Tell me why, if you think you know why
People love when there's no tomorrow
And still not cry when it's time to go
And still not cry when it's time to go
And still not cry when it's time to go?

The wall of your memory will echo your sorrow
The pictures of sadness are not what they seem
So hold out your smile, take my hand and be happy
These pictures of sadness are not all they seem
Are you so old that you've no childhood?
Is your timeline so unreal
That all your sunsets come in the morning?
Baby, tell me how you feel

Shelves of books in your mirror reflected
The sidewalks and alleys that you've seen
Show colors change as the images fade in
The magical vanishing memory machine

Baby
Tell me how, if you think you know how
People love if there's no tomorrow?
Do people love if there's no tomorrow
And still not cry when they have to go
And still not cry when they have to go
And still not cry when they have to go?Embed
