If You Feel Lyrics
If you feel like china breaking
If you feel like laughing
Break china laughing
Break china laughing, laughing, laughing

If you feel like leaves are falling
If you feel like smiling
Fall leaves are smiling
Fall leaves are smiling, smiling, smiling

If you feel like love making
If you feel like flying
Make love flying, baby
Make love flying, flying, flying

Got down
Not the first time, you know
Got down, got up to go
Got up to go

If you feel like china breaking
If you feel like laughing
Break china laughing
Break china laughing, laughing
Laughing, laughing
Laughing, laughing
Laughing
Laughing
Laughing
