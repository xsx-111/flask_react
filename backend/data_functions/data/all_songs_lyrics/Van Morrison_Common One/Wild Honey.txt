Wild Honey Lyrics
Open your arms in the early mornin'
When the light comes shinin' through

Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
Beating so wild, honey
(So wild)
And the light comes shinin' through

Singin' my song
And the band is playin'
And the music is tried, tried and true

Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
It's beating so wild, so wild, honey, yeah
And the light comes shinin' through

I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting there for thee
(I'll be waitin' for you)
Way up on the mountainside
Where the hillside rolls
Rolls down to the sea
Tell me what's real?
(Won't you tell me)
What you feel inside
(What do you feel)
Any time of day or night will do
(Any time of day or night, you can call me anytime)

Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
(Can't you hear my heartbeat)
It's hurts so wild, honey
(So wild, so wild)
And your light comes shining through
(Shine, shine on, shine through, shine)
Play on, play on, play

I'll be waiting for you
(Yes, I'll be waiting for you)
I'll be waiting there for thee
(I'll be waitin' there, as long as it takes)
Way up on the mountainside
(Way up on the mountainside)
Where the hillside rolls
(Where the hillside rolls)
Rolls down to the sea
(Rolls down to the sea)
Tell me what's real
(Tell me)
What I feel inside
(Anytime)
Any time of day or night will do
(Anytime of day or night, baby)

Can't you hear my heart beat just for you?
(Just for you, yeah)
And it's so wild, honey, so wild
(So wild, so wild, honey)

Your light, and the light
And the light, and the light
And the light, and the light
And the light, and the light
And the light, and the light
And the light, and the light
And the light, and the light
And the light, and the light
And the light, and the light comes shining through
The light, the light, the light, the light
The light, the light, the light, the light
The light, the light, the light, the light
The light, the light, the light, the light
The light, the light, comes shining through
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
And the light that comes shining through
Let it shine on, shine bright, and trueEmbed
