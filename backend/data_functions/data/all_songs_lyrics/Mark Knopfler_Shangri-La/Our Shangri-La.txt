Our Shangri-La Lyrics
It's the end of a perfect day
For all surfer boys and girls
The sun's dropping down in the bay
And fallin' off the world

There's a diamond in the sky
Our evening stone
In our Shangri-La, oh

Get that fire burnin' strong
Right here and right now
It's here and then it's gone
There's no secret anyhow

We may never love again
To the music of guitars
In our Shangri-La

Tonight your beauty burns
Into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns
Above us endlessly
This is all the heaven we've got
Right here where we are
In our Shangri-La, oh

Tonight your beauty burns
Into my memory
The wheel of heaven turns
Above us endlessly

But this is all the heaven we've got
Right here where we are
In our Shangri-La
In our Shangri-La
In our Shangri-LaEmbed
