Whoop De Doo Lyrics
If I'm over the moon
It's because I'm over you
A day at a time
And I'm tickety boo
I don't carry on
The way I used to

Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo

If I'm doin' great
It's because when I get home
I don't go straight
To my answerphone
And the tears don't come
The way they used to

Whoop de doo
Whoop de doo

So many little things
So much better now
They were only the little things
Anyhow
If I'm over the moon
It's because that's what I am
Funny that once
I used to give a damn
And I'd do anything
In the whole wide world for you

Whoop dee doo
Whoop dee doo
Anything, anything you'd want me to
Whoop de doo
Whoop de dooEmbed
