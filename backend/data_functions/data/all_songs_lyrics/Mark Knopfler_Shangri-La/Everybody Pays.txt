Everybody Pays Lyrics
I got shot off my horse
So what? I'm up again
Playin' in one of these big saloons on main
You can come up here take a look around these sinners dens
You're only ever goin' to find
One or two real games
Nobody's drivin' me underground
Not yet anyway
But either on the strip or on the edge of town

Everybody pays
Everybody pays to play

Yeah, you ought to stay right where you are in Sawdust Land
It's probably the safest place to be
With your greasy little pork pies
And your shoestring hands
Makes no difference to me
All those directions which we never took
To go our different ways
Who went and wrote the oldest story in the book?

Curl up inside a boxcar dream and disappear
With a couple low roller friends
You were never one for trouble
So get out of here
I knew the game was dangerous back then
But nobody's breezin' through these swingin' doors
Just ups and walks away
Everybody has to leave some blood here on the floor
