Sucker Row Lyrics
Somebody's gotta crack a whip around here
Who's mindin' the store?
Shake it up, sell some beer
What's your money maker for?
Pay day we're packin' 'em in
Six gun Annie and buffalo Jill
But who's to say they'll be back again
For a refill?

Honey, you know the drill

Ain't no left turn down sleepy time street
You gotta be fast but you gotta stay loose
Thinkin' on your feet
Slick as grass through a goose
We gotta rationalise
The payroll is givin' me chills
You and me is gettin' organised
It's kill or be killed

Honey, you know the drill
Well they can all look down on sucker row
But they all forget
The tallest trees from acorns grow
Though they ain't yet
I never look down on a sucker stake
They all pay the bills
I never gave a sucker an even break
And I never will

A beautiful vision keeps comin' to me
I see a miracle mind
Flyin' in for free
Service with a smile
High rollers, fancy hotels
Big time singers toppin' the bill
You gotta have a feel for the stuff that sells
Call it a skill

Honey, you know the drill

Somebody's gotta crack a whip around here
Who's mindin' the store?
Shake it up, sell some beer
Money walkin' through the door
Annie's arrivin' at a dangerous age
Don't you go gettin' ill?
Get another woman up in the cage
Who ain't over the hill
Honey, you know the drill

Somebody's gotta crack a whip around hereEmbed
