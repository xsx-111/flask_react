Boom, Like That Lyrics
I'm going to San Bernardino, ring-a-ding-ding
Milkshake mixers, that's my thing now
These guys bought a heap of my stuff
And I gotta see a good thing sure enough now

Or my name is not Kroc, it's Kroc with a K
Like crocodile but not spelt that way now
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that

Folks line up all down the street
Now I am seeing this girl devour her meat now
And then I get it--wham--as clear as day
My pulse begins to hammer then I hear a voice say
These boys have got this down
Ought to be one of these in every town
These boys have got the touch
It's clean as a whistle and it don't cost much
Wham bam, don't wait long
Shake fries patty - you're gone
And how about that friendly name
Heck, every little thing gotta stay the same

You gentlemen ought to expand
You're gonna need a helping hand now
So gentlemen, well, what about me?
We'll make a little business history now

Or my name's not Kroc, call me Ray
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way now
It's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that

Well, we'll build it up and I'll buy them out
But man they made me grind it out now
They open up a new place flippin' meat
So I do too, right across the street
I got the main I need the town
They sell up in the end and it all shuts down
Sometimes you gotta be an S.O.B
If you wanna make a dream reality
Competition, sent 'em south
If they're gonna drown put a hose in their mouth
Do not pass "Go", go straight to hell
I smell that meat hook smell

Or my name is not Kroc that's Kroc with a K
Like crocodile, but not spelt that way now
Ohh, it's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Dog eat dog, rat eat rat now
Ohh, it's dog eat dog, rat eat rat
Kroc style, boom like that1Embed
