All That Matters LyricsMy darling girl
Oh! My darling girl
You're all that matters in this wicked world
All that matters, all that matters
My darling boy, my darling boy
All of my sunshine and all of my joy
You're all that matters, all that matters
Well, I can't stop the pain
When it calls, I'm a man
And I can't stop the rain
When it falls my darling, who can?
My darling girl
Oh! My darling girl
You're all that matters in this wicked world
All that matters, all that matters
Well, I can't stop the pain
When it calls, I'm a man
And I can't stop the rain
When it falls my darling, who can?
My darling girl
My darling girl
You're all that matters in this wicked world
All that matters, all that matters
My darling friend
My darling friend
All we've got going is love in the end
It's all that matters, all that matters
All that matters, all that mattersEmbed
