Back to Tupelo Lyrics
Around the time of Clambake
Movie number twenty five
You and the lying Dutchman
Are still in overdrive
You're strong as when you started
Mississippi in your soul
You can still be Marlon Brando
And the King of Rock 'n' Roll
It isn't just the records
No, you must have Hollywood
The songs alone are not enough
That much is understood
You'll soon be back in Memphis
Maybe then you'll know what to do
The story lines they're giving you
Are just not ringing true

Oh, it's ways to go
Back to Tupelo
It's ways to go
Back to Tupelo
When you're young and beautiful
Your dreams are all ideal
Later on it's not the same
Lord, everythin' is real
Sixteen hundred miles of highway
Roll back to the truth
And a song to give your mother
In your first recordin' booth
Around the time of Clambake
That old dream's still rollin' on
Sometimes there'll be the feelin'
Things are going wrong
Mornin' star is fadin'
Lord, Mississippi's cold
You can still be Marlon Brando
And the King of Rock 'n' Roll

Oh, it's ways to go
Back to Tupelo
It's ways to go
Back to Tupelo1Embed
