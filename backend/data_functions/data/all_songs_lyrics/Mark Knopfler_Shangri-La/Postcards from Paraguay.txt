Postcards from Paraguay Lyrics
One thing was leading to the next
I bit off more than I could chew
I had the power to sign the checks
It wasn't difficult to do

I couldn't stay and face the music
So many reasons why
I won't be sending postcards
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
From Paraguay

I robbed a bank full of dinero
A great big mountain of dough
So it was goodbye Compa√±ero
And cheerio

I couldn't stay and face the music
So many reasons why
I won't be sending postcards
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
I never meant to be a cheater
But there was blood on the wall
But I had to steal from Peter
To pay what I owed to Paul

I couldn't stay and face the music
So many reasons why
I won't be sending postcards
From Paraguay
From Paraguay
