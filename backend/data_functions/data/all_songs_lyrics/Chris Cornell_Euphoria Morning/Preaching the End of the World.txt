Preaching the End of the World Lyrics
Hello, I know there's someone out there
Who can understand and who's feeling the same way as me
I'm 24 and I've got everything to live for
But I know now that it wasn't meant to be

'Cause all has been lost and all has been won
And there's nothing left for us to save
But now I know that I don't wanna be alone today
So if you're finding you've been feeling just the same

Call me now, it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You'll need a friend in the world
'Cause you can't hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world

I've got a photograph, I'll send it off today
You will see that I am perfectly sane
Not for a lifetime or "forever and a day"
'Cause we know now that just won't be the case
So call me now, it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You'll need a friend in the world
'Cause you can't hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world

With no commitment and no confessions
And no little secrets to keep
No little children or houses with roses
Just the end of the world and me

'Cause all has been gone and all has been done
And there's nothing left for us to say
We could be together as they blow it all away
And we could share in every moment as it breaks

So call me now, it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You'll need a friend in the world
'Cause you can't hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world
So call me now, it's alright
It's just the end of the world
You'll need a friend in the world
'Cause you can't hide
So call and I'll get right back
If your intentions are pure
I'm seeking a friend for the end of the world1Embed
