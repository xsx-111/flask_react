Mission Lyrics
Pulled through you and drowning in your swirl
Circling, unfolding in your will
I'm gonna glide on the winds of your breathing
And alight on your guarded heart
I'm going to tear all your temples down

I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now

Smoldering down inside your mood
Slithering and fanning in your eyes
I'm gonna dive through your crying and sleep in your hair
Rise from your ashes and kneel in your prayers
Tear all your temples down

I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now

I have nothing but then, the have is not as good as the want
I'm gonna glide on the winds of your breathing
Writhe in your calm and provide your release
Wade into your warning you're needing
And reside in the heart of your strongest beliefs
Tear all your temples down

I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now
I'm on a mission now

And I have nothing, but then the have is not as good as the wantEmbed
