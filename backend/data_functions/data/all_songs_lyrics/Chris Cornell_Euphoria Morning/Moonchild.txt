Moonchild Lyrics
Open your arms to the lonely shine
Lonesome as gold in the poor man's smile
See how the moon is full
Follow the push and pull
Follow the ebb and flow in the breathing tide

Come on, Moonchild
You're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild

Cat on the road down in the living night
See how the black dog grins in the diamond light
We're dreaming and we're real
We're broken and we're healed
Give in to what you feel over what you see

Come on, Moonchild
You're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild

Come on, moonflower
You're so far away from now
You could bloom forever in the hour
And when "if" is only "yes" and "no"
It now becomes too soon
I know
You'll be alright
If you'd only
Come away in the moon
Yeah
Come away in the moon
In the blue shine

Come on, Moonchild
You're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild

Come on, moonflower
You're so far away from now
You could bloom forever in the hour

You could bloom forever in the hourEmbed
