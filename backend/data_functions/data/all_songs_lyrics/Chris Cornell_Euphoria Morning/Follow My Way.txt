Follow My Way Lyrics
Little one, don't be a fool
I'm a wreck when I look mighty
In euphoria, I'm bruised
In confusion, next I'm lightning
In complacence, I am small
Through oblivion I'm charged

Follow my way when I'm not leading anyone
Open and frayed when you can see that I'm unsure
Out on my way, I'm only pure when I get lost
And you're only needing when you're finding that I'm not

You're just looking for a boy
Bathed in infrared and sunlight
I'm all polish and reward
When I'm confident, I'm hopeless
Just like everybody else
Right before they fall apart

So follow my way when I am falling from your heart
When I'm the pain, fever, and sweet relief in one
Out on my way, though I'm not worthy of your trust
Follow me down into a swan dive, all eyes closed tight
Lowly, slowly, now I know
I love where you go when you're gone
Warm your hands inside my veins
I might be contagious
Through oblivion, I charge

So follow my way when I am useless to your cause
When I derail, calm in the patience of remorse
Out on my way, out on my empty open nerves
When all you know is that I don't know where we are
When all you know is that I don't know
Follow my wayEmbed
