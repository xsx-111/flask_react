Disappearing One Lyrics
What have you done, my little spark?
Cursing my name 'cause again I put you out
Falling apart, you tell yourself you are
Dreaming only of the ones who never dream of you
Never dream of you

But I'm your disappearing one
I vanish when the curtain's drawn
But I will come again
And you will let me in
And you'll see I never disappear for long

Into your room I stumble now
Too tired to cower and it's too late to draw you out
And there you lie like a painting of Christ
Bleeding on the heads of the ones who nailed you down
The ones who nailed you down

But I'm your disappearing one
I vanish when the curtain's drawn
But I will come again
And you will let me in
And you'll see I never disappear for long
Yeah, I'm your disappearing one
I vanish when the curtain's drawn
But I will come again
And you will let me in
And you'll see I never disappear for long

And you'll see I never disappear for longEmbed
