Sunshower Lyrics
Dark as roses and fine as sand
Feel your healing and your sting again
I hear you laughing and my soul is saved
On forgotten graves you cry

Crawl like ivy up my spine
Through my nerves and into my eyes
Cuts like anguish or recollections
Of better days gone by

But it's all right when you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
It's alright when you find your way
Then you see it disappear
It's alright, though your garden's grey
I know all your graces someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower
In the sweet sunshower

Eyes like oceans so far away
A feather trail to a better way
Worried mornings turn into days
Then into worried nights
But it's all right when you're all in pain
And you feel the rain come down
It's alright when you find your way
Then you see it disappear
It's alright, though your garden's grey
I know all your graces someday will flower
In the sweet sunshower
In the sweet sunshower

Oh in the sweet sunshower
In the sweet sweet sweet sunshower
I know all your graces someday will flower
In the sweet sweet sunshower
It's all right
All you'll be you are today, are today
It's all right
All you'll be you are today, are today
Are today
Are today
Are today
Are today5Embed
