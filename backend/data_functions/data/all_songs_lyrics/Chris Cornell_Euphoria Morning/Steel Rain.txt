Steel Rain Lyrics
And so we start another day together
You and I and the million miles between us
I train my moods to bloom like flowers unfolding
Instead of fluttering around and slowly drowning in the

Steel rain
Steel rain
Steel rain
It's taking over
It's taking over

The sky is open and the drones are pouring out
The day inhales in a contagious yawn
And there you smile as though the sun were bouncing in the

Steel rain
Steel rain
Steel rain
It's taking over
Steel rain
Steel rain
Steel rain
It's taking over
It's taking over
Here in the little world, the tiny world spins for me
All's well in the tilted world
But there's something falling down in the

Steel rain
Steel rain
Steel rain
It's taking over
Steel rain
Steel rain
Steel rain
It's taking over
It's taking over

It's taking over
It's taking over
It's taking over
It's taking over
It's taking overEmbed
