Wave Goodbye Lyrics
Words get tangled on your tongue
And you stumble on your feet
When you miss somebody
And everywhere you think you see them
Walking down the street
When you miss somebody

When you miss somebody
You tell yourself a hundred thousand times
"Nobody ever lives forever"
So you give it one more try
To wave goodbye
Wave goodbye

Every hurtful thing you ever said
Is ringing in your ears
When you miss somebody
And every thing of beauty that you see
It only brings a tear
When you miss somebody
Oh, when you miss somebody
You tell yourself that everything will be alright
You try to stand up strong and brave
But all you want to do is lay down and die

How long I've waited for an answer or a sign
Lonely and weary from this troubled task of trying
To wave goodbye

So now you start to recognize that every single path you see
Leads to a tear in your eye
So wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbyeEmbed
