Somebody Got Murdered Lyrics
Someone lights a cigarette
While ridin' in a car
Some old guy takes a swig
And passes back the jar
But where they were last night
No one can remember
Somebody got murdered
Goodbye, for keeps, forever

Somebody got murdered
Somebody's dead forever

And you're mindin' your own business
Carryin' spare change
You wouldn't cosh a barber
You're hungry all the same
I been very tempted
To grab it from the till
I been very hungry
But not enough to kill

Somebody got murdered
Somebody's dead forever
Somebody got murdered
His name cannot be found
A small stain on the pavement
They'll scrub it off the ground
As the daily crowd disperses
No one says that much
Somebody got murdered
And it left me with a touch

Somebody got murdered
Somebody's dead forever

Sounds like murder
Those shouts
Are they drunk down below?
Sounds like murder
Those screams!
Are they drunk down below?
Say, my watch stopped, some time ago
Sounds like murder
Those screams!
Drunk, down belowEmbed
