Hey Joe Lyrics
Hey Joe
Where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe
Where you going with that gun in your hand?

I'm gonna shoot my baby
I caught her messin round
With another man

Hey Joe
I heard you shot your baby down
Hey Joe
I heard you shot your baby down

Yes I did I shot her
I went and put her in the ground

Hey Joe
Where you gonna run to now?
Hey Joe
Where you gonna run to now?
I'm heading way down South
Where I can be free
I'm heading Mexico way
No hangman's about to put a leash around meEmbed
