The Hammer Song (Cover) Lyrics"Oh please, don't sell me out"
Said the man with the hammer
Hammering the anvil
"I've been walking on the road of rocks
And I keep on hammering
Keep on hammering
Keep on hammering
Hammering the anvil."
"Don't let the sun go down"
Said the man with the fire
Firing the furnace
"I've been buried in the snow
And I keep on firing
Keep on firing
Keep on firing
Firing the furnace."
"Don't talk to me"
Said the man with the chisel
Chiseling the surface
"I've been sleeping far too long
And I keep on chiseling
Keep on chiseling
Keep on chiseling
Chiseling the surface."
"I don't know what you mean"
Said the man with the shovel
Shoveling the ashes
"I've been diggin' in the frozen ground
And I keep on shoveling
Keep on shoveling
Keep on shoveling
Shoveling the ashes."
Chiseling the surface
Firing the furnace
Hammering the anvil
Hammering the anvil
"Don't sell me out"
Said the man with the hammer
Hammering the anvil
"I've been walking on the road of rocks
And I keep on hammering
Keep on hammering
Keep on hammering
Hammering the anvil."
Shoveling the ashes
Chiseling the surface
Firing the furnace
Hammering the anvil
Keeping on, keeping on, keeping on
Hammering the anvil
I'm gonna keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on hammering
I'm gonna keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on hammeringEmbed
