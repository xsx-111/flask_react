Perk LyricsSwinging little messy stinky girl
Call me whatever you will
I have a present for you... charity
Take off your shoes if you're going to dance on me
But don't grind your pretty heels in my face
I have a present for you
Drunk when I got here
Drunker as I stayed
So I masturbated to your serenade
Couldn't see any face
Except for that girl I saw in that place
Her legs and her cheeks and her ass and her face
But I got mine
Close up... she kicked me in my face
Laugh at the noises my breaking bones make
Cover me up with the milk that you spill
I have a present for you... povertyEmbed
