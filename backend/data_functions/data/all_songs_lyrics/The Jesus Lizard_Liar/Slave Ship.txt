Slave Ship LyricsWell, well, fuck this rain
Sail
Well, fuck this rain
My finger nails have got torn off
This rain will never let up
My blistered wounds are sticky mounds, sail
Oh, I've been
Sail
I've been
Pumped full with salt water
I fill my stomach up so full
And I fill that cubby hole so full
And I tried to cram some more
But it won't go in
I've seen my father go before
I've seen my mother go before
I've seen my sister go before
I've seen my brother go before
I've seen my true love
I've seen my daughter go before
I've seen my son go before
I've seen my friends all go beforeEmbed
