Boilermaker LyricsI'm calm now
I've calmed down
But I'm shaking
Make me another boilermaker
In molasses
A fly in molasses
Nasty sticky shit holds it down
There's an arched back
There is an arched back
's got a pained look under rain clouds
In molasses
A fly in molasses
Just if you know what it's like to drown
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What was that?
Make me another boilermaker
And it's dry inside 'til a dusty wind
And each trying sigh is a trusted friend
In his pride I saw his just defense
I eyed the bedroom door until I busted in
I busted
I busted
I busted in
In molasses
A fly in molasses
Nasty sticky shit holds it down
There's an arched back
There is an arched back
's got a pained look under rain clouds
In molasses
A fly in molasses
Just if you know what it's like to drown
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What's that?
What was that?
Make me another boilermaker
Strange how it makes him want to tell liesEmbed
