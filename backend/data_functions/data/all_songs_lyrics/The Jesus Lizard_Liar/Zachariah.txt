Zachariah LyricsThis mister strolls into some town
This mister strides into some shitty township
Like Moses
The townfolk like the Red Sea
Like Moses
The people like the Red Sea
My mistake, he does not stroll
He does not stride
He smokes into town, goddamn
Like dust with boots on
He's looking around and it's making him smile
He's pushing them around
Because it makes him smile
These bastards' disgrace is conspicuous
They creep away
Like Moses
The townfolk like the Red Sea
Like Moses
The people like the Red Sea
Like MosesEmbed
