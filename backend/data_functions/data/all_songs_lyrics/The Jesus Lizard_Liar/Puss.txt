Puss LyricsGet me something to stop the bleeding, 'cause I'm fittin' to blow
Knock her down the stairwell and kick her, I think you can take her
Shove more bourbon down her mouth hole
'Cause she's the one that needs a nailing
Ya might as well just open the door and
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get me something to stop the bleeding, 'cause I'm fittin' to blow
Knock her down the stairwell and kick her, I think you can take her
Oh, she's the one that needs a nailing
Ya might as well just open the door and
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get her out of the truck, get her out of the truck
Get her out, pow in the bush, yeah right in the kisser
Shove more bourbon down her mouth hole
Pow, smacked in the puss, straight in the sucker
Plum in the kisser, busted her pie hole
Square in the yap, punched in the jaw, straight in the sucker
Dead in her tongue pin, busted in her pie
Square in the yap, punched in the jaw, plum in the kisser
Dead in her tongue, crushed, across, her pie
Smacked in the mushEmbed
