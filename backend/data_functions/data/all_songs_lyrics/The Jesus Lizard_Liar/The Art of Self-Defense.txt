The Art of Self-Defense LyricsA diminutive figure in a filthy loin cloth
Is en-route to your house just to knock you off
A sad pygmy who takes small steps
Who weeps while he snuffs you
Who sits on your chest
The art of self-defense
The art of self-defense
A diminutive figure in a filthy loin cloth
Is en-route to your house just to knock you off
A sad pygmy
A sad pygmy
He weeps while he snuffs you
He sits on your chest
To him you're no different from all the rest
The art of self-defense
