Kings Of Speed Lyrics
Please don’t come any closer to me
I feel old like a withered tree
These days are passing eternally
You won’t ask me to slow it down
Blurred emotions in the crown of the kings of speed
And all we see in full motion collection

Time isn’t slowing
Just speed
Just speed

Silence is golden and seems so pretend
The towering of war machines and men
The falling of lives as we wait in line
We are fading to nothing
Losing the race as they steam ahead
Leaving the trail of the living dead
Moving away
Broken frames push forward then play

Time isn’t slowing
Just speed
It’s all we’re knowing

Silence is golden and seems so pretend
The towering of war machines and men
The falling of lives as we wait in line
We are fading to nothing
Losing the race as they steam ahead
Leaving the trail of the living dead
Moving away
Broken frames push forward then play

Time isn’t slowing
Just speed
It’s all we’re knowingEmbed
