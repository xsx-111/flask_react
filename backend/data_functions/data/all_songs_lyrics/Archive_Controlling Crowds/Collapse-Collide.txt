Collapse/Collide LyricsToo late
They hate
Too late
They hate
You’ve jaded
They’ve faded
From your heart
They’ve ripped it all apart
Our worlds collide
Inside our souls collapsing
In their thoughtless ways
Our hearts collide
They’re correcting
They correct my heart
They’re rejecting
They reject our hearts
Now we’re all stoned
They’ve ripped it all apart
Collapse, collide
They’re correcting
They correct my heart
They’re rejecting
They reject our hearts
Now we’re all stoned
They’ve ripped it all apart
Collapse, collide
Our hearts collideEmbed
