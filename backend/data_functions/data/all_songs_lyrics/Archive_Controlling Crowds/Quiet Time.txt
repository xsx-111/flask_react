Quiet Time LyricsJuxtapose feeling
Just suppose I reel in revolving doors closing
Imposters posing
Turn spinning it round about
Pulling your inside out
Know that they will do it now without a doubt
Motivated in quick time to stop the watchman exposing orchestrated explosions
Medicine man mix a potion sedate the not so great nation
Now they be jumping out of their skin to fear factors
Run through acres morphing shape shifters
Lift the lid and give a wide berth
The earth not a million miles away
Minor detail as I put it in another way
To the latter day
Burning out your retina pitch black enveloping hells fire developing heat
Skin crawling up you swear blind
The cruel and unkind advance you’re running out of time
The adrenalin flows hitting the wall
Ready to fall over but still they stand tall
Winner taking it all in, stalling for some ideological ways out
Twist and then shout out aloud
Steady bellowing
Subtle moment following
Subsequent change rearrange
How we doing?
We are fine
Quiet time
Ready for the steady climb
Cross a ley line down into the open mind’s eye
Attack they react and turn into the maniac
Critical breakdown why?
‘cause it’s an actual fact, focus at
Take a longer look at how we can prevail and not failEmbed
