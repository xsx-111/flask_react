Dangervisit LyricsSo much writing on the wall, can you read it all?
Can you see through the haze when the writing's small?
Can you read what it means, is it make any sense?
'Cause it's all dollar bills, and pounds, and pence
Telling you what to do and what pills to take
When your head's in your hands and your belly aches
Where to go in the world when you need a change
Don't you worry about the bill, that can be arranged
Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question
Give me things that can calm this depression
Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question
Give me things that can calm this depression
Let me know what to do when my money's spent
Let me know how to smell and to pay the rent
Let me know what to do when my hair is gone
Let me know who to kill when the war is on
There's a woman of your dreams and she's on the phone
Better send her a text when you're on your own
Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question
Give me things that can calm this depression
Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question
Give me things that can calm this depression
Make me sad, make me sleep, make me question
Give me things that can calm this depression
Give me things that can calm this depression
So much writing on the wall...
Obey...
Feel, trust, obey... (x7)
Swing your love, swing your love, swing your love, swing it...
Feel, trust, obey... (repeat)
Swing your love, swing your love, swing your love, swing it... (repeat)
Sleep along, sleep along, sleepless... (repeat)
You know that they can't turn you
You know that they can't turn you
Don't want that dreams to waste me
Don't want the dreams to save me
High rises, killing lowsEmbed
