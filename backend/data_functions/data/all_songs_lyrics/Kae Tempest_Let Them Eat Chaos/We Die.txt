We Die Lyrics
Across the street
Above the green, in the flat with the colourful curtains
Alisha's wrapped in her blankets
Head lent back on the wall
She's gripping her knees
Looking for purpose, shaking and nervous
She keeps her brave face on all day long
But now, the brave face is gone
Something in the changing seasons prickles in her skin all day
Sucked her back through time and left her feeling far away
He was in her dream
She hasn't dreamt of him for months
She's so tired when she sleeps, she doesn't really dream at all, but there he was
Holding his belly, blood on his shirt, she heard him scream her name
And then she saw him fall
Alisha wipes her face and whispers to herself
"It was just a dream"
She sniffs, and nods, and dries her eyes
She checks the time
It's 04:18

It's a strange thing, your face seems to fade with the changing seasons
Then for some reason it comes back more present than ever
Well, not your face really, more a sense of you
Even though I know it's happened, it's no more comprehensible than
If it was an abstract thing, someone else's friend, are you
Asking me for something, is there something I should do?
It's hard on your mother, she lost your little brother too
But your sister's doing good, man, she's smart, smart like you
And she'll finish her degree next year, try and find a job
I suppose she's got her head screwed on right, you don't have to worry
Is there something else, though? I mean, if there is, I'm sorry
'Cause I can't really think what you might want from me
I heard your voice aloud, it woke me up
I don't believe in ghosts

Work's fine, life's good, Ty's nearly 4 now
Smart enough to walk 'round and hear what I don't say
The night it happened is vivid in my brain, it won't fade
Life is long, still, some things don't change
Nice to fall in love again but that ain't gonna happen soon
I'm tryna get some money saved, fix up the living room
Nearly got in trouble, I got angry with my manager
There's this young girl who works with us
He tried to put his hands on her
It's such a waste, so many idiots alive and kickin'
Why'd I have to be the only sane man in town?
Well, I'm probably only saying that 'cause you're not around
But I'm keeping my chin up though, I don't let it get me down

I heard your voice aloud, it woke me up
I don't believe in ghosts

You're with me all the time
I think I know you better than I did when we were hanging out together
What's it like where you've gone?
Well, I can feel it, it's ok, I know you can't say
But you've been with me all day, I have to tell you
When it happened, I couldn't cry for ages
But when it hit me, I fucking screamed like a lion in a cage
And, look, I fasted, I didn't eat a thing for, like, a week
And I just walked across the heath in the rain
Spittin' bars to the grass, and listenin' to the cars skidding past
I thought life would get more real or something more fast
But it didn't
When I look at your son, though
Life's hidden meanings come to the front of my vision
And it's weird, the way I see it right now, it's so strong
I'd never be the person I'd become if you would never gone
Everything's connected, right? Everything's connected
And even if I can't read it right, everything's a message
We die so the others can be born
We age so the others can be young
The point of life is live, love
If you can, then pass it on, right?
We die so the others can be born
We age so the others can be young
The point of life is live, love
If you can, then pass it onEmbed
