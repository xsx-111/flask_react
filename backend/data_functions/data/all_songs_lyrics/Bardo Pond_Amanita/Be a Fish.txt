Be a Fish LyricsI'd like to
Smell like a fish
When I go swimming
In the soupy mix
I like to
Smell like a fish
When I go swimming
Each and everyday faithfully
Hey Mom, when I grow up
I want to be a fish
'Cause I know we're all free to be
What we want to be
So I'd like to
Smell like a fish
When I go swimming
In the deep blue sea constantly
Come on in
And the water's fine
Come on in
And the water's fine
Air is warm
And the ocean's blue
Sky is warm
And the ocean's blue
Come on in
The water's fine
Come on in
The water's fine
I'd like to
Smell like a fish
When I go swimming
In the soupy mix
Sky is warm
And the ocean's blue
Constantly warm
Faithfully blue
I'd like to
Smell like a fish
I like to
Smell like meEmbed
