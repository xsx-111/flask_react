Wank LyricsI go for a walk
Visible smoke in my back pocket
I saw all the signs
I smelled it burning
When the sky bleached white
It all went down before me
No time like goodbye
No time for the present
No time for goodbye
No time like the present
I went for a walk
Visible smoke in my back pocket
I saw it all went down
I smelled the burning
When the sky bleached white
All laid out before me
All coming to a head
Inside my head
No time for goodbye
No time like the present
Secret eyes
In the back of my headEmbed
