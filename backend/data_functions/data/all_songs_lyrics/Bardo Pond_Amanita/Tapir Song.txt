Tapir Song LyricsRed rise
Like the northern light
Warm rays
Still tinged with night
The story of the angels
Pouring down through the sky
The world thirsty
Drinks up
Without asking why
Shine through the dream
Warm at the end of night
Story of the angels
Pouring down through the sky
Thirsty
Drink it up
Without asking why
Red rise
Like the northern light
Warm rays
Still tinged with night
Story of the angels
Pouring down through the sky
Seven times thirsty
Drink up
We don't ask why
Shine through the dream
Warm at the end of night
Don't ask whyEmbed
