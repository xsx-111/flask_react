Sometimes Words LyricsSometimes words get in the way
Sometimes they help me say
What I need to say
Sometimes words get in the way
I get mixed up
I don't know what to say
Sometimes words get in the way
But you help me
Push the words out of the way
It's so hard
I feel like a card
Sometimes words get in the way
Sometimes they help me say
I want to play around with words
You help me go
You help me go all the way
Sometimes words get in the way
Sometimes they help me say
Sometimes words help me say
What I really need to say
I love youEmbed
