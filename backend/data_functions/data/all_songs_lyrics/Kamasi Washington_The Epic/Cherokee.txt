Cherokee LyricsBrave Indian Warrior, since first I met you
I can't forget you, Cherokee sweetheart
Child of the prairie, your love keeps calling
My heart enthralling, Cherokee
Dreams of summertime, of lovertime gone by
Throng my memory so tenderly, and sigh. My
Brave Indian Warrior, one day I'll hold you
My arms enfold you, CherokeeEmbed
