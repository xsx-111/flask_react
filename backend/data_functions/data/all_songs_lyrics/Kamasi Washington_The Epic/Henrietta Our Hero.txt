Henrietta Our Hero Lyrics
Can I tell you a story of a lady so meek?
Fought her battle alone with love
Had no armor, no weapon, no desire to flee
But a power so deep inside, preside to us all
I see a star, how strong it was
And still, somehow, we seem to fall

Henrietta, our hero
Shining fearless and bright
Can you see her?
Her light is here


Can I tell you a story of a lady so meek?
Fought her battle alone with love
Had no armor, no weapon, no desire to flee
But a power so deep inside, preside to us all
I see a star, how strong it was
And still, somehow, we seem to fall

Henrietta, our hero
Shining fearless and bright
Can you see her?
Her light is here
Henrietta, our hero
Shining fearless and bright
Can you see her?
Her light is here
Henrietta, our hero
Shining fearless and bright
Can you see her?
Her light is hereEmbed
