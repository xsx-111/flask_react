Tobacco Road LyricsI was born in a bunk
Mama died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a dusty shack
And all I had was a'hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road
I'm gonna leave and get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money, get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco RoadEmbed
