Romeo & Juliet LyricsFinding a job tomorrow morning
Got a little something I want to do
Gonna buy something I can ride in
Take my girl dating at the drive-in
Our love's gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet
I'm gonna buy her pretty presents
Just like the ones in the catalog
Gonna show her how much I lover her
Let her know that one way or the other
Our love's gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Right now I'm speculating
Wonder what to morrow's gonna really bring
If I don't find work tomorrow
It's gonna be heartaches and sorrow
Our love's gonna be destroyed by a tragedy
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Talk about love and romance
Just wait till I get myself straight
I'm gonna put Romeo's fame right smack dab outta date
Finding a job tomorrow morning
Got a little something I want to do
Gonna buy something I can ride in
Take my girl dating at the drive-in
Our love's gonna be written down in history
Just like Romeo and Juliet1Embed
