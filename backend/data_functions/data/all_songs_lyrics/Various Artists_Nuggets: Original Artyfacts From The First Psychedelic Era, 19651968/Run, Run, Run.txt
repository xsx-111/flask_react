Run, Run, Run Lyrics(ooooooooo)
(ooooooooo)
Up in the morning at half past eight
You can't have your breakfast 'cause you'll be late
You tie your tie like a hangman's noose
Ain't no time to drink your juice
So you run, run, run, run
Yeah you run, run, run, run
Stand on the corner and wait for the bus
It's late again, you start to cuss
The paper's filled with all bad news
Fat lady stands on your polished shoes
So you run, run, run, run
Yeah you run, run, run, run

... of the latest quotations from the new york stock exchange:
Heart attacks up two & three quarters
Mental illness split three for one
Ulcers up one
General chaos, that's general chaos is up one quarter
The great society unfortunately is down five points
Down at the office all is still
The boss is at a funeral
A note on the door 'no work today'
Our chief competitor passed away
So you run, run, run, run
Yeah you run, run, run, run
Up in the morning at half past eight
You can't have your breakfast 'cause you'll be late
Tie your tie like a hangman's noose
Ain't no time to drink your juice
So you run, run, run, run
Yeah you run, run, run, run
Oh you run, run, run, run
Oh you run, run, run, run
