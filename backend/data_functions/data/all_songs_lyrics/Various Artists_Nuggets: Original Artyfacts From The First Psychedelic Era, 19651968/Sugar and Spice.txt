Sugar and Spice LyricsSugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine
Everybody stops and stares at my baby, when she's walking down the street
People passing by just look at my baby, cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's
Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine
Every time we kiss I get that feeling, every time we simply meet
When I see her smile I get that feeling, cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's
Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mine
Never eve knew a girl so lovely, sweet enough to want to meet
Everyone's crazy 'bout my baby, cause my baby looks so sweet
You know she's
Sugar and spice and all things nice, kisses sweeter than wine
Sugar and spice and all things nice, you know that little girl is mineEmbed
