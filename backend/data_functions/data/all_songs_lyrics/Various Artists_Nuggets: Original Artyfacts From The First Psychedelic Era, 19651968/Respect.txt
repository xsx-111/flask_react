Respect LyricsWhat you want, honey, you got it
What you need, baby, you've got it
All I'm asking, for respect
When I come home
Hey hey hey, now
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Do me wrong, honey, if you want to
You can do me wrong while I'm gone
All I'm asking, is for respect
When I come my home, ooh
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey little girl, you're sweet as honey
And I'm about to give you all of my money
And all I'm asking, gotta have respect
When I come home, hey now
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey little girl, you're sweeter as honey
And I'm about to give you all of my money
Gotta have respect
When I come on home
Gotta come on home
Hey hey hey
People get ready
Respect is what I need
Respect is what I want
Gotta have it
Gotta have it
Come on
Talk to me
You're ready
Respect gotta have it now
Gotta have it
In the morning...Embed
