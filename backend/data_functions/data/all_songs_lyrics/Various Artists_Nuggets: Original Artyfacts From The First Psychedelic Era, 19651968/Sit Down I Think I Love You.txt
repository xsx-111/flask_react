Sit Down I Think I Love You LyricsSit down, I think I love you
Anyway, I'd like to try
I can't stop thinkin' of ya
If you go I know I'll cry
If you want someone to love ya
Pretty baby, make it me
It's not much I'm asking of ya
Just try me and you'll see
Baby, can't ya see that I'm a desperate man?
I get high just a-thinkin' about ya
You know what they say about the bird in the hand?
And that's why I ain't leavin' without ya
Baby, can't ya see that I'm a desperate man?
I get high just a-thinkin' about ya
You know what they say about the bird in the hand?
And that's why I ain't leavin' without ya
Sit down, I think I love ya
Anyway, I'd like to try
I can't stop thinkin' of ya
If you go I know I'll cry
Sit down, I think I love ya
Sit down, I think I love ya
Sit down, I think I love ya
Sit down, I think I love ya
Sit down, I think I love ya
Sit down, I think I love yaEmbed
