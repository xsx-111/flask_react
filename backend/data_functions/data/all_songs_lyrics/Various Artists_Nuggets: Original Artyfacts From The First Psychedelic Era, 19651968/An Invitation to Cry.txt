And you don't want no anna boy 'cause we the anna kings
Don't even talk about guns 'cause we quick to sling
And when it comes to beef boy we some Burger Kings
Catch you with the small .22 that I had in my bouge
Had that upper hand had pulled first but you was scared to shoot

With automatic triggers, chrome handles
Red lights to keep you sighted, my shit on the rising
I'm combining platinum with some diamonds
Keep the room rotating like spinners and get you out your seat
Sensation or vibrations as soon as you hear the fuckin' beat

Bring it to the fuckin' floor I might respect your fucking state
