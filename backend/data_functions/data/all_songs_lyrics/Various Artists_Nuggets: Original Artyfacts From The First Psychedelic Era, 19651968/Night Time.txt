Night Time LyricsI get up in the mornin'
Kick the covers from my bed
The sunlight in my eyes
Playin' tricks with my head
I work like a dog
On a job every day
Tryin to make some money
So you can go and play
In the night time
Its the right time
I said the night time
That's the right time
I want to be with you
In the night time
I come home from work
You know I'm tired and I'm beat
I try to make some supper
But I can't even eat
I jump in the shower
Wash the world off my back
I'm gonna get you baby
That's a natural fact
In the night time
That's the right time
I said the night time
That's the right time
I wanna be with you
In the night time
Come here baby
Just a little bit closer
Turn your radio up so you can hear what I'm sayin
Awww now ya got me turned on baby
Ha ha ha ha ha ha...
A hundred million people
With nothin to say
Runnin round in circles
They just livin the day
But stick with me baby
Ill show ya how to fly
Well make such pretty music
Watch the world go by
In the night time
That's the right time
I said the night time
Night time...
Night time... night time... night time
Night time... night time... night time...Embed
