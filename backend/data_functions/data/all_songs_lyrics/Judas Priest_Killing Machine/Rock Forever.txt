Rock Forever Lyrics
When the day is over
I like to ease my mind
By juicing up my system
With this beat of a heavy kind
I smack a bottle open
I crank the Hi-Fi high
I'm in a seventh heaven
Ooh, I can touch the sky

I'm in love, so in love
And I can't stop talking about my rock forever

It starts to moving to me
Just that I can't explain
It's like a brilliant sunshine
After standing in the pouring rain
My skin begins to tingle
Ooh, right on down my back
It's really got me fevered
Pounding my senses flat

I'm in love, so in love
And I can't stop talking about my rock forever
Rock, rock, rock forever
I love my
Rock, rock, rock forever
My fever
Rock, rock, rock forever
Always going to
Rock, rock, rock forever
I can't stop talking about rock
Now give them back, boys
So when you get those blue days
Here's just what to do
Switch into this lifeline
And feel it rushing through
Before you know it, blue days
Are better left behind
By juicing up your system
With this beat of a heavy kind

I'm in love, so in love
And I can't stop talking about the
Rock forever, rock forever
I'm going to rock foreverEmbed
