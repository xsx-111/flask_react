Take On the World Lyrics
Got to leave your seat, got to get up upon your feet
Going to move you to the rhythm until you never can stop
We got the power, we got the music, and you bet you that we can use it
Going to take it rock-bottom, going to take it to the top

Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world

Move a little nearer, you know you got to follow your leaders
Because we need you, like you need us for sure
We're going to drive you, we're going to ride you, we're going to get right inside you
And if you want to keep going, just shout out for more

Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world

Sing your song, we'll listen to you
Sing your song, the spotlights on you
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the world
Put yourself in our hands, so our voices can be heard
And together we will take on all the worldEmbed
