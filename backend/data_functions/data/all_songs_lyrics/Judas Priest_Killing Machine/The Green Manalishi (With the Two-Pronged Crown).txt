The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown) Lyrics
Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around
Making me do things I don't want to do

I can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams
Making me see things I don't want to see


'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night, dragging us up or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, then slip away, leaving me here
Trying to keep from following youEmbed
