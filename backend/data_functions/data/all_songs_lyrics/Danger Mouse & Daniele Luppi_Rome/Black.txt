Black LyricsWe touch the walls of the city streets, and
Didn't explain
Sadly showed us our ways
Of never asking why
Cast down
It was heaven sent, and
To the church no intent to repent
On my knees, just to cry
Until you travel to that place you can't come back
Where the last pain is gone and all that's left is black
Bright nights cease coming to me, and
Some day
They'll punish my deeds, and they'll find
All the crimes
But then they ask when they going to see them
Then they're gonna
Ask to feel the ghosts, the walls, the dreams
Oh, I've got mine
At last those coming came and they never looked back
With blinding stars in their eyes but all they saw was black
Fooled them, hoping to seem
Like the slayer of evil
But the product of greed, and
It's not a mask, so be honest with me
They can't afford to ignore that I'm the disease
Practical, since we had to be, and
When they were old they came back to me
And they tried, oh they tried
And when you follow through and wind up on your back
Looking up at no stars in the sky those white clouds have turned it black11Embed
