The Rose With the Broken Neck LyricsLonely I see
Lonely I need
Lonely I feel
Lonely I bleed
Lonely I trust
And lonely I must
Be the rose with the broken neck
The plow on the farm
The train on the track
The tracks on my arm
The train in the wreck
That's when they all sing this song
About when you are all alone
In your home with the broken neck
Help myself to a drink
Help myself to the sink
The dogs start to moan
And the crows start to peck
At my eyes and down at the ground
Oh and it shows
On the rose with the broken neck
Lonely I see
Lonely I need
Lonely I feel
And lonely I bleed
Lonely I trust
And lonely I must
Be the rose with the broken neck1Embed
