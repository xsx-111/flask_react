Two Against One LyricsMake no mistake I don't do anything for free
I keep my enemies closer than my mirror ever gets to me
And if you think that there is shelter in this attitude
Wait till you feel the warmth of my gratitude
One
I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me, so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a gun
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
And if it looks to me like you and your reflection
Plan to add your own fight to this dimension
Then tell it that this ain't no free-for-all to see
There's only three
It's just you and me against me
One
I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a gun
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
And if your foot soldiers, sycophants, and yes men
Plan to break into the middle of this little plan
Then they should plan to hear me say
That I won't play around the way
Anyway, I plan to plan around them
One
I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a gun
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
Lucky for me I'm not the only one5Embed
