The World LyricsThe world is a running brook
Take a look
Cold and always moving
Blind but never soothing
It moves like you and I
In the moonlight
Perfect like a circle
And powerful with energy
The world is an open book
Take a look
Welcome to your own abuse
Your greed is your own hangman's noose
She takes whatever you can give to her
No sooner
Never judging
No matter how much you seem not to care
The world is a bull whose horns you cannot pull
Silently rewarding
Relentlessly commanding
The world's own heart seems to be left behind
Your heart was left behind you
And I am behind you, tooEmbed
