Problem Queen LyricsHelp me through this déjà vu
This crazy state of shock
Have you seen the problem queen
She's never far away
Away from me
And it seems I'm a dream
In some sad luxury
But when I escaped
It's just I...
Can't see through this hazy view
And all the doors are locked
We're only alive when we can't be
Defectors from the clock
The clock of all time
She comes and she goes
But where no one knows
And when Her Highness grows
She shakes me
I wake up and you're gone from me
This lonely shell of shock
Helps me to imagine you
But more often than not
I'm all aloneEmbed
