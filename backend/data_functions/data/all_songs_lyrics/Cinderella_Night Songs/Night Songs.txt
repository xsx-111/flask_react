Night Songs LyricsWorkin' this job ain't payin' the bills
Sick and tired rat race takin' my thrills
Kickin' down the road not a dime in my pocket
Nightime falls and I'm ready to rock it
CHORUS
I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day 'cause we're gonna scream
Night songs
Howl into the light singin'
Night songs
Makes the day right
Night songs
Raise your glass take a bite
Night songs
Ridin' to the east and ridin' to the west
Sleepin' all day but never get a rest
Lookin' at the time stand still it ain't right
Livin' for the moment time to get it tight
CHORUS
I need a shot of gasoline
I'm hittin' one sixteen
I get so hot I see steam
Forget the day 'cause we're gonna scream
