Insulin Lyrics
We dissolve everything
Scratch follicles so they don't grow
Expose your shame for all to see
Sell your bones as ivory

Perfume in my blood
Nails grow through the glove
Bruise my embryo
Lay them down lay them down in rows

I sleep for you when you're exhausted
Your first born will be accosted
Fill their lungs with tar and sage
Make the stem cells act their age

Perfume in my blood
Nails grow through the glove
Bruise my embryo
Lay them down lay them down in rows

Perfume in, perfume in my blood3Embed
