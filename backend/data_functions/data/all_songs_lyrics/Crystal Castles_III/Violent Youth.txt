Violent Youth Lyrics
Show up in your lace
Drink up little girl
And they will always let you down
Hold your mother's pearl

Show up in your lace
Up to your cheekbones
Prevention is the only cure
Kiss them through windows

Throw up in your plate
Look angelical
If you sleep before I arrive
I'll pray for you, my girl

A flower on fire
And I will always let you down


Show up in your lace
Drink up little girl
And they will always let you down
Hold your mother's pearl
Show up in your lace
Up to your cheekbones
Prevention is the only cure
Kiss them through windows

Throw up in your plate
Look angelical
If you sleep before I arrive
I'll pray for you, my girl

A flower on fire
And I will always let you down4Embed
