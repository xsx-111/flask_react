Sad Eyes Lyrics
You can't disguise
You can't disguise

She wears her veil at night
Shadows cast uninvited

Discourage affection
Sad eyes
Sad eyes
You can't disguise
Sad eyes
You can't disguise
Sad eyes
You can't disguise

Feign care and warm concern
The kiss you did not earn

Discourage affection
Sad eyes
Sad eyes
You can't disguise
Sad eyes
You can't disguise
Sad eyes
You can't disguise
Discourage affection
Discourage
Discourage affection
Discourage

Sad eyes
Sad eyes
You can't disguise
Sad eyes
You can't disguise
Sad eyes
You can't disguise6Embed
