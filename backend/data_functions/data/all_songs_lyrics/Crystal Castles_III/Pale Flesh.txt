Pale Flesh Lyrics
Place the ash on their foreheads
An impression to embed
Born-Again before teething
Collect tears from their weeping

Oh hiding them under the sea foam
Package them like a cheap gift
You're nesting under the corridor


Place the ash on their foreheads
An impression to embed
Born-Again before teething
Collect tears from their weeping

Oh hiding them under the sea foam
Package them like a cheap gift
You're nesting under the corridor

Adolescent fiance
I'm just flesh to give away
Adolescent fiance
I'm just flesh to give away7Embed
