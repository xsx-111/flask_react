Mercenary Lyrics
Silhouettes caress without feeling
Who'll be your mercenary

Let the trespassers stay
Decorate starving strays
You can not convert me
Reparations unseen

Silhouettes caress without feeling
Who'll be your mercenary

They dress them up in lace
Underage have their way
Join them in solitary
Should be voluntary3Embed
