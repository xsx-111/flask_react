Affection Lyrics
Catch a moth, hold it in my hand
Crush it casually
Without past I can't disappoint
My ancestry
Forever can I sleep inside
Your menagerie
Catch a moth, hold it in my hand
Crush it casually
Without past I can't disappoint
My ancestry
Forever can I sleep inside
Your menagerie

We drown in pneumonia not
