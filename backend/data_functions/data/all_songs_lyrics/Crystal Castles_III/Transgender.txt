Transgender Lyrics
Are from the start
The chosen few
Out of the youth
Are from the start
Oh I’ll lie with you
Out in the dew

Intimacy
Real love true
Regarding a deal
Is it really true
I love you
Is it really you?
Cause I
Have some news for you

You
Will you ever preserve
Will you ever exhume?
Will you watch petals shed
From flowers in bloom?

Nothing can live up to promise
Nothing can stop its narrative
Nothing in place of catalysts
And you'll never be pure again
Are from the start
The chosen few
Out of the youth
Are from the start
Oh I’ll lie with you
Out in the dew

Intimacy
Real love true
Regarding a deal
Is it really true
I love you
Is it really you?
Cause I
Have some news for you

You
Will you ever preserve
Will you ever exhume?
Will you watch petals shed
From flowers in bloom?

Nothing can live up to promise
Nothing can stop its narrative
Nothing in place of catalysts
And you'll never be pure again16Embed
