Seeing Red Lyrics
You see me and you laugh out loud
Taunt me from safe inside your crowd
My looks they must threaten you
To make you act like the way you do

Red, I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!

You see me and you think I'm a jerk
First impressions without a word
You can't believe your eyes at first
But now you know you've seen the worst

Red, I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!

Red, I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!
I'm seeing red!Embed
