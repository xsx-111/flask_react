Screaming at a Wall Lyrics
I'm gonna knock it down
Any way that I can
I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna yell
I don't wanna have to use my hands

It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
Someday it's gonna fall

You built that wall up around you
And now you can't see out
And you can't hear my words
No matter how loud I shout

It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
Someday it's gonna fall
You're safe inside and you know it
'Cause I can't get to you
And you know I resent it
And my temper grows

You better reinforce those walls
Until you don't have no room to stand
'Cause someday the bricks are gonna fall
Someday I'm gonna use my hands4Embed
