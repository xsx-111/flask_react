Minor Threat Lyrics
Play it faster

We're not the first, I hope we're not the last
'Cause I know we're all heading for that adult crash
The time is so little, the time belongs to us
Why is everybody in such a fucking rush?

Make do with what you have, take what you can get
Pay no mind to us, we're just a minor threat

We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat

I was early to finish, I was late to start
I might be an adult, but I'm a minor at heart
Go to college, be a man, what's the fucking deal?
It's not how old I am, it's how old I feel

Take your time, try not to forget
We never will, we're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat

That's a promise, ha ha1Embed
