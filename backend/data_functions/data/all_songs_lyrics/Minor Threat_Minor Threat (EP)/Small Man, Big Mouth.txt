Small Man, Big Mouth Lyrics
Compete, compete, do it for the boys
Empty barrels make the most noise
You're always on the move
You've always got something to prove

What the fuck are you fighting for?
Is it because you're five foot four?
You better be happy with what you got
You'll never get anymore!

You laugh at a man when he tries
You're trying to make up for your size
To you life is a rivalry
Keep a step ahead of me

What the fuck are you fighting for?
Is it because you're five foot four?
You better be happy with what you got
You'll never get anymore!
Small man, Big mouth!
Small man, Big mouth!
Small man, Big mouth!
Small man, Big mouth!Embed
