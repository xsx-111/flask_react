What Love Lyrics
Going down to see my girl, going to see what I can find
I'm going down to see my love, going to mean her in behind
I'm going down to see my girl, going to come back everyday
I'm going down to see my girl, because I've been too long away

(You know what I'm saying?)

What love?

Because I'm naked at home
You don't want to know
You've got to feel it
I couldn't know why
You don't want to know
Want to let go, let go
And the ground is clear

What love?
What love?
What love?
What love?
What love?
What love?
What love?
What love?
Where did that love go?
What love?
Love it when you're here
God, I love it when you're here
God, I look as though he's over the line
Where did we go?
Way behind
We know
To color in the lines
You know
She didn't mean it
She didn't

What love?
What love?

Yeah, how's everybody coming on?
You're a motherfucker
Take a look at yourself
Who done
Oh yeah
Oh yeah on my right time
The right time
You don't know that time
Know that's mine
Blow my mind
Going down to see my girl, going to see what I can find
I'm going down to see my love, going to mean her in behind
I'm going down to see my girl, going to come back everyday
I'm going down to see my girl, because I've been too long away

Yeah
It's alright1Embed
