Everytime You Touch Me Lyrics
Easy Moby on the controls

Oh, come and take me away
Oh, because everything is wrong today
I look the east, there are colors in the sky
The sun on my face, and oh I've started to cry
Easy Moby on the controls

Because everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Everytime you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's all high, never feeling bad
Used to be alone now I feel so glad
'Cause everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born

Anytime you need some peace
Come along, and stay with me
The forest burns, there are fires in the sky
Is everybody under controls?

Because everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born
Everytime you touch me I feel like I need some more
Love's all high, never feeling bad
Used to be alone now I feel so glad
'Cause everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born
(colors in the sky)

One time in da place we've got to be free, come on!
One time in da place now come stay with me
Because I pull it to the left, pull it to the right
Massive song, we never uptight
Want everybody just feel alright
Massive chorus to make you excite

Because everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born
(word's out, come on people!)
Every time you touch me I feel like I need some more
(Sound system's rocking myself)
Love's all high, never feeling bad
Used to be alone, now I feel so glad
Everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born
(I am not looking to do that...Do it to me!)

Because everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born
(Beautiful people, now!)
Everytime you touch me I feel like I need some more
(Just come to thy self esteem)
Love's all high, never feeling bad
Used to be alone, now I feel so glad
Everytime you touch me I feel like I'm being born
(Sound system's rocking myself)1Embed
