Wasted Time LyricsBlood's been spilled throughout all times
We should known better since we've been around
There's been changes, there's no denying
But what direction is the good sense flyin'
This world's so endless blue
It's better for lovers
You cry cause you don't know if it's true
Have all those years been wasted time
Wasted time
Evil strikes, you feel the fear
The vision of the future is no longer clear
In your mind you see yourself
Runnin' and hiding, you're somebody elseEmbed
