Stormwind LyricsI like to sit beside the fire
When the light is going down
I like to hear the wild wind blow outside my door
I have so much left to remember
I have so much left to forget
And I know i just don't have to search for more
But you want to change my world
Stay out of my life
Stormwind
You're just like a wind
Coming to drag me away
Stormwind
What can I say
I just don't want you to stay
I like to walk around and dream at night
And play with kings and queens 'til the morning light
I like to wake up in the morning, unaware
Of the fact that you are calling me
To ask me if I want to be
Someone who you can love and always care for
You want to change my world
Stay out of my life
Stormwind
You're just like a wind
Coming to drag me away
Stormwind
What can I say
I just don't want you to stayEmbed
