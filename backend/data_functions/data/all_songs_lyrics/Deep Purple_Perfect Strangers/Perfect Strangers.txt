Perfect Strangers Lyrics
Can you remember, remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Oh-oh-oh
And cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah
All my life
I am the echo of your past

I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Oh, oh-oh-oh
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers

Ah, ah, ah, no
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh
Is aching with the dead of the night
Oh-uh-oh, precious life
Your tears are lost in falling rain

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, yeah2Embed
