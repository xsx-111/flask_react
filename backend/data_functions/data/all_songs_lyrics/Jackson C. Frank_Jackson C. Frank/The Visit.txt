The Visit LyricsWhen I said that you were beautiful, I said it there and then
I laid aside all resistance, forgot to say amen
And when you raised your hands to me, a glow therein I saw
A baby of the morning, a sleeping nature's law
And it begins to seem like summer's almost gone
Like the wind that blows the leaves out on the lawn
I determined that I loved you; you determined I am ‘he’
Determined both together, we'd need our company
And the feathers of the wild dove floating to the ground
Gliding through the branches, spinning slowly round
As we wait in the mountains for the song
That revives what's been between us all along
In Cannes there was absurdity
In Nice there was the shore
In Monaco there were casinos
In Asia there was war
And the papers were American
The peaches fresh with cream
People with vibrations
Just wild robots by some stream
And now they grasp imaginary straws
And shuffle through the sea with bright new claws
If what we know can save us, then it's time to make the try
Every time they try to make us servants of some lie
The children born of bodies in bald-with-pattern scheme
It's a funny, a funny world you live in, ‘til you learn that it's a dream
Sea serpents on a rocket made of clay, explaining how we were yesterday
Still I said that you were beautiful, I said it there and then
I laid aside resistance; forgot to say amen
And when you raised your hands to me, a glow therein I see
The childhood of that beauty which belongs to you and me
And I realize that summer is never gone
Like the wind that blow the leaves out on the lawn
Out on the lawn, out on the lawn, on the lawn1Embed
