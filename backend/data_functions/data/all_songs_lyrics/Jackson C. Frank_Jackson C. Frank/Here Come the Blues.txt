Here Come the Blues Lyrics
Monday's shine, yes an' Tuesday's rain
While the days that go by baby like a south bound train
Well its funny thinking you won't ever call my name

Here comes lonely
Here come the blues

Well the words they won't come babe, you know my tongue is cold
Well there's nothing new blue lady, that won't get old
Yes the dealer's gone down and I just better fold

Here comes lonely
Here comes the blues

You know the sun has run down, oh, she's gone out to hide
Yes and I'm out walking while midnight rides
Just me, the good time Charlie's, and the suicides

Here comes lonely
Here come the blues
While Thursday's dry, yes and Friday's just the same
Maybe come down blue Monday, I will grab the brakes again
Cause no bottle of pills, baby, can kill this pain

Here comes lonely
Here come the blues
Here comes lonely
Here come the bluesEmbed
