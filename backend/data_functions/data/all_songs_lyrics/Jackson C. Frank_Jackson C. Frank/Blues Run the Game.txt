Blues Run the Game Lyrics
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same

Send out for whisky, baby
Send out for gin
Me and room service, honey
Me and room service, babe
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin

When I'm not drinking, baby
You are on my mind
When I'm not sleeping, honey
When I ain't sleeping, mama
When I'm not sleeping
You know you'll find me crying

Try another city, baby
Another town
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues come following down
Living is a gamble, baby
Loving's much the same
Wherever I have played
Whenever I've thrown them dice
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game

Maybe tomorrow, honey
Someplace down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older, mama
I'll wake up older
And I'll just stop all my tryin'

Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same4Embed
