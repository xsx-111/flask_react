Marlene LyricsThe ghost of her floats over there
And the smile, the smile, it seemed so lonely
She gave me her hand as they struck up the band
And she seemed to say, she seemed to say ‘you're the only'
And we danced like two snowflakes
In the falling wind, in the wind
And do me a favor God
Won't you let Marlene come in
The gymnasium floor, the brass-bound door
The jungle bird, the jungle bird that you showed me
Her love was so clean, to tell the truth, Marlene
The sound of your tambourine still haunts me
We were so young then,
Now that I'm old I know, oh I know
I loved you right then
I would have made Marlene let go
My friends in the bars, hell they only see the scars
And they do not give a damn, they do not give a damn that I loved you
I don't know why, but once you've seen the sky
You think you know all birds are lovely
But there's snow on the ground
In Woodstock tonight
It's 22 years dear
Since I saw the light
The world it explodes, as such a high powered load
To run, to run, to run, was all they left me
Up here there’s breeze, high in the clouds we're free
To fly, to fly away, was the lesson
And though the fire had burned her life out
It left me little more
I am a crippled singer
And it evens up the score
The ghost of her floats over there
And the smile, the smile it seems, seems so lonely
She gave me her hand as I struck up the band
And she seemed to say, she seemed to say ‘you're the only'
And there we danced like two snowflakes
In the falling wind, in the wind
And do me a favor God
Won't you let Marlene come in
Do me a favor God
Won't you let Marlene come in1Embed
