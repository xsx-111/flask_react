You Never Wanted Me Lyrics
Wondering and waiting
My back against the wall
Not a word that passed between us
Comes to call
Just your shadow on the window
And your step on down the hall
You never wanted me, babe
You never knew me at all

I haven't any picture
To set before my eyes
Nothing to blame
When the blues start to rise
Just the memory of laughter
And the living out of lies
And if I could change my ways, babe
You'd never have said goodbye

If you ever get the time, baby
Please think on me
It's a lock that can't be broken
And there isn't any key
And I'm only in your mind
Only you can set me free
You can't hurt me anymore, babe
And that isn't hard to see
Someday, someone will leave you
And I know you'll feel the same
You'll mark it down to memory
And the dream that never came
Well there are no answers given
When love is just a game
You never wanted me, babe
And now I feel the sameEmbed
