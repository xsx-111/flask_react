Dialogue (I Want to Be Alone) Lyrics
I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be alone

Before all the days are gone
And darker walls are bent and torn
To pass the time of those who mourn
I want to be alone

Rivers that run anywhere
Are in my hand and just up the stair
Past the eyes of those who care
Who can never be alone

Changes that were not meant to be
Tow the hours of my memory
Sing a song of love to me
To say you must never
Never be alone

The tears of a silent rain
Seek shelter on my broken pain
And run away
But I remain
To speak the words
That sing of alone
I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be alone2Embed
