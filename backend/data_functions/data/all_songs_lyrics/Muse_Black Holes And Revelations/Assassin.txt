Assassin Lyrics
War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
Join forces underground

Lose control
An increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
In time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah

Whoaaaa, yeaahhhh
(Aim! Shoot! Kill your leaders!
Aim! Kill them all!)

Oppose and disagree
Destroy demonocracy

Lose control
An increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
In time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born, yeah
