Glorious Lyrics
Rose-tinted view
And satellites that compromise the truth
But I wanted more
With the cuts and the bruises
Touch my face
A hopeless embrace

Faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
And we, too, could be glorious

I need to believe
But I still want more
With the cuts and the bruises
Don't close the door
On what you adore

Yeah and faith
It drives me away
But it turns me on
Like a stranger's love
It rockets through the universe
It fuels the lies and feeds the curse
And we, too, could be glorious4Embed
