Exo-Politics Lyrics
Open the skies over me
I am waiting patiently
I'll wait for a sign
As conspiracies unwind
Will you slam shut or free your mind
Or stay hypnotized?

When the Zetas fill the skies
Will our leaders tell us why?
And fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds

And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign

Carried through the centuries
Secrets locked up and loaded on my back
Well, it weighs me down

When the Zetas fill the skies
It's just our leaders in disguise
Fully loaded satellites
Will conquer nothing but our minds
And I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign, yeah
But I'm waiting patiently
And I'll wait for the sign11Embed
