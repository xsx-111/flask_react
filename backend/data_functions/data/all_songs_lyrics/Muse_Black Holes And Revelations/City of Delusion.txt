City of Delusion Lyrics
Stay away from me
Build a fortress and shield your beliefs
Touch the divine
As we fall in line

Can I believe when I don't trust?
All your theories turn to dust
I choose to hide
From the All-Seeing Eye

Destroy this city of delusion
And break these walls down
And I will avenge
And justify my reasons with your blood

You will not rest or settle for less
Until you guzzle and squander what's left
Do not deny
That you live and let die

Destroy this city of delusion
And break these walls down
And I will avenge
And justify my reasons with your blood

Destroy this city of delusion
And break these walls down
And I will avenge
And justify my reasons with your blood5Embed
