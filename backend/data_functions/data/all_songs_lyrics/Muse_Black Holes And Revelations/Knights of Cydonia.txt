Knights of Cydonia Lyrics

Come ride with me through the veins of history
I'll show you a god falls asleep on the job
And how can we win when fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time, or time will waste you

No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive


No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
