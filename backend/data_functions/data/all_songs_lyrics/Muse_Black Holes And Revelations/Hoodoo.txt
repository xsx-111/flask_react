Hoodoo Lyrics
Come into my life
Regress into a dream
We will hide
And build a new reality
Draw another picture
Of a life you could've had
Follow your instincts
And choose the other path

You should never be afraid
You're protected
From trouble and pain
Why, why?
Is this a crisis
In your eyes, again?

Come to be
How did it come to be?
Tied to a railroad
No love to set us free
Watch our souls fade away
And our bodies crumbling
Don't be afraid
I will take the blow for you
And I've had recurring nightmares
That I was loved for who I am
And missed the opportunity
To be a better man17Embed
