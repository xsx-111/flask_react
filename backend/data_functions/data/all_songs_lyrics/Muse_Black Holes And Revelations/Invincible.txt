Invincible Lyrics
Follow through
Make your dreams come true
Don't give up the fight
You will be alright
'Cause there's no one like you in the universe

Don't be afraid of what your mind conceives
You should make a stand
Stand up for what you believe
And tonight, we can truly say
Together we're invincible

During the struggle they will pull us down
But please, please, let's use this chance to turn things around
And tonight, we can truly say
Together we're invincible

Do it on your own
It makes no difference to me
What you leave behind
What you choose to be
And whatever they say, your soul's unbreakable
During the struggle they will pull us down
But please, please, let's use this chance to turn things around
And tonight, we can truly say
Together we're invincible
Together we're invincible


During the struggle they will pull us down
But please, please, let's use this chance to turn things around
And tonight, we can truly say
Together we're invincible
Together we're invincible6Embed
