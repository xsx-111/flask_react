Back to Back LyricsBack to back to back to back to back
Back to back
Now how you gonna hold me
Back to back
How you gonna show me
Back to back
Baby that's a fact
You know that I made a mistake
You know that I will stand face to face
And now I gotta take it
Back to back
Back to back
Why don't you put a book upon our heads
And put some pistols in our hands
Count twenty paces at dawn
Count twenty questions we'll get wrong
You know that I made a mistake
You know that I will stand face to face
If you want
Face to face
If you only turn around
Turn around
I can't take it
Back to back
Back to back
Back to back
We're standin' back to back
We're livin' back to back
You're holdin' back to back
And now I'm gonna hold me
Back to back to back to back to backEmbed
