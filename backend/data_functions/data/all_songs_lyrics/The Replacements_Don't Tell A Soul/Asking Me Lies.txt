Asking Me Lies LyricsSummoned through a keyhole
In a lunchbox for three
Take me to your followers
And the swingset police
You can't see the weather
You've got to pull the blinds
Tellin' you questions
Askin' me lies
Well the rich are gettin' richer
And the poor are gettin' drunk
In a black and white picture
There's a lot of grey bunk
Man, you're hittin' them books
And hittin' their streets
Won't be hard to find
Tellin' you questions
Askin' me lies
Happy birthday
Whosever birthday it is today
Born yesterday
It's a wonder you're still alive
And they're tellin' you questions
And they're askin' me lies
Little Boy Zoo
And the rock with his helpful friends
Butterfly train
Never ends, never ends
At a Mexican Bar Mitzvah
For seven hundred years
The selfish pray
You're gonna drive right by
Tellin' me lies
And they're askin' me lies
Tellin' you questions
Askin' me lies
Happy birthday
Whosever birthday it is today
All the sex spit in it
Gone down on this fight
Tellin' you questions
Askin' me lies
They're telling you questions
And they're asking me lies
Telling you questions
And they're asking me lies
Askin' me lies
Lies
Lies...Embed
