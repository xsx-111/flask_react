2nd Foot Stomp LyricsCome and wind your belly
Come and wind it for me
Oh my Mother Anna knew
Oh my Mother Anna knew
If all the piggies don't don't whine
Then you keep it here with mine
Doko won the magic prize
Taken from Mother, a song song for Ella
Taken from Mother, a song song aglow
Cheeky boy sits on the side side forever
Cheeky boy who snuffles in the snow
Come and whip up for one, whip up for two
Oh our Mother Anna knew
Oh my Mother Anna knew
If all the doggies don't don't pine
Then you keep it here with mine
Doko won the magic prize
Taken from Mother, a song song for Ella
Taken from Mother, a song song aglow
Cheeky boy sits on the side side forever
All the guns, guns were never once Arthur's no
Come and veto the rose, veto for me
Oh my Mother Anna knew
If all the doggie don't don't pine
Then you keep them undermined
Keep them undermined
Doko won the magic prize
Doko watched the orphan's prideEmbed
