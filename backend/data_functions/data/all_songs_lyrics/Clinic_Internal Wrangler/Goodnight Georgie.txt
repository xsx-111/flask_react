Goodnight Georgie LyricsGoodnight Georgie, goodnight Grace
You know the sandman's on his way
Beating a path down the alleyway
Beginning to laugh in his favourite place
Here he comes as you're dreaming
Dreaming for us, darling
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight queen
Now you know what can come from dreams
All that you ask for comes from dreams
All that you ask for comes for free
Shh, now hush, as you're dreaming
Dreaming for us, darling
Come on my liege just roll him over
Come on the lip only makes him bolder
Now we know what's good for us darling
Oh my darling, shall we dance?
So now hush, as you're dreaming
Dreaming for us, darling
Come on my liege just roll him over
Come on the lip only makes him bolder
Come in and slit him, I've got tokens
Now we know what's good for us darling
Oh my darling, shall we dance?
Goodnight Georgie, goodnight queen
Now you know what can come from dreams
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnightEmbed
