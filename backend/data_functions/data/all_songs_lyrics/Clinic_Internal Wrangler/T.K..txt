T.K. LyricsUp a hill and down a slope
We're up a hill and down
Up a hill and faster so
We're up a hill and down
Singing me, mine does you no harm
Blixen and Saint Anna on the snows
Got to get and get the main glows
Marvo Marvo Marvo don't be gauche
Can the can and can of Mother knows
Up a hill and down a slope
We're up a hill and down
Up a hill and faster so
We're up a hill and downS
Inging me, mine does you no harm
Blixen and Saint Anna on the snows
Got to get and get the main glows
Marvo Marvo Marvo
Can the can and can of Mother knows
Faster, faster, faster, low
We're faster, faster, faster lowEmbed
