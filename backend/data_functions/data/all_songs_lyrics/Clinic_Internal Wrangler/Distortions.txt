Distortions LyricsI'd like to know completely
What others so discreetly
Talk about when they leave me â€”
Not that I notice when they're gone
It's eerie and so scary:
I don't know who to marry
Your sister came to bait me
Oh, your sister came to bait me
But I love it when you blink your eyes
Oh I, I want to know my body
I want this out, not in me
I want to know no secrets showed
I leave, oh I leave cured
It saved me once too often
You'd never know how often
I've pictured you in coffins:
My baby in a coffin
But I love it when you blink your eyes
Oh I, I want to know my body
I want this out, not in me
I want no other leakage
I want to know no secrets yet
I leave, oh I leave, now I leave cured
