The Second Line LyricsBeel embark embark another one
Bell embark embark a low
Got it to get it and get it over
Got it to get it and get it or low
Take it take it your mother knows
Se da ra come and come and come
Dig e dig e me no me no
Dig e gig e me no me no
Western highs and buys another
Western highs and buys a low
Got it to get it and get it over
Got it to get it and get it a low
Take it take it your mother knows
Se da ra come and come and come
Dig e gig e me no me no
Dig e dig e me no me no
Beel embark embark another one
Bell embark embark a low
Got it to get it and get it over
Got it to get it and get it or low
Take it take it your mother knows
Se da ra come and come and come
Dig-e dig-e menno menno, oh IDig-e dig-e menno menno, oh IEmbed
