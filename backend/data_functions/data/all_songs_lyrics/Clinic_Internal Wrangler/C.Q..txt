C.Q. LyricsC.Q. in unison, C.Q. in unison
I hate the G.L.U
I hate the Y.M.O
C.Q. made Europe sick, C.Q. made Europe sick
And we want no, no more fascist chic
No, no, no more fascist chic
C.Q. was never one to spit
Do do do for the reindeers
Do do do to please
Do do do this for me
C.Q. was always bold
C.Q. was never told
Baby they let you go
Baby they kill the old
Baby your supper's cold
C.Q. was never one to
C.Q. was never one to scold
C.Q. in union
C.Q. in unionEmbed
