2/4 LyricsCome my Lucien come and gloat
All our boys are still in tow
Hack, hack, hacking off the nose
Went and pissed on all the show
You're pollution and I know
Your pollution was a joke
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
Become one pretty fickle son
Plastic grasper's at the punch
Mummy money don't you blush
Hack, hack, hack who'd ever thought
Went and pissed on all the bore
You're pollution and I know
Your pollution was a joke
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
Each dilution wasn't slow as the
Chunks and chunks went cold
Mystic Lisper's in the pink
Ah the money don't you blink
Hack, hack, hack who'd ever think
Went and pissed on all the stink
You're pollution and I know
You're pollution and I know
Your pollution was a joke
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
You couldn't blow, blow for your loaf
You couldn't blow or be toldEmbed
