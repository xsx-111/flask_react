Sick City LyricsOoh she said, "The crowd just loved you
My name's Angel and I'm sixteen
I really love your band and your funny accent
Sure would like a cruise in your limousine."
Then she said, "How about a rubdown?
You're so cute and I'm so mean
The way you hold your guitar really gets me
I can show you tricks that you ain't never seen."
Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City
"Hey man, how's about a handout
All you dudes just loaded down
Just a little sugar man, makes me sweeter
I like to sit at home and watch the world go 'round."
Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight
Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City
Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight
Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh oh, Sick City
Sick City
