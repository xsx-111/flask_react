Jeanette LyricsAll set luncheonette
Kitchenette to let
I bet to get hamburgerette again
We met in a launderette and kissed beneath the air jet
No threat no sweat
Another one in the back of the net
When I met Jeanette
Substitute Ronette
She said "Will you remember?"
Said I could never forget her
Au naturalette
Her mom's a millionette
So we shared one last cigarette and swapped false addresses
Jeanette
Jeanette
Dangerous
She's like damp dynamite
Oh boy, enjoy, have a nice night
Won't you promise to write me whenever you can
Make sure that you warn me if you're coming to Birmingham
I get Jeanette
Substitute Ronette
She said "Will you remember?"
Said I could never forget her
Jeanette
You know know know I'll never forget you
Touching your skin has proved one thing
That love's still exciting
We're getting there
We're nearly there
Just one final fling
Pushing into a new love steady deep and strong
Steady on
You know we shouldn't talk like this
I met Jeanette
Substitute Ronette
She said "Will you remember?"
Said "I could never forget you."
Au naturalette
Her mom's a millionette
So we shared one last cigarette and swapped false addresses
Jeanette
You know know know I'll never forget you
Jeanette
You know know know I'll never forget you
Shared one last cigarette and swapped false addresses
Jeanette
You know know know I'll never forget you
Jeanette
You know know know I'll never forget youEmbed
