Ackee 1-2-3 LyricsCross your fingers, say you're on high
Pretend you're in debt and see what life brings
But all of this taking things as they come
Tends to make you forget to put anything in
The longer you dwell, the more it's like hell
You sit by the well just making a wish
It would be a shame to take too much blame
Look, we're all the same
It's only a game
Ackee 1 2 3
Ackee 1 2 1 2 3
Did I just catch you laughing?
Ackee 1 2 3
Ackee 1 2 1 2 3
Forward, where the knocks are hardest
Some to failure, some to fame
Never mind the cheers or hooting
Keep your head and play the game
Try to keep your feet on the ground
Without getting them stuck in the mud
You will soon be over the moon or twice as hot as the sun
Ackee 1 2 3
Ackee 1 2 1 2 3
Did I just catch you laughing?
Ackee 1 2 3
Ackee ackee ackee 1 2 3
Ackee 1 2 1 2 3
Ackee ackee 1 2 3
Cross your fingers, say you're on high
Pretend you're in debt and see what life brings
But all of this taking things as they come
Tends to make you forget to put anything in
The longer you dwell, the more it's like hell
You sit by the well just making a wish
To make it plain, I'll sing it again
We're all the same
It's only a game
Ackee 1 2 3
Ackee 1 2 1 2 3
Did I just catch you laughing?
Ackee 1 2 3
Ackee ackee ackee 1 2 3
Ackee 1 2 1 2 3
Someone just smiled for no special reason
It looks like the smile's come back into season
It's easy
Doesn't have to be a nice day
Just the only one you've got
And it's coming, ready or not
