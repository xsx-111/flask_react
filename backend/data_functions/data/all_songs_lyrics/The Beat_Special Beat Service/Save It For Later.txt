Save It For Later LyricsTwo dozen other dirty lovers
Must be a sucker for it
Cry, cry but I don't need my mother
Just hold my hand while I come to a decision on it
Sooner or later
Your legs give way, you hit the ground
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down
Sooner or later
You'll hit the deck, you'll get found out
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down, you let me down
Black air and seven seas all rotten through
But what can you do?
I don't know how I'm meant to act with all of you lot
Sometimes I don't try
I just now now now now now now now now now now now
Now now now now now now now now now now now
Sooner or later
Your legs give way, you hit the ground
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down
Sooner or later
You'll hit the deck, you'll get found out
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down, you let me down
You runaway, runaway and let me down
Two dozen other stupid reasons
Why we should suffer for this
Don't bother trying to explain them
Just hold my hand while I come to a decision on it
Sooner or later
Your legs give way, you hit the ground
Save it for later
Don't run away and let me down
Sooner or later
You'll hit the deck you'll get found out
Save it for later
Don't runaway and let me down, you let me down
You run away, run away, run away, run away, run away, run away
And let me downEmbed
