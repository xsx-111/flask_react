End Of The Party LyricsShe said to leave it till the end of the party
Do it now, you know there's never a next time
How come the feeling that it's only just started
Pull back your cover, I could love you for all time
But do it now, you know there's never a next time
The bees are busy
Now there's gold on the hill
The branches waving
But our hearts are wrapped up inside
And then you leave me, so I start missing you a lot
No argument oh do I love you or not
No argument, you have all the love that I see as mine
Pull back your cover, I could love you for all time
But do it now you know there's never a next time
She said to leave it till the end of the party
How come the feeling that it's always just starting
The bees are busy
Now there's gold on the hill
The branches waving
But our hearts are wrapped up inside Soon as you leave me then I start
Missing you a lot
No argument oh do I love you, I love you or not
Oh treat him like a baby please
All night
Oh treat him like a baby please
All night
Strength is not the same as anger
Put the taste back into hunger
Searching the box?
Looking for what?
I love you, I love you or not?
Strength is not the same as anger
Put the taste back into hunger
Searching the box?
Looking for what?
Pushing the gear back into top?
Put the first back into class
Lose your bottle break the glass
You'll wind up high and dry with just this slow cold comfort
Oh treat him like a baby please
All night
Love you or not?
Oh treat him like a baby pleaseEmbed
