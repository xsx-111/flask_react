Sole Salvation LyricsOf course I want there to be an us
I've always wanted that
But how
And if giving time and patience
Trying hard to understand
We never feel the power of our own hands
Sense the danger late
And only vaguely ever grasp the means of our sole salvation?
What then?
Do it right, do it now!
Here there, everywhere
Shouting out "I'm mad as hell"
He pushes his legs against the bed
And feels the triumph flooding through his head
He could conquer
He could win
Now that dying only means you're not in next week's programme
Stop being a baby
Will you stop, will stop it
Won't you stop play-acting little man?
Just how long till you drop it
Will it be this year, next year, sometime, never?
Stop, when you feel like saying "Have a heart but don't take mine"
There's a new dance "The Tolerence,"
And it just might be your sole salvation
Sole salvation
Sole salvation
Sole salvation
Skabadoo ooh yeah
Yeah skabaday
Make a cross
Make amends
Set the record straight
We've never said the only things we should have ever
Bothered saying
Lets write out a list of things we need
Lets strike a brand new deal
That's strong enough for any man
But has a woman's understanding in it
And then finish!
Just stop, when you feel like saying "Have a heart, but don't take mine"
Try a new dance "The Tolerence,"
It just might be our sole salvation
Sole salvation sole salvation sole salvation
Sole salvation
Sole salvation?
Oooh yeah yeah
Skab-a-doo, skab-a-day
