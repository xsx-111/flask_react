Sorry LyricsTry to live but it's more like worry
Each time I try to speak it does sound like "sorry"
Setting up races you've gotta keep winning
Imaginary races
You jump until you're bleeding and you're needing
And you're wanting it so badly timed your sighing
All lying
And she's trusting you completely stupid
"Sorry"
Feeling attack put up defences
Nothing you've ever said made much sense
Words are just another violence
Nothing rings as true as silence
Dream I can fly in desperation
Sorry
Must have mixed up remorse with anticipation
Sorry
Each time I try to break this hurry
Sorry
Start off apologizing for saying sorry
Leaving
Me pleading
All through wanting it so badly timed my sighing
All lying
And you trusted me completely foolish
Sounds like "sorry"
It sounds like "sorry"
It always sounds like "sorry."Embed
