I Confess LyricsJust out of spite
I confess I've ruined three lives
Now don't sleep so tight
Because I didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine
Night after night time time after time
Done too much of both types of w(h)ining
Still wasn't right fight after fight
Till "Get out of my life get away from me get away from that gun"
"No it's not a joke it's cards on the table time
Yes I could have phoned
I could have spoke
But how to break the news without beaking your heart
Being dead don't hurt
No only dieing
Cards on the table time
Sometimes it's right to say goodnight."
Always searching for paradise
I'll admit that I'm good as blind
Darling I confess yes I've ruined three lives
And didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine
I confess
Our love seems like a punishment
And I confess
If it's all the same to you I'll stay indifferent
I confess I confess I confess
I confess I confess I confess
No-one wins and there's no denying
Don't pretend like you don't know why
Just a little word here a little push there Darling
I confess look I confess that I don't really care
I confess I confess I confess
Out like a light
Another boy who's given up trying
Blinded by fright
He scream my life's not open
Please get out
I know I'm shouting
I like to shout
It's not a joke it's cards on the table time
It's not a joke it's cards on the table time
I could have phoned
I could have spoke
But how to break the news without beaking your heart
Being dead don't hurt
No only dieing
Cards on the table time
Sometimes it's right to say goodnight."
Always searching for paradise
I'll admit that I'm good as blind
Darling I confess yes I've ruined three lives
And didn't care till I found out that one of them was mine
I confess
I deserve some type of punishment
I confess
If it's all the same to you I'll stay indifferent
I confess I confess I confess
I confess I confess I confess
I confess I confess I confess
I confess I confess I confess
I confess I confess I confessEmbed
