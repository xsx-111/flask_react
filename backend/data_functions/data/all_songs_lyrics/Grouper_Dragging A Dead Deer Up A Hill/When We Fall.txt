When We Fall LyricsWhen we fall
We fall, fall, fall down
Into the water
Where it's harder to see
And the weight of the water
Pushes onto the deep
And remember that
Some things do sink
When we follow
The rush in the rain
Drawn into oceans
Where it's hot
With the weight of the water
We lose into the storm
And when we fall
Just move to the deepEmbed
