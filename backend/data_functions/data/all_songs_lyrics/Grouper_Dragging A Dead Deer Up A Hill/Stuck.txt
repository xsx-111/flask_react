Stuck LyricsStuck in a bad home
I've been good but
Now I'm stuck in a sad song
We were stuck in a sad song
I've been good but
I'm stuck in a sad song
Stuck in a bad home
Stuck in a sad song
Stuck in a sad song
We were stuck in a sad song
I've been good but
I'm stuck in a sad song
Water is pouring
Stuck
Stuck in a bad...
Stuck
Stuck in a bad...
Stuck
Stuck in a sad song
We were stuck in a sad home
We were stuck in a sad home
I don't want to be...
Stuck in a bad home
I don't want to be...
Stuck in a sad homeEmbed
