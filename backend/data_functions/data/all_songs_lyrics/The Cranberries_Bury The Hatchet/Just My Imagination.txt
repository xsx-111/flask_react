Just My Imagination Lyrics
There was a game we used to play
We would hit the town on Friday night
Stay in bed until Sunday
We used to be so free
We were livin' for the love we had
Livin' not for reality

Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was

That was a time I used to pray
I have always kept my faith in love
It's the greatest thing from the man above
The game I used to play
I've always put my cards upon the table
Never be said that I'd be unstable

Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination (My imagination)
Just my imagination, it was
There is a game I like to play
I like to hit the town on Friday night
And stay in bed until Sunday
We'll always be this free
We will be livin' for the love we have
Livin' not for reality

It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination (My imagination)
It's not my imagination, it was
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination (My imagination)
Not my imagination, it was

Not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my
Not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my (My imagination)
Not my, not my, not my
Laa, la-la-la, laa, la-la-la-laa
Laa, la-la-la, laa, la-la-la-laa
My imagination, my imagination
My imagination, my imagination (Not my imagination, not my imagination)
My imagination, my imagination (Not my imagination)3Embed
