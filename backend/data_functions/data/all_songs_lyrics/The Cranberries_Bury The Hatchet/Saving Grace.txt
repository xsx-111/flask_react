Saving Grace LyricsIt could happen here today
It could happen here today
And I can't wait to see your face
No I can't wait to see your face
Can you hold on
While I take hold of myself?
Can you hold on
While I take hold of myself?
You're the little thing, my saving grace
You're just a little thing, my saving grace
It could happen here today
It could happen here today
You are my saving grace
You are my saving grace
Will you be strong
While I take hold of myself?
Will you be strong
While I take hold of myself?
You're the little thing, my saving grace
You're just a little thing, my saving grace
It could happen here today
It could happen here today
You are my saving grace
You are my saving graceEmbed
