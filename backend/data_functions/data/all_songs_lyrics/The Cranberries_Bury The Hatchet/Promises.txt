Promises Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh

You'd better believe I'm comin'
You'd better believe what I say
You'd better hold on to your promises
Because you bet, you'll get what you deserve
She's going to leave him over
She's gonna take her love away
So much for your eternal vows
Well, it does not matter anyway

Why can't you stay here awhile?
Stay here awhile, stay with me

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do

What of all the things that you taught me?
What of all the things that you'd say?
What of all your prophetic preaching?
You're just throwing it all away
Maybe we should burn the house down
Have ourselves another fight
Leave the cobwebs in the closet
'Cause tearing them out is just not right

Why can't you stay here awhile?
Stay here awhile, stay with me, oh-oh

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke
Oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we made (Promises we made)
All the meaningless and empty words
I prayed, prayed, prayed
Oh-whoa-oh, all the promises we broke (Promises we broke)
All the meaningless and empty words
I spoke, spoke, spoke

Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh, oh-eh
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do2Embed
