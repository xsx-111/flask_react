Delilah Lyrics
Shout, shout, shout Delilah
Shout, shout, shout at the top of your lungs
Shout, shout, shout Delilah
Shout, shout, shout until the kingdom comes
Stay away from me
Just stay away from my house
Stay away from me
Just stay away or I'll sort you out
Shout, shout, shout Delilah
Shout, shout, shout 'til the kingdom comes

Treading on my dreams
Stop treading on my dreams
Stop treading on my dream
Ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea...
Out, out, out Delilah
Out, out, out, stay out of my place
Out, out, out, Delilah
Out, out, out, I'll rearrange your face

He'll never really be
He'll never be your lover
He'll never really be
He'll never be your lover
So stay away from me
Just stay away from my house
Stay away from me
Just stay away or I'll sort you out
Shout, shout, shout Delilah
Shout, shout, shout, 'til the kingdom comes
Treading on my dreams
Stop treading on my dreams
Stop treading on my dreams
Ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea, ea-ea...

Delilah, Delilah, Delilah
Push me, push me
Delilah, Delilah, Delilah
Push me, push me
Delilah, Delilah, Delilah
Push me, push me
Delilah, Delilah, Delilah
Push me, push me, push me
Push me, push me, push me
Push me, push me, push me
Push me, push me, push me
Push me, push me, push me
Push me, push me, push me1Embed
