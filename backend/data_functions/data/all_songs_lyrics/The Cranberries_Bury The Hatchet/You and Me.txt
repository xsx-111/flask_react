You and Me LyricsI'm not going out tonight
'cause I don't want to go
I am staying at home tonight
'cause I don't want to know
You revealed a world to me
And I would never be
Dwelling in such happiness
Your gift of purity
Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh
Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh
Aaah, you and me
It will always be
You and me
Forever be
Eternally
It will always be
You and me
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
I don't pay attention
To the ones who never cared
Find your own direction
'cause there's sweetness in the air
You will be the world to me
And I will always be
Dwelling in this happiness
Your gift of purity
Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh
Eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh, eh-ee-oh
Aaah, you and me
It will always be
You and me
Forever be
Eternally
It will always be
You and me
Always be
You and me
Forever be
Eternally
It will always be
You and me
Forever be
Eternally
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor, TaylorEmbed
