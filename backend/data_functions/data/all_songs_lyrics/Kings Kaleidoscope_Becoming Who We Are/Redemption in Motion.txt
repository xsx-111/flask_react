Redemption in Motion LyricsYou're with me always
I won't be afraid
You're with me always
You're with me always
You died and rose
And set the world ablaze
Amazing grace, redemption in motion
And I will see You when I fly away
To the gates of heaven where I'll see Your face
Holy Jehovah, Alpha Omega
You died and rose and set redemption in motion
Holy Jehovah, Alpha Omega
You died and rose and set redemption in motionEmbed
