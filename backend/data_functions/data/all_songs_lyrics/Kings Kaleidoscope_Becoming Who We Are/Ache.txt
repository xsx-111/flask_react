Ache Lyrics
And I know it's alright
You are near every night
Always in my sight
Always in my mind
In the fear in the fight
In the pain in the plight
There's no hold on my life
In the dark there is light
When I feel so suppressed
All the things in my chest
And the fear doesn't rest
Oh You protect
'Cause you see and you ache
And your heart doesn't wait
You're already there

Yes I've seen you
I've seen you
I've seen you
I've seen you
I've seen you
I've seen you
I've seen you
I'll see you again
I'll see you again
I'll see you againEmbed
