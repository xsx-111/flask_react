I Know Lyrics
Every day at dusk I chase the sunset, sunset
Looking for a glimpse of Heaven's skies
I've been given a taste for something
That nothing in this world can satisfy
But I know that a time is coming
When I will be in glorious delight

I know I will run through Heaven's brilliant streets of gold
Shouting "Hallelujah, Christ alone!"
I know I will dance and sing and bow before the throne
This I know
Oh-Oh

Every day at dusk I chase the sunset, sunset
Looking for a hint of Heaven's light
I've been given a taste for something
That nothing in this world can satisfy
But I know that a time is coming
When I will be in glorious delight

I know I will run through Heaven's brilliant streets of gold
Shouting "Hallelujah, Christ alone!"
I know I will dance and sing and bow before the throne
This I know
Oh-Oh
This I know
I know I will run through Heaven's brilliant streets of gold
Shouting "Hallelujah, Christ alone!"
I know I will dance and sing and bow before the throne
This I know
Oh-Oh
This I know
This I know
This I knowEmbed
