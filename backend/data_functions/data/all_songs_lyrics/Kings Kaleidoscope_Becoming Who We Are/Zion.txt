Zion Lyrics
Maybe someday we’ll meet
Under the stars, under the stars
Healed and home free, complete
That’s where we’ll start, that’s where we’ll start

Zion, I’m coming soon
To where you are
‘Til then my love’s with you
Though worlds apart

This will take much longer
Than I’ve planned, than I've planned
But I will wait to see you
And hold your hands, hold your hands

Zion, I’m coming soon
To where you are
‘Til then my love’s with you
Though worlds apart

Waiting each day, God will
Comfort my soul, comfort my soul
You are home now, healthy
Safe in His fold, safe in His fold
Zion, I’m coming soon
To where you are
‘Til then my love’s with you
Though worlds apart

Beyond this storm’s a brilliant sky of stars
I’ll follow you, I'll follow youEmbed
