Fix My Eyes Lyrics
When my heart is weary, when my soul is weak
When it seems I can't traverse the trail before me
I survey the glory of Your agony
And I find the will to fight for what's before me
Cause you ran the race enduring for Your glory

I fix my eyes on You
The Founder and the Finisher of our faith
I fix my eyes on You
The solace in Your suffering is my strength

As I fight to follow, You're my righteous guide
And You train me to delight in all that's holy
Heal my broken body, cure my crooked stride
Throw off every weight and sin that clings so closely
I will run the race enduring for Your glory

I fix my eyes on You
The Founder and the Finisher of our faith
I fix my eyes on You
The solace in Your suffering is my strength
You help me breathe, You're the only life I need
You died for me, You're the only life I need
You help me breathe, You're the only life I need
You died for me, You're the only life I needEmbed
