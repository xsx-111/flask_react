Defender LyricsA torrent of destruction hid
My darkened soul from rescuing
I cried to God for help, He heard my voice
The tainted Earth, it rocked and reeled
The heavens bowed, the mountains kneeled
The thunderous voice of God, my covering
I will not be afraid
For my hope is in His name
Who is a rock but our God?
Who's blood has sealed our freedom?
Jesus, our Savior, Defender, Redeemer
He brought me to a safer place
Equipped my hands and feet with strength
So I advance with confidence in Christ
His precious truth delivers me
From lies that wage a war with me
Your victory is mine for all my days
I will not be afraid
For my hope is in His name
Who is a rock but our God?
Who's blood has sealed our freedom?
Jesus, our Savior, Defender, Redeemer
You kneel down to raise me up
You, my Lord
You, my God
You rescue me with reckless love
Oh, my Lord
Oh, my God
Who is a rock but our God?
Who's blood has sealed our freedom?
Jesus, our Savior, Defender, Redeemer
Jesus, our Savior, Defender, RedeemerEmbed
