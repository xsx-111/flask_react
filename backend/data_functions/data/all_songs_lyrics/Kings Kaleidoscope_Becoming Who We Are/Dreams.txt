Dreams Lyrics
Once in while, I close my eyes
Drifting to sleep, You come alive
My heart begins to sing in tune
And suddenly all I see is You

In sunlight, in moonbeams
In forests, in gold streams
The colors of Your world
Echo in my dreams

And I see You, I see You
I know You, I feel You
You're my joy, my life
My love, my light

In the moment
It's clear
And I know
Yes, I know
That I'm loved, I'm loved
I'm loved, I'm loved!
I see You
In sunlight, in moonbeams
In forests, in gold streams
The colors of Your world
Echo in my dreams
Echo in my dreams

In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreamsEmbed
