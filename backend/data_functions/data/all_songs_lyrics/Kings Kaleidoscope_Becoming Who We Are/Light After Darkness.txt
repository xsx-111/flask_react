Light After Darkness Lyrics
Light after darkness, gain after loss
Strength after weakness, crown after cross
Sweet after bitter, hope after fears
Home after wandering, praise after tears
Sheaves after sowing, sun after rain
Sight after mystery, peace after pain
Joy after sorrow, calm after blast
Rest after weariness, sweet rest at last

Give me the hope for tomorrow
Give me the strength for today
You are the promise of peace
On my pathway to faith
Give me the hope for tomorrow
Give me the strength for today
You are the promise of peace
On my pathway to faith

Near after distant, gleam after gloom
Love after loneliness, life after tomb
After the agony, rapture of bliss
Glory awaits beyond the abyss...
Give me the hope for tomorrow
Give me the strength for today
You are the promise of peace
On my pathway to faith
Give me the hope for tomorrow
Give me the strength for today
You are the promise of peace
On my pathway to faith

Give me the hope for tomorrow
Give me the strength for today
You are the promise of peace
On my pathway to faith
Give me the hope for tomorrow
Give me the strength for today
You are the promise of peace
On my pathway to faith

(All better, all better, better)
(All better, all better, better)
(All better, all better, better)
(All better, all better, better)Embed
