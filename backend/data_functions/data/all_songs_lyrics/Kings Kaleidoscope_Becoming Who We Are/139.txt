139 Lyrics
You heard my first heartbeat before I could breathe
Before my first cry You knew me
You knit me together when I was conceived
When I was designed You knew me

You know what I wonder before I can speak
Before my first thoughts You know me
You see what I'm dreaming when I go to sleep
When I'm waking up You know me

I could run away or hide beneath the sea
You'd still hear my prayers
I could climb the peaks or dive beyond the deep
You are always there

You crafted the heavens and care for my soul
In all of Your ways You're holy
When I'm lost in darkness and far from my home
Your hand guides my way and holds me

I could run away or hide beneath the sea
You'd still hear my prayers
I could climb the peaks or die beyond the deep
Oh, my God, You are there
You are the God who knows and loves me
The God of David, the Rock of Ages
You are the King who dwells above me
The King of Zion, the Mighty Lion
You are the God who knows and loves me
The God of David, the Rock of Ages
You are the King who dwells above me
The King of Zion, the Mighty Lion

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, ohEmbed
