Silver Snail Lyrics
On my way back to one
Half asleep with a loaded gun
In a room with a light bulb sun

Ain't no place for to hide
At an orgy of grooms and brides
At the scene of the suicides

Follow me
See my silver trails
Blessed be
When is a snake a tail?
I am the silver snail

On my way back to one
On my way back to seventh son
Then I count to a million

He will awake from his dreams
Find his way in these honey beams
Find a way to the cream of creams
Silver spoons
For my silver snails
Black harpoons
For the killer whales
I am the silver snail
