Magdalena Lyrics
I needed something to eat
I took a walk down the street
I came to 318
Saw my sweet Magdalene

Magdalena, you're the meanest, oh
Magdalena, you're the meanest, oh
Magdalena, sweet Magdalene

I went down deep in her hive
One year just turned into five
Night came and then it was gone
How did you get so strong

Magdalena, just between us, oh
You're the meanest, you're the meanest, oh
Magdalena, how'd you get so strong

Magdalena, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena
And then we started to drag
Me and my Maggie-mag-mag
I begged her please no no no
She said she got to go go go go go go

Magdalena, just between us, oh
You're the meanest, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena, you're the meanest, oh
Magdalena, Magdalena, oh
Magdalena, MagdalenaEmbed
