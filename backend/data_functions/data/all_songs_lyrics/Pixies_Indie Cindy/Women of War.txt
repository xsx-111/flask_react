Women of War LyricsLeanne, I want you
And your soft army green
Your natural legs
And your militant cuisine
I know you are at war
But if you need some love
Be my soldier lover
And I'll be your peaceful dove
Now here comes the ammo
He sound so machismo
So be my soldier lover
And I'll be your peaceful dove
Why do you need him?
He'll give you conditions
Why do you want him?
He'll take your freedom
Now you do his cooking
With all his requirements
But I would do your cooking
While you're fighting on the fronts
We'll sleep on a beach
And we'll see the stars above
So be my soldier lover
And I'll be your peaceful dove
You know women of war (women of war)
They need a little more (a little bit more)
So be my soldier lover
And I'll be your peaceful dove
You know women of war (women of war)
They need a little more (a little bit more)
So be my soldier lover
And I'll be your peaceful dove

You know women of war (women of war)
They need a little more (a little bit more)
So be my soldier lover
And I'll be your peaceful dove
You know women of war (women of war)
They need a little more (a little bit more)
So be my soldier lover
And I'll be your peaceful dove1Embed
