Another Toe in the Ocean Lyrics
I have a drink, I start to sink
I put my toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean

Down on the shelf, an elf I saw
I took his picture, he was waving
I passed again and now they're gone
I think my picture is worth saving

No more waiting for a new day
You've got to swim sometimes

I'll be here for the rest of my life
Up in the land of green
Making love in the cool, black sand
Thinking where I've been
Oohoohooh, I put my toe in the ocean
Another toe in the ocean

Merry making with the fairies
Going down to the onion patch
To you and me, to shining seas
I see the lights of Edward Thatch
No more waiting for a new day
You've got to swim sometimes

I'll be here for the rest of my life
Up in the land of green
Making love in the cool, black sand
Thinking where I've been
Oohoohooh, I put my toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean

I have a drink, I start to sink
I put my toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the ocean
I have a drink, I start to sink
Another toe in the oceanEmbed
