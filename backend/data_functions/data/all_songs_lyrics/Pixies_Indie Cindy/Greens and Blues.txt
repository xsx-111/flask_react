Greens and Blues Lyrics
I'm not together, and you know it's true
My bits all wander in the trees
And if I ever seem a little strange
Would you excuse me please?

I said I'm human, but you know I lied
I'm only visiting this shore
I'll soon be leaving in the outbound tide
I pray again we will meet

I’m wasting your time, just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind
Slip into the greens and blues

I said I'm human, but you know I lied
I'm only visiting this shore
I'll soon be leaving in the outbound tide
I pray again we will meet

I’m wasting your time, just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind
Slip into the greens and blues
Greens and blues
Greens and blues
Greens and blues
Greens and blues

I’m wasting your time, just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind
Slip into the greens and blues
I’m wasting your time, just talking to you
Maybe best you go on home
I'll leave you alone, fade from your mind
Slip into the greens and blues
