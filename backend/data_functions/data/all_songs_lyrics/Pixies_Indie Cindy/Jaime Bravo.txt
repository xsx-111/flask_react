Jaime Bravo Lyrics
Oh my, look at you go by
It's so nice just to see you

Oh oooh-oooh

It feels right here in the sunlight
And this ride is almost through

Oh oooh-oooh
Oh oooh-oooh

So goodbye and goodnight
I can't hide holding a bull's eye
A bullfighter and his crew


It's so nice here in the sunlight
And this ride is almost through
Oh oooh-oooh
Oh oooh-oooh

So goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye

La trapezista camina por la cuerda floja
Desde el D. F. y todo el mundo
Y ultimo a Zacatecas
So nice here in the sunlight
A bullfighter and his crew

Oh oooh-oooh
Oh oooh-oooh

So goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye and goodnight
Goodbye and goodnight
GoodbyeEmbed
