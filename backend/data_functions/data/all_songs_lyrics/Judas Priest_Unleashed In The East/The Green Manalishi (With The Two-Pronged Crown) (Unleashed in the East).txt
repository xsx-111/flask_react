The Green Manalishi (With The Two-Pronged Crown) (Unleashed in the East) LyricsNow when the day goes to sleep
And the full moon looks
And the night is so black
That the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around
Making me do things I don't want to do
I can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneaking around
Trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams
Making me see things I don't want to see
'Cause you're the Green Manalishi
With the two-pronged crown
All night, dragging us up
Or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love
Then slip away, leaving me here
Trying to keep from following youEmbed
