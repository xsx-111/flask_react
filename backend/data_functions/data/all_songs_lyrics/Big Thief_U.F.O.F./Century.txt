Century Lyrics
Dogs eyes in the headlights of the driveway
Cool autumn rain
Bugs died on your windshield on the freeway
Wonder if you'll be the same
Centuries flower

And we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power

Moth flies in the window of the kitchen
You hang up your coat
Cold lips and gold eyes listen
There's something that I want you to know
Turn on the shower

'Cause we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
No resolution, no circling dove
Still caught in the jaw of confusion
Don't know what I'd do for love
But stay another hour

'Cause we have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power
We have the same power1Embed
