Cattails Lyrics
Caroline, Caroline
I never could leave you to struggle
Hold the line, hold the line
I’ll be there on the double
In time, in time
Everyone does see trouble

And you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

Violet’s eyes, Violet plays
Going back home to the Great Lakes
Where the cattail sways
With the lonesome loon
Riding that train in late June

With the windows wide by my side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by my side

And the clusters fell like an empty bell
Meteor shower at the motel
Where the empty space is a saving grace
Making good time and doing well
Still the question sings like Saturn’s rings
Maybe she knows and she won’t tell
But you don’t need to know why when you cry
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry

And I find you there in your country flair
Middle of the river in a lawn chair
With your wrinkled hands and your silver hair
Leaving here soon and you know where
To where the cattail sways with the lonesome loon
You’ll be riding that train in late June

With the windows wide by your side
With the windows wide
With the windows wide by your side
You don’t need to know why
You don’t need to know why when you cry3Embed
