Strange Lyrics
Doesn't it seem strange
Searching for a hidden page
The fairy’s cage
Coming of true age
Leave the costume on the stage
The silkworm's rage
Iridescent thread, beautiful and dead
Billions of worms were boiled to make the bed

Strange, see the luna moth cry
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes

Scatter and destroy
Every power you enjoy
To lay with the void
Twirling of the dime, splitting of the mind
Drawing constellations ’til the stars align

Strange, see the luna moth cry (Cry)
Lime green tears through the fruit bat's eyes (Eyes)

You have wings of gold
You will never grow old
And turquoise lungs
You have never been young
You have wings of gold
You will never grow old
And turquoise lungs
You have never been youngEmbed
