From LyricsNo one can be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
No one can be my woman, be my woman
Be my woman
One ear to the ground
One dog at my neck
One tongue to my tongue
Wanting to protect me from, from
No one can be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
Be my man, be my man
No one can be my woman, be my woman
Be my woman
One ear to the floor
My dog barking loud
Couldn't tell for sure
Where the screaming sound
Was coming from, from
One ear to your womb
Puppy on the floor
Babyâ€™s coming soon
Wonder if she'll know
Where she's come from, from
From, from
From, fromEmbed
