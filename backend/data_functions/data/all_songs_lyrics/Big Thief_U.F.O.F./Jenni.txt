Jenni Lyrics
Too hot to breathe
Too hot to breathe
Too hot to breathe

Jenni's in my room
Jenni’s in my room
Jenni's in my room

Her skin so bare
The fragrant air
Her vacant eye

Jenni's in my room
Jenni’s in my room
Jenni's in my room

The signal swarms
The portal forms
She calls me through

Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni's in my room
Jenni
Jenni's in my roomEmbed
