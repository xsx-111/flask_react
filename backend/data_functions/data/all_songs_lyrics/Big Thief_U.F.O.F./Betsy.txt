Betsy Lyrics
Driving through the night
Rings of crystal, crystal light
Every gulp of the warm suburb air
Betsy's auburn, auburn hair

Ooh, ooh

Drive into New York with me
How she keeps me calm
Street lights, boys and poison palms

Ooh, ooh

Drive into New York with me
Big lights in the city

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh1Embed
