Terminal Paradise Lyrics
Warm
So warm
Screaming in the field
As I was born
Worm
Will you return me
To the robin's beak?
I'll be a bird

Terminal
We both know
Let the rest of me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hour

Woman
Woman
Hold me in your heat
'Til I remember

Terminal
We both know
Let me rest, let me go
See my death become a trail
And the trail leads to a flower
I will blossom in your sail
Every dream and waking hourEmbed
