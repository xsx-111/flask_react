Open Desert Lyrics
Vacant angel, crimson light
Darkened eyelash, darkened eye
The white light of the living room
Leaking through the crack in the door
There was never need for more
Things we're meant to understand
Crawling closer to your hand

To the poison image
Brave surrender
Kiss the water

After all my teeth are gone
After all the blood is drawn
The white light of the waiting room
Leaking through the crack in the door

Through the poison image
Brave surrender
Kiss the water

Through the mirror, mountain view
She has one green, one eye blue
I can see her smiling through
The white light of the living room
Leaking through the crack in the door1Embed
