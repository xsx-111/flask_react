Please turn the pages for me
You seem so free
You know I'm barely, barely
Wrap me in silk
I want to drink your milk
You hold the key
You know I'm barely, barely
Parker Lake Beach
All of the sunnys swimming
I wanna see
To feel my body sinking, sinking
She gives me gills
Helps me forgive the pills
She makes me sing
She is both dreamer and dream
And dream, and dream, and dreamEmbed
