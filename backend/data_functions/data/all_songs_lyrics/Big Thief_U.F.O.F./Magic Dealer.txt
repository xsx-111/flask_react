Magic Dealer Lyrics
Starve, magic mirror
I thought the crumbs of your life wouldn't dry
It hurts to see clearer
Falling like needles, the passage of time

Would it hurt, would it hurt to be nearer?
Heaven is stitching across me
My chest is the crossing
The blood is parting all the time, but I don't mind

Carve magic dealer
Bring me the company I couldn't buy
As I go cleaner
Falling like needles, the passage of time

Would it help, would it help to go deeper?
I am the photograph in you
The photograph in you
Still as the moment we're lying in right nowEmbed
