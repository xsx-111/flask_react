The King Has Lost His Crown Lyrics
I believe your new girl turned you down
And they say she's pushing you around
How does it feel? I guess it hurts your pride
Tell me my friend, how many nights you cried

Disaster and disgrace - the king has lost his crown
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown

Was it hard to step down from your throne
And to know tonight you're all alone?
Oh, what a shame, you really want that girl
She doesn't care, still, you just dream of her

Disaster and disgrace - the king has lost his crown
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Disaster and disgrace - the word is all around
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Disaster and disgrace - the word is all around
Suddenly he's clumsy like a clown1Embed
