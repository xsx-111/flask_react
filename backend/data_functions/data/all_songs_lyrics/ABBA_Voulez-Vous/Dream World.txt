Dream World Lyrics
We're not the stars of a hollywood movie
So what's the use to pretend?
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy
You've gotta face it, my friend

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we've gotta make it together
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better

When you reach out
And you say to me, "How I love you, girl"
When I hold you
Baby can't you see? It's a real dream world

You had your hopes and your high expectations
Somehow it doesn't seem right
I'm getting fed up with your accusations
I'm not your angel in white

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better
When you reach out
And you say to me, "How I love you, girl"
When I hold you
Baby can't you see? It's a real dream world

Dream world, you've been living in a dream world
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dream world
Here I am, there you are, we gotta make it together
And we've made it so far, so it can only get better1Embed
