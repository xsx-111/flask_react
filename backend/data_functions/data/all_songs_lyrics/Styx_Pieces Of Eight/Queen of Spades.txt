Queen of Spades Lyrics
Day into night, she's with me
How sweet is her warm embrace
Safe in the scent of jasmine
So safe in her gold and lace

Mornings I find, she's left me
So cold, so alone, but aware
I try to escape, she finds me
Oh run, though I may, she's there
There, there, there, there

Luck is a lady whose smile
Is as cold as a stone
She'll bring you things
Many things you might never have known
But when your die is cast
She'll have the final laugh at you
She'll lock you in a duel
Where you come out the fool

Beware of the Queen of Spades!
Her black widow's curse might find you yet
Beware of a love that you will regret!
Her love means only your death

Day into night, she's with me
Turn of a card, she's there
The first time is free, you know
But from now on, pay me
Me, me, me, me
(Hahahahahaha! You lose!)

Beware of the Queen of Spades!
Her black widow's curse might find you yet
Beware of a love that you will regret!
Her love means only your death
Beware of the Queen of Spades!
Her black widow's curse might find you yet
Beware of a love that you will regret!
Her love means only your death
