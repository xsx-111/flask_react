Great White Hope LyricsWhen I was a young man
I had to kick and scratch and claw
Now it's like top gun in the old west
Everybody wants me to draw
If I had known it would be like this
I might have given it a second thought
But if someone had told me to give it up
It's a line that I wouldn't have bought
Look at me
I'm the great white hope
Can't you see
I'm up against the ropes
Don't you know
It's so hard to cope
When you feel
Like the great white hope
Look at me
I'm the great white hope
Can't you see
I'm up against the ropes
Don't you know
It's so hard to cope
When you feel
Like the great white hope
Now you've paid your money
You're sitting in your ringside seat
And I know that some of you out there
Might wanna see the champ get beat
If I had known it would be like this
I might have given it a second thought
But real life sure isn't like school
There's some lessons that just can't be taught
Look at me
I'm the great white hope
Can't you see
I'm up against the ropes
Don't you know
It's so hard to cope
When you feel
Like the great white hope
Look at me
I'm against the ropes
Look at me
So hard to cope
Look at me
Great white hope
Look at me
Up against the ropes
Look at meEmbed
