Sing for the Day Lyrics
Sing for the day
Sing for the moment
Sing for the time of your life
Come for an hour
Stay for a moment
Stay for the rest of your life

Hannah, you're with me in spirit wherever I go
To the ends of the earth and all points between high and low
Each night by the stage you appear as you are
The ever intangible child, ageless and timeless as Dorian Grey
Oh Hannah, I know that it's you, and you're leading me on

Hannah, you're my inspiration, my fountain of youth
And as your surrogate leader I'm bound in your search for the truth
And yes, how the truth rushes out, when it's become honestly clear
I see your anxious and curious eyes
But Hannah, I need you as much as you think you need me
Come to your window tonight, and we'll fly to your dreams

And we'll sing for the day
Sing for the moment
Sing for the time of your life
Come for an hour
Stay for a moment
Stay for the rest of your life
Sing for the day
Sing for the moment
Sing for the time of your life
Come for an hour
Stay for a moment
Stay for the rest of your life

Hannah, don't fail me, I need you like never before
Father Time's at my back, on my heels, behind every door
He says "Son, when the youth has but gone from your face
Will she let you grow older with grace?
Will she give you up for one younger than you?"
Oh Hannah, please tell me the things that he says are untrue
Hannah, I'm honestly hoping you'll always be there

And we'll sing for the day
Sing for the moment
Sing for the time of your life
Come for an hour
Stay for a moment
Stay for the rest of your life

Sing for the day
Sing for the moment
Sing for the time of your life
Come for an hour
Stay for a moment
Stay for the rest of your lifeEmbed
