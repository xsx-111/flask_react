Lords of the Ring LyricsAll hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the music in their story
All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the lands of ancient glory
In the year of the Lords
A message came from above
The Heavens opened with their mighty sound
That shook the people in the town
And so we came from everywhere
The young and old, the rich and poor
To hear the legend of the magic ring
And of the powers it could bring, they sing
"All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the music in their story"
"All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery it brings
May we someday wear its glory"
And now the message is clear
'Cause I became a Lord this year
And though the legend was pure fantasy
We still need the hope it brings, so let's sing
"All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To believe is a wondrous thing
May we always sing their glory"
"All hail to the Lords of the Ring
To the magic and mystery they bring
To the promise in their story"Embed
