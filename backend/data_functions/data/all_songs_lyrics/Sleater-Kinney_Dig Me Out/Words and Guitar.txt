Words and Guitar LyricsWords & guitar, I got it
Words & guitar, I want it
Way way too loud, I got it
Words & guitar
I want it all, I want it all, I want it
(can't take this away from me
Music is the air I breathe
Can't take this away from me)
Words & guitar
Take take the noise in my head
Take take the noise in my head
C'mon and turn it turn it up
I wanna turn turn you on
I want it all, I want it all, I want it
(fill the space surrounding me
That is if you never breathe
Fill the space surrounding me)
Words & guitar
I dream of quiet songs
I hear the silky sounds
Hush, hush and rock
Oh give me pretty songs
Oh let me have that sound tonight
Words & guitar, I got it
Words & guitar, I want it
Way way too loud, I want it
Words & guitar
I got it all, I got it all, I got it
(tell me what you want in me
Tell me what you want in me
Tell me what you want in me)
Words & guitar
Take take the noise in my head
Take take the noise in my head
C'mon and turnit turn it up
I wanna turn turn you on
(well you want it or you don't
Either you'll come or you won't
It's the thing you'll never know
It's the thing you'll never own)
I want it all, I want it all, I want it
(rock you till you're good and dead
Rock you till there's nothing left
Rock until you're good and dead)
Words and guitar
I dream of quiet sounds
I hear the pretty songs
Hush, hush and rock
Oh give me pretty songs
Oh let me have that sound tonight
Words & guitar, I want it
Words & guitar, I got it
Way way too loud, I want it
Words & guitar
I got it all, I got it all, I got it
(tell me what you wanna be
All the things you'll never be
Tell me what you want in me)
