Dig Me Out Lyrics
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out my head
What do you want, what do you know?
One to get started, three till we go

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skin

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

What do you want, what do you know?
Do you get nervous making me go?
Get into your sores, get into your things
Do you get nervous watching me bleed?

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skin
I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows

You got me
For now
I'm here
For now

I wear your rings and sores
In me, in me, it shows
Oh, God, let me in, there's nowhere else to go
Oh, God, let me in, and let me go, go, go, go

Dig me out, dig me in
Out of this mess, baby, out of my head
Dig me out, dig me in
Out of my body, out of my skinEmbed
