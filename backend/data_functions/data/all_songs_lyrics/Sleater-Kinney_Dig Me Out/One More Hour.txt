One More Hour Lyrics
In one more hour, I will be gone
In one more hour, I'll leave this room
The dress you wore, the pretty shoes
Are things I left behind for you

Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (You never wanted to let it let it go)

If you could talk, what would you say?
'Fore you things were just night and day
Take off the dress, take off the face
I'll hold you close before I leave

Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (It's so hard for you to say goodbye)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
I needed it (You need a little bit, just a little more time)

Don't say another word
About the other girl
Don't say another word
About the other girl

I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I needed it (Never wanted to let it, let it go)2Embed
