In Limbo Lyrics
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can’t read
Another message I can’t read

I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world

I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
The most beautiful woman in the world
Come back
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back11Embed
