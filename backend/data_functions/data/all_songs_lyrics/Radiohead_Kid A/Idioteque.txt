I haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first, and children

Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
