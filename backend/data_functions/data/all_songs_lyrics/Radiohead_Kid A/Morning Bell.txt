Morning Bell Lyrics
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

The lights are on but nobody's homeEverybody wants to be a friend
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking12Embed
