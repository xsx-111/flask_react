Shame for You Lyrics
I've been thinking that you've crossed the line
If you disappear, that would be just fine
'Cause you waste my time and waste my money
And you're not too cool and not so funny
Spreading your seed all over the town
Getting too greedy and messing around
Oh my gosh, you must be joking me
If you think that you'll be poking me

Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on

Shattered the lie, but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn
I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame for you

Please don't come around and knock on my door
'Cause I don't wanna have to pick you up off the floor
When you ask if we can still be lovers
I'll have to introduce my brothers
I think that they could teach you a lesson or two
By the time they've finished, you'll be black and blue
You'll be crying like a baby
A sea of tears, they'll call the navy in
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on

Shattered the lie, but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn
I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame for you

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on no, no
Don't take me on

Shattered the lie, but you think I don't already know
Don't try to deny 'cause my fuse is ready to blow
It's your turn to learn
I think that you know where to go
It's a shame, shame, shame, shame for you
Shame, shame, shame, shame for you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Don't take me on
Don't take me on
Don't take me on
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no2Embed
