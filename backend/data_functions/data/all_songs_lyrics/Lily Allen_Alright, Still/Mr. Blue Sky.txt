Mr. Blue Sky Lyrics
Sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining, everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day, hey
Running down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly in the city
On the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration, Mr. Blue Sky's up there waiting
And today is the day we've waited for, -or

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Mr. Blue Sky, Mr. Blue Sky
Mr. Blue Sky

Mr. Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night, creeping over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Nevermind, I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you1Embed
