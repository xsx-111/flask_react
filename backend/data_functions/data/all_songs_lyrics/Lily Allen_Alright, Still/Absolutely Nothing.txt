Absolutely Nothing Lyrics
I'm on the doorstep with my key turned in the door
Walk in the living room and you're sat on my floor

My heart is achin' and I've never felt this bad
I pinch myself to check that all of this is real
Keep thinking I'm not letting on I feel this sad
And then you've got the cheek to ask me how I feel
And I say...

Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind

I know that you just want to see me get upset
My world turned upside down, so what did you expect?

My heart is achin' and I've never felt this bad
I pinch myself to check that all of this is real
Keep thinking I'm not letting on I feel this sad
And then you've got the cheek to ask me how I feel
And I say...
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind

You've seen me cry, too many times
But not this time, no, not this time
I don't need you, to help me through
I'll be just fine, I'll be just fine

And I say...
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mind
Absolutely nothing, I'm absolutely fine
Absolutely nothing you can say to change my mindEmbed
