Friend of Mine Lyrics
I don't want us to have a fight
But in the background, I can hear you chatting shite
I hear it every night
And you think you're being really cool
And you've been doing it since we were both at school
Now who looks like a fool?

You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl?

Tell me, what did you expect?
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me, what did you expect?
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck

What happen to the good old days?
I was kinda hoping this was all a stupid phase
Who are you anyway?
I know you've heard this all before
I know some people who've been calling me a whore
Don't know you anymore
You're no friend of mine, girl
And I've known it for a while, girl
You're just a waste of time, girl
Why don't you have another line, girl

Tell me, what did you expect?
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me, what did you expect?
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck


Tell me, what did you expect?
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck
Tell me, what did you expect?
Have you got no self respect?
Reputation to protect
Soon you'll be a nervous wreck1Embed
