Cheryl Tweedy Lyrics
I wish I had one good reason
Why I should stay
How'd I get myself into this place?
I wish had qualities like:
Sympathy, fidelity, sobriety, sincerity, humility
Instead, I got lunacy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish I could fit myself in my pocket
And tie myself to a rocket
And send myself to outer space
I wish I had a different face
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish I had one good reason why I should stay
How'd I get myself into this place?

I wish my life was a little less seedy
Why am I always so greedy?
Wish I looked just like Cheryl Tweedy
I know I never will, I know I never will
I wish my life was not so boring
Every weekend, fall to the flooring
Don't get me started on Monday morning
It would be overkill, it would be overkill
I wish I had one good reason why I should stay
How'd I get myself (How'd I get myself)
Into this place?

I wish I could apologize, be dignified
Wish I could look you in the eye
And tell you that I never lied
I wish that I could stop the cries
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't wake me up today
Under my duvet's
Where I wanna stay
Don't wanna come out to play
Doesn't matter what you say, anyway, anyway

I wish my life was a little less seedy
Why am I always so greedy?
Wish I looked just like Cheryl Tweedy
I know I never will, I know I never will
I wish my life was not so boring
Every weekend, fall to the flooring
Don't get me started on Monday morning
It would be overkill, it would be overkill
Oh, I wish I didn't smoke so many cigarettes
Another programme on antiques on the TV set
Wish I had blonde hair, wish I had green eyes
So many things about myself that I despise
(I wish my life was a little less seedy)
So many things about my life that I despise
(I wish my life was a little less seedy)
So many things that I despise
(I wish my life was a little less seedy)
So many things that I despise3Embed
