Smile Lyrics
When you first left me
I was wantin' more
But you were fucking that girl next door
What'cha do that for? (What'cha do that for?)
When you first left me
I didn't know what to say (Say)
I never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feelin' alone

At first, when I see you cry
Yeah, it makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst, I feel bad for a while
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back (Want me back)
And I tell you it don't mean jack (It don't mean jack)
No, it don't mean jack (No, it don't mean jack)
I couldn't stop laughin'
No, I just couldn't help myself (Help myself)
See, you messed up my mental health (Mental health)
I was quite unwell

I was so lost back then
But with a little help from my friends
I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Now you're calling me up on the phone
So you can have a little whine and a moan
And it's only because you're feelin' alone

At first, when I see you cry (When I see you cry)
Yeah, it makes me smile (It makes me smile)
Yeah, it makes me smile (Yeah, it makes me smile)
At worst, I feel bad for a while (I feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile (But then I just smile)
I go ahead and smile (I go ahead and smile)
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

At first, when I see you cry (When I see you cry)
Yeah, it makes me smile (It makes me smile)
Yeah, it makes me smile (It makes me smile)
At worst, I feel bad for a while (I feel bad for a while)
But then I just smile (But then I just smile)
I go ahead and smile
I go ahead and smile29Embed
