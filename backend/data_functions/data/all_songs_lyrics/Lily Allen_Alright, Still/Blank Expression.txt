Blank Expression Lyrics
Snow is falling all around
Seven o'clock and the roads are blocked
So I walk downtown
There's no one else around

I walk in the bar and immediately
I sense danger
You look at me girl as if I was some kind of
A total stranger

Where did you get that (Blank)
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that (Blank)
Blank expression on your face?


The streets are dark
And there's no one about
I wander home
And all the lights are out
I keep wondering
Where did you get that (Blank)
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that (Blank)
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that (Blank)
Blank expression on your face?
Where did you get that (Blank)
Blank expression on your face?
