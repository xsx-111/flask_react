You Lost Sight on Me LyricsAnd you lost sight on me
Whilst the wind it blows so holy
As if I disappeared
To thin, breathless air
Drinking, bittersweet
And sometimes it seems
That you lost sight on me
And don't lead me on
And don't break my heart
You know it's breakable
You know it's sweet
And what shall I do
When it finally crumbles away
Pick up all these years
That I seen myself throw away
To where I know it will be safe
From all your broke
All your broken heartsEmbed
