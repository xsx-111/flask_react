As You Can See LyricsAs you can see
I will fall
With the right wing
Giving in
I will find a way
I will find a way
To get us in safely
I cannot promise a thing
As i can see
You will fall
With the left wing
Oh it's giving in
Tell me you'll find a way
Tell me you'll find a way
To get us in safely
I know you can't promise a thing
Either wayEmbed
