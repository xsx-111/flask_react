Stand in My Way LyricsOne two three
Two two three
It's not what you said
It's just how you said it to me
It's not what you said
It's just how you said it to me
Could you stand in my way
It's not what you did
It's just how you did it to me
It's not what you did
It's just how you did it to me
Could you stand
Could you stand in my way
Could you stand
Could you stand
Could you stand in my wayEmbed
