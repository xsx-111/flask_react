Close Your Eyes LyricsAnd close your eyes
And don't you make a sound
There's no worries now
And close your eyes
And don't you make a sound
There's no worries now
There's no one else around
To hear you cry
You're so asleep
Again, tonight
Close your eyes
And don't you make a sound
There's no worries now
And close your eyes
And don't you make a sound
There's no worries now
There's no one else around
To hear you cry
You're so asleep
Again, tonightEmbed
