Possibilities LyricsThe possibilities are endless now
The forecast not so good
For me now
When you turned away
We tore apart
Finding no better way
Nor time this far, for us now
Complete with all your misunderstandings
Can barely rise to stay
To see you now
The consecuences are endless now
The stream of thoughts that don't make it out
For you now
When you turned away
You didn't tore apart
Finding no better way
Nor time this far, for us now
Complete with all your misunderstandings
Can barely rise to stay
To kill you now
To kill you nowEmbed
