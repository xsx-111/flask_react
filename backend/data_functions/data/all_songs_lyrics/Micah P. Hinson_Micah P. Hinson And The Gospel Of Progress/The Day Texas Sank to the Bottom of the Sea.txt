The Day Texas Sank to the Bottom of the Sea LyricsHere's all that I have to give
I'll admit it's not a lot
But it's all that I've got
To hang myself with
In hopes that you'll take notice of me
I've been waiting
So long
Up in these trees
Trying to hang myselfs with
Thoughts of you
Thoughts of me
I've been wishing so long
Why can't you see?
Here's all that I have to give
I'll admit it's not a lot
But it's all that I've got
To hang myself with
In hopes that you'll take notice of me
I've been waiting so long
Up in these trees
Trying to hang myself with
Thoughts of you
Thoughts of me
I've been wishing so long, why can't you see me?
Here's all that I have to give
I'll admit it's not a lot
But it's all that I've got
To hang myself with
To hang myself with
In hopes that you'll take notice of me
I've been waiting so long
Up in these trees
Trying to hang myself with
Thoughts of you
Thoughts of me
I've been wishing so long, why can't you see?Embed
