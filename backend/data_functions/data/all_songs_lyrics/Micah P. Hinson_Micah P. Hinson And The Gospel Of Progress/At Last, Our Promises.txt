At Last, Our Promises LyricsAt last, they agreed we were sank
Though sometimes I just don't feel the same
At last, we've gone on our ways
Though sometimes I just wish you could have stayed
And it's all your fault
At last, all our promises turn to shit
And do you ever remember them
At last, we've found something that we can not change
And it's all my fault
And it's all our fault
And it's all my faultEmbed
