Caught in Between LyricsCaught between
Somewhere this and that
Convincing myself that I can get over it
Convincing myself to pick up the phone but I'm never leaving home
Caught between
Somewhere this and that
Convincing myself that I can get over it
Convincing myself to pick up the phone but I'm never leaving home
Who when why what and then
My heat or my luck my time is giving in to
Convincing myself that I dont owe you
Or anything, anything at all
I don't owe you or anything, anything at all
I don't owe you or anything, anything at all
I don't owe you or anything
You or anything
Caught between somewhere this and that
Convincing myself that I can get over it
Convincing myself to pick up the phone
But I'm never leaving home
