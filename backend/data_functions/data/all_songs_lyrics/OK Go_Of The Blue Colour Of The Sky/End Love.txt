End Love Lyrics
Oh sugar, oh sugar, can't you see
How hard I'm trying?
You know you gotta, you know you gotta 'ventually
Make up your mind

'Cause no one's gonna find ya
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find ya
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find ya
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find ya

So won't you, so won't you talk to me?
It's time to decide

'Cause no one's gonna save ya
If you don't swim for the boat
No one's gonna save ya
If you won't take the rope
No one's gonna find ya
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find ya
And it's end love, the sky is fallin'
End love, the sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin'

So sugar, so sugar, dance with me
This one last time
We got no reason, we got no reason I can see
To hold back tonight

'Cause no one's gonna catch ya
If you can't just let go
No one's gonna love ya
If you can't let love show
No one's gonna find ya
When you're hiding in the dark
No one's gonna find ya

And it's end love, the sky is fallin'
End love, the sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin'

Oh sugar, oh sugar, can't you see
How hard I'm trying?
You know you gotta, you know you gotta 'ventually
Make up your mind
(You gotta make up your mind)
(You gotta make up your mind)
And it's end love, the sky is fallin'
End love, the sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin'

End love, the sky is fallin'
End love, the sky is fallin'
End love, the sky is, the sky is fallin'
End love, the sky is, the sky is fallin'Embed
