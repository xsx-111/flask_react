White Knuckles Lyrics
You'll never get that taste, out of your mouth
You'll never get the paw print, out of the hen house now
And you can't go back, same way you came
Round all the pieces up, but they just don't fit the same

White knuckles!
Maybe it's not so bad
So let your hair down now
White knuckles!
Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
Oh, go ahead and let it down

So come and let it all out, let it bleed
Did you get what you want? Did you get what you need?
And behind the lines, behind the wall
Tell me was the bed you made really that bad after all?

White knuckles!
Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
So let your hair down now
White knuckles!
Oh, maybe it's not so bad
Just let it all come down now
So just how far, is far enough?
Everybody needs to sleep at night, everybody needs a crutch
But couldn't good, be good enough?
'Cause nothin' ever doesn't change, but nothin' changes much

Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
So let your hair down now
White knuckles!
Oh, maybe it's not so bad
Just let it all come down now

Yeah, maybe it's not so bad
Oh, just let your hair come down now
(White knuckles!)
Oh, maybe it's not so bad
Just let it all come down4Embed
