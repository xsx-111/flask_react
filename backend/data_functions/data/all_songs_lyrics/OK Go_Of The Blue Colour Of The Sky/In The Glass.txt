In The Glass Lyrics
At first, there was
There was just no question
Who wouldn't rather be their reflection?
When I got here, everything was cold and perfect
When I got here, everything was cold and perfect

It was clear and bright
Like mid-winter sunlight
My heart beat counting down a moment, precise and quiet
I looked out and saw my own reflection, helpless
I looked out and saw him overwhelmed and helpless

But oh, what have I done, what have I done?
Oh, what have I done? Oh, what have I done?
My God, what have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
Oh, what have I done?

As time went on, you could feel a silence
Solidifying the sound of my thoughts, paralyzing
I tried to call out to him but the glass was perfect
I tried to call out to him but the glass was perfect
But oh, what have I done? What have I done?
Oh, what have I done? Oh, what have I done?
My God, what have I done?
Oh, what we can pay
To get what you want, oh, to get what you want
Oh, what have I done?

Everyday is the same
We're praying for rain
And when it finally came
And when it came
Every day was the same
Still praying for rain
Every day is the same
We're praying for rain
And when it finally came
And when it came
Every day was the same
Still praying for rain
Every day is the same
We're praying for rain
And when it finally came
And when it came
Every day was the same
Still praying for rain
When it finally came
And when it came
Every day is the sameEmbed
