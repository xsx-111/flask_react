Back from Kathmandu Lyrics
In the dream, you were someone different
You and everyone else, all at once
You were beautiful, you were beautiful
In the dream, you were just like you are

You loved everyone like a sovereign
Half magnanimous, half unimpressed
And I was talkin' too much, I was tryin' too hard
In the dream, it was just like it is

And then, everything was so simple
Things are how they always will be
You are the answer to the question that is me
Oh, in the dream, it was just like it is

We were captive in, in a prison
Where everyone was guilty by mistake
And it was infinite, it was infinite
In the dream, it was just like it is

And I, I asked, "Is that good for you?"
You said, "No, probably not."
But everybody needs to get through the night
And love is all we got, yeah
In the dream, it was just like it is
Yeah, in the dream, it was just like it is

In the dream, you were someone different
You and everyone else, all at once
And you were beautiful, you were beautiful
In the dream, it was just like it isEmbed
