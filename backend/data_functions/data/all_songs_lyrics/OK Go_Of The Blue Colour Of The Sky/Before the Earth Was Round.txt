Before the Earth Was Round Lyrics
Before the Earth was round
And there was no end to things
And no one tried to measure what they knew
Everything was war
But everyone knew love
And every contradiction was true

And the sun worked twice as hard
And the moon was twice as far
And the sky was still honestly blue
The sky was still honestly blue

But when the time came
Everything spiralled in
And everyone forgot what they knew
War became a job
And love became a mystery
And heart and head were rent into two

Fear and doubt began
And God threw up his hands
And the sky didn't know what to do
The sky didn't know what to do
The sky didn't know what to do1Embed
