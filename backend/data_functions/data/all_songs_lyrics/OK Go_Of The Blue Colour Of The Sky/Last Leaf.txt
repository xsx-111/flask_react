Last Leaf Lyrics
If you should be the last autumn leaf
Hanging from the tree
I'll still be here waitin' on the breeze
To bring you down to me

And if it takes forever
Forever it'll be
And if it takes forever
Forever it'll be

And if you should be the last seed in spring
To venture out a leaf
I'll still be here waitin' on the rain
To warm your heart for me

And if it takes forever
Forever it'll be
And if it takes forever
Forever it'll beEmbed
