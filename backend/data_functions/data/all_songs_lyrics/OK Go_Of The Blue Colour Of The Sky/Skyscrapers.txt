Skyscrapers Lyrics
Skyscrapers, please forgive me
I didn't mean a word I said
Skyscrapers, I was just tangled up in my own head

And somehow, in all the madness
I thought that I was seeing straight
It ain't always pretty, but it seemed there was no other way

And I guess all I ever loved
Was standing right before my eyes
And I
Ohhh, I, I was blind

So skyscrapers, please forgive me
I stand here a penitent man
Oh, skyscrapers, I'll never look down again, again

Oh, 'cause I guess all I ever loved
Was standing right before my eyes
Oh, yeah I guess all I ever loved
Was standin', was standin', was standing here all the time
And I
Yeah I, I was blind
I was blind
I was bliiiind
And you were right here all the time
And you were right here all the time
And I was blind
I was bliiiiind
I was blind
Oh, I was blind2Embed
