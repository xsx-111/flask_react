Needing/Getting Lyrics
I've been waiting for months
Waiting for years
Waiting for you to change
Aw, but there ain't much that's dumber
There ain't much that's dumber
Than pinning your hopes on a change in another

And I, yeah, I still need you
But what good's that gonna do?
Needing is one thing
And gettin', gettin's another

So I've been sittin' around
Wasting my time
Wondering what you've been doin'
Aw, but it ain't real forgiving
It ain't real forgiving
Sittin' here picturing someone else living

And I, yeah, I still need you
But what good's that gonna do?
Needing is one thing
And gettin', gettin's another
I've been hoping for months
Hoping for years
Hopin' I might forget
Aw, but it don't get much dumber
It don't get much dumber
Than trying to forget a girl when you love her

And I, yeah, I still need you
But what good's that gonna do?
Oh, needing is one thing
And gettin', gettin's another

When?
When?
Why not now?
Why not me?
Why not me?
When?
When?
Why not now?
Why not me?
Why not me?4Embed
