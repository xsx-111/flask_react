While You Were Asleep Lyrics
In the shallowest part of the night
While you quietly slept
I lay here and I counted the hours
To the sound of your breath

Can't you love me?
Can't you love me?
How I want, please
How I want

I went walking down on Second Street
Through the leaves and the clutter
In the pale yellow sodium light
Nothing has any color

Can't you love me?
Can't you love me?
How I want, please
How I want

Can't you love me?
Can't you love me?
How I want, please
How I wantEmbed
