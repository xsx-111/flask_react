WTF? Lyrics
What.....the..

I've been trying to get my head around
What the fuck is happening
I've been trying to make some sense out of
Whatcha do with my head

(High, high) It's like a skydive
(High, high) Or gettin' high
(High, high) The kinda thing'll maybe kill ya
(High, high) It's like I'm eye-to-eye
(High, high) With a wild lion
(High, high) Ooooh, I don't know what to tell ya
There's just this thing about ya

So maybe you can help me clear this up
'Cause me, myself, I just can't tell
Are you some kind of dark sorcerer?
Am I under some kind of spell?

'Cause I can go on for days
Just crazy about it, oh
You're so respectable
Mmm, but a little bit animal
(High, high) It's like a skydive
(High, high) I'm gettin' high
(High, high) The kinda thrill that could just kill ya
(High, high) It's like I'm eye-to-eye
(High, high) With a wild lion
(High, high) Ooh, I don't know what to tell ya
There's just this thing about ya

Now, aren't you gonna tell me what comes next?
Or am I just supposed to know?
Do I make my own decisions here?
Or am I under your control?

'Cause I'm like this for days
Crazy about it, oh
And it's starting to get, you know
A little bit uncomfortable

(High, high) It's like a skydive
(High, high) Or gettin' high
(High, high) The kinda thrill'll maybe kill ya
(High, high) It's like I'm eye-to-eye
(High, high) With a wild lion
(High, high) Ooooh, I don't know what to tell ya
(High, high) Do you think I'm out of line?
(High, high) Do you think I'm out of...?
(High, high) Or maybe it's fine, oh, maybe it's alright
It's like I'm eye-to-eye (High, high)
(High, high) With a wild lion (Wild lion)
(High, high) Yeah, and I don't know what to tell ya
I don't know what to tell ya
There's just this thing about yaEmbed
