This Too Shall Pass Lyrics
You know you can't keep lettin' it get you down
And you can't keep draggin' that dead weight around
If there ain't all that much to lug around
Better run like hell when you hit the ground

When the morning comes
When the morning comes

You can't stop these kids from dancin'â€”why would you want to?
'Specially when you are already gettin' yours
'Cause if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend
Well don't go blamin' the kids again

When the morning comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
When the morning comes

Let it go, this too shall pass
Let it go, this too shall pass
You know you can't keep lettin' it get you down
No, you can't keep lettin' it get you down
(Let it go, this too shall pass)
Hey! Is it really all that much to lug around?
Oh, you can't keep lettin' it get you down
(Let it go, this too shall pass)
When the morning comes
(You can't keep lettin' it get you down)
(You can't keep lettin' it get you down)
When the morning comes
(You can't keep lettin' it get you down)
(No, you can't keep lettin' it get you down)
When the morning comes
(You can't keep lettin' it get you down)
(You can't keep lettin' it get you down)
When the morning comes
(You can't keep lettin' it get you down)
(No, you can't keep lettin' it get you down)
When the morning comes!5Embed
