Three King Fishers LyricsTwelve kingfisher birds shall you have
Dive and swim in the ripples of your laugh
Whoa, I dreamed you were a jewel
Sitting on a golden crown on my head
My head
My head
Look at the tiny oceans in my hand
Waves of liquid colours touch the sand
Oh, I dreamed you were a jewel
Sitting on a golden crown on my head
My head
My headEmbed
