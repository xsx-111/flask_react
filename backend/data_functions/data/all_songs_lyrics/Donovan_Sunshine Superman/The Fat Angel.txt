The Fat Angel LyricsHe will bring happiness in a pipe
He'll ride away on his silver bike
And apart from that he'll be so kind
In consenting to blow your mind
Fly Translove Airways, get you there on time
Fly Translove Airways, get you there on time
He will bring orchids for my lady
The perfume will be of an excellent style
And apart from that he'll be so kind
In consenting to blow your mind
Fly Translove Airways, get you there on time
Fly Translove Airways, get you there on time
He will bring happiness in a pipe
He'll-a ride away on his silver bike
And apart from that he'll be so kind
In consenting to blow your mind
Fly Jefferson Airplane, get you there on time
Fly Jefferson Airplane, get you there on time
He will bring happiness in a pipe
He'll ride away on his silver bike
And apart from that he'll be so kind
In consenting to blow your mind
Fly Translove Airways, get you there on time
Fly Translove Airways, get you there on time
We'll be flying at an altitude of thirty-nine thousand feet
Captain High at your serviceEmbed
