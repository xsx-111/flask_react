Guinevere LyricsGuinevere of the royal court of Arthur
Draped in white velvet, silk and lace
The rustle of her gown on the marble staircase
Sparkles on fingers slender and pale
The jester he sleeps, but the raven he peeps
Through the dark foreboding skies of the royal domain
Maroon-coloured wine from the vineyards of Charlemagne
Is sipped by the queen's lips and so gently
Indigo eyes in the flickering candlelight
Such is the silence o'er royal Camelot
The jester he sleeps, but the raven he peeps
Through the dark foreboding skies of the royal domain
Guinevere of the royal court of Arthur
Draped in white velvet, silk and lace
The rustle of her gown on the marble staircase
Sparkles on fingers both slender and pale
The jester he sleeps, but the raven he peeps
Through the dark foreboding skies of the royal domainEmbed
