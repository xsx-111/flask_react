Legend of a Girl Child Linda LyricsI will bring you gold apples
And grapes made of rubies
That have shone in the eyes of
A prince of the breeze
Bright cascading crystals
They danced in the sand dunes
On the beach of no footprints
To harpsichord tunes
A throne of white ivory
A gown of white lace
Lies still in the magic
Of a timeless place
One hundred small children
They laugh at the white doves
That rest on their hands
With the touch of love
On a hillside of velvet
The children they lay down
And make fun of the grown-ups
With their silly frown
And the sound of their laughter
Is the sound of the green sea
As it washed around the foot of
The seashell tree
The doves circled over
And land in the trees
Where parrots are talking
Their words with such ease
Thus spoke three wizards
To the young ones that day:
“There’s sadness in the kingdom
Make it go far away
If you follow the sunbeams
Through the valley of flowers
To the palace of the White Queen
With its white jade towers.”
The youngest, she sighed and
The clouds drew away
And a hundred small fingers
Scratched their heads in dismay
From out of the sun a
Giant gull came flying
And the children got ready
To sit on its wing
They waved to the raindrops
As they soared o'er the trees
The wind tossed their hair high
Flashing gold on the sea
They came to the castle
And there they did fall
And they saw all the sadness
Through the crystal wall
A princess lay a-sleeping
So gentle and kind
Whilst her prince took to battle
With his confused mind
The clash of bright metal
Brought the children fear
But their cloaks of blue satin
Dried up all of his tears
Thus children held hands and
They spelled out her name
All the golden children
Became a golden chain
It lies on a white throne
In a magic place
With a tunic of velvet
And a gown of white lace
My sword, it lies broken
And cast in a lake
In the dream I was told that
My princess would wakeEmbed
