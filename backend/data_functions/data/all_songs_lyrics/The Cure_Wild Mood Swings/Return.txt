Return Lyrics
Oh I really love it here!
Oh you've thought of it all!
Candlelight! coconut ice! and fur on the floor!
And I really love the way you wear your hair
And nothing more
So tell me
What is going on?
I was sure that I'd already gone

But all you say is we're all spinning
It's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be

A prisoner in pvc a minute after three
It didn't used to be like this
Must be all that sleep I missed

Yeah but I really love it here!
You've done everything to please!
Stolichnaya! Banco de Gaia! Bad Timing on tv!
And I really love the way you turn
Your smile into striptease
But I'm still not sure what's going on
And I can't help feeling something's wrong

Still wrapped inside your rubber as I wriggle at your feet
No it didn't used to be like this
Must be something strange I kissed
Maybe when my eyes were closed?

So tell me what is going on?
I'm sure that I've already gone
But all you say is we're all spinning
And it's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
Still fixed inside your fantasy
A tv refugee
So tell me what is going on?
Just can't help feeling something's wrong
Or is it right this way I feel?
Someone get me out of here!
I'm waiting on my kneesEmbed
