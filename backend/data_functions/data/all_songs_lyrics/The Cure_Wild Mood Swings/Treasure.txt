Treasure Lyrics
She whispers
Please remember me
When I am gone from here
She whispers
Please remember me
But not with tears

Remember I was always true
Remember that I always tried
Remember I loved only you
Remember me and smile
For it's better to forget
Than to remember me
And cry
Remember I was always true
Remember that I always tried
Remember I loved only you
Remember me and smile
For it's better to forget
Than to remember me
And cryEmbed
