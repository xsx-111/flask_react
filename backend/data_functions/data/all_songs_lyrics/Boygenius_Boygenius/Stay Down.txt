Stay Down Lyrics
Wasn't a fighter until somebody told me
I had better learn to lean into the punch
So it don't hurt as bad when they leave
There you were, turning your cheek

I look at you and you look at a screen
I'm in the back seat of my body
I'm just steering my life in a video game -
Similar acts and a different name

It's a slow down

So would you teach me I'm the villain, aren't I?
Aren't I the one constantly repenting for a difficult mind?
Push me down into the water like a sinner, hold me under
And I'll never come up again

I'll just stay down

It's a half life, it's a fallout
It takes so long for me to settle down
And when I finally do, there's no one else around
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down3Embed
