Ketchum, ID Lyrics
Back in the States now
In a college town
I would walk around
But it's really coming down
Mesmerized by double lines
Two yellow tightropes
I'm making good time

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

Being in love
Is the same thing as being alone
Given the sorrows and company
Nothing to say
But stay on the phone
No, I'm sorry I do not know
What else you want from me

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know
You say "How are you?"
I say "I don't know
Let's dissolve the band, move to Idaho"
Everyone's around
And I hear you smiling
You say "I love you"
I say "You too"

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough5Embed
