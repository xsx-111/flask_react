Bite the Hand Lyrics
I can't hear you, you're too far away
I can't see you, the light is in my face
I can't touch you, I wouldn't if I could

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Here's the best part, distilled for you
But you want what I can't give to you
Your hands are grabbing while my hands are tied

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
What do you want to say?
What do you think will change?
Maybe I'm afraid of you
Maybe I'm afraid of you
I'll bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

I can't love you how you want me to6Embed
