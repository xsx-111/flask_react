Souvenir Lyrics
Dreamcatcher on the rearview mirror
Hasn't caught a thing yet
Twenty dollars and a souvenir
Anything's worth trying
To stay out of your nightmares
Say I was in your dream last night
Always end up dying
You said, because of course I did
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

Always managed to move in
Right next to cemeteries
And never far from a hospital
I don't know what that tells you about me

Pulling thorns out of my palm
Work a midnight surgery
When you cut a hole into my skull
Do you hate what you see?
Like I do
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh9Embed
