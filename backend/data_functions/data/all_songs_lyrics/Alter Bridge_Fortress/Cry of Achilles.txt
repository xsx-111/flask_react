Cry of Achilles Lyrics
Crying out
Now you can’t escape you are buried in doubt
And it pulls you down
Now you’re in too deep you may never get out
Such an awful fate
Tear it down
It’s almost too late, is the end coming now?
As you scream out loud
You sever the peace 'til your truth has been found

Is there nothing left to follow?
Is there nothing left to steal?
Crying out for something more than I’ve been shown
Knowing none of this is real

Don’t close your eyes
Something beautiful is still alive
Don’t close your eyes
Never turn away and let it die

I cannot seem to find the answers
Every truth has slipped away
All that real is we will never cease to be
Still I search this world in vain
Don’t close your eyes
Something beautiful is still alive
Don’t close your eyes
Never turn away and let it die

Cry out to save tomorrow
It’s not too late
Or your heavy heart will follow
You to the grave
This is not the end
This is not the end


Don’t close your eyes
Something beautiful is still alive
Don’t close your eyes
Never turn away and let it die


We can’t hesitate, hope is not too late
For the time has come, what have we become?
Nothing left to do but deny the truth5Embed
