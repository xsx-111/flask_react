Fortress Lyrics
Am I lost to wander forever
Perhaps for the rest of my days?
If all that has been surrendered will just go to waste
You left me out in the distance
To wander this world on my own
Sometimes it’s so hard to admit it
But I can’t let go, I can’t let you go

Go on and take it all
Go on and take it all
(Fortress coming down)
I know we can’t save it all
I know we can’t save it all
Everything is gone
Oh, I have seen it all
Oh, I have seen it all
(The fortress coming down)
Go on and take it all
Go on and take it all

One thing I know is for certain
We cannot have all we want
Still, this will not stop the hurting
It is never gone
Now I hold on to the one thing
Too fragile to stand on its own
The fortress we built, it is crumbling
Still I can’t let go, I can’t let you go
Go on and take it all
Go on and take it all
(Fortress coming down)
I know we can’t save it all
I know we can’t save it all
Everything is gone
Oh, I have seen it all
Oh, I have seen it all
(The fortress coming down)
Go on and take it all
Go on and take it all
Fortress coming down

Whoa, there’ll come a time, yes I know
There’ll come a time
You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
Oh, there’ll come a time, yes I know
There’ll come a time
You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone
You’ll look back and regret when it’s gone

In the end, too far gone
This I can’t deny
Still, I keep holding on and on
There’s still time
On the outside looking in
Everything seems fine
But the fortress caving in
Comes down on me tonight

Go on and take it all
Go on and take it all
(Fortress coming down)
I know we can’t save it all
I know we can’t save it all
Everything is gone
Oh, I have seen it all
Oh, I have seen it all
(The fortress coming down)
Go on and take it all
Go on and take it all

Just take it all
Just take it all
Just take it all2Embed
