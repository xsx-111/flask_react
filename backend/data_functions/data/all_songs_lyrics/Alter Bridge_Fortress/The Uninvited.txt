The Uninvited Lyrics
What was sacred lost forevermore
What your hatred washed up to the shore
Underneath I still can feel the pain
What you took can never be replaced

Stone faced liar
Your hate vile

For the blood you waste this will fall on you
Now your fate has been decided
For the life you take, this is overdue
You are now the uninvited

Sirens screaming blood against the wall
No more saving innocence at all

No shame spineless
Cold rage of violence

Soon you'll feel all my agony
Soon you’ll know it
All you feel will come to life and it won’t be long
For tonight you are gonna know my pain


Stone faced liar
Stone faced liarEmbed
