Waters Rising Lyrics
Now is the end of time, a fool and his legacy are gone
His pride found another way to make sure it all went wrong
Awake in a new day, our fears have come to pass
And this time they’re gonna last
This time they’re gonna last

Don’t let me drown
Don’t let me drown

Now all of the fields are burning, it blocks out the sun
I see all the water rising to drown everyone

This is the season we tear our rivals down
This circle of tyrants will end us all right now
The earth has provided the means to burn it down
Well, don’t you see it now?
Well, don’t you see it now?

Don’t let me drown
Don’t let me drown
Now all of the fields are burning, it blocks out the sun
I see all the water rising to drown everyone
This is tomorrow's way to end our days
Watch as the clouds they gather now to wash us away

Water is rising coming to wash it all away
There’s no denying we were so wrong
Water is rising coming to wash the filth away
There’s no denying we are so
Lost

Staring down the end of time
Every fear is realized
Crying out is much too late
There’s nothing we can do to save
For the time has come

Now all of the fields are burning, it blocks out the sun
I see all the water rising to drown everyone
This is tomorrow's way to end our days
Watch as the clouds they gather now to wash us away
At the end of days
The end of daysEmbed
