Never Say Die (Outright) Lyrics
Never be afraid
No, never fear at all
But I must be on my way
But you must carry on

But if I do not make it back again
Please know that I have loved you till the end

And one last thing before we say goodbye
Never say die

Heroes slip away
Yeah, heroes come and go
But I hope that you can face
Your shadows on your own

I know you fear the end is gonna come
But you, my friend, you've only just begun

And one last thing before we say goodbye
Never say die
Don't let em keep you down, hold your head up high
Never say die
Somewhere in the distance, it's calling me home
But, in case, I don't see you again
Always care, be resilient, never let weakness show
And keep fighting till the very end

And one last thing before we say goodbye
Never say die
Don't let em keep you down, hold your head up high
Never say dieEmbed
