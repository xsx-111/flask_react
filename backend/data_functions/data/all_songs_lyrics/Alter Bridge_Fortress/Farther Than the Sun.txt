Farther Than the Sun Lyrics
Drifting like a comet in the cold
I cannot feel at all
I fade to black and set out on my own
This is my resolve

I have to find a place where I belong
I do not like what I have become
No more compromise I will be gone
Free to fly farther than the sun
Farther than the sun

Something in the silence beckons me
And tells me every time
All of your defiance sets you free
And brings you back to life

I have to find a place where I belong
I do not like what I have become
No more compromise I will be gone
Free to fly farther than the sun
Farther than the sun
Farther than the sun
Farther than the sun
I have to find a place where I belong
I do not like what I have become
No more compromise I will be gone
Free to fly farther than the sun
I have to find a place where I belong
I do not like what I have become
No more compromise I will be gone
Free to fly farther than the sun
Farther than the sun
Farther than the sun
Farther than the sunEmbed
