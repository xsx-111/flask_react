Peace Is Broken Lyrics
All the sorrows that you’ve known
All the wars that you wage
I’m bearing arms against your own
As you throw your life away

The peace is broken
You did it all yourself
With you and no one else to blame
The peace is broken
The trouble in your heart
Is self imposed and hard to tame
The peace is broken

Oh can’t you see what you’ve become?
As you crawl to your own grave
When everything is said and done
You will find that it’s too late

The peace is broken
You did it all yourself
With you and no one else to blame
The peace is broken
The trouble in your heart
Is self imposed and hard to tame
The peace is broken
All the sorrows that you’ve known, all the wars that you wage
Lost to every worry
Every sorrow in your heart
Everything is blurry
Now you’ve torn your world apart
None of this will matter
Not tomorrow just today
Don’t let this moment slip away

The peace is broken
You did it all yourself
With you and no one else to blame
The peace is broken
The trouble in your heart
Is self imposed and hard to tame
The peace is brokenEmbed
