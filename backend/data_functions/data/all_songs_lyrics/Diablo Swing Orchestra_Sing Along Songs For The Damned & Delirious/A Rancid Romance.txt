A Rancid Romance LyricsYou're never there
Eyes never seem to care
Now there's a silence piercing through us
Your gaze elude, a promise seems to soothe for a while
But then you're off into your own mind
Now put aside what's been and all we've seen
Let go of all that's dear to me
How would I know, they're words you never spoke
How could I know, or see without it
It never shows, but it's one for all and each to their own
What once was ours is now estranged and gone
And breathing side by side, could never find
The peace of mind we now deserve
Liar, cheater, bastard child
Broken promise, love died
Traitor, heartless filth of a man
All broke down when you ran
We mourn the weak, but never let them see
We never speak of those who hurt us
Don't show the world the reason why we bleed once again
Fragile words from a fragile mind
In spite of me, of you, I'll grow
And now our time has come to us at last
Liar, cheater, bastard child
Broken promise, love died
Traitor, selfish greedy hag
All broke down when you ran
Liar, cheater, bastard child
Broken promise, love died
Traitor, selfish greedy hag
Liar, cheater, bastard child
Broken promise, love died
Traitor, heartless filth of a man
All broke down when you ranEmbed
