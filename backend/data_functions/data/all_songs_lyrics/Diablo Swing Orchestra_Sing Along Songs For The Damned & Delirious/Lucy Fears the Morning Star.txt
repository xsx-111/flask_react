Lucy Fears the Morning Star LyricsSet them free, cut the leash, let them out, let them feed
On a world much too small when it lies at your feet
Stay now and you're never to be found
Preach, and their ears will pretend they can hear
With the birth of a curse, spawned out of fear
Inhale those words without a sound
Over, they're passing over, from a distance, from afar now
Closer, they're getting closer to a weak mind like mine
Lucy fears the morning star
How she wonder's where you are
Come out, come out and shine your light
Upon those who whisper your prayers at night
Rise the accuser, you burn like the sunlight
Inferior creatures, their world came undone
March of the scapegoats, from heights yet unheard of
While screaming your gospels, their world came undone
Make a wish, make it so, you may shine, you may glow
Try to belong, so much further from home
You walk as if swallowed by the sun
Make a stand, pick a side, where the stars do collide
And their pillars of sand, all wrecked by the tide
Let them sleep when their work here is done
Slowly, almost calmly, they invade me, and persuade me
Breathing, they keep on breathing, in a weak heart like mine
Lucy fears the morning star
Won't you twinkle to her from afar
Come out, come out and shine your light
Upon those who lost they way and sight
Rise the accuser, you burn like the sunlight
Inferior creatures, their world came undone
March of the scapegoats, from heights yet unheard of
While screaming your gospels, their world came undoneEmbed
