New World Widows LyricsSpoke of honour, spoke of truth
Spoke of everything it made us do
In the name of a broken, but promised land
Down a path so worn out, stained red by man
And I never knew
How hatred could consume
In a prayer that no one heard
Came the words too late to her
Carved in skin and heart since birth
Took on duties to cleanse this earth
From unbelievers, from those outside
Our eyes we close, our hearts we fortify
In a world that sleeps
Built to make us weak
Silence calling, how numb we all are
Tried to set it free
Tried to leave it be
Tried to spare your eyes and now you just dream me away
Safe from harm now, safe we all are
Heaven to her, such beauty in your arms
I raise my hands as if time would stop
We all bow down, forgive us all
So afraid of what could occur
Forgot to heal what's sore
Spend a life taking back what you said
Just words you'll live to regret
In a world that sleeps
Built to make us weak
Silence calling, how numb we all are
Tried to set it free
Tried to leave it be
Tried to spare your eyes and now you just dream me awayEmbed
