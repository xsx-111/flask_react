Bedlam Sticks LyricsIn a place where long lost souls are led astray
A penny's a cheap price to pay
We play those pokeÂ´em in the nostril games all day
Oh the fun! oh the joy! they all would say
Ode to tranquils meant to soothe
Head riots, all them bells in my mind in high pursuit
In love with a spine, I try to stroke it most of the time
I wish they could, wish they would
Leave us alone, leave us alone
Carnivore, we never could tell, no one seems to feed you
Carnivore, tell me what is that smell, no one wants to greet you
Life on clouds and walls in bloom, bring the cookie, eat the cookie
Who's the cookie, I'm the cookie
Carnivore, we never could tell, no one seems to feed you
Carnivore, show me what is that smell, no one wants to greet you
Sing along and my birds will hum, bring the cookie, kill the cookie
Who's the cookie, I'm that cookie
The warden plays such a pretty little tune
We call it the toenail dance and we're in love with the fumes
A sweet and innocent after tear romance
Painting blisters on our feet, more sugar by any chance?
We sway in time to the rhythm we left behind
Are we entertained by the lunacy at hand?
What we see is man's cruelty
We're down on our knees, we're begging you please
Leave us alone, leave us alone
Leave us alone, leave us alone
Carnivore, carnivore...
Carnivore, we never could tell, no one wants to feed you
Carnivore, tell me what is that smell, no one wants to greet you
Life on clouds and walls in bloom, sing along and my birds will hum
Life on clouds and walls in bloom, sing along and my birds will hum
Carnivore, we never could tell, no one seems to feed you
Carnivore, tell me what is that smell, no one wants to greet you
Life on clouds and walls in bloom, bring the cookie, eat the cookie
Who's the cookie, I'm the cookie
Carnivore, we never could tell, no one seems to feed you
Carnivore, show me what is that smell, no one wants to greet you
Sing along and my birds will hum, bring the cookie, kill the cookie
Who's the cookie, I'm the cookieEmbed
