Stratosphere Serenade LyricsI'm free this time, and I surrounded mankind
There's nothing here now but you
While gravity never used to bother me
I'm floating senseless in the presence of you
And I see euphoria in what we do
This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
We've lost the air of innocence we shared
Once at peace, once so calm
Whatever woke me up now it's calling me home
This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
We've lost the air of innocence we shared
Once at peace, once so calm
Whatever woke me up now it's calling me home
Morphine slumber, in haze of wonders
Enter womb-shaped rooms where we can be safe
Vision blurred by an opiate sky
Sedated while your world starts to quake
I forgot how affection used to taste
This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
We've lost the air of innocence we shared
Once at peace, once so calm
Whatever woke me up now it's calling me home
This world is closing in, and while I don't feel a thing
We've lost the air of innocence we shared
Once at peace, once so calm
Whatever woke me up now it's calling me home1Embed
