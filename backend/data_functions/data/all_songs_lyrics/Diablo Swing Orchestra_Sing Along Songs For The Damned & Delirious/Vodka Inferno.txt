Vodka Inferno LyricsSaved by her grace, Oh so fair without a lock of hair
Grabs her by the waist, lifts her high above
Says: Behold my love!
With you, I'll never be lonely
Without you I'll never be sane
For you, I shall conquer the oceans
For you, I'll just leave them again
Absinthe love affairs, we fill our lungs with hymns of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come
Absinthe love affairs, we fill our lungs with hymns of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come
Words so tender, slowly whispered
Heed her bittersweet caress
Swears he'll never leave, he'll never lie to her again
Never lie to her again, he'll never lie to her again
My dear, forgive me my feelings
My dear, I'll give you my all
Just save me from all these thoughts now
Just spare me, be there when I fall
Woken by her voice
A song she's hummed so many times before
Hear her calling, hear her yearning
For his hand again
With you, I'll never be lonely
Without you I'll never be sane
For you, I shall conquer the oceans
For you, I'll just leave them again
Absinthe love affairs, we fill our lungs with hymns of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come
Absinthe love affairs, we fill our lungs with hymns of
Pride and poverty and we shall overcome
Bring her into our hearts of tar and stone
Until that warm embrace will come
Absent delo lubovi intrigami napolnim
Gordosti i bednost' mi preodoleem
Priglasim eyo v nashi serdsa iz smoli i kamnya
Tepla darite skorey!
Absent delo lubovi intrigami napolnim
Gordosti i bednost' mi preodoleem
Priglasim eyo v nashi serdsa iz smoli i kamnya
Tepla darite skorey!Embed
