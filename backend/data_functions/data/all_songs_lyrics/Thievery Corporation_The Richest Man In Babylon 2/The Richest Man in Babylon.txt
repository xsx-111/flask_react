The Richest Man in Babylon Lyrics
There is no guidance in your kingdom
Your wicked walk in Babylon
There is no wisdom to your freedom
The richest man in Babylon

Your beggars sleep outside your doorway
Your prophets leave to wander on
You fall asleep at night with worries
The saddest man in Babylon

The wicked stench of exploitation
Hangs in the air and lingers on
Beneath the praise and admiration
The weakest man in Babylon

There is no hope left in your kingdom
Your servants have burned all their songs
Nobody here remembers freedom
The richest man in Babylon

Babylon no get rich again
But to end up sick again and you end up weak again
Babylon
Babylon, you run
You better know, you better understand
They're right, you know, you better hear what we say
Babylon, this is your final day
Babylon, this is your final call, read the writing that's on the wall
See, divided we stand and together we fall
You never know dat; you not gon' catch me in the rat pack
We're not gon' fall in on your death trap, no way1Embed
