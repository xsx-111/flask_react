The State of the Union Lyrics
People live in misery
Government a work but government them is a mockery
Respect to the youths whether in front and all dem a back a me
Why don't you treat them the way you should
And I know all the things you hide
Even though it's a good disguise
And I see all the things you do
But what you do will comeback on you
You think we can't fight what the eyes can't see
Because we are blinded by poverty

It's like the people you want them to rebel
And fire gunshots and burn buildings to hell
And after that you a go want treat me well;
It's like you have the people under a spell
Talking to the people in a congress
A we vote you in, so you must put out your best
After all we no in a contest;
It's the state of the union address

Broadcasting lies on the television screen
Trying to get us hooked on your American dream
We up on your games if you know what me mean
When you cheated on your wife with your money and your schemes
People rule and a that you fi follow
We and nuh no call me no nigga
Do a good term and you deserve another
Signed musically yours, the general Sleepywonder
