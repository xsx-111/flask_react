Sunshine Lyrics
I opened my eyes
And watched the sunshine
It had been out all night
To relax and unwind

There will come a time gigantic
Waves will crush the junk that I have saved
When the moon explodes or floats away
I'll lose the souvenirs I made
La la la

I lay down on the grass
And let the insects do their thing
She covered me with wings and
Held my head and said 'poor thing'

There will come a time gigantic
Waves will crush the junk that I have saved
When the moon explodes or floats away
I'll lose the souvenirs I made
La la laEmbed
