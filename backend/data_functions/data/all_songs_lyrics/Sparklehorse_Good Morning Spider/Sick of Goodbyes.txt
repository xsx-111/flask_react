Sick of Goodbyes Lyrics
If I could just keep my stupid mind together
Then my thoughts would cross the land for you to see
No one sees you on a vampire planet
No one sees you like I do

Seconds click in which I'm changed to dust
Whithered roots of knots and hairy rust
No one sees you on a vampire planet
No one sees you like I do

I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes goodbyes

The night comes crawling in on all fours
Sucking up my dreams through the floor
I'm so sick
I'm so sick
Of goodbyes

I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so sick, so sick, so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
So... I'm so sickEmbed
