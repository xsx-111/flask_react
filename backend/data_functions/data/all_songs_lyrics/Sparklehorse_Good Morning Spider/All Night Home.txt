All Night Home LyricsShining motorcycle
Through the trees we rifle
We're gonna drive
All night home
We're gonna drive
All night home
Down to west virginia
Like the blood within ya
We're gonna drive
All night home
We're gonna drive
All night home
Shining motorcycle
All her worries stifled
We're gonna drive
All night home
We're gonna drive
All night home
This ought to hold her now
This ought to hold her now
This ought to hold her now
This ought to hold her nowEmbed
