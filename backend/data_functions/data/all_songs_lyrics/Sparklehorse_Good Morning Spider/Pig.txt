Pig Lyrics
Why don't you sing me that
Pretty lullaby
Then when you're singing great
Pack it all up

I want a new face right now
And I want it bad
I wanna new body that's strong
I'm a butchered cow

I wanna try and fly
I wanna try and die
I wanna be a pig
I wanna fuck a car

I want a new face right now
And I want it bad
I wanna new body that's strong
I'm a butchered cow

I wanna be a stupid and shallow motherfucker now
I wanna be a tough skinned bitch but I don't know how
I wanna be a shiny new baby with a spongy brain
I wanna be a horse full of fire that will never trainEmbed
