Hey Joe LyricsHey Joe
C'mon, Joe
Don't make that sad song
Any sadder than it already is
Hey Jack
Get back
Get yourself together
C'mon, c'mon
I know you're thinking about your nervous laugh
I know exactly what you're thinking of
Hey Sid
No matter what you did
It can work out
Work out
No matter how you feel
Right now
Hey George
Do your chores
Don't feel sore
I know it's a lot more
Than just being poor
There's a heaven and there's a star for you
There's a heaven and there's a star for you
There's a heaven and there's a star for you
There's a star for you
There's a star for you
There's a star for youEmbed
