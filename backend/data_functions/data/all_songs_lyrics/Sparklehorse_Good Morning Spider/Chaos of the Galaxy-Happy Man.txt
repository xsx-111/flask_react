Chaos of the Galaxy/Happy Man LyricsIf I had
If I had more
More would be laid at your feet
If you give me
Just a little smile
The dogs on my trail wouldn't drag me back to jail
I woke up in a horse's stomach upon a foggy morning
His eyes were crazy and he smashed into the cemetery gates
All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man
I've seen teeth across the horizon
Fangs spanning yellow against the earth
And if...
I woke up in a horse's stomach upon a foggy morning
His eyes were crazy and he smashed into the cemetery gates
All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man
I woke up in a horse's stomach upon a foggy morning
His eyes were crazy and he smashed into the cemetery gates
And all I want is to be a happy man
And all I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man
All I want
All I want
All I want
All I wantEmbed
