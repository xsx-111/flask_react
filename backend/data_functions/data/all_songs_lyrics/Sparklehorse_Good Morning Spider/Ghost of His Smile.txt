Ghost of His Smile LyricsHe don't get out much
These days
But I wouldn't call him
Lazy
He sees the dawn sneak
Into the room
And knows the dogs will
Be up soon
And we thought that he was doing alright
As the sun chased down another night
And days carreen
Like the waters
Of a river rushing
To the sea
Here she comes again
Down the staircase
She never passes without
Saying hello
And we thought that he was doing alright
And she says hello
I can't forget the ghost
I can't forget the ghost
I can't forget the ghost
Of his smile
Dogs will wag their tails
And birds will sing
Hell it's hard world
For little things
And we thought that he was doing alright
I can't forget the ghost
I can't forget the ghost
I can't forget the ghost
Of his smileEmbed
