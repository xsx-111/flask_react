Satellite Lyrics
I see you floating by me
I see a beautiful face it's pointed straight up towards the smog
I know, I know you feel me beaming
Can you sense my burning X-ray vision as you roll on by?

Now you must be gravitating
To the vibe I'm generating or maybe not yet

I have known you forever
You pushed the reset button on the counter of my heart
But you'll laugh at my advances
But still I've gotta chance it as I watch your dust

You do it, (you do it) you do it for me, yeah
You do it, (you do it) you do it for me
Yeah you do it, that's how I know that you are mine
That's how I know that you are mine
That's how I know that you are mine
That's how I know that you are mine

I send out to you
Frequencies exceeding the speeding laws of sound
I extend out to you
The satellite that will orbit your mind 'til you're down
That's how I know, that's how I know
I'm the asteroid that will infiltrate your soul
That's how I know, that's how I know
Speeding towards you burning out of control

You do it, (you do it) you do it for me, yeah
You do it, (you do it) you do it for me
Yeah you do it, that's how I know that you are mine
That's how I know that you are mine
That's how I know that you are mine
That's how I know that you are mineEmbed
