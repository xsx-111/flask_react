Waste Lyrics
I'm looking at my watch
At all the time that's been stolen
When I was carrying you
It seems I've tripped and I've fallen
Don't want no one to ache
Oh to be drunk and forgetful
To get out of this unscathed
Oh to be free and inhuman

Some may say I love to play
When the chance is there to take

I'm mopping up the floor
From messy recipes of romance
I'm packing up the pots
Too many cooks in the kitchen

Some may say I love to let a good thing go to waste
I let it go to waste

Let a good thing go to waste, a good thing go to waste
Let a good thing go to waste, a good thing go to waste
I'm looking at my watch
At all the time that's been stolen
When I was carrying you
It seems I've tripped and I've fallen1Embed
