Stoned Lyrics
Leave me alone, I'm over it and everybody's moving on
I can't see my tomorrow
And yesterday has come and gone
So, leave me alone

My mind is blown but it's my own, so deal with it
I'm feeling fine most of the time
I may be on the outside but no one's getting in
So, leave me alone

We're okay, reeling in the days
We're alright, we're just getting high
Let us be, it'll be all right

I got no strife I'm loving life, could you say the same?
You don't have to move to groove
So come on up and see me but leave that judge behind
Cause I'm loving life

We're okay, reeling in the days
We're alright, we're just getting high
Let us be, it'll be all right

We're okay, reeling in the days
We're alright, we're just getting high
Let us be, it will be all right

I'm getting stoned and what's wrong with that
The President seems to be just fine
Come on up and see me
Come on up just know that I'm getting stoned, I'm getting stoned
I'm getting stoned, I'm getting stoned

We're okay, reeling in the days
We're alright, we're just getting high
Let us be, it'll be all right

It'll be alright, it'll be alrightEmbed
