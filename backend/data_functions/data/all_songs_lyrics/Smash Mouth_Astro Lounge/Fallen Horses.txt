Fallen Horses Lyrics
A long summers day, stretching out the cold
Searching for the answers
And some say I'm not alone
Could you tell me, where I might find fallen horses?
Their spirits they fly

Blinded by the whiteness staring at the sun
I'm wishing that I had wings so that I could become one
Would you help me, if I wanted to die?
I could ride off with horses tonight

Tell me why
Why, oh, why?
I said, "Why
Why, oh, why?"

Now that I've arrived here, I know I'm not alone
All my friends among me, tell me welcome home
But could you tell me, where I might find
The one I'm looking for, 'cause her wings have arrived

Tell me why
Why, oh, why?
I said, "Why
Why, oh, why?"
Tell me why
Why, oh, why?
I said, "Why
Why, oh, why?"

And then you said goodbye1Embed
