Water LyricsWater inside
We're all in water
Water we climb and run through it
Water inside
We're all in water
Reaching inside of a big death bag
When you go to danger
Ends are met and lived
Where they are happens to be where they have been
When you lower placement
The strong get stronger
Where you are when you waste there's a whip hitting you
Water inside we're all in water
Water we climbed and run though it
Water inside we're all in water
Reaching inside of a big death bag
Everytime I fake it
Devils crawl through me
I'm ashamed when I ignore the voices that agree
Get us all together
All work for the same thing
It's only a lie to recall believing your body
Water inside we're all in water
Water we climb and run through it
Water inside we're all in water
Reaching inside of a big death bag
Reach inside of a bag
Reach inside of a bag1Embed
