Cut-Out Lyrics
Your number fakes coming along without you
Knowing a shift took place
Your father hooks a wing about you
(La la la)
If you flail this broken sword around you
Cut nothing up
Again we'll face these things when they're dead issues
Ooh, oh

Moments take each other's place
Born and forgotten the same way

Hey
Hey
Ooh

I'll pay you to cut me out
I'll pay you to cut me out

A blower of hot flesh is a baby
That's the first white stuff I sucked
To feed this open fire with a windy day
Ooh, day
Moments take each other's place
Born and forgotten the same way

Never knowing who you are, never knowing who you are
Never knowing who you are, never knowing who you are
Never knowing who you are, never knowing who you are
Are
Are
