Carvel Lyrics
A-aah aaah ah
A-aah aaah ah
A-aah aaah ah
A-aah aaah ah

When I try I force it out
Never looking in only out
Now is the time for millions to lose
Never the same since I lost you

Running me out of town
Wishing the best around
Would only get off my back
Heaven receives you and throws you back
Sending a dummy to my God
Sending a dummy to my God
Sending a dummy to my God
Sending a dummy to my God
A-aah aaah ah
A-aah aaah ah (hey)
A-aah aaah ah
A-aah aaah ah
Driving to eat a Carvel cake
(Driving to eat, driving to eat, driving to eat)
Somewhere you know isn't where you think
(Driving to eat, driving to eat, driving to eat)
Have you gone away?

Have you gone, have you gone away already?
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
Have you gone, have you gone away already?
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
Have you gone have you gone away already?
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
Have you gone, have you gone away already?
Come back, come back, come back, come back
All the good times are on their way

Up and down, um that's how energy stays alive
Up and down, um that's how energy stays alive
And I wouldn't have it any other way
(Wouldn't have it any other way baby)9Embed
