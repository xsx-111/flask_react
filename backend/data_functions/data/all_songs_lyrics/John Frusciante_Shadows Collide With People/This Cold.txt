This Cold Lyrics
I don't need a ride to arrive
I don't feel approached any time

If you feel a fader on a decline
Out of all you've ever been and you won't need time you never need time

I don't need this every God
You see every ghost am I

Have we found a phase to be out of
Transfer all your thoughts to me and you won't need love we don't need love

I don't need this sin to go
Down to where all forevers flow

Every faith released is revealed slow
Never talking back to me
Say it out loud, say it out loud

I feel this cold
I never stay and I never go
I feel this cold
I never stay and I never go1Embed
