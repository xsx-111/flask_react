Ricky Lyrics
I was afraid to be me
Be anyone you want to be
Be anyone you want to be
I don't blame my week
For my not being able to speak
Clearly about things I've said before

And if it's light outside
Night will fall
Night will fall
And if it's life
It resolves
It resolves

Anywhere you are in a maze is a lie
Anywhere you are in a page you still go to the right
Any time there's no ground below you you're in the sky
Any time you're afraid it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

I was a flame in the night
I heard what I wanted to hear
And the moment I disappeared
I grew the size of all outside
'Cause I - I became one with the night
I became one with the night
And if it's real it's not all
It's not all there is
There's a lot in what appears not to be there at all
And you can function as someone besides who you are (x4)2Embed
