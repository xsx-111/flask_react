In Relief LyricsTo seem you're in me and over me
Relief in all things
And all things shoot to me
And all things shoot to you
Wherever you are
To seem you're a dream when you never stop
And we ask you what you are
Belief as one
Belief as one with what you believe in
Travel slowly
Move in circles
You know time grows old in reverse
Life is a thing that began
And was magnified
And made the first fire and the last one
To mean everything you never say
Every single thing going every way
When your leader's gone
He means to make you strong
He never went away
'Cause what you need, you are2Embed
