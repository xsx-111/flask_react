Mother Russia Lyrics

Mother Russia, how are you sleeping?
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling 'round like ghosts in the snow

Mother Russia, poetry majestic
Tells the tale of a great empire
Turning 'round, the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by


Mother Russia, dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, be proud of what you are
Now it has come, freedom at last
Turning the tides of history and your past

Mother Russia, dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, remember who you are
Can you release the anger, the grief?
Can you be happy now your people are free?1Embed
