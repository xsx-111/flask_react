Fates Warning Lyrics

Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive?
And some of us are here just so that we'll die?
How come the bullet hits the other guy?
Do we have to try and reason why?

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away?
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove?

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show
A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come, a Hell to face mankind


Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the showEmbed
