Public Enema Number One LyricsAh ha!

When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet
One way ticket out of here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain


A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
Mmm, what ho!Embed
