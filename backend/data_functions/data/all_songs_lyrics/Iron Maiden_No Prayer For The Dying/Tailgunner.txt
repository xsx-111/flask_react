Tailgunner Lyrics
Trace your way back fifty years
To the glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah

Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the bloodlust
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner


Nail that Fokker, kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more, hahaha!
Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more bombers, one big bomb, yeah hey, ooh

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner1Embed
