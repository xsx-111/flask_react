Hooks in You Lyrics
I got the keys to view at number twenty-two
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature? What kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me?
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

She's tied up, she can't come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed, she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you


Oh yeah, yeah yeah

Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
I’ve got those…
Hooks in youEmbed
