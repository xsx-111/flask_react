Holy Smoke Lyrics
Believe in me and send no money
I died on the cross, that ain't funny
But my so called friends they're making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke
They choose what they wanna hear, don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
Saving your soul by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey

Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Making holy smoke

Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records, burning books
Holy soldiers, Nazi looks
Crocodile smiles, just wait awhile
Till the TV queen gets her make up clean
I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in
Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Holy smoke, smells good


They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When Noah built his Cadillac, it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president, trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail

Holy smoke, holy smoke
Plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke. yeah
