Birds LyricsI loved you in the morning
Before the sun would come
You were the dawn to me
I loved you in the evening
While the birds were still singing
You gave every song to me
I want to see you
More than anything
Babe I miss you
All day and everyday
It's not that I can't go on without you
Got a lot of things to do
I'm busy, busy all the time
Still I can't stop thinking about you1Embed
