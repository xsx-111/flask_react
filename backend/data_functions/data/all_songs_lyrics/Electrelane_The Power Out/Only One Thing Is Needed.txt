Only One Thing Is Needed LyricsI'm going out again
I'm going to meet that girl
I saw her looking so fine
I said I've got to go on over
You got it, you got it, you you you got it
You're gonna be my girl
I saw you looking so fine
I said I've got to go on over
I'm going out to meet her
I'm going out to meet herEmbed
