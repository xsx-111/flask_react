Take The Bit Between Your Teeth LyricsI know you had it hard
I know you had it hard
I know you had it hard and you wanted to tell me
I know you had it hard
I know you had it hard
I know you had it hard and you wanted to tell me
Oh I don't want to hear it
Turn it up
I know you had it hard
I know you had it hard
I know you had it hard and you wanted to tell me
That you're the man
That you're the man
That you're the man, you've got all of the answers
I don't think you do
Turn it up yeah yeahâ€¦Embed
