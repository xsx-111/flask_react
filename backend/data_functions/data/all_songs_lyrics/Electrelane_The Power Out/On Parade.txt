On Parade LyricsStand up against the wall
So I can make you out
Do do you wanna be it?
You take the power out
One day we'll be wanderingâ€¦
Girl you'll be a dandy
And a deserter
You sit astride your horses
Dressed as Nelson
I wanna see her
I wanna see her
I wanna see her with her horses
Oh yeah
I bet I'd like your underwear
I bet I'd like your underwear
I bet I'd like your underwear
You got it down
You got it down
Uh huh
You got it down
You got it downEmbed
