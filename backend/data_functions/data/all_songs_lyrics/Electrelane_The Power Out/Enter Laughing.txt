Enter Laughing LyricsI saw a light
And it shone
Yeah it shone
All around your head
My friend there's no time
For all our plans
Now you're gone
There's no way back from here
Sometimes I just want to change
But the people keep saying
You can't give up your own ways
Can you tell me how
I could be so blind to
Ever let you go
When I wanted you around?
You know I was just waiting for you to come over
I thought that you knew it
I never told you that I
I've been looking out for you
I've been thinking about you
I could, I could, I could, I could, I could, I could, I could not tell youEmbed
