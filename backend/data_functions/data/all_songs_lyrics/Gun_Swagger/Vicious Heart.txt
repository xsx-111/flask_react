Vicious Heart LyricsBreak away while the wheels are turning
Looking round there can be no doubt
All you gave me was a hard hitting headache
That is something I can do without
I don't mind if you think I'm crazy
I don't care iy you never know my name
All I want is to see you laughing
I don't wanna put you through it again
It's only a vicious heart that's making you feel so low
It's only a vicious heart that's making you feel so low
I'll be open if you meet me on the level
I don't know what you're trying to hide
I wanne live, wanna breathe, wanna function
I'm only doing what I think is right
I don't mind if you think I'm crazy
Everybody has the right to a little fame
All I need is to see you happy
I don't wanna put you through it again
It's only a vicious heart that's making you feel so low
It's only a vicious heart that's making you feel so low
Yeh it's only a vicious heart that's getting to you
Gonna drag you down wear you out, watch that river flow
It can mesmerise, tell you lies ,teach you what you already know
Honey you're so vicious, don't you owe it all to me
Honey you're so vicious, easy for the world to see
It's only a vicious heart that's making you feel so low
It's only a vicious heart that's making you feel so low
You do, do what you want to
You do, do what you please
You do, do what you want to
You do, do what you pleaseEmbed
