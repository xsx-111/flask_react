Something Worthwhile LyricsYou'll never find the truth cause you don't wonna know
Reality is not a dream, it's an effect mode
And if I told you what I thought about the system
I'd be banned from being played by using vulgarism
I don't wanna be somebody like you
Wanna be somebody new, not like you a statue
You make me sick with your hypocrite mind
And I know you can see but I still think you're going blind
Welcome people, recharge, repay
Backward, braindead, blinded, blockhead
Sterile, futile, hostile, lifestyle
Why can't you be someone worthwhile
Avarice, the spur of the industry
Causing so many people the never ending misery
Now people, it's time to wake up
And start believing that you're someone not a number
You've got to learn to understand you're not braindead
You have the power to show that you're not affected
And if you try to maintain your superiority
Then you know that you've broken their credibility
Welcome people, recharge, repay
Backward, braindead, blinded, blockhead
Sterile, futile, hostile, lifestyle
Why can't you be someone worthwhile
Power the ultimate aphrodisiac
Wanted by the greedy-eyed maniac
Autocrat turning up the thermostat
Burning everybody's eyes so they can't counteract
Wash the car, go to bed, sleep well
Welcome people, recharge, repay
Backward, braindead, blinded, blockhead
Sterile, futile, hostile, lifestyle
Why can't you be someone worthwhile
Welcome people, recharge, repay
Backward, braindead, blinded, blockhead
Sterile, futile, hostile, lifestyle
Why can't you be someone worthwhileEmbed
