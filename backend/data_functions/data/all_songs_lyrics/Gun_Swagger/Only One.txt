Only One LyricsMemories of failure and feeling like the fool on the hill, say you will
As I stare into the distance heading down the road it seems so far
To where you are
And I've given all I had to give, gave it all to you, ahh…
And now I got myself believing that I'm not the only one
Meet me at the ocean where sunrise meets the day, I'll be there, I'll be there
As I drive another border closer to the place where I belong, where I belong
And it's easier to walk away from what I have to say, ahh…
Because I'm not the only reason and I'm not the only one
I almost had my heart believing that I'm not the only one…
So many times I thought of leaving but I'm not the only one
I almost had myself believing that I'm not the only one
And so it's too late now for reason ‘cause I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one… I'm not the only one…Embed
