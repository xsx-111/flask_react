Find My Way LyricsCrack city lover, she moves like a dancer
She'll slip through your fingers, and kill you like cancer
It pains me to hurt you and hurts me to leave you
I work â€˜til my back breaks, it's more than I can take
She's deep as an ocean, closer than brothers
My fallen angel, she leaves herself open
It's all an illusion, this world of confusion
Just follow the river, wherever it takes you
Someone help me to find my way again
Someone help me to find my way again
Come on now baby, my lover lazy
Let's preach to the masses and bridge all the classes
A cool kind of swagger and lips like Jagger
This is a clampdown, it goes up so it comes down
In with the in crowd, and I'm thinking out loud
I hunger for you, need to be near you
Someone help me to find my way again
I gotta know now, I gotta know now
Someone help me to find my way again
I gotta know now, I gotta know now
Someone help me to find my way
Born to be broken, she asks no questions
I need her to function, she's, she's my religion
Inside I'm twisted and she's so gifted
A perfect creation, my dedication
Someone help me to find my way again
I gotta know now, I gotta know now
Someone help me to find my way again
I gotta know now, I gotta know now
Someone help me to find my way againEmbed
