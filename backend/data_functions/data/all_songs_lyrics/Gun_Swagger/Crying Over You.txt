Crying Over You LyricsDid you ever stop and wonder
Why do somethings never change?
When you left me without reason
Did you lie to yourself again?
If your past comes back to hurt you
Tell me where does that leave me?
Feel like someone locked my heart up
And you threw away the key
And I say hold on hold on
Why can't we see it through
Cos baby, baby what do you have to lose
And I say tell me, tell me
What do I have to do
Cos baby, baby, I'm crying over you
If you give me the chance to tell you
Could you trust me like before?
In your eyes there's a new horizon
Telling me that it's time to go
It's a no win situation
We don't want what we left behind
Can we move in the same direction?
I'll be there if you change your mind
And I say hold on hold on
Our love can see us through
Cos Baby tell me what does it mean to you
And I say it's alright, alright
It's time now to face the truth
Cos baby, maybe, I'm crying over you
So god give me the strength to go through it again
Cause I, I wanna be her lover
But the more I know, the more I fear I'm like so many others
And the hardest part is when you lose your heart
To a second hand emotion
Now it's easy to see with every breath I breathe
That I'm crying over you
CHORUS:
And I say somehow, someday I'm trying to get through to you Cos baby, baby, what do I have to lose
And I say hold on, hold on why can't we see it through
â€˜Cos baby, maybe, I'm crying over you
And I say hold on hold on
What do I have to lose
Cos baby, tell me why I'm crying over youEmbed
