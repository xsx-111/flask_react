Stand In Line LyricsYou make me wanna rise, you make me wonder why
No-one can hold your hand
We've lost our self control, we've got no way to go
You'll never take our pride
Ohh Ohh Ohh I won't stand in line
I said Ohh Ohh Ohh I won't stand in line
You built this world of lies, you made us sacrifice
You tried to bring me down
You cause this pain inside, I know you've got no right
You tried to rule my life
CHORUS:
Ohh Ohh Ohh I won't stand in line
(I could never look up to nobody like you no)
I said Ohh Ohh Ohh I won't stand in line
(And I'm doing alright so get out of my life)
I said Ohh Ohh Ohh I won't stand in line
Can you see, can you see
That I'm everything you'll never be
Could you come back, come back, come back
CHORUS:
Ohh Ohh Ohh I won't stand in line
Never thought of looking up to nobody like you
I said Ohh Ohh Ohh I won't stand in line
Can you see, can you see
That I'm everything you'll never be
Sometimes I get so blind
Sometimes I sacrifice
Sometimes I take that chance
It makes me wonder why
You got to take a chance
You cause the pain inside
I only want what's mine
You built this world of lies
You made me sacrifice
You tried to bring me downEmbed
