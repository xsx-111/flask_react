Hallucinations Lyrics
I saw you walking only yesterday
When I ran to catch you
You disappeared and the street was gray
The candle died, now you are gone
For the flame was too bright
Now you are gone

I heard you laughing with your laugh of gold
When I called out to you
Silence returned and the air was cold
The castle fell, now you are gone
And no more rings the bell
Now you are gone

I found a letter on the day it rained
When I tore it open
There in my hands, only ash remained
The castle fell, now you are gone
And no more rings the bell
Now you are gone

I felt you breathing as I fell asleep
When I reached out to touch you
No one was there and the night was deep
The candle died, now you are gone
For the flame was too bright
Now you are gone
I saw you walking only yesterday
When I ran to catch you
You disappeared and the street was gray
The castle fell, now you are gone
No more rings the bell
Now you are gone1Embed
