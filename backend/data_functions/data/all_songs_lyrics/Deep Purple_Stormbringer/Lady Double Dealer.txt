Lady Double Dealer Lyrics
Get out of my way
I'm getting tired of you
There ain't no chance
Doing what you want to do
I've been down down down down down
Got to get my feet back on the ground

Lady double dealer
Get outta my way
Lady double dealer
You got nothing to say

I am not satisfied
Dealing with second hand goods
You wanted something for nothing
Taking everything you could
You been around--I got the news
But you aren't waiting around for me to lose

Lady double dealer
Get outta my way
Lady double dealer
You got nothing to say
I gave love to you
Did what you wanted me to
But all you did was bring me down
So I just had to try
Try to reason why
You took advantage of my love
Two timing woman
Trying to take me for a ride
You're a hard lover honey
But you sure don't keep me satisfied
I wanna be there
To try to make you see
There ain't no woman going to make a fool out of meEmbed
