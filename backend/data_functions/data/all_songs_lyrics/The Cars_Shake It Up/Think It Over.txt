Think It Over LyricsEvery time I see you I got to jump and shout
I haven't got a clue what it's all about
Ooh I never had a dream that looked so much like you
I'll do anything that you want me to
(Think it over, think it over)
There's nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
(Think it over, think it over)
Ooh every time you run around it makes me want to pop
What's it gonna take to make you change your line?
What's it gonna take to get your valentine?
How can I be sure that you're the one for me?
I only know that you wanted to be free
(Think it over, think it over)
There's nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
(Think it over, think it over)
Every time you run around it makes me want to pop
Nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
Every time you run around makes me want to pop
Nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
Think it over
Pop (echo)
Pop
Every time I see you I got to jump and shout
I haven't got a clue what it's all about
I never had a dream that looked so much like you
Well I'll do anything that you want me to
(Think it over, think it over)
There's nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
(Think it over, think it over)
Every time you run around it makes me want to pop
(Think it over, think it over)
Well nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
(Think it over, think it over)
E-every time you run around it makes me want to pop
There's nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
Every time you run around it makes me want to pop
There's nothin' you can do to make me wanna stop
Think it over
Yeah
(Think it over)
(Think it over)
(Think it over)
Think it over
(Think it over)
Think it over
(Think it over)
(Think it over)
Think it over
(Think it over)
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
You gotta think it over
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do
Think it over
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do but think it over
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do, nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can do, nothin' you can do
But think it over
(Think it over)
Nothin' you can do
Nothin' you can doEmbed
