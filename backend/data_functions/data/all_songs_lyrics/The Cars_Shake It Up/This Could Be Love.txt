This Could Be Love LyricsOh yeah I got time
Oh yeah I guess I'm doing fine
Till I met you in the dark
I was chasing little sparks
You were slinked and dressed in pink
Here with someone you wouldn't think
Is this the kill is this the thrill
I'll wait until you say
This could be love
This could be love
Oh yeah I got hope
Oh yeah it comes and goes
Till I met you things were easy
Till I felt you things were sleazy
Doesn't matter once I told
You were someone I could hold
Oh yeah I need you
Is this the kill is this the thrill
I'll wait until you say
This could be love
This could be love
This could be love
Oh yeah I want you
Oh yeah more than you want me to
Till I met you in the dark
I was chasing little sparks
When you think you're going to sink
Comes someone you wouldn't think
Is this the kill is this the thrill
I'll wait until you say
This could be love, you say
This could be love
This could be love
This could be loveEmbed
