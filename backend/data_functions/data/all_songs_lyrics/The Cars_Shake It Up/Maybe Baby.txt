Maybe Baby LyricsI heard stories about you
I'd like to think that they were true
I did not know you'd be like that
With those surprises under hat
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
When you dance between the stars
In the night late, sweet and dark
Turn them over one by one
You don't need to jump the gun
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
When the night is feeling flush
And when the night is all a hush
Electric look, eclectic blue
Keep one dream that won't come true
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Maybe baby
Maybe baby
Be my, be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Maybe baby
Maybe baby
You're the one
Maybe baby
Maybe baby
Maybe baby
Be my, be my, be my
Be my maybe baby
Be my maybe baby
I heard stories about you
I'd like to think that they were true
Be my maybe
Be my, be my, be my, be myEmbed
