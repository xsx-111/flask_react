A Dream Away LyricsFive in the morning, all alone in your room
Door locked tight, private moon
No faces to face, no one to blame
Nonexistent inside this frame
You better
Take it on the run
Take it on the run
Yeah
There's a cheetah walking high
Liquid whispers, dragonfly
Charleston booties, painted toes
Drop the knot, ivory soul
You better
Take it on the run
Take it on the run
Yeah
The good life is just a dream away
I said, The good life is just a dream away
Choke emotion, lose control
Chicken counters, fill your bowls
The lonely crowd, is decomposed
Lost obsession, future froze
Well, take it on the run
Take it on the run
Take it on the run
Take it on the run
Take it on the run
The good life is just a dream away
I said, The good life is just a dream awayEmbed
