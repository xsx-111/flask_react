Cruiser LyricsBig city noise disappears
Sucker punch is in your heart
Light is reason light is due
My shape is shapeless in your suit
Chrome red eyeballs reflect and roll
A simple sun is slowly sinking
Roman shoes and pretty hats
Glitter bombs that beat the beat
You comb the night 'cause you're a cruiser
And ya you never get enough
When you're cruisin' down the street
And takin' off the heat
When you're on the moonlight run
(Cruiser)
(Cruiser)
Floating jets and big vignettes
Get the treatment grab a cab
Set aside the screaming fish
Tell the world why you're so glad
Flip the switches pull the plug
You always wait for better news
You need a hit you need a slu-ug
You don't easily get amused
You comb the night 'cause you're a cruiser
And ya you never get enough
When you're cruisin' down the street
And you're takin' off the heat
When you're on the moonlight run
(Cruiser)
Well you're a cruiser
(Cruiser)
Cruiser
(Cruiser)
Cruiser
(Cruiser)
