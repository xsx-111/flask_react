I Got By in Time LyricsSaw a girl that I used to know
I was deep in thought at the time
Didn't recognise her face at first
'Cause I was probably looking at mine
Well she was the only girl I've ever loved
But my folks didn't dig her so much
I was young
It was serious
To me she was the world (she was my world now)
I thought I'd never live without her
But I got by in time
Well let me tell you now
Saw a guy that I used to know
Man he'd changed so much
I think it hurt him to say 'hello'
'Cause he hardly opened his mouth
Yeah well he was my best friend a few years ago
We were truly inseperable
We were young
We were full of ideals
We were gonna rule this whole world
But something happened
I didn't know why
But that's the way that it goes
I suppose
What you say - what you do
Don't mean nothing, nothing at all
When all the bonds you make between ya
Can be broken any time you want now
Please tell me  if my philosophy's wrong
I've got to know the truth
I don't mean to offend anyone but
You know it's something that I do, oh-
So nice to see you tonight
And I'm so glad that you came
Some of the people understand this song
Now I say d'you ever feel the same
Yeah my point is in a round about way
Given time you don't always forget
'Cos the memories
That are shouting me on
To me they're everything (they're everything now)
I know they always will be mine, yeah
And no one can take them awayEmbed
