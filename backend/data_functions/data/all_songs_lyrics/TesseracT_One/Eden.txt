Eden LyricsSouvenirs sustain life
Souvenirs of flesh and bone
Waste them all for wealth and gain
When the time comes you'll know
Machinery dredge the sea
And all that's left is memory
No
All the time they lie to me
They suffocate
All the time they're suffering
So when will it end?
It breaks my heart to watch
As we rip this world we have apart
Kill for pleasure
Seven wonders of our history
Endless pleasure
Satisfaction is reality
Careful pleasure
No protection of ancestry
Guilty pleasure
Machinery dredge the sea
And all that's left is memory
No
No
No
No
Machinery bled the sea
You protect this misery
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
Machinery dredge the sea
All that's left is memory
All the time they lie to me
They suffocate
All the time they're suffering
So when will it end?Embed
