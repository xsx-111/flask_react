Concealing Fate Part Three - The Impossible Lyrics
Don't you know how you're feeling?

Breathe in, breathe in
Reach out
The ocean swells
The ocean keeps me safe

Don't you know how to keep, keep me safe?
Disgrace!
Is this how you plan on treating yourself?

Breathe in, breathe in
Reach out
The ocean swells
The ocean keeps me safe

You're in denial
Don't you know how you're feeling?
Don't you know how you're feeling?
Don't you think it's been long enough?
Don't you know how you're feeling?
You're in denial
Don't you think it's been long enough?
Open your mind before
The impossible consumes us all
(So) So many people, don't close your eyesEmbed
