Concealing Fate Part One - Acceptance Lyrics(Now) show your hands, (your hands)
You have no right to complicate
(Now) show your hands, (your hands)
You have no right to complicate
You put to me in your defence
A circumstance in evidence, that's what you said
To me it seems you advertised
It's your chosen last book
Gave you everything, all you need to make your decision
Keep these wounds open for you
Now they're closing, scars remind me
Every moment
Revolve alone
Revolve alone
Revolve alone
Revolve alone
All I said I meant it
Confused by the mire
We stride relentlessly
All I said I meant it
(Now) show your hands, (your hands)
You have no right to complicate
(Now) show your hands, (your hands)
You have no right to complicate
Revolve alone
Become defenseless
All I ever said
Before the moment twisting words inside my head
All I ever said
Take back everything, all I wanted
All I ever needed was here2Embed
