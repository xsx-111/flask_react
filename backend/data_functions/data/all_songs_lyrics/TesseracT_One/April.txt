April LyricsA deep engrained lust for possession
Modern sundowns break me
I like to watch things burn down
Soft and gently
I need to watch her abused 'til I'm satisfied
Never
Never
See tonight through bloodshot eyes
I'll wait 'til you can see me here
Left so long alone
Undressed tonight
Forsaken skin
You mean nothing, nothing
No, you mean nothing to me
Won't you feel bad while you're thrashing out?
Makes me feel sick to know she's had enough
Time and time again
You see tonight through bloodshot eyes
You mean nothing, nothing
No, you mean nothing at all
I'll never say a word of this I swear, I swear
Never
Never
I hope you know
I live tonight through methadone highs
This life is overEmbed
