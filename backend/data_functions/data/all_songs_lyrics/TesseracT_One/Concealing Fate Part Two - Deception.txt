Concealing Fate Part Two - Deception Lyrics
So, my demons
Your time has come

You will find me lay here
You and I both entwined
How refined
An encounter
You ignite within my mind
With one desire

When it falls into place
Rush of fear takes over
Suddenly you succumb to impatience and surrender

So, my demons
Your time has come

Well I swear we are in limited landscapes
Well I swear the tide swallows me
You're in denialEmbed
