Nascent Lyrics
As the mind evolves menaces are born
As the needles turn innocence is torn
(Wake, wake)
Wake

(They find all things tiring)
In time they’ll find a reason to hide their devotion

Desperate defiance
Such a complex rage inside us all
This structured raw submission
Such a killer free to lose control

Alliance
Between the cold and the ones we’ll never know
Alliance
Defined by a harsh society

Dangerous alliance
Such defiant menaces are born
This structured raw submission
Such reluctant innocence is torn
(Liar, liar, liar)

(Nascent, Nascent, Nascent) (Patience, Patience, Patience)
(Defiant, Nascent, Nascent, Nascent)
(Wake Up, Wake Up, Wake Up)

Nascent
A killer is born
Nascent
A killer is born

Desperate defiance
Such a complex rage inside us all
This structured raw submission
Such a killer free to lose controlEmbed
