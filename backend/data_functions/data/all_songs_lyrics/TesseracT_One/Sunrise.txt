Sunrise LyricsDon't you look at me with those eyes
I hate them, why do they lie?
Run away from me
Patient, fortunate survivor
Head for safety within your mind
Pray for safety within numbers
Don't you look at me with those eyes
I hate them, why do they lie?
Run away from me
Don't you come near me with those eyes
I'll break you, I will survive
Get away from me
Don't you come near me with those eyes
I'll break you, just get away from me
Just get away from me
Get away from me
Patient, unrefined defender
Make for danger without caution
Pray for safety within numbers
Flames burn down
Engulf forever
Inside your soul
Don't you believe?Embed
