Concealing Fate Part Four - Perfection Lyrics
Give me just one moment through the eyes of the one
In that picture perfect moment in the life of the one who is
Something better, more than anything I will ever be
Give me just one second just to touch what I'll never own
Let me have those feelings of love that I will never share
Show me your compassion in the dark of this world

I would give it all for one taste only of everything
I would give it all to become you

Well I finally found out
That this world, this whole world is a lie
And I'll try, I would give it all to become youEmbed
