Test Transmission LyricsStanding here on this burning bridge
Trying to figure out but there's nothing here
Seem like they got the fear
Cattle grids rattle gold chains pay it back
Just count all the chickens
And tell your son that he should steal the gold
The kings send their knights, check these soul satellites
Test transmission is calling me back home
The kings send their knights, check these soul satellites
Test transmission is calling me back home
Too messed up to perform this
Can't you see I'll only miss you now
And memories get, they get washed to the seas
Feeding tape through the fabric, must tune in
Unless you're trapped tomorrow
Get out the sun, get out before it gets you back
The kings send their knights, check these soul satellites
Test transmission is calling me back home
The kings send their knights, check these soul satellites
Test transmission is calling me back home
And I feel close enough, taste the change, feel the rays
It's gonna get you again, setting sun is coming back again
And I feel close enough, taste the change, feel the rays
It's gonna get you again, setting sun is coming back againEmbed
