Cutt Off Lyrics
John was a scientist
He was hooked on LSD
Interested in mind control
And how the monkey held the key
Said that all life is experiments
And what he's planning for the heir
Is for the unsuspecting citizens
Who hallucinate in fear
Sing that

Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts

In union station
With a package in his hand
Tied to the suspect
He chanced him where he stand
And I don't think you realise
He's coming for your neck
And the sound is breaking all around
He's keeping lives in check
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts

Making his getaway
Through a punched up mirror
He blends into the crowd
Hear the system scream
And all those spies
That strike you here
Are clinging to their guns
And if you smell those omens, man
I think you better run
Check out

Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
(John was a scientist
He was hooked on LSD)
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
(Interested in mind control
And how the monkey held the key)
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
To the backbone
A solar system
These clever convicts
