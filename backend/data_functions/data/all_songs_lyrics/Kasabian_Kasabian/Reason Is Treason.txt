Reason Is Treason Lyrics
Ah, ah
(Oh)
Ah, ah
(Oh)
Ah, ah
(Oh)

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason

See the stones coming at my window
See they left me no protection
Tell his family that he will be okay
K-I-L-L
Check the angles from both forces
Overcome by the need to fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it                                                                      Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
(Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it)
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
(Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it)
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
(Fight it, fight it)
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason

I hear the sounds all around
I hear the sounds all around
I hear the sounds all around
I hear the sounds all around
I hear the sounds all around
I hear the sounds all around
I hear the sounds all around
I hear the sounds all around

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, cause the reason is treason
