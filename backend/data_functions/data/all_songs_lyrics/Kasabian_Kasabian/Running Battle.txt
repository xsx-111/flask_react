Running Battle Lyrics
All lying across the ground
Try not to make no sound
To make or break you down, I said
To make or break you down, I break
All lying across the ground
Try not to make no sound
To make or break you down, I said
To make or break you down, I break

I take down what I need
'Cause you know I need to breathe
I'm tired of walking on another plane
Another plane, 'cause I feel insane, I
Step back to get to you
Cut back, I'm falling through
Another day I feel the same
I'm cutting, and I'm bleeding here with you

All lying across the ground
Try not to make no sound
To make or break you down, I said
To make or break you down, I break
All lying across the ground
Try not to make no sound
To make or break you down, I said
To make or break you down, I break

So keep those voices down
If you don't make no sound
A thousand voices making all the mistakes
The fire escapes and this code must break
Step back to get to you
I'm cutting back, I'm falling through
Another day I feel the same
I'm cutting, and I'm bleeding here with you

All lying across the ground
Try not to make no sound
To make or break you down, I said
To make or break you down, I break
All lying across the ground
Try not to make no sound
To make or break you down, I said
To make or break you down, I break1Embed
