L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever) Lyrics
I'm on it, get on it
The troops are on fire
You know I need it much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it, electronic
The troops are on fire
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
I'm waiting for the final trip

Come on it, get on it
I'm carving through a letter bomb
I need it like potions
These drugs are just an hour away
Come on it, electronic
A polyphonic prostitute
The motor's on fire
Messiah for the animals

Ah, Oh come on
We got our backs to the wall
Get on and watch out, say
You're gonna kill us all
Oh, I'm on it, get on it
The troops are on fire
You know I need it much closer
I'm trading just a little more
Step on it, electronic
The troops are on fire
I'm much deeper, a sleeper
Messiah for the animals

Ah, oh come on, say
We got our backs to the wall
Get on, uh, and watch out, uh
Before you kill us all
Ah, oh come on, say
We got our backs to the wall
Get on, and watch out, uh
Before you kill us all9Embed
