I.D LyricsNo one else is here
And I can't get a sense of nothing
No one else gets high
And I can't sleep cause I got nothing
Feeling I have lost
Control to a higher force
Music is my, my whore
No one else is here
And I can't get a sense of nothing
No one else comes clean
And I can't sleep, cause I got nothing
Feeling I have lost
Control to a higher force
Music is my, my whore
Music is mine, music is mine1Embed
