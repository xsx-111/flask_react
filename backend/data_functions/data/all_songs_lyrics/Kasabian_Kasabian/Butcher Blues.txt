Butcher Blues Lyrics
Coco, believe me
I'm a lonesome man
I wanna get stoned and trip some wires
I wanna get myself underground
I said that, you must believe me
When I say I'm fighting the dead
Lying low across the evening
Can you see the lumps on my head?
But I got these voices that just keep singing out

Saying, "I just can't stop losing control"
I said that I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
I said that I just can't stop losing control

Trench wander pavement
Trying to score some love
In the corner of the city
Matching faces with fees
I guess that you never been here
By the look upon ya face
Standing with all the whores and cannibals
In the censored race
But I got these voices that just keep singing out
Saying, "I just can't stop losing control"
I said that I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
I said that I just can't stop losing control

You must believe me
When I say I'm fighting the dead
Lying low across the evening
Can you see the lumps on my head?
I guess that you never been here
By the look upon ya face
Standing with all the whores and cannibals
In the censored race
Well, I got these voice that just keep singing out

Saying, "I just can't stop losing control"
I said that I just can't stop losing control
I just can't stop losing control
I said that I just can't stop losing control

Well, I got these voicesEmbed
