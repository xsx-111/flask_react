U Boat Lyrics

I sit and wait for you
'Cause this war's never over
And I hear the talk in codes
If you want me then come get me
You want me so come get me

I'm standing with my allies
Selling arms to strangers
Watch them shoot you down

There ain't nothing I would say to you
But I know your eyes are fearing
And I watch as you creep by
Won't find my way, won't let go
Find my way, won't let go

I'm standing with my allies
Selling guns to strangers
Sit and let me sin


See the stones coming at my window
Ever since then I have not been conscious
To all the dreams that have been passed on to me
Will be gone, it's almost over
Will be gone, has come so close to me
Settle back, come and start the fire
They're all part of the big machine, now
Shed the angles, oh, from both forces
Overcome by the need to fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, 'cause the reason is treason

See the stones coming at my window
See they left me no protection
Tell his family that he will be okay
K-I-LL!
Turn away from selfish silence
You get fed as your country's using you
Shed the angles, oh, from both forces
Overcome by the need to fight it
Fight it, fight it, fight it, fight it

Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, 'cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, 'cause the reason is treason
Here come the morning that I say goodbye to ya
Here come the morning that I'll say goodbye
But I don't turn around, 'cause the reason is treasonEmbed
