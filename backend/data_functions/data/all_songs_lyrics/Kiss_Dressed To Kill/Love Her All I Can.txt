Love Her All I Can Lyrics
I remember the times
I was lonely without her
Now she's mine
And I spend my time dreaming about her

Love her all I can and try and understand
The things that make her glad
The things that make her sad
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry
And when the world looks bad
She's never ever sad
She's so easy to please
And it doesn't take money, no no
We can have a good time
When the skies aren't sunny, oh

I love her all I can and try and understand
The things that make her glad
The things that make her sad
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry
And when the world looks bad
She's never ever sad
Wow

I remember the times
I was lonely without her
Now she's mine, and I spend
My time dreaming about her, ah

I love her all I can and try and understand
The things that make her glad
The things that make her sad
I'm a lucky guy, I hardly ever cry
And when the world looks bad
She's never ever sad
