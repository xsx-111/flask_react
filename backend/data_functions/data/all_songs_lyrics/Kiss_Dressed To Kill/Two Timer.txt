Two Timer Lyrics
She thinks she's high fashion
She thinks she looks divine
And that's what I keep tellin' her
I tell her all the time

And she tells me she likes fast cars
She says she likes mine the best
And just because of that, baby
You think she'd forget the rest, no no no

Just call me a three time loser
That's all I'll ever be
'Cause my baby's such a two timer
You know she's two timing, she's a-two timing me

Two-timer, my baby is a two timer
My baby's a two timer
My baby's a two timer
My baby, she's a-two timing me, timer
Two timer
Just call me a three time loser
That's all I'll ever be
'Cause my baby's such a two timer
You know she's two timing, she's a-two timing me
Two timer, two timer
My baby's a two timer
My baby's a two timer
My baby, she's a-two timing me
Two timer
My baby is a two timer
She's nothin' but a two timer
It's the truth, baby, you're a two timer
My baby is a two timer
My baby is a two timerEmbed
