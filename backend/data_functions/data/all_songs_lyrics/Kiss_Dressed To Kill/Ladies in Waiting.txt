Ladies in Waiting Lyrics
So you've been to the market
And the meat looks good tonight
And the ladies in waiting
Will show you what it's all about

Their selection is inviting
They sure look hot tonight
And the ladies in waiting
Will show you what it's all about

And so you move on down the line
All the ladies are looking fine, so fine

Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting

So you move on down the line
All the ladies are looking fine

The selection is inviting
They sure look hot tonight
And the ladies in waiting
Will show you what it's all about
And so you move on down the line
All the ladies are looking fine, so fine

Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting

Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waiting
Ladies in waitingEmbed
