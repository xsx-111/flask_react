Room Service Lyrics
I'm feeling low, no place to go
And I'm a-thinking that I'm gonna scream
Because a hotel all alone
Is not a rock and roll star's dream
But just when I'm about
To shut the light and go to bed
A lady calls and asks if I'm too tired
Or if I'm just too dead for

(Room service) Baby, I could use a meal
(Room service) You do what you feel
(Room service) I take the pleasure with the pain
I can't say no
My plane's delayed and I'm afraid
They're gonna keep me waiting here till nine
Then a stewardess in a tight blue dress says
"I got the time"
But just as I'm about
To take my coat and get my flight
She says "Oh please," she's on her knees
And one more time before I leave, I get some
(Room service) Baby, I could use a meal
(Room service) You do what you feel
(Room service) I take the pleasure with the pain
I can't say no, no

In my home town, I'm hangin' 'round
With all the ladies treating me real good
A sweet sixteen looking hot and mean says
"I wish you would"
But just as I'm about
To tell her, "Yes, I think I can"
I see her dad, he's getting mad
And all the time, he knows that I'm in need of

(Room service) Baby, I could use a meal
(Room service) You do what you feel
(Room service) I take the pleasure with the pain
I can't say no
(Room service) Baby, I could use a meal
(Room service) You do what you feel
(Room service) I take the pleasure with the pain
I can't say no, I can't say no
(Room service) Baby, I could use a meal
(Room service) You do what you feel
(Room service) You take the pleasure with the pain
I can't say no
(Room service) Well maybe baby, room serviceEmbed
