Anything for My Baby Lyrics
(Anything for my baby)
I would steal (anything for my baby)
I'd wheel and deal (anything for my baby)
Oh
I'm in love and it feels so good
'Cause I need her, don't mistreat her
And I tell her so
When I saw her and she looked my way
I was lonely, she's my only
And I gotta say that

I would steal (anything for my baby)
I'd wheel and deal (anything for my baby)
Crawl or kneel (anything for my baby)
In the morning, when I raise my head
She's beside me, she can hide me
When I'm feeling low
If I'm thinking everything's all wrong
My girl shakes me, she awakes me
Then I really know that
I would steal (anything for my baby)
I'd wheel and deal (anything for my baby)
Crawl or kneel (anything for my baby)
Don't you know that
I would steal (anything for my baby)
I would wheel and deal (anything for my baby)
I would crawl or kneel (anything for my baby)
I'd do anything
I would give (anything for my baby)
I would die or live (anything for my baby)
I would t-t-t-t-take or give (anything for my baby)
Yes, I would take (anything for my baby)
I would build or break (anything for my baby)
I would rob or take (anything for my baby)
I would do anything for my baby
I would steal (anything for my baby)
I would wheel and dealEmbed
