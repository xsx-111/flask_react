Getaway Lyrics
I've been trying to get away, to get away
To leave this old town
I've been trying to see my way, to see my way
So I won't be found
Many times I've felt alone, I've felt alone
But that's all behind
One thing I know, I know
One thing is that

I know I have to go
Got no dough
Should I stay, or should I go
Gotta get away
Don't wanna stay
Leaving tomorrow by subway
Some people, they tell me, they tell me
I've been here too long
It don't compel me, they tell me
I just don't belong
Sometimes I wonder, I wonder
What's right or what's wrong
One thing I know, I know
One thing is that
I know I have to go
Got no dough
Should I stay, or should I go
Gotta get away
Don't wanna stay
Leaving tomorrow by subway

(I gotta get away)
Get away, get away, get away
(I gotta get away)
Yeah, baby, get away
(Gotta, gotta, gotta get away)
Wow, just gotta get awayEmbed
