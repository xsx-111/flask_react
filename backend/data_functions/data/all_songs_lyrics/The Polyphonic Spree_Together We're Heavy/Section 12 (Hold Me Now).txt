Section 12 (Hold Me Now) Lyrics
(He started the day with a mood and a shake)
(He was finely arranged)
(And someone said with a cold, hard chest, "You're a mess!")
(He woke up at nights)
(He thought he was twice)
(He was moving away)
('Cause everyone thinks that it goes away with age)

(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)
(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)
You better be cool at the time

He's walking along with his soul in his lungs
(Ba dum, ba dum, ba da dum)
You stare at him long, you can find a new song
(Ba dum, ba dum, ba da dum)
Everyone thinks they've got a new phrase
(Ba dum, ba dum, ba da dum)
But you're still miles away
You're still miles away
I said, "You're still miles away"
(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)
(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)


(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)
(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)
(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)
(Hold me now)
(Don't start shakin')
(You keep me safe)
(Don't ever think you're the only one)
(When times are tough in your new age)
