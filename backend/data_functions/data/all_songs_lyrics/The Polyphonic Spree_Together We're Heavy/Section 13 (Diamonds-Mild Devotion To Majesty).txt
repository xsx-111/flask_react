Section 13 (Diamonds/Mild Devotion To Majesty) LyricsDon't fall in love with diamond rings
Or tragedy will somehow find its way
In all that you hold true
Keep 'em amazed with your mild devotion to majesty
In some ill quoted phase
In all that you hold true
What would you do?
If it all came up to you
And love had a new place to play
What would you do?
If it all came up to you
And love had a new place to play today?
Holding on, holding on sunshine
Keep the light on in your soul
Holding on, holding on sunshine all day
Keep the light on in your soul
On your own, on your own
The rest is good
What would you do?
If it all came up to you
(All came up to you)
And love had a new place to play?
(To play)
What would you do?
(What would you say?)
If it all came up to you
(All came up to you)
And love had a new place to play today?
(To play)
See those superstars
Tidal waves of broken cars again?
I'll be flying high
See those superstars
Tidal waves of broken cars again?
I'll be flying high
What would you do
(What would you say?)
If it all came up to you
(All came up to you)
And love had a new place to play?
(To play)
What would you do
(What would you say?)
If it all came up to you
(All came up to you)
And love had a new place to play today?
