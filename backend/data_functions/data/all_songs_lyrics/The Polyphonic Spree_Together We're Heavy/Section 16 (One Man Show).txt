Section 16 (One Man Show) LyricsShe said goodnight to all the lights that made her seem to glow
Her hair parades for him to stay, but he decides to go
He makes his way in subtle plays some times he says hello
It takes him days to move her way, she knows its time to go
Coz time doesnt go along the way now she sits right down to find the one man show
Its a beautiful day, its time to leave, somebody
The house is bold and so much colder than nights they'd ever know
She bends her knees and tries to scream and says its time to go
She moves her lips her words are gifts he stares as she lets go
And trades a space for her new place in a world she wants to know
Coz time doesnt go along the way now she sits right down
Coz time doesnt go along the way now she sits right down to find the one man show
It's a beautiful day, its time to leave, somebody
It means a lot to find it so easy it takes a lot to find yourself way down
It means a lot to find it so easy, and it takes a lot to find yourself way downEmbed
