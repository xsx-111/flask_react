Section 19 (When the Fool Becomes a King) LyricsLove the life you choose
Keep yourself feeling brand new
And love your strife with life
Everyone wants to know why
And love your strife with youth
Keep yourself feeling brand new
And love your strife with God
Yeah, everyone wants to know love…
Love, love, love…
Songs, which you said, with this crucifix, now
You're shaking it but you think to yourself, "Everything will be fine."
And love, what they said, with this crucifix, yeah
You're shaking it but you think to yourself, "Everything will be fine."
Hail to the sky, hail to the sky
Time to watch a show, time to watch a show
The trees wanna grow, the trees wanna grow
Grow, grow, grow
Still a man
It seems the time has gone away
But all at once you knew your mission well
You're civilized, it seems soon to paralyze
The thought became the mission of your life
The best place is to find your home
The coolest is to find your way
The best place is to find your home in time
Till when the fool becomes a king
Step right up and sound off again
The way to the new world has once begun
We tried to find ourselves within the light
Which made demands that much longer
We move much closer than they have before
To strike our ways and go forth
The time is now, we move once again
We reach for dreams we've never known
Stranger to the sun you've seen the light
Your sixteen ways will blow your mind
If you open up to the sky
You know the time is right when you reach for the sun
And it makes me smile on my wayEmbed
