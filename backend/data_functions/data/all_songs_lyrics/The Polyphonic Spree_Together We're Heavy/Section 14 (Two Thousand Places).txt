Section 14 (Two Thousand Places) LyricsYou gotta be good
You gotta be strong
You gotta be two thousand places at once
Sold inside, you'll find it's right between the eyes
You'll never know the shame entirely fits you
You gotta be good
You gotta be strong
You gotta be two thousand places at once
And I know there's a lot outside the window
It seems a lot for you and me
It takes the sun to make the sidewalk
It takes the moon to burn my feet
It means a lot to take some time
I know it's right
You gotta be good
You gotta be strong
You gotta be two thousand places at once
It seems a lot to show
You've got the time to grow
It seems so good
Zoom, zoom, zoomâ€¦
And time will show the way
And love will shine today
And time will go away so love can growEmbed
