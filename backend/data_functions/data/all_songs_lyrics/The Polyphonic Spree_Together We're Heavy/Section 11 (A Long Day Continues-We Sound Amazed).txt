Section 11 (A Long Day Continues/We Sound Amazed) LyricsUntil tomorrow...
Until tomorrow, the only voice was far away
Until tomorrow, the only sound was my mistake
Until tomorrow, it's all I can say
Take the time to find the world another way
I want to be more than yesterday
And somehow find a way to this new religion
If the world can compromise another faith
I wanna be more than yesterday
And somehow find a way to your new religion
If the world collapses, I know I want to be yours in time
And somehow find the way to your new religion
If the world collapses, I know I want to be yours in time
And somehow find a way to this new religion
It seems it's more than I can carry on
It seems it's more than I can take
It seems the time is finally now
I think I have the right to speak
Take them all together and shove 'em off
Keep them all together and keep 'em warm
Take them all together and shove 'em off
Keep them all together and keep 'em warm
Take them all together and shove 'em offEmbed
