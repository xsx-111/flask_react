Section 17 (Suitcase Calling) LyricsEntirely for you. Soon you will see that there's more there to me I will show
The days went softly, suitcase calling me to the needs of our fond memories
The days went softly, suitcase calling me to the needs of our fond memories of our love. In the moment, a sparkled sky. It's amazing we all know. It's the coolest waterslide. It's amazing we will show. What would you do to keep yourself holding on?
And what would you say to keep yourself holding on too?
When the light comes today I'll show my face. It's the seasons that keep me hanging on. It's the reason it keeps me strong. It keeps me hanging on and on and on
When the mood gets me so far, then you go
The places, you take me. It seems like it's always better until my heart. It starts to show. The places, you take me. It seems like it's always better until my heart. It starts to grow. It's the feel good time of day. You gotta go
Too late to stay
It's the seasons that keep me on and on
You got no place to play
It's the reasons that keep me strong. They keep me hanging on and on and on. When the mood gets me so far, then you go
Time to feel the softest blow. Waited for days for this night to get colder
Time to feel the softest blow. Waited for days for this night, for this day to grow
For this day to growEmbed
