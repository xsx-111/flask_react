Ice Age LyricsHeard it's old age
Better check out your personal stock
Swallowed a silver dollar
Now you got nothin' to hock
World ain't movin' too fast
You just movin' too slow
No matter what you did before
Ain't what you know, it's who you know
Ain't no age of innocence
Ladies and gents
It don't make no sense
Seen and the unseen
KKK, CIA
All playing in the same cage
Livin' in the ice age, livin' in the ice age
Now it's cold age
Worrying about the rent, ain't got a cent
Got no cash to flash
Now you ain't got no friends
Be losin' jobs
Starting losin' hope, using dope
Now we all hangin' from the end of our rope
Ain't no age of innocence
Ladies and gents
It don't make no sense
Seen and the unseen
KKK, CIA
All playing in the same cage
Living in the ice age, play
This is the ice age
Smokin' crack, firing up blunts
Wind up in jail, doin' a stint, being a punk
Kids with Uzis, ice suckers
Death is a always thing
If you ain't iced, you got the breath of life within
Ain't no age of innocence
Ladies and gents
It don't make no sense
Seen and the unseen
KKK, CIA
All playing in the same cage
Ain't no age of innocence
Ladies and gents
It don't make no sense
Seen and the unseen
KKK, CIA
All playing in the same cage
Living in an ice age, living in an ice ageEmbed
