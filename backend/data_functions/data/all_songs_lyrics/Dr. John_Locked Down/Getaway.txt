Getaway LyricsStrung out on thrills, livin' wild
On a crooked road wearing a cockeyed smile
Never cared where I'd been
Only that I'd see you again
I was always ready to make a play
Loved you so, made a getaway
Dues I paid is my greatest sin
Will I ever see you again?
See you again?
See you again?
No eyes to hang in a burnt out hell
Padded dungeon's jailhouse cell
Tried to break us, all we did was bend
A love that will never end
Will never end
Will never endEmbed
