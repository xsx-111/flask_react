My Children, My Angels LyricsLove y'all, ain't nothin' you can do about it
Ain't tryin' to make excuses but then
Just wanna be there for y'all as a friend
Your pa did a lotta work on hisself
Just know I love y'all more than anyone else

Tell me 'bout your desires right now
Don't trip on loose wires
I'll show you how
My babies, I wish I'd never made you blue
My children, my angels
I'm talkin' to you
One is too many
Billions ain't never enough
Don't take the easy road
There's no shortcuts
Spirit kingdom do
What we can't do for ourselves
Don't put nothin' down
Without lovin' everybody else

Tell me 'bout your desires right now
Don't trip on loose wires
I'll show you how
My babies, I wish I'd never made you blue
My children, my angels
I'm talkin' to you
Tell me 'bout your desires right now
Don't trip on loose wires
I'll show you how
My babies, I wish I'd never made you blue
My children, my angels
I'm talkin' to youEmbed
