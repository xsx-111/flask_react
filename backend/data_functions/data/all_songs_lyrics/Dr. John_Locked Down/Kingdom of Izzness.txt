Kingdom of Izzness LyricsBetter move fast, you gotta travel light
Don't let nothing pass
When you in the night
Wonder who's who
If you don't know what's what
History's version make me wonder, but
Got my attention, on all that I witness
My nuclear vision is a everybody's business
We livin' here in the kingdom of izzness
Can't find ourselves no matter what we do
Feel our way around getting half the truth
History's a mystery of the chosen few
Don't matter if you Muslim, Christian or Jew
Buddhist, Mason, Hindi or Voodoo
My nuclear vision is a everybody's business
We're livin' here in the kingdom of izzness
The world is lost
It's everybody's business
The world is lost, it's everybody's business
In the kingdom of the izzness
Can I get a witness? Yeah, yeah
Don't know who we are, where we are
In the middle of nowhere and it don't seem far
Doin' what we can, wonder where we stand
Lost in confusion, hopin' somebody knows the plan
Got my attention on all that I witness
My nuclear vision is everybody's business
We're livin' here in the kingdom of izzness
Better move fast, you gotta travel light
Don't let nothing pass
When you're in the night
Wonder who's who
If you don't know what's what
History's version make me wonder, but
Got my attention on all that I witness
My nuclear vision is everybody's business
We livin' here in the kingdom of izznessEmbed
