Big Shot LyricsI know you're holdin'
But hold it down
Don't oversell it
And you can hang around
Never been done like I can
Ain't never gonna be done again
Ain't stuck up, don't put on no airs
Fuss and cuss, and I never split hairs
Ain't never was, never gonna be
Another big shot like me
I'm the big shot
Laying in the cut for you to see
Let's me and you go off somewhere, child
I do your thing in my own kinda style
If I don't cure ya, I'm sure to kill ya
Got the remedy that's sure to heal ya
Ain't never was, never gonna be
Another big shot like me
I'm the big shot
Laying in the cut for you to see
If you don't follow that ratty second line file
Snatch ya up, light ya up, make you smile
If you're stalled at the wall
Gonna be balled with style
Send ya to the precinct for loitering, child
Gold diggers, money wasters, that's my groove
Hey child, whose little who is you?
I'm the big shot
Turn ya on, shut 'em off, that's right
Saturate ya, when I signify
Fragile child, handle you with care
I can rough and tough it if you like it there
It never was, never gonna be
Another big shot like me
It never was, never gonna be
Another big shot like me
It never was, never gonna be
Another big shot like me
I'm the big shot, laying in the cut for you
For all you to seeEmbed
