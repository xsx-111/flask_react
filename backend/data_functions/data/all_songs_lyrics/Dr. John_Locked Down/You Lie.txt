You Lie LyricsHigh price lyin'
Nosey pryin'
Twistin' facts
Behind their backs
So low down
Over town
Bad mouth friends
Till the end
Girl you hear
Say this go get 'em
You lie 'em
Truth sound better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
Rank and evil
Edge of legal
Bent church steeple
Connin' people
Back fence talk
Chicken squawk
Square goods save
Tidal wave
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
No plea bargain
No cheap cop out
The truth sound better
Than what you're about
No plea bargain
No cheap cop out
The truth sound better
Than what you're about
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds better
In hell, Satan's go-getter
You lie when the truth sounds betterEmbed
