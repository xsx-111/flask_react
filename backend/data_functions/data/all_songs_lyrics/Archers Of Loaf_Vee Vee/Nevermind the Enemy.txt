Nevermind the Enemy LyricsLet's raise the glass
Let's peel the eyelids back
And toast them
And we can watch their plans fall through
I've found a reason to quit
And I can stop when I want
And I can call it off any time I want to
If I could light your cash
You can smoke your stash
Sucking on your best friend's skin
Nevermind your friends
Nevermind your friends
We'll make a joke of them
We'll make a joke
Nevermind your friends 'cause you can make a joke of them. (2 times)
Let's stick ourselves
Let's tack their earlobes to the radio
We'll watch our heroes trip and fall
I've found a reason to quit
And I can stop when I want
And I can call it off any time I want to
When you light your cash
You can smoke your stash
Sucking on your best friend's skin
Nevermind your friends
Nevermind your friends
We'll make a joke of them
We'll make a joke
Nevermind your friends 'cause you can make a joke of them. (4 times)Embed
