The Worst Has Yet to Come LyricsWe're on the outside
And we're all making fun of you
You're on the inside
Digging through your shit
If you could see that it's not your fault
I can  just about anything
There's no correlation between our aggravations
There's no correlation between our aggravations
There's no correlation between our aggravations
There's no correlation and the worst is yet to come
Don't wake me up in the middle of the fight
You're always wrong and I'm always right
Trying so hard to make the same fun twice
You're always wrong and I'm always right
There's no correlation between our aggravations
There's no correlation between our aggravations
There's no correlation between our aggravations
There's no correlation and the worst is yet to comeEmbed
