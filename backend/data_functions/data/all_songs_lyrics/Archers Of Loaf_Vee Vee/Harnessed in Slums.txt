Harnessed in Slums Lyrics
Too harnessed in slums, to rock you wrap your throat
Standing over your common ground
Snuff the leader with the bad assed plan
Take what you want from the palm of his hand
We're running joke, running jokes, running dry
Strip the color from the meat of my eye
Lick the loser, just don't make him stick
Lay it on heavy and make the wrong size fit

I want waste
We want waste
They want waste
Slaves want waste

Too harnessed in slums, to rock you wrap your throat
Standing over your common ground
We're running joke, running jokes, running dry
Strip the color from the meat of my eye

I want waste
They want waste
We want waste
They want waste
Side to side, with the tired smile
Cut into your face
You let me down for the second time straight
With thugs and scum and punks and freaks
Are harnessed in slums but they want to be free

Snuff the leader with the bad assed plan
Take what you want from the palm of his hand
Lick the loser, just don't make him stick
Lay it on heavy and make the wrong size fit

I want waste
We want waste
They want waste
Slaves want waste

Side to side, with the tired smile
Cut into your face
You let me down for the second time straight
With thugs and scum and punks and freaks
Are harnessed in slums, but they want to be free
