Nostalgia LyricsI've got the skin of a shark
And I'm gonna make a muscle
Just holding onto filth
Of the pornographic slut
I've got an ill will
And a pair of brass knuckles
 cutting through ribs
It's a tour de force
Nostalgia
Nostalgia
Nostalgia
Nostalgia
 on to grease
Cause grease is the word
And I'm never never sure
But I'm sure you're never right
It's the secret agent man
And a cartoon hero

Nostalgia
Nostalgia
Nostalgia
