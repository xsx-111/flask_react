Death in the Park LyricsA death in the park
A death in the dark
I'm calling the cops
Cops, calling all cars
It's not the way they want it to be
It's not the way they wanted it to be
The freaks on the phone
The freaks in my home
My elbows propped so
I could take a cheap shot at you
You're not the one I want you to be
You're not the one I want you to be
It's always the same people
Pissing the same people off
Always the same ones
Calling the cops
Why do I ask you
So many questions?
Why do I ask you
When you don't know anything?
You're not the one I want you to be
You're not the one I want you to be
Please cut us off
Please make us stop. (?)
From saying stupid things again
Saying stupid things
Sure, I can put you on the guest list
Of course, I can put you on the guest list
It's always the same people
Pissing the same people off
Always the same ones
Calling the cops
A death in the park
A death in the dark
All I want is empathy from you
The freaks on the phone
The freaks in my home
And all I want is everything from you
They're calling the cops
Cops, calling all cars
Calling all cop cars
Calling all cars
It's always the same people
Pissing the same people off
Always the same ones
Calling the cops
(repeat)
A death in the park
A death in the dark
And all I want is empathy from you
The freaks on the phones
The freaks in my home
And all I want is empathy from you
They're calling the cops
Cops, calling all cars
Calling all cop cars
Calling all carsEmbed
