Underdogs of Nipomo LyricsBlack and white
But the time is strychnine
You soak it down in your rubbing alcohol
You're saying you're underdogs
Knowing what they don't want
And what they don't want
Strange boy
Scrounging through his pockets
Scraping over nachos
And a microbrew
Stuck in the middle one sucking up, up town
Clogging up the quarters at the arcade
I said you're better than me at this
So much better at this
So much better of forcing the matter of
Kill the running joke before it grows
Till everyone you owe
Collects and goes away
I said you're better than me at this
So much better at this
So much better of forcing the matter of
Kill the running joke before it grows
Till everyone you owe
Collects and goes away
Goes away
Goes away
Goes away
I said you're better than me at this
So much better at this
So much better at forcing the matter of
Kill the running joke before it grows
Till everyone you owe
Collects and goes away
I said you're better than me at this
So much better at this
So much better at forcing the matter of
Kill the running joke before it grows
Till everyone you owe
Collects
I'm not at home 'cause I'm going to Nipomo, C.A
Just leave the money on the soundman's check
I'm on the middle box sucking up, up town
Knowing what we don't want, what they don't want
I'm not at home 'cause I'm going to Nipomo, C.A
But lay your money on the soundman's check
I'm on the middle box sucking up, up town
Knowing what we don't want, what we don't wantEmbed
