Fabricoh LyricsFabricoh is the favorite sound around
Watch the wholesale slaughter of the whole downtown
Stepping off the ship in limbo
It's the spit on his chin that makes us nervous
It sets the high price from the crowd that's gathering
Cutting off the false communication
And we missed the registration
In our mental hibernation
With the strangest violation of all
Fabricoh will have his say someday
What's to land the blow to the ones in the way
Swearing off his occupations
It's the spit on our chins that makes us strong
It's the sounding off of a crowd that's gathering
Rocking out, rocking out
There's a lovely indication
You go past the Bronx station
To get the wrongest violation of all
It's the spit on his chin that makes us nervous
It's the spit on our chins that makes us numb
It's the high price from the crowd that's gathering
Cutting off the false communication
Slipping off the ship in limbo
Getting out of a crowd that's rocking
Rocking it out (10 times)Embed
