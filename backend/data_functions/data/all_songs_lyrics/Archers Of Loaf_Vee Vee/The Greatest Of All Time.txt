The Greatest Of All Time LyricsThey caught and drowned the front man
Of the world's worst rock & roll band
He was out of luck, because nobody gave a fuck
The jury gathered all around the aqueduct
Drinking and laughing and lighting up
Reminiscing just how bad he sucked, singing
Throw him in the river
Throw him in the river
Throw him in the river
Throw the bastard in the river
And way up in the sky
Is the leader of the greatest band of all time
Blasted from a plane
Heading back home to the U. S. A
The people gathered all around the radio
To hear the transmissions from the devil's soul
Locked and stunned and sick and cold
Toasting to their hero
Toasting to their hero
Toasting to their hero
A toast to their dead hero
The underground is overcrowded. (4 times)
The people gathered all around the radio
To hear the transmissions from the devil's soul
Locked and stunned and sick and cold
Toasting their dead hero
Toasting their dead hero
Toasting their dead hero
A toast to thier dead hero1Embed
