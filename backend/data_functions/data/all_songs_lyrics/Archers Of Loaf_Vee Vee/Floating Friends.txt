Floating Friends LyricsAll of my friends have floated away
They clog up the valley and drift up to outer space
It was just like the old ones
Just like the times before
When all of my friends floated away
They always cry out, one by one
(Living in their pockets, living in their pockets)
They were always sincere
Hip to the freshest ideas
The latest ideas
I'm clinging to fresh, new mistakes
I've got some new faults to force on you
It won't be hard to prove you wrong
It's never hard to prove you wrong
When I'm clinging to fresh, new mistakes
And I've got a smile one mile long
(Hidden in their pockets, Hidden in their pockets)
I'm always sincere
Hip to the latest ideas
The freshest ideas
All of my friends have floated away
Connect the valley to the astral plane
All of my friends have floated away
Connect the valley to the astral plane
All of my friends have floated away
Connect the valley to the astral plane
All of my friends have floated away
Connect the valley to the astral planeEmbed
