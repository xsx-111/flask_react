Crystal Mountain Lyrics
Built from blind faith
Passed down from self-induced fantasy
Turn a page to justify
Conjuring power - it opens wide
On your seventh day

Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive
All that you want
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with a cross-turned dagger

Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes its form
Inside crystal mountain
Commandments are reborn

All the traps are set to confine
All who get in the way of the divine
In sight and in mind of the hypocrite
A slave to the curse forever confined

Shatter the myth
Don't cut yourself
On your words against
Dreams made of steel
Stronger than any faith
That inflicts pain and fear

Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive
All that you want
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your
Cross-turned dagger

Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes its form
Inside crystal mountain
Commandments are reborn6Embed
