Zero Tolerance Lyrics
In the dark of night, abusing a portion of light
While others are sleeping and some are escaping
A serpent spews out fantasy, unjustified blasphemy
That cannot be condoned

It must be strange to not have lived so far into existence

This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won, let justice be done

There will be zero tolerance for the creator of hallowed intentions
There will be zero tolerance, fate is your deciding God

Karma comes crashing down, leaving a very deep scar
Exposing a door to the source of a verbal whore
Machines supply the altar, where virtuous lives are sacrificed

It must be strange to not have lived so far into existence

This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won, let justice be doneEmbed
