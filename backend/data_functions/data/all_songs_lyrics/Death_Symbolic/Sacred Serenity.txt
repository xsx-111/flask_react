Sacred Serenity Lyrics
Wherever we go, whatever we do
Your shadow is not far behind our steps
And our breath
Protecting and watching all...
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?

Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure

Sacred is the gift
That they have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
From destruction of time

Maybe we could take a step back
And discover what leads us to attack
Time that is short - distance unknown
For them, each day life has just begun
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?
Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure

Sacred is the gift
That they have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
From destruction of timeEmbed
