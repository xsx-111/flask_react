1,000 Eyes Lyrics
Crossing the line into the other side
Emerging as prisoners
To the emptiness of time

To the left and to the right
From behind - they're out of sight
Plunging into a newfound
Age of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage

Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew

Living in the pupil of one thousand eyes

Was it overlooked in front of all our faces?
Now, all the mistakes and secrets
Cannot be erased
Viewing the blind complexity
By which laws were justified
To erase simplicity

To the left and to the right
From behind - they're out of sight
Plunging into a new found
Age of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage

Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew

Living in the pupil of one thousand eyes

We are enslaved now...1Embed
