Happy Together LyricsThought that I would forget you?
Heaven knows that's not my style
And that I would let you...
Walk away without at least goodbye
You shouldn't let those feelings fool you
You shouldn't let those feelings get you down
We're happy together now
Feeling you close to me baby
Happy till the end of time
We're happy together now
Feeling you close to me baby
Happy till the end of time
We're happy together.. happy together
Thought that I was a devil?
But I'm an angel waiting for my wings
And I was out to hurt you?
But I've no wish to ever cause you pain
Cause there's enough in this world of sorrow
I've no wish to add some more to it
We're happy together now
Feeling you close to me baby
Happy till the end of time
We're happy together now
Feeling you close to me baby
Happy till the end of time
We're happy together.. happy together
I don't hear a symphony
All I hear is the beating of wings
What I'm trying to say is you're my only
We're happy together now
Feeling you close to me baby
Happy till the end of time
We're happy together now
Feeling you close to me baby
Happy till the end of time
We're happy together.. happy together NOWEmbed
