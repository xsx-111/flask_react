Sleep Lyrics

There was no place like it, in the whole world, like Coney Island when I was a youngster. No place in the world like it, and it was so fabulous. Now it's shrunk down to almost nothing, you see. And, uh, I still remember in my mind how things used to be, and uh, you know, I feel very bad. But people from all over the world came here. From all over the world, it was the playground -- they called it the playground of the world, over here. Anyways, uh, I... uh... you know...

They don't do that anymore. Things changed, you see. They don't sleep anymore on the beach...
