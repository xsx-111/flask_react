Mr. to You Lyrics
Dorian Electra

No first name basis, it's not like that
I want you on the edge, don't relax
Don't get way too casual, casual

You can call me Mister, Mister
It's Mister to you
Don't get it twisted, twisted
Don't get confused
I want you to listen, listen
I thought you knew
It's Mister to you

I wanna keep it formal with you
Because I'm never normal with you
By now, you know just what to do, what to do

You can call me Mister, Mister
It's Mister to you
Don't get it twisted, twisted
Don't get confused
I want you to listen, listen
I thought you knew, yeah
It's Mister to you
Mister, mister, mis-mister, oh
Mister, mister, mis-mis-mister
Call me Mister, Mister (Dorian Electra)
Mister, oh
I-I-I-It's Mister to you

I don't make anybody call me Mister
I don't make anybody but you, no
I don't make anybody call me Mister
I don't make anybody but you, oh
But you, but you, but you
Nobody calls me that but you, but you, but you
I don't make anybody do, I do, I do
Nobody calls me that but you
But you, but you, but you

You can call me Mister
It's Mister to you
Don't get it twisted
Don't get confused
I want you to listen
I thought you knew, yeah
I-I-I-It's Mister to you, yeah2Embed
