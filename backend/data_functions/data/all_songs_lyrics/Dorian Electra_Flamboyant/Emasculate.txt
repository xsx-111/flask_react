Emasculate Lyrics
Oh-ooh yeah
Uh-huh, ooh, oh

I got the strength of an ox
I got the speed of a fox
Yeah, but I want it to stop
I'm feeling toxic, oh
Hate to say I’m too strong
I've been this way for too long
So hard, so raw
Turn me off,  yeah, I'm toxic

Dominate, humiliate
I can’t wait to be free

Emasculate me
Cut the man right out of me
Emasculate me
Emasculate, emasculate
Do it now, I can't wait, baby
I'm begging for you to come save me
Emasculate me
Emasculate, emasculate
Too much man for my own good
Need to kill my own manhood
Lend a hand here if you could
And a knife, tonight
To cut me down to size
And to help me realize
That the man that is inside is a demon
That needs to be exorcised

Oh, oh, oh
(Emasculate me, baby)
You know you got to, you got to, you got to
(Emasculate, emasculate)
Oh, you know I really need to
(Emasculate, emasculate)
You know you got to, you know you got to
You know you got to emasculate me

Emasculate me
Cut the man right out of me
Emasculate me
Emasculate, emasculate
Do it now, I can't wait, baby
I'm begging for you to come save me
Emasculate me
Emasculate, emasculate
Emasculate me
Cut the man right out of me
Emasculate me
Emasculate, emasculate
Do it now, I can't wait, baby
I'm begging for you to come save me
Emasculate me
Emasculate, emasculateEmbed
