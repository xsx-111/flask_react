Adam & Steve Lyrics
In the beginning, there was the word
In nothing but darkness, God made the world
In the beginning, there were just two
Made from the dust, like all of us
In the beginning, the four letter word:
"L-O-V-E" meant nothing to me
But made in His image, we were born
Two of a kind, beginning of time

And God made me
And He loves me, and He loves me
God made me, and Adam and Steve
And He loves me, and He loves me
And God made me, and God made me
And He loves me, and He loves me
God made me, just like Adam and Steve
And He loves me, 'cause God made me

And in the garden, they were both there
Smiling like children without a care
And in the garden, up on the tree
They saw the fruit for you and me
And in the garden, they took a bite
Ashamed of the truth, ashamed of the light
Cast into darkness, they would be damned
For being a man holding hands
And God made me
And He loves me, and He loves me
God made me, and Adam and Steve
And He loves me, and He loves me
And God made me, and God made me
And He loves me, and He loves me
God made me, just like Adam and Steve
And He loves me, 'cause God made me

They want to destroy me, they will all enjoy it
Say I'm an abomination, but I'm God's creation
They all want to crush me, say I am so disgusting
Secretly they love me, just like Him

And God made me
And He loves me, and He loves me
God made me, and Adam and Steve
And He loves me, and He loves me
God made me this way
And He loves me, and He loves me
God made me gay
And He loves me, 'cause God made me
(Made me)
God made me, and Adam and Steve
God made me, you got to believe
God made me, and Madam and Eve
God made me and He loves me3Embed
