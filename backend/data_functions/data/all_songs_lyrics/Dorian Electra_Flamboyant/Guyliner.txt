Guyliner Lyrics
I wake up, open my eyes
Gotta spice it up, yeah, gotta make it shine
Look in the mirror and I'm feeling fine
It's crystal clear that it's time to line my eyes

I'm a guy, don't be surprised
If I take my time to glamorize
No reason why that I can't try
To line my eyes, it feels so right

Guyliner
Yeah, you know I'm wearing
Guyliner
Yeah, and everybody's staring
(Guyliner)
This is the real me, baby
And this ain't no disguise
Guyliner
Ooh-ooh, under my eyes

Wake up, puttin' on my makeup, yeah
Chicks dig it when they see me cry
Wake up, time to make my face up
Chicks dig it, let me tell you why
'Cause I'm a guy, don't be surprised
If I take my time to glamorize
No reason why that I can't try
To line my eyes, it feels so right

Guyliner
Yeah, you know I'm wearing
Guyliner
Yeah, and everybody's staring
(Guyliner)
This is the real me, baby
And this ain't no disguise
Guyliner
Ooh-ooh, under my eyes
Ooh-ooh, under my eyes

Everybody coming at me, they wanna attack me
They wanna wipe me clean
They can make me cry, but they can't make me bleed
Masc for mascara, the feeling of terror
As they watch these tears rolling down
Rolling down, they can't stop me now
I'm a guy, don't be surprised
If I take my time to glamorize
No reason why that I can't try
To line my eyes, it feels so right

Guyliner
Yeah, you know I'm wearing
Guyliner
I'm wearing, nobody can stop me now
Guyliner
This is the real me, baby
And this ain't no disguise
Guyliner, yeah
Guyliner, ooh-ooh, I'm wearing
Guyliner (Guyliner)
Guyliner, under my eyes
Guyliner, it feels so right1Embed
