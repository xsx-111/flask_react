Musical Genius Lyrics
I got the mind of a genius in the body of a man
I always comprehend, and I always understand
How it all fits together, how it can sound that grand
I'm a musical, musical genius, won't you be my fan?

Musical, musical genius
Musical genius
Won't you be my fan?

Pitch perfect, baby, I'm worth it
I sing great, yeah, and I serve it
Mom told me that I deserve it
These trophies and medals galore
When I played at my recital
I made everybody smile
Invented new styles
And genres, sub-genres and more

I got the mind of a genius in the body of a man
And I always comprehend, and I always understand
How it all fits together, how it can sound this grand
I'm a musical, musical genius, won't you be my fan?
Musical, musical genius
Musical genius
Won't you be my fan?

Dorian Electra
Won't you be my fan?Embed
