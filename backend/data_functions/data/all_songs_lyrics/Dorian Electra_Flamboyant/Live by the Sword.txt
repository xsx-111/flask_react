Live by the Sword Lyrics
You wanna hit like this?
You're gonna hurt like this
You wanna live like this?
You’re gonna die like this

Live by the sword, you die by the sword, oh-oh
'Cause I'll get what’s mine, baby
You'll get what's yours, oh-oh-oh
Live by the sword, you die by the sword, oh-oh
'Cause I'll get what's mine, baby
You'll get what's yours

You’ll get what’s yours
If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the sword
You’ll get what's yours
If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the sword

It's cold like the ocean, cold like the rain
Show your devotion, show me the pain
Show me the blood, show me you tried
Show me the tears coming down from your eyes
Live by the sword, you die by the sword, oh-oh
’Cause I'll get what's mine, baby
You'll get what's yours

You'll get what's yours
If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the sword
You'll get what's yours
If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the sword

You wanna live like this?
You're gonna die like this
You wanna kiss like this?
You're gonna cry like this
You wanna hit like this?
You're gonna hurt like this
You wanna live like this?
You're gonna die like this

You'll get what's yours
If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the sword
You'll get what's yours
If you live by the sword
You'll get your reward
If you live by the swordEmbed
