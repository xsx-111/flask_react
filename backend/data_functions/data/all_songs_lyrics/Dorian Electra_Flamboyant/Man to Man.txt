Man to Man Lyrics
Man to man
You gotta let me in
You gotta let me in

You know I ain't straight
But I'ma say it straight to you
I look you in the face
Every time I talk to you
I want to be clear
And not convolute
I'll say what I mean
I expect the same from you

So you want to play rough in the parking lot?
See you acting tough, but I know you're not
We can take it outside, scuffle in the streetlight
I just really wanna fight with you

Man to man, hand to hand
One on one, friend to friend
Are you man enough to soften up?
Are you tough enough to open up?
Man to man
You gotta let me in
You've gotta be the bigger man
You've got to take the higher ground
You gotta put your fists away
You gotta lay your weapons down

So you want to play rough in the parking lot?
See you acting tough, but I know you're not
We can take it outside, scuffle in the streetlight
I just really wanna fight with you

Man to man (Man to man), hand to hand (Hand to hand)
One on one (One on one), friend to friend (Friend to friend)
Are you man enough to soften up? (Soften up)
Are you tough enough to open up? (Brave enough, open up)
Man to man
You gotta let me in

(Man to man to man to man, baby)
You gotta let me in
Don't beat around the bush
Don't talk behind my back
Quit acting cowardly
Don't launch a sneak attack
Just step out here in the daylight
And we can handle this just right
Just take my hand and we can settle this man to man
(Man to man)
Man to man (Man to man), hand to hand (Hand to hand)
One on one (One on one), friend to friend (Friend to friend)
Are you man enough to soften up? (Soften up)
Are you tough enough to open up? (Brave enough, open up)
Man to man
You gotta let me in

(Man to Man)
So you want to play rough in the parking lot? (Man to man)
See you acting tough, but I know you're not (Hand to hand)
We can take it outside, scuffle in the streetlight (One on one)
I just really wanna fight with you (Friend to friend)
Are you man enough to soften up? (Soften it up)
Are you tough enough to open up? (Toughen it up)
Man to man
You gotta let me in9Embed
