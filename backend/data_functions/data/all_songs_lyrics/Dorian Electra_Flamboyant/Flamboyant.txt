Flamboyant Lyrics
I'm a very flaming, flammable guy
Some say my fire burns way too high
Some say they find me too hot to touch
But I, I think it's not enough

Don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to say
You know I like it loud
'Cause that's the only way
No taste for subtlety
And no time for restraint
No, I go all the way

I'm flamboyant, I go all the way
I'm flamboyant, I go all the way
Flamboyant, every day
I'm flamboyant, I go all the way

You always see me putting on a show
I entertain until it's time to go
You know I like to put it on display
I like to work and I like to play
I've always been this way, since I was young
I like to steal the show from you for fun
I do it big and take up lots of space
You know I like to get up in your face
Don't tell me what to do
Don't tell me what to say
You know I like it loud
'Cause that's the only way
No taste for subtlety
And no time for restraint
No, I go, I go, I go all the way

I'm flamboyant, I go all the way (They say)
I'm flamboyant, I go all the way (All the way)
Flamboyant, every day (Every damn day)
I'm flamboyant, I go all the way

Turn down? I never do
I turn down, turn down for what?
They ask me
Turn down? I never do
I turn up, I turn up, I turn up

(All the way)
I'm flamboyant, I go all the way (All the way)
I go all the way (Baby)
I know it drives you crazy
I know it drives you crazy (I go all the way)
I'm flamboyant, I go all the way (All the way)
All the way, all the way, yeah
I'm flamboyant, I go all the way (All the way)
Flamboyant, every day (Every day, all the damn way)
Flamboyant, baby, yeahEmbed
