Career Boy Lyrics
Career boy (Career boy)
Working overtime (Working overtime)
Career boy (I'm a career boy)
One thing on my mind (Got one thing on my mind)

Cheap office coffee
Stays pumping through my veins
(Pumping through my veins now)
I work for the man, yeah
But you know I love the chains
(I love the chains)

I can never fight the feeling
I stay up all night
Workin' so hard after hours
Till I see the sunlight
Stuck up in the office tower
You know it's pure joy
And that's my superpower
I'm a career boy
Career boy
You know they got me working overtime, yeah
Career boy
And you know I got that one track mind, oh yeah
Even after I get what I want
I can see baby, baby
That it's lonely at the top, yeah
Career boy
Nothing is ever gonna make me stop

Business and pleasure
I like to mix the two (Mix it up, mix it up)
Hangin' in the break room
Mixin' it with you

I can never fight the feeling
I stay up all night
Workin' so hard after hours
Till I see the sunlight
Stuck up in the office tower
You know it's pure joy
And that's my superpower
I'm a career boy

Career boy (Career boy)
You know they got me working overtime, yeah
(Working overtime, yeah)
Career boy (Career boy)
And you know I got that one track mind, oh yeah
(One track mind)
Even after I get what I want
I can see baby, baby
That it's lonely at the top (Top)
Yeah
Career boy (Career boy)
Nothing is ever gonna make me stop
(Make me want to stop)

I'm addicted to the work, I
I love the way it hurts, I (Uh)
The suits and pencil skirts
I get what I need 'cause I'm greedy for it
'Cause I'm addicted to the pressure (Addicted to the pressure)
Yeah, but the burden is a pleasure (Burden is a pleasure)
Come on, hit me with your ledger
Close to the edge, face down on the desk, I'm

Career boy (Career boy)
You know they've got me working overtime, yeah
(Working overtime, yeah)
Career boy (Career boy)
And you know I've got that one track mind
(One track mind)
Even after I get what I want
I can see baby, baby
That it's lonely at the top (Top)
Yeah

Career boy (Career boy)
Nothing is ever gonna make me stop (Make me want to stop)
Career boy (Career boy)
Nothing is ever gonna make me stop6Embed
