3 Umbrellas Lyrics
"â€”jump out and do you in"

It's not about us holding hands
I don't have to be on top of your plans
Tucked beneath them I'm showing my teeth
And I could say I love you
I'm hiding beneath my dark
Green umbrellas

Can we talk about the funny things
When we're hanging out the heavy mist leaves
It's how it should be, you like all my songs
And we're all just like brothers
You see me beneath my dark
Green umbrellas

And we're laughing at this lover's scene
And we're laughing at the older brothers
I've been hiding under green umbrellas
I've been hiding under green umbrellas

Do other people act like fools
I wonder if they feel like we do
We're always teasing, and I can't imagine
If I didn't know you
I don't take for granted my
Three umbrellas
And if you don't wanna talk, let's sing
That it's been about us finding new things
That's always pleasing to share with some people
But they'll never know you
Or just how I feel about your
Three umbrellas

And we're laughing at the lover's flings
They we're laughing at the older brothers
I've been hiding under green umbrellas
I've been hiding under green umbrellas

And it softens my heart?
?
?
?

And we're laughing at the lover's flings
They we're laughing at the older brothers
I've been hiding under green umbrellas
I've been hiding under green umbrellasEmbed
