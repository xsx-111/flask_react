Laughing Hieroglyphic Lyrics(Down there)
("Do you know where you are? No, I don't. I was talkin' to... Dave, and I told him that the reason I get so mean, I mean, I would like to, to make it stronger, so it's angry...") (???)
The flies in the dark with their ways
Of shedding some light, now I've lost all my day
I think they are very lucky
With internal parts like illumined sun rays
It's so easy to get
Lost in the mixture
When forces strike hard
You wear your layers or you'll shiver
I didn't think you were
Struggling so long
With all of the wild things
That we took so young
How it must have wrapped you up
And left you hanging upside-down
When I was too busy getting lost in
The big sound, the big sound
Now I'd trade in all I'd saved
To fly to those nights and ask, "How are you lover?"
If we could have just engaged
I'd have enhanced my weakness in comforting others
But the words are all jumbled and faded
My heart is a nurse, but my tongue's in the blender
Now it's become something creative
I know it's not much, but just let it right into your gut
And hold me, I've been sad for days
The light does change its gifts, every hour's devoured
But the same things haunt me, what's haunting you?
Lately I've been seeing beings
They look like they float at the back of my headroom
I don't find it strange when I'm talking to you
Lion in your dreams
The lion is good for your dreams, accept the lion
The lion would probably try and come and embrace you too
And when I get fucked up, I'll do the best
To make myself not fucked up again, my heart and my lungs too
Why can't I do the same for everyone I love too?
How about it'll be you and me and the leader of the ghosts
How about it'll be you and me and the leader of the ghosts
Lately I've been seeing beings
They look like they float at the back of my headroom
I don't find it strange when I'm talking to you
Lion in your dreams
The lion is good for your dreams, accept the lion
The lion would probably try and come and embrace you too
("I paid a fortune for these boots" )
("You'd better keep movin', there's a fair amount of quicksand around here. Best keep your eyes open, too, or one of these just mightâ€”")Embed
