Heads Hammock LyricsI'm moving slowly through the earth time
Breaking off like a ripe vine
Bouncing off of the muddy shore
Singing in, look my color's bright
Disappearing like a swamp snake
Never let on that I'm feeling bad
Flustered when I am getting started
Often bitter in the undertow
We almost lost his color
And with the muddy bang
(Why?)
And it lets me decide that I'm
(Why?)
A little more into the free form
I'm crying peacefully in a river bed
Digging roots up in my head
Hershey cup in my looking bowl
Wondering why I made the choice to go
Licking all of my wounds clean
Enjoy life, and your  is clean
Wish I'd never have to fall asleep
Not sure if I wanna leave
We almost lost him but the other
Caught him by the end of his tail
(Why?)
Should let me decide that I'm
(Why?)
A little more into the free form
I don't to slow you down
I don't to slow you down
But you keep going by me
But you keep going by me
I don't to slow you down
I don't to slow you down
But you keep going by me
But you keep going by me
He'll take care of me
He'll take care of me
And I'm gonna let him take care of me
And I'm gonna let him take care of me
I'm moving slowly through the earth time
Breaking off like a ripe vine
Bouncing off of the muddy shore
Singing in, look my color's bright
Disappearing like a swamp snake
Never let on that I'm feeling bad
Flustered when I'm getting started
Often bitter in the undertowEmbed
