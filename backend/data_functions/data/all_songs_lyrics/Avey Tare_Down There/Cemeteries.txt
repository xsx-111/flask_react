Cemeteries LyricsLooking back on old day
Stained floor and ice cold
Look away, not looking forward
Cemeteries I saw
And I'm told
("Maybe... There's a better way")
We'll lean through old children
They'll keep counting, I know
Seated people never painted
Cemeteries I saw
And I'm told
And I'm told
And I'm told
And I'm told
("Jud, what's that?" "Shh... Just a loon, that's all.")
("Here, give me that.")
Let me, I would like
Taking a hike through the cemetery tonight
The gravestones are covered in time
It's the perfect light, everywhere the mud floods
("What's that?" "Shh...")Embed
