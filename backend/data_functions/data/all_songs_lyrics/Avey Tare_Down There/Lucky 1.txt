Lucky 1 LyricsFly off from harder days
Today, feel like the lucky one
Die in a bed of shade
Today, you feel like the lucky one
There have been days you feel so sad
Glad you could feel better shade
Today, you feel like the lucky one
Try if you follow me
Today, you feel like the lucky one
There have been days you feel so sad
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Well, are you crying? Well, are you crying?
Well, are you?
There have been days you feel so sad
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Were you crying? Were you crying?
Well, are you crying? Well, are you crying?
Well, are you?Embed
