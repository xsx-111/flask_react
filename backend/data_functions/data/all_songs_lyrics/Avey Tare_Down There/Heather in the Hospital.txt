Heather in the Hospital LyricsYou see blood and bone pump and flow and...
It brings me down
The people bandaged up, the doctors making rounds
It's sunny on the other side of windows that look out on the town
It brings me down
To see you lying wrapped up in your messy gown
With secrets to celestial bodies speak as you sleep without a sound
And it brings me down
Machines of modern magic keeping folks above the ground
A nurse's scribbling pad, a shadow shape, a mother going mad
It brings me down
'Let's get out of here' says a boyfriend to a dad
We'll get you on your feet, I'll hug you dear and give you all I can
The windy day
Let it pass away
Now I can't hear the crying
Are some better that way?
Is it sad to say?
Do I think that I'll ever be ready
Or willing or smiling
Well I'll wear a little well
There are spirits in this realm
They remind me that our grandma will always be shining
What a simple case
And you're strong today
You move out a performance as your hardest day
Someone's in the room, listening to me
No one's in the room, it must just be me
Thinking to myself
Hearing myself breathe
There are no more eyes
What is it I see?1Embed
