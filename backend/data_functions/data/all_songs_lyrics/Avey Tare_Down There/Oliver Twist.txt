Oliver Twist Lyrics("He saw what, he would look in the rock and see what was in there and I guess that day he saw a skull. One of his dark days.")
Pockets...
Oh when I look through the door of my lean-to
I don't know another lean room from my room
Should I pull up the floor of my kitchen
So I can feel the dirt while I'm doing all my dishes
To live in a house that is breathing
Is a luxury when you understand its meaning
But even in a box am I dreaming
Of a galaxy of stars above our ceiling
And my eye isn't understanding of what I see
It's hard to think about the time it takes
To get from one space to me
(And it may take a while)
It may take a while 'cause I never know where I should be
And then I start thinkin', and I'm thinkin'
Of the many dirty pennies and
Different motions
Mine'll be kind of sticky lately stuck inside the ocean
Oh, city grind
It's hard to sit myself down
And just think about the ocean
Oh, am I crying?
Shouldn't I be content with what I've got
And not seek dimes?
Or am I denying myself it's
Something that I'd enjoy if I acquire
And I wonder if it's me who's just a thief
Taking the stash and blazin' the grass
Diggin' a hole and diggin' it deep
(And I dig for a while)
Yeah, I dig for a while cause I never know
When to plant the seed
And then I start thinkin', and I'm thinking
Of the many dirty pennies
(It's going to be a fine night tonight, it's going to be a fine day tomorrow)
And if I have some kind of need
Maybe the thing I need is the thing I've got
And if I look inside of me
I find the thing that can't be took or bought
And I know that there are needy
Some are good, yeah, but some are rotten
Why should I motivate my needs
When I know my greed should be forgotten
Is it alright if we feel good?Embed
