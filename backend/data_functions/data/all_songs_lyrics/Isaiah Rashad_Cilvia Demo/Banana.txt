Banana Lyrics
(Mrranamanamanamanamana)
I gotta kinda sing it
(Manamana)

Yo, now ever since I was young, had a gift with the tongue
This shit might open the door (It might open the do')
Fruit loop for the young, honeycomb for some
22, put piff in a bowl (Put piff in a bowl)
And I was bending the corners, hot-boxin' the sauna
I've been focused gettin' closer to goals (Gettin' closer to goals)
And I be slippin' a bit, probably sippin' a bitch
I ain't really into tippin' the hoes
See, my brother got weight, my sister at home (Yeah, yeah)
When I get straight, my sister gettin flown (Yeah, yeah)
Couple nephews, my niggas gettin' grown (Yeah, yeah)
Mikey D stay down, nigga gettin on (Yeah, yeah)
Can I get a glass cup and a lil' Henny? (Yeah, yeah)
I'm too cold but a little timid (Yeah, yeah)
I blow checks save a lil' penny (Yeah, yeah)
I'm too young for some big money, ooh
Come girl get some dick from me (Ooh)
My job needs some piss from me, ugh (Ooh)
Lil' bro, can you fuck with me (Yeah, yeah)
Came through at the last minute, ugh (Yeah, yeah)
Living, wasting my time, lacing with percs, purp in a bind
Hazy, oh baby, I'm better when blind
I don't see nothin', it's perfect, I'm fine (Yeah, yeah)
We are the young and Xanax, oh
See, there's nowhere to go
To hide from the lows (Ugh)
'Cause we are the young and Xanax, oh (Yeah, bitch)
See, there's nowhere to go (Yeah, bitch)
Stuck on the high, yeah

Ayy, my son sleep, I'm rollin it up, I don't sleep (Rollin' it)
I'm runnin' for bucks, don't tweet (Runnin' for)
You fuckin' with us, I won't eat (Fuckin' with)
Start stomping your feet, I need that (Stompin' ya)
Depending on all of your feedback
Come out to my show and come feed that
Can't go back to sellin' that retail
My daddy left me with no details
Came back with a bitch and a stepson (Yeah, yeah)
I guess he forgot that he left somethin' (Yeah, yeah)
He must have been saving the best bum (Yeah, yeah)
She screaming out, "Give me the rest, hun" (Yeah, yeah)
Pearl necklace, I empty my left nut (Yeah, yeah)
Most niggas can't fuck with my worst shit (Yeah, yeah)
I'm scribing my living with curses (Yeah, yeah)
Just wait 'til I get this shit perfect (Yeah, yeah)
You niggas can't fuck with my verses (Yeah, yeah)
See, Dave, he don't think that I'm 'bout this (Yeah, yeah)
Don't make me come run in your houses (Yeah, yeah)
We know where your mom and your dad live (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh baby, it's Swayze, just mask us (Yeah, yeah)
My niggas got triggas and vastly (Yeah, yeah)
Don't like how we living it lasts (Yeah, yeah)
You out of your trigger and backseat (Ooh)
Just look at the shooter, it's Mike D (Ooh)
Your rosary shining so nicely (Ooh)
We innocent kids if you ask me (Ooh)
I rode in the Benz in the backseat (Yeah, yeah)
Them vices, they swarm and attack me (Yeah, yeah)
God got me, that nine is upon me (Yeah, yeah)
That Juve, that Percy, that Bun B (Yeah, yeah)
Soundtrack in this black while we dumping (Yeah, yeah)
We are the young and Xanax, oh
See, there's nowhere to go (Yeah, yeah)
To hide from the lows (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
'Cause we are the young and Xanax, oh (Yeah, bitch)
See, there's nowhere to go (Yeah, bitch)
Stuck on the high, high, yeah43Embed
