Modest Lyrics
Modest, I, be in interviews, so niggas hatin'
'Cause I play it like, I no have no clue that I'm the greatest, uh
Tori come, sit up on this dick, I see you waiting (wait)
Need a baby 'cause I'm too young and wild to be the savior
Nail me to the cross and I'm just hanging
Least they left the serpent in my fingers, I'm just smoking
Players from my city rarely make it to a poster
'less you got a warrant, what you got in that Corolla?
Oh, officer, just Boosie Boo and DG Yola
Won't let them haters get me down
That's what they told us
It's funny how they blame the South
When they weak shit don't blow up
We came with all the funk
While niggas act like they don't know us (they didn't)
Just living a lie, OG's, acting like hoes
We couldn't rekindle the fire
Nigga, retire, nigga, catch up with the time
I can see more than the block (block)
I can see more than your spot (spot)
I don't be stuck in the past (past)
Homie, I'm puffing the grass (grass)
Holding my cup like a strap (strap)
Look at my southerner ass
Niggas try to tell you what you want
Niggas rarely give you what you need
Bitch, I came right here with the bounce (the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed
Yeah, 'cause niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need
Bitch, I came right here with the bounce (the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed

Quiet, I be in living room
Cuh, nigga shaded
With my Nia Long
I sing her a song, she masturbatin'
Then bring me along
She got something to say like Larry David
But I leave her 'lone
Ho, I gotta go, I got a baby
Stuck in Babylon
Niggas carry bombs and carry rabies
Who gon' speak for you?
Who gon' sing your song if you don't play this?
I got stress for days
Picture you go home and you that nigga
But can't pay your bill
You can't buy no diapers for your lil' one
Don't you pay for thrill
Child support is like a check away
How you chill with Kendrick?
Do you smoke with Q and Dr. Dre? (Dre)
Least today is real
I should ask some groupie for some face (face)
Just a stepping stone
Least them kind of bitches know their place (place)
This my second home
This where favorite rappers get replaced ('placed)
This what the niggas from the South
Gon' kill that, doubt it, bring the bass (bass)
And bitch, I came here right here with an ounce
And if that ain't enough you gotta leave (ahh bitch)
Niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need
Ayy, bitch, I came right here with the bounce (the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed
Yeah, 'cause niggas try to tell you what you want
But niggas rarely give you what you need (whoa)
Bitch, I came right here with the bounce (the bounce)
And if that ain't enough I got some weed
Yeah (Yeah)66Embed
