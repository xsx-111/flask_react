Heartbeat Chilli LyricsI was in the kitchen on my own making chilli
You came in with an onion and got dicing
It seems silly, but this chilli has two heartbeats in the recipe
So come over, give your heart to me
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
On a warm summer's evening in the lido
Your hands touched my feet on the fifteenth lap
Treading water, through my goggles I can see
Your hands wrinkled like an old man's
Come over, give your heart to me
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
It's funny how things change
I'm smoking cigarettes again
Drink black coffee to hide the smell
Of smoke on my breath but when you take my hand in your hand
I feel so whole again
I was in the kitchen on my own making spaghetti
You came in with an onion and got dicing
It seems silly, but spaghetti has two heartbeats in the recipe
So come over, give your heart to me
So come over, give your heart to me
I adore you, give your heart to meEmbed
