Woody Allen LyricsIn the movie of our lives, would Woody Allen write the
Screenplay?
Not his best era, but certainly not his worst either
But I wouldn't like to be like Diane Keaton in Manhattan
So cerebral was she, runs away from any romance
But though you're neurotic, and a little paranoid
It doesn't make me Annie, it doesn't make you Alvy
Woody Allen couldn't play you
Woody Allen couldn't play you
I know you want him to
But he couldn't play you
If the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman was still with us
What a mastermind but surely he'd have trouble with us
See I wouldn't like to be like Bibi Andersson in Wild Strawberries
What a doll she is, but I'm really not that complex
And although we argue, and we have our problems
And sometimes it gets bad, it never gets Bergman bad
Max von Sydow couldn't play you
Max von Sydow couldn't play you
I know you'd want him to
But Max von Sydow couldn't play youEmbed
