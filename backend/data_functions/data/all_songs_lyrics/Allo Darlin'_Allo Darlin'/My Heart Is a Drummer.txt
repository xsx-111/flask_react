My Heart Is a Drummer LyricsAs I am preparing myself to say "Farewell to my pride again"
I remember how it was back then
I'd see you light a cigarette and then you'd ask me to pass your asthma inhaler
I'd say "Don't you ever think about cancer?"
You'd say "Baby you don't know but my heart is as strong as a drummer
My heart is as strong as a drummer"
You make me feel like apologizing for being like this
Do I have to say I'm sorry for my happiness?
You see it's like loving "Graceland"
It's not allowed to be but we know it's everybody's favorite
Deep down in the place where music makes you happiest
In the place where my heart is a drummer
In the place where my heart is a drummer
And when you call me on the telephone my fingers will twist through the cord
And I'll slide my feet up and down the wall
But I know that I'm stronger than you are
But I know that I'm stronger than you are
And when you call me on the telephone my fingers will twist through the cord
And I'll slide my feet up and down the wall
But I know that I'm stronger than you are
But I know that I'm stronger than you areEmbed
