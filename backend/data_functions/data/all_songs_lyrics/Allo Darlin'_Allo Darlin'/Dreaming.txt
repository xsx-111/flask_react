Dreaming LyricsWill you go out with me tonight
Lose it on a disco floor
Take the night bus with me tonight
Frost on the window
It's freezing out here on the pavement
But here in your arms
It's heaven
I can wait for you now
But not forever
I have tried everything I know
To make you understand
This is not a game for broken hearts
Played by a lonely band
We've both got so much to lose
But here in your arms
It's heaven
I can wait for you now
But not forever
I was surprised by how happy I was
Don't ask why it's just because
Down by the harbour in the dawn
It's not a star it's a satellite
The thought of it keeps me from sleeping
Or am I already dreaming?Embed
