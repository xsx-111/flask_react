Kiss Your Lips LyricsIn a fairground in the middle of Paris
You tried to prove to me your manliness
By winning me a teddy bear
Your mouth was pink from all the fairy floss we ate
And I got bits of popcorn stuck between my teeth
And I felt a bit sick from those rides that spin
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of salty
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of sweet too
Then I kissed your lips and for a moment it was heavenly
Because you found me baby
Underneath the stars on the ferris wheel
You swung your feet and sang my favorite Weezer song
So I sang along
"I'm a lot like you so please
Hello I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you could be good for me"
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of salty
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of sweet too
Then I kissed your lips and for a moment it was heavenly
Because you found me baby
And baby I found you
All the pretty people that we meet
Eat organic and buy green electricity
All the pretty people that we meet
Are so much more successful in their careers than me
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of salty
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of sweet too
Then I kissed your lips and for a moment it was heavenly
Because you found me baby
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of salty
Then I kissed your lips and they were kind of sweet too
Then I kissed your lips and for a moment it was heavenly
Because you found me baby
And baby I found you
And baby I found you
Baby I found you
Baby I found youEmbed
