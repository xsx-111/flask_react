What Will Be Will Be LyricsBaby don't be sad with me tonight
Because the mean bus driver drove me home tonight
And on the underground
All the faces I smiled at were looking down
And though I try to see the positive in every little thing
Sometimes London has a way of taking every little thing out of me
But when I come home
And I see you smile
You make me feel alright
You make me realise
Que sera sera
What will be will be
As long as you're with me
It's easy like taking candy from a baby
I've got my troubles too you don't know much about
I try to keep them hidden from you
So I won't freak you out
You're not the only one with dreams baby
And if you're patient you will see maybe
But when I come home
And I see you smile
You make me feel alright
You make me realise
Que sera sera
What will be will be
As long as you're with me
It's easy like taking candy from a baby
Que sera sera
What will be will be
As long as you're with me
It's easy like taking candy from a babyEmbed
