If Loneliness Was Art LyricsYou've been on your own as long as I recall
If loneliness was art, I could hang you from the wall
In some Berlin hall
It doesn't matter where you've been or who you have been with
It's like the Just Joans said: "you're oh so sensitive!"
In that jumper, in that t-shirt
This situation has to change
Can you feel the pulse
My heavy heart race?
Some day I'm going to be your girl
One fine day: I'm going to be your girl
Shalalalala...
When I'm all alone I find a map of the world
Zoom in on your island 'til the pixels form
Have some booze 'til I can't see you
This situation has to change
Can you feel the pulse
My heavy heart race?
Some day, I'm going to be your girl
One fine day, you're going to make me your girl
Shalalalala...
We make believe that our hearts are never shot
And somehow you've convinced me that I'm pretty when I'm not
Everybody I know wants to be your friend
But I just want to hold you when the music ends
That's all, all I ask
Is that too crass?
This situation has to change
Can you feel the pulse
My heavy heart race?
Some day I'm going to be your girl
One fine day, you're going to make me your girl
Shalalalala...Embed
