Silver Dollars LyricsOh baby take me out tonight and we can pretend
That these pennies are silver dollars and the music won't end
Yeah my love for you is so much deeper than these pockets
I'll spend all I have on you and I'll burn it up like a rocket
And yeah I sold all my records but I'm still in debt by two grand
And yeah we played that show but we spent what we made on the cab
I'm even starting to wish that I'd finished a legal vocation
My life would be dull but at least I could go on vacation
And all I want to know is where do we go when this bar closes
And all I want to know is where do we go when this bar closes
And though I've got no money to burn I'm going to burn what I've got
And though this band is awful I like them an awful lot
And though you say we're just friends and that this love is purely platonic
I'm hoping that you'll forget after this round of gin and tonics
We do it because we love it and I'm here because I love you
Yeah we do it because we love it
And I'm here because I love you
And these silver dollars are pretty but they're worthless
Yeah these silver dollars are pretty but they're worthless
Yeah these silver dollars are pretty but they're worthlessEmbed
