The Polaroid Song LyricsDo you remember that photo
The one you took with an instant Polaroid?
I didn't know that you had it
I didn't know you could get that film anymore
We both looked so happy
Like it was 1973
The color faded like my memory
And not so long ago
You said you'd been stockpiling
All the film that you can find
Before it all starts expiring
And then there won't be Polaroid anymore
Will we still look happy
When we're not super-overexposed?
Will we still look happy
When we're wearing our normal clothes?
Feel like dancing on my own
To a record that I do not own
In a place I've never seen beforeEmbed
