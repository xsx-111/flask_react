Sunday LyricsI'm blue every Monday thinkin' over Sunday
That one day when I'm with you
It seems that I sigh all day Tuesday, I cry all day Wednesday
Oh my, how I long for you
And then comes Thursday, gee, it's long, it never gets by
Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die
But after payday is my fun day, I shine all day Sunday
That one day when I'm with you
And then comes Thursday, gee, it's long, it never goes by
And Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die
But after payday is my fun day, I shine all day Sunday
That one day when I'm with you
That one day, it's a fun day
Sunday is my day with youEmbed
