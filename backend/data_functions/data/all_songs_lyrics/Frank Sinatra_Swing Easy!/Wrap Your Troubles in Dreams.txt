Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams LyricsWhen skies are cloudy and grey
They're only grey for a day
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away
Until that sunshine peeps through
There's only one thing to do
Just wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream all your troubles away
Your castles may tumble, that's fate after all
Life's really funny that way
No use to grumble, smile as they fall
Weren't you king for a day?
Just remember that sunshine
Always follows the rain
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream your troubles away
Your castles may tumble, that's fate after all
Life's really funny that way
But no need to grumble, smile as they fall
Weren't you king for a day?
Just remember that sunshine
Always follows the rain
So wrap your troubles in dreams
And dream, dream your troubles awayEmbed
