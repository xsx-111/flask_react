Jeepers Creepers LyricsJeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?
Gosh all get-up
How'd you get so lit up?
Gosh all get up
How'd it get that size?
Golly gee
When you turn those heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize
Where'd you get those eyes?
Mmm, golly gee
When you turn those heaters on
Woe is me
Got to put my cheaters on
Jeepers creepers
Where'd you get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers
How they hypnotize
Where'd you get those eyes?
How did they get that size?
Where'd you get those eyes?Embed
