Get Happy LyricsForget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
The sun is shining, come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're going to the promised land
We're heading 'cross the river, wash your sins 'way in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
That sun is shining, come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take you by the hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're going to the promised land
We're heading 'cross the river, wash your sins 'way in the tide
And it's all so nice and peaceful when you get on the other side
Forget your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the Judgment Day
Forget your troubles, c'mon, get happy
Forget your troubles, c'mon, be happy
Forget your troubles, c'mon, stay happy
Happy, stay happyEmbed
