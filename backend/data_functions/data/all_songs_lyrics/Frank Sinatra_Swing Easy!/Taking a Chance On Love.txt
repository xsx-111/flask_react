Taking a Chance On Love LyricsHere I go again
I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love
Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry-eyed again
Taking a chance on love
I thought that cards were a frame-up
I never would try
Now I'm taking that game up
And the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now
Taking a chance on love
Here I slip again
About to take that trip again
I got that grip again
Taking a chance on love
Now I prove again
That I can make life move again
Mmm, I'm in a groove again
Taking a chance on love
I walk around with a horseshoe
In clover I lie
And brother rabbit of course you
Better kiss your foot goodbye
On that ball again
I'm riding for a fall again
I'm gonna give my all again
Taking a chance on loveEmbed
