Royale with Cheese (Dialogue) Lyrics
Okay so, tell me again about the hash bars.
Okay what do you want to know?

Well, hash is legal over there, right?

Yeah, it's legal but it ain't hundred percent legal, I mean, you just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away. I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.

And those are the hash bars?

Yeah, it breaks down like this, ok, it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it, and if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, but...but that doesn't matter, cause, get a load of this; all right, if you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you. I mean that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.

Oh, man, I'm goin', that's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

I know, baby, you'd dig it the most.. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?

What?
It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over there they got here, but, it's just, just, there it's a little different.

Example?

Alright, you can walk into a movie theatre in Amsterdam and buy a beer. And I don't mean just like in no paper cup. I'm talking about a glass of beer. And in Paris, you can buy a beer at McDonald's. And you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

Then what do they call it?

They call it Royale with Cheese.

Royale with Cheese. What do they call a Big Mac?

Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
Le big Mac! Ahhaha, what do they call a Whopper?
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King. But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
What?
Mayonnaise.
Goddamn!
I seen 'em do it man, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

Uuccch!Embed
