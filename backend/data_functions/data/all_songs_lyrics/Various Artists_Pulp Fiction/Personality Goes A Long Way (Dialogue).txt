Personality Goes A Long Way (Dialogue) Lyrics
You want some bacon?

No, man, I don't eat pork.

Are you Jewish?

No, I ain't Jewish, I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

Why not?

Pigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.

But bacon tastes good, pork chops taste good...

Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers. Pigs sleep and root in shit, that's a filthy animal. I don't eat nothin' that ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.

How about a dog? A dog eats its own feces.
I don't eat dog either.

Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?

I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but it's definitely dirty. But, dogs got personality, personality goes a long way.

So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?

We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one charmin' motherfuckin' pig. I mean he'd have to be ten times more charmin' than that Arnold on Green Acres, you know what I'm sayin'?1Embed
