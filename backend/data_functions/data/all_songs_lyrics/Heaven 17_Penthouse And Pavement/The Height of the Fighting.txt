The Height of the Fighting LyricsHeat, war (They sent you to it, do it)
Sweat, law (If you can't move it, prove it)
At the height of the fighting
He-la-hu (x4)
Heat, war (If you don't like it, fight it)
Sweat, law (If you can't take it, fake it)
Heat, war (They sent you to it, do it)
Sweat, law (If you can't move it, prove it)
(Chorus)Embed
