Are Everything (Bonus Track) LyricsYour looks
My charm
My own imagination
My loves
Your hates
Your own infatuation
Are everything
Are everything
My hopes
Your fears
Your only limitation
Your thoughts
My schemes
My own evaluation
Are everything
Are everything
My looks
Your charm
Your own imagination
Your loves
My hates
My own infatuation
Are everything
Are everything
Your hopes
My fears
My only limitation
My thoughts
Your schemes
Your own evaluation
Are everything
Are everythingEmbed
