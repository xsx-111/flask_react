Geisha Boys and Temple Girls LyricsLook ahead, on the screen
Slim perfect creatures and they're just 16
Their eyes meet, this is it
The contact so much more than words can transmit
He stands up, she gives in
Their first encounter, their embrace within
A short ride, they arrive
There is no doubt that true love will survive
We are the geisha boys
Doing it wrong again
They are the chosen ones
Doing it right
Here come the temple girls
Looking for sanctuary
Naked as advertised
For the first time
If you turn away from the screen
Another version can be seen
She is black, and he is white
They love each other but they also fight
Back from work, she's not home
Another evening angry, all alone
She arrives and he departs
Misunderstandings, then the breakdown starts
Here we are late at night
We are both refugees
There is no easy way
Let it be right
Anything's possible
If you can fake it, but
The wrong place is anywhere
If you're not right
(Chorus)
There's not much that you can do
Choose either one of them it could be you
The first time could be the only time
The odds against you and your hopes decline
Do it right, or do it wrong
Console yourself that either won't last long
Geisha boys or temple girls
Make contact or remain in separate worlds
(Chorus)
Here we are late at night
We are both refugees
There is no easy way
Let it be right
Anything's possible
If you can fake it, but
The wrong place is anywhere
If you're not right
(Chorus)
Here we are late at night
We are both refugees
There is no easy way
Let it be right
Anything's possible
If you can fake it, but
The wrong place is anywhere
If you're not rightEmbed
