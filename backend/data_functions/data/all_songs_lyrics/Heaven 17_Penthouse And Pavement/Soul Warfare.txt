Soul Warfare Lyrics(Soul warfare) (x3)
If I was someone else
Would you still say what you're saying?
If I were somewhere else
Would your conscience be straying?
(Soul warfare) (x2)
It's all that I can do
To put my faith in you
It's all that I can give
To be a fugitive
It's all that there can be
Not wanting to be free
It's all that I can take
These fifteen days awake
It's more than I can hide
My needs can't be denied
A million miles or more
Can't keep me from your door
There is no place to run
Until the fighting's done
More bloodshed every day
The soul war's here to stay
If I want something more
It could be you who'll be paying
As this is my soul war
These are the rules we'll be playing
(Chorus)
It's not for you to say
Which district I'll be destroying
You could never know
The tactics I'll be employing
(Chorus)
You could be part of me
Forget the wealth you're forsaking
Your strategy is clear
My soul is there for the taking
(Chorus)
(Repeat 2nd verse) (x2)Embed
