Play To Win Lyrics(Play to win)
City clubland, theatre, dockland
Empty house, no audience
Smiles of fortune, no man master
Play to win and break the bank
(Play to win)
Turn professional, know your job
Be up to every trick
Make a breakthrough, strain your eyes
Have no secrets, hear no lies
(Play to win)
(And then he said)
Have no secrets, hear no lies
(Play to win)
(x2)
One needs a great deal more than this
Make-up master plan
Tension mars the prettiest face
Sex in fairyland
(Play to win)
How can you improve your life
Obtain the unobtainable?
Boost your health, a giant refreshed
Treat rough, get tough, 10-10!
(Play to win)
(Play to win)
Did you take a backseat
When your kids were small?
Suit the movement to the word
Reverse and take the action
(Play to win)
Now suit the action to the word
Make every minute count
Matching cunning, see the cars
Step on the heels of chance
(Play to win)
(Chorus x3)Embed
