Song with No Name LyricsCan't sleep, trying hard to find a rhyme
Can't work, I am tired all the time
Can't eat, since my appetite has gone
Can't think, when it started to go wrong
Can't move, I've no energy to fight
Can't see, any end to this in sight
Last week, I could do all of those things
But now, I am just the man who sings
I've searched around for years and years
I've drank in bars, destroyed careers
Sold on a need to be famous
I've seen the good in men survive
Only to fail when I arrive
Convincing them I am blameless
I was the man with future sight
I would change fortunes overnight
Knowing for me it was painless
(Repeat 1st verse)
One day in April 10:15
Awakened screaming by a dream
Something that touched me was burning
A diamond pin fell from my eye
Then something strange began to cry
"Your will can stop this world turning"
Since then I've fought more than I should
Against the will that I withstood
Hoping I could be its master
But now the dream is all I see
There is no hope of breaking free
One song away from disaster
Can't move, I've no energy at all
Can't see, any end to this in sight
Last week, I could do all of those things
But now, I am just the man who singsEmbed
