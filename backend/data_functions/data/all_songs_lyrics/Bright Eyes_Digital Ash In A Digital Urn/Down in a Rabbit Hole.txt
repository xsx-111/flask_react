Down in a Rabbit Hole LyricsI heard you fell into a rabbit hole
Covered yourself up in snow
Baby, tell me where'd you go
For days and days?
Did they make you stay up all night?
Did they paint your face that pasty white?
You're thirsty but your appetite
Gets chased away
The sun turns us to stone
It's a cloudy day but we still can't go
Up and out that cellar door
'Til we see the moon, we're invisible
No one ever takes the garbage out
A neighbor kid gets dared to touch the house
He runs back only to announce
There's no one home
As we paint the foil with the flame
Smear the soda, taste butane
For every fear that can't be named
To calm you down
Your heart starts skipping steps
So you're farther gone than you might expect
If your thoughts should turn to death
Got to stomp them out like a cigarette
I heard you fell into a rabbit hole
Covered yourself up in snow
Baby, tell me where'd you go
For days and days and days
Days and days and days and days
Days and days and days and days
Days and days and days and daysEmbed
