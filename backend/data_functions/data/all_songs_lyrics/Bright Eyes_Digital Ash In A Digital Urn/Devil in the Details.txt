Devil in the Details LyricsA house of cards, a supple heart
Is not a place to dwell
Now you have your cake, don't hesitate
Come on just do it, come on just do it
Put it in your mouth, there is only now
Tomorrow has to wait
But know there's no backing out
This is gonna be reality
You can never dream it down
I have no way of telling
The two apart
Well I made amends in the general sense
But the devil's in the details
And I know the cause and I want to stop
But I can't do it, I just can't do it
There was love I meant, there were accidents
So tell me which is which
'Cause I just can't work it out
But for memory and clarity
We had better write it down
I have no way of knowing the truth
With time dissolves
I put the past into the ground
I saw the future as a cloud
If there's still time to turn around
I'm going to
It's just one day I fell asleep
And now all day all night I dream
I am the first one I deceive
If I can make myself believe
The rest is easy2Embed
