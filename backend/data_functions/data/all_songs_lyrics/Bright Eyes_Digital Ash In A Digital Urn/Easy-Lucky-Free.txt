Easy/Lucky/Free LyricsDid it all get real? I guess it's real enough
They got refrigerators full of blood
Another century spent pointing guns
At anything that moves
Sometimes I worry that I've lost the plot
My twitching muscles tease my flippant thoughts
I never really dreamed of heaven much
Until we put him in the ground
But it's all I'm doing now
Listening for patterns in the sound
Of an endless static sea
But once the satellite's deceased
It blows like garbage through the streets
Of the night sky to infinity
But don't you weep (Don't you weep for them)
Don't you weep (Don't you weep)
There is nothing as lucky
Honey, don't you weep (Don't you weep for them)
Don't you weep (Don't you weep)
There is nothing as lucky, as easy, or free
Don't be a criminal in this police state
You'd better shop and eat and procreate
You've got vacation days, then you might escape
To a condo on the coast
I set my watch to the atomic clock
I hear the crowd count down until the bomb gets dropped
I always figured there'd be time enough
I never let it get me down
But I can't help it now
Looking for faces in the clouds
I've got some friends I barely see
But we're all planning to meet
We'll lay in bags as dead as leaves
All together for eternity
But don't you weep (Don't you weep for us)
Don't you weep (Don't you weep)
There is no one as lucky
Honey, don't you weep (Don't you weep for us)
Don't you weep (Don't you weep)
There is nothing as lucky, as easy, or free
Or free
Or free
Or free
There is nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing1Embed
