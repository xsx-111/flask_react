La Rapet LyricsIt's what you see in men, does my rugged face cut scars like daggers
Faces on the wall, we can't touch you but you move our hobby
Reach into the hall, step around the feast and find the lobby
Open up the door, see an angel and you'll lose your body
My body...
Her angel...
Picking out a name, stretching out on your sheets
Isabelle, Isabelle, can't you hear me I can't tell
Is the devil in the room, is he hiding in the first drawer
Hold me dear, hold me dear, can't you feel me touch your ear
Meat was on the bone, but the children huddled and devoured
Keep them in the home, let their minds go where their bikes can't take them
Flinching finds me first, so I'll hide 'til she is in the basement
When I light the match, touching angels shadows on the ceiling
Racing 'round the room, your forehead is on fire
Isabelle, Isabelle they're all talking you're not well
Looking like a ghost doctors shaking their heads
Say my name, say my name can't you see that I'm to blame
(There have been sadder days...)
Starting to rot in their mind, pretty angel
Grab the preachers throat, can't you see the light within the shutters
Who set up the ball, don't you see your dancing frees my chances
Put me on my feet, there's an angel with a hand thats open
Write my name in ink, send a letter to the ground and beg him
Folding all your clothes, changing all your bed sheets
Isabelle, Isabelle, you're not with me where I dwell
Drinking from your glass, smash it on the pyre
It's a shame, it's a shame don't you see me, I'm to blame
Some people's lives awake to itsy-bitsy I'm-so-sorry's
The branch breaks, you crack a window and the wind might say
"The birds are calling for you please don't follow..."Embed
