April and the Phantom Lyrics
When April passes by, she thinks of saying bye
She tells her mother, I am not afraid
Of dying in the bath, or swinging from up here
She asks her mother if she slept with strangers
Phantom was the bright way out
Of all the things her mother said
And whisper to her scream
Autumn in my green
December, hello frost
Her mother would say
"Dad, I don't know where April went"

She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature, Ah
She ran out in nature

(She ran out in nature)
I found the Phantom would go
Across the river and hide from all the suffering
(She ran out in nature)
Like the shades of trees
Take off my dress and flow into the stuff we're in
(She ran out in nature)
What'd she find?
(She ran out in nature)
Where'd she go?
(She ran out in nature)
Phantom light
(She ran out in nature)
Take her home
Everybody wants it
Ah, can't you see me waste it?

She ran out in nature
She ran out in nature

(She ran out in nature)
We've gotta buy our land
When they go out and take all the stuff we're in
(She ran out in nature)
We've got neither reaching for the stars
And beg and keep us suffering
(She ran out in nature)
What'd she find?
(She ran out in nature)
Where'd she go?
(She ran out in nature)
Can't somebody
(She ran out in nature)
Take her home?

Everybody wants it
Ah, can't you see me waste it?
I finally see a baby girl
I'm sorry April, but you'll be fine 'til then
I'm the Phantom
I'm the Phantom
I'm the Phantom
When I sleep around, and you're on top
A frenzy April, then we ride again
I'm the Phantom
I'm the Phantom
I'm the Phantom
And in the end, your mother knows
I'm sorry April, but a child grows
I'm the Phantom
I'm the Phantom
I'm the Phantom
I am...
Watch me as I lead the way
From infancy to grown up babies

Phantom, please put on your make-up
I am breathing, I'll keep calling
Phantom, you're alright and naked
Have your baby, I'll keep calling
I'm not right, I'm not faking
I am burning, and I'm shaking
April, no, it's just a spirit
I am there, end is nearing
April and the Phantom
They were just like lovers
Always sneaking kisses for the weekend
Everything's just okay with me
Everything's just alright with
April and the Phantom spoke in secret code
Until they buried Phantom by the road
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with Phantom
Everything's just alright with me
Everything's just alright with me
