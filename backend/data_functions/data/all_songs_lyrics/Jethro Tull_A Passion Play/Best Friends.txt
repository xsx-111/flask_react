Best Friends LyricsAll your best friends' telephones never cooled from the heat of your hand
There's a line in a front-page story, 13 horses that also-ran
Climb in your old umbrella. Does it have a nasty tear in the dome?
But the rain only gets in sometimes and the sun never leaves you alone
You alone, you alone, you alone, you alone, you aloneEmbed
