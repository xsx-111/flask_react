Memory Bank LyricsAll along the icy wastes there are faces smiling in the gloom
Roll up roll down, Feeling unwound? Step into the viewing room
The cameras were all around. We've got you taped; you're in the play
Here's your I.D. (Ideal for identifying one and all)
Invest your life in the memory bank; ours the interest and we thank you
The ice-cream lady wets her drawers, to see you in the passion play
Take the prize for instant pleasure
Captain of the cricket team
Public speaking in all weathers
A knighthood from a queenEmbed
