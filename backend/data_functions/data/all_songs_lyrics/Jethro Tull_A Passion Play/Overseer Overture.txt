Overseer Overture LyricsColours I've none dark or light, red, white or blue
Cold is my touch (freezing)
Summoned by name - I am the overseer over you
Given this command to watch o'er our miserable sphere
Fallen from grace, called on to bring sun or rain
Occasional corn from my oversight grew
Fell with mine angels from a far better place
Offering services for the saving of face
Now you're here, you may as well admire
All whom living has retired from the benign reconciliation
Legends were born surrounding mysterious lights
Seen in the sky (flashing)
I just lit a fag then took my leave in the blink of an eye
Passionate play join round the maypole in dance
(primitive rite) (wrongly)
Summoned by name - I am the overseer over youEmbed
