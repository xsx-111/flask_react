Flight from Lucifer LyricsFlee the icy Lucifer
Oh he's an awful fellow!
What a mistake!
I didn't take a feather from his pillow
Here's the everlasting rub: neither am I good nor bad
I'd give up my halo for a horn and the horn for the hat I once had
I'm only breathing
There's life on my ceiling
The flies there are sleeping quietly
Twist my right arm in the dark. I would give two or three for
One of those days that never made impressions on the old score
I would gladly be a dog barking up the wrong tree
Everyone's saved we're in the grave
See you there for afternoon tea
Time for awaking the tea lady's making
A brew-up and baking new bread
Pick me up at half past none
There's not a moment to lose
There is the train on which I came
On the platform are my old shoes
Station master rings his bell
Whistles blow and flags wave
A little of what you fancy does you good (Or so it should)
I thank everybody for making me welcome
I'd stay but my wings have just dropped offEmbed
