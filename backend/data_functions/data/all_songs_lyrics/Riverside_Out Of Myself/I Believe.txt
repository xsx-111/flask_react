I Believe LyricsI learn to understand
Getting harder to pretend is ok with me
In this moment I believe
And I want it so much
In spite of everything
You make me so real
I don't have to shut myself in this cage of me
I see what I haven't seen
I wanna share my place to hide
My place to feel
With You
In this moment I believe
And I want it so much
In spite of everything
I learn to understand
If only I was worth waiting for...Embed
