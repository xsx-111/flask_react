In Two Minds LyricsAnother day of talking
And I'm in two minds
I think I have to tell you
I finally realised
I know you'll never really get inside of me
But I don't mean to hurt you
Just let me disappear
We used to like it
Used to be
In the sunset time of our dream
For all these things we cannot change
We cannot be
We cannot stay
But if you lose your faith
Know that I am still your friend
And if the sky falls down
Know that I will still support youEmbed
