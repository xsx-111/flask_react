The Same River Lyrics
(instrumental)

(instrumental)

/she/
I stay... I swear... I am... I can...
Please take a walk with me
Let me know - Am I to blame?
As you know
I've always loved you and I know I will always love...

I am your fear, I am your hope
I am your grief, I am your joy
I know... I can... Wanna stay...
I am your deed, I am your word
I am your hate, I am your love
I know... I can... Wanna stay...Embed
