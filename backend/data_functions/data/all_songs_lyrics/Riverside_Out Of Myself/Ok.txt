Ok LyricsNeed to stay right here
I don't care if there is a better place
I must try it myself
Again
My broken sleep will never be the same
I'm only hanging on
And waiting for another night
There's sadness in my mind - ok
There's darkness in my mind - ok
What has come over me?
Can't believe, but your tears leave me cold
I'm walking through the dark
Again
And I am not afraid to be alone
Anymore
There's sadness in my mind - ok
There's darkness in my mind - ok
Thoughts echoing in my mind - ok
Everything is gonna be...Embed
