Death Rattle Lyrics
Numbing rumble, countless medicine
Depleted from years of abuse
Death rattle shaking
And there's no faking, undertaking
Pressure point, rigor mortis
Induce, grasp of poison hands
Death rattle shaking
From years of compulsive mistaking

Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes

Disease of eyes, the addict blindfold
Reduced to the realms of death
Death rattle shaking
Accumulating life it’s taking

Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes

I’ve seen the end, and there is no light
Like deadly snakes, death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
Death rattle shakes
