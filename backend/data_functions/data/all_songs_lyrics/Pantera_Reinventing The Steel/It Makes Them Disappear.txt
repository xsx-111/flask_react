It Makes Them Disappear Lyrics
Gone
Gone
The time had finally come to kill the vein
And I'm dropping down the dirt on your grave

It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you

The wrath has just begun
The time has finally come

And it hurts so bad, and it drives you mad
Life with a blinded view

It makes them disappear
It fills their life with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappear

Gone
Gone
So the coward has up and run to be saved
But with each step taken down, you sink in your grave
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you

It makes them disappear
It fills their life with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappear

Get the fuck on down the road

It makes them disappear
It fills their life with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappearEmbed
