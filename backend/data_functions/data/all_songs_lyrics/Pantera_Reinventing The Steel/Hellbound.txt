Hellbound Lyrics
Eliminate, the life decline
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
And it's not for sale by any stretch
It's like religion without a Bible
And the Dragon lives inside my mouth
And it speaks in tongues, the word

Hellbound - in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Fort Worth

Snakes, in Southern flames
To bring the thunder; the great decider
Would you believe in this or the ash?
I do believe it and it's taking over
Accept, accept, accept, accept
Accept, accept, accept, accept

Hellbound - in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Fort Worth

Born to a world so young and proud
But over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself
Because there you cannot hide
Facing fears that you'll overcome and one
Of these years you know you've won
You've won, you've won
You've won, you've won
Hellbound - in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Fort Worth
Hellbound - in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Fort WorthEmbed
