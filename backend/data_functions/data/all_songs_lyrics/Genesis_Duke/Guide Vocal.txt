Guide Vocal LyricsI am the one who guided you, this far
All you know, and all you feel
Nobody must know my name
For nobody would understand
And you kill what you fear
I call you, for I must leave
You're on your own until the end
There was a choice but now, it's gone
I said you wouldn't understand
Take what's yours, and be damnedEmbed
