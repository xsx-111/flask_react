Behind the Lines LyricsI held the book so tightly in my hands, saw your picture, heard you call my name
There was something strange, I could not look away
I wanted to be there, I wanted to go
You gave me no warning
You gave no reason
But I was with you
Right by your side
Give me the strength, and I will help you
They can try their hardest, they don't frighten me
It is written in the book
It is hotter than I've known before, but I feel so cold, and I don't know why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Then I really believe, you could make it right
The time has come now
We must show our feelings
But I'm looking right through you
And your heart is empty
Whatever happened to you it's too late to change now
There's nowhere you can run to, no place to hide
Oh you let me down!
...but wait a minute, I don't understand
It's getting stronger, grab my hand
Don't wanna leave you, don't wanna go
But I'm losing all control
Can't you see me slipping away?
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here
It is written in the book
Oh so many times since I've read those words
Just waiting to see you, can you see me?Embed
