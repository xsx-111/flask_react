Baby Lyrics
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, I'll sing you a lullaby

We're walking down the street of chance
Where the chances are always slim or none
And the intentions unjust

Baby, there's nothing to see
I've already been down the street of chance

Baby, you're so clean
Baby, please stay clean

We're walking down the street of chance
Where the chances are always next to none
And the intentions unjust

Baby, there's nothing to see
I've already been down the street of chance
Baby, you're so young
Baby, please stay young

We're walking down the street of chance
Where the chances are always slim or none
And the intentions unjust

Baby, there's nothing to see
I've already been down the street of chance
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, I've already cried

We're walking down the street of chance
The chances are always slim or none
And the intention unjust Embed
