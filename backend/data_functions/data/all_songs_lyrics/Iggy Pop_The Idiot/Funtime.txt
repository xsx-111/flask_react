Funtime Lyrics
Fun
Hey baby we like your lips
Fun
Hey baby we like your pants
All aboard for funtime

Fun
Hey, I feel lucky tonight
Fun
I'm gonna get stoned and run around
All aboard for funtime
Fun
Last night I was down in the lab
Fun
Talking to Dracula and his crew
All aboard for funtime
Fun
I don't need no heavy trips
Fun
I just do what I want to do
All aboard for funtime

We're having fun (Oooooo)
We're having fun (Aaaaaaa)
We're having fun
Fun
Hey baby we like your lips
Fun
Hey baby we like your pants
All aboard for funtime

Fun
Everybody we want in
Fun
We want some we want some
All aboard for funtime

Fun
Hey baby we like your lips
Fun
Hey baby we like your pants
All aboard for funtime

Uuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Uuuuuuuwoah
Uuuuuuueeeeah
Uuuuuuuoh
Uuuuuuuoh
Uuuuuuuoh
UuuuuuuOH2Embed
