Tiny Girls Lyrics
Well the day begins, you don't want to live
'Cause you can't believe in the one you're with
'Cause you know her tricks and you know her past
When she makes a face you just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know it all
When you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing
So you turn around toward the tiny girls
Who have got no tricks, who have got no past
Yeah that's what you think and you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed like a young banshee
And she wants for this and she wants for that
Now what did you think?1Embed
