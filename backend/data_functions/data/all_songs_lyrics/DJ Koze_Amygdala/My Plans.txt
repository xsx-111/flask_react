My Plans LyricsWhy do my plans always change?
And why does this make me laugh?
When I notice the world is falling apart
I will run a bath
And why does this make me laugh?
When I notice the world is falling apart
I will run a bath
Why, why does my face always break?
Why does it not stay flat?
When controlling my mouth, seems like (???)
I will run a bath
I'm known for the things I'm told
My ocean of life not sold
To creators of man and lovers of swine
It seems like the roads will hold
Why do my plans always change?
And why does this make me laugh?
When I notice the world is falling apart
I will run a bathEmbed
