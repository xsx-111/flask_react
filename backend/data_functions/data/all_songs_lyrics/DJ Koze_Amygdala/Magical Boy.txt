Magical Boy LyricsWhen I'm climbing lemon trees of feeling
Time on my hands when I'm running out of faith
There's a fire when I am falling out of place
Years of soaring wisdom slap me in the face
I'm all like cause you're making me feel good
Hopeful embers glowing like my little ones
Save the date and make mistakes of joy
You're the only girl for me, a magical boy
I can run across seas 'til I touch your face
I'll take you in my arms and fly
It's a serious world
I'm a magical boy
You can count on me for escape
Open up and explore
Show me what you need
I can count on you for escapeEmbed
