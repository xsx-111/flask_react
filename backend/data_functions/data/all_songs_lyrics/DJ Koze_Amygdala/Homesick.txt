Homesick LyricsI lose some sales
And my boss won't be happy
But I can't stop listening to the sound
Of two soft voices
Blended in perfection
From the reels of this record that I found
I lose some sales
And my boss won't be happy
But I can't stop listening to the sound
Of two soft voices
Blended in perfection
From the reels of this record that I found
Every day there's a boy in the mirror
Asking me what I am doing here?
Finding all my previous motives
Growing increasingly unclear
I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
All the other options held before me
Would wither in the light of my plan
So I lose some sales and my boss won't be happy
But there's only one thing on my mind
Search in boxes, underneath the counter
On a chance that on a tape I'd find
A song for
Someone that needs somewhere
To long for
Someone who needs somewhere
To long for
Homesick, cause I no longer know
Where home is
Cause I no longer know1Embed
