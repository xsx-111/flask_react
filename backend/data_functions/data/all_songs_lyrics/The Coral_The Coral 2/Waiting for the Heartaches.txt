Waiting for the Heartaches Lyrics
Why do I listen to sad songs?
To make me feel good
When I know I've done wrong
What have I done wrong?
Is it in this song?
I'll guess I'll know before too long

But I can't understand
Why she's holding my hand
No I can't understand at all

I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
There's nowhere that I can possibly run
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
Got to keep on holding on

Another day and I'll try to hide
The endless pain and the tears I've cried
It feels like I'm fixin' to die
She took my soul and she blew my mind
But I can't understand
Why she's holding my hand
No I can't understand at all

I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
There's nowhere that I can possibly run
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
Got to keep on holding on for you

But I can't understand
Why she's holding my hand
No I can't understand at all

I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
There's nowhere that I can possibly run
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
I'm waiting for the heartaches to come
There's nowhere that I can possibly run
I'm waiting for the heartaches to comeEmbed
