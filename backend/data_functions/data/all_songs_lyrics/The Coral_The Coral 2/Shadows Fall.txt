Shadows Fall Lyrics
Morning calls, darkness draws
Upon this day a shadow falls
Silence warps through the halls
Since I've been gone, gone, gone

A hundred years from today
Lamplights ablaze paves my way
'Til Jesus saves my early grave
I will be gone, gone, gone

Drop the anchor, lift my heart
From stem to stern, I'm torn apart
Mount my horse, park my cart
Tomorrow I'm gone, gone, gone

Seek the hull, leave the deck
Silver moon, silhouette
In due time you will forget
That I am gone, gone , gone
Since I've been gone, gone, gone
I will be gone, gone , gone
Tomorrow I'm gone, gone, goneEmbed
