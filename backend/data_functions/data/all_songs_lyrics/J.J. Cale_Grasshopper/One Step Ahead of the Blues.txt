One Step Ahead of the Blues LyricsI ain't high on cocaine
I don't need the pain
It's bad for your brain and that's true
I ain't droppin' no names
I ain't playin' no games
I'm just one step ahead of the blues
One step ahead of the blues
From Memphis to Reno
From New York to Tokyo
I'll try to come through for you
I won't do you in
I ain't no fairweather friend
I'm just one step ahead of the blues
One step ahead of the blues
I don't rob, I don't steal
I ain't beggin' no meal
I ain't driven to drink, I'm no fool
I don't run with the crowd
I don't talk big and loud
I'm just one step ahead of the blues
One step ahead of the blues
I've been under a spell
I ain't been feelin' well
I've been in a shell, and that's true
Dealin' with a curse
But it couldn't be worse
I've been one step ahead of the blues
One step ahead of the bluesEmbed
