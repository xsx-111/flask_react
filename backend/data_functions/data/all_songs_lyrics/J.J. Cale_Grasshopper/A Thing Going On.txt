A Thing Going On LyricsLook here we got a thing going on
Never fear we got a thing going on
Ain't nothing to it
Got to get down and do it
I tell you the truth
Ain't jivin' you
Lord, Lord, we got a thing going on
Something in this place
It's on every face
It's catching fever
You just can't leave her
Look here we got a thing going on
Never fear we got a thing going on
What we gonna do
We're gonna roll through
Do it right, keep it light
Lord, Lord, we got a thing going on
Look here we got a thing going on
Never fear we got a thing going onEmbed
