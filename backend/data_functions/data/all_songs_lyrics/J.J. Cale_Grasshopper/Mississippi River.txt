Mississippi River LyricsMississippi River railroad track
Want to go to Memphis get my baby back
Get me a motorcycle take off tomorrow
If it don't run I'll get me a car
Fill that car with gasoline
Do anything just to see her again
Mississippi River railroad track
Want to go to Memphis get my baby back
Walking down the highway
Thumbing down the road
Got to get there
How I don't know
Uphill, downhill, just around the bend
Got to go to Memphis see my baby again
Leaving in the morning
I cannot wait
Got to go to Memphis
See my baby today
Get me a ticket fly on a cloud
Airplane, airplane help me out
Mississippi River railroad track
Want to go to Memphis get my baby backEmbed
