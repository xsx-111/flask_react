Does Your Mama Like to Reggae LyricsDoes your mama like to reggae
Does your mama like to reggae
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Does your mama like to reggae
You gotta come on home to the city
Down in Jamaica way
Better come home to the city
Down in Jamaica way
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Does she dance it for you daily
Watch it, watch it
Does she dance it for you daily when you want it
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Does your mama like to reggae
