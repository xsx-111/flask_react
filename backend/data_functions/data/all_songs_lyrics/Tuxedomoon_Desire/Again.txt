Again LyricsOn your free day
All your friends have gone
To find a change of pace again
Leaving you alone
To talk to your own face again
So what else is new?
There's nothing new to say
Nothing new to do
But you're still breathing
Just like always you can't manage
To spend any time alone
So you fuck someone
You don't really want to see
But they'll understand
They'll just let you be
The hollow man you are
If you want to break
On the freeway
You are being driven
To another place and as usual
About half way there you don't want to go
Anywhere anymore
Oh no, no, no, no
Just want to go home
Again
So what else is new
Nothing could be better than oblivion
On your free day
Can I have it now
Need to have it now
Let me have it now
On this free day
On this free day
On this free dayEmbed
