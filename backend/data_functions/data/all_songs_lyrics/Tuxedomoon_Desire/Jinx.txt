Jinx LyricsWhy all the flags at half-mast
Why the murders, the rage
Where the retainers of passion
Left from a sensible age
To wipe the wretched history
From this page
What makes the people so bloated
What making cancerous sin
Where the god-merging shamans
To make new sense of the din
To make beast-calming music
Out of this din
It’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx
Why all the pressing confusion
When will the answering cry come
Will we be able to hear it
So busy dying to die
How is it we live
Dying to die
Why all the pressing confusion
When will the answering cry come
Will we be able to hear it
So busy trying to die
How is it we live
Dying to die
Don't disrespect your parents
Rather calm their panic
Curb their distemper
Don't tamper with their rot
No diaper, no rash
Put out the trash
It’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinx, it’s a jinxEmbed
