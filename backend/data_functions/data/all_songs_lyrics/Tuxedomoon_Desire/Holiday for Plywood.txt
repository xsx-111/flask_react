Holiday for Plywood LyricsSometimes, in the finest of moments
You find the furniture just doesn't fit
Something about the carpet
Makes you want to scream
The ashtrays make you ill
The hostess wants you to smile
Don't sit on the sofa
The plastic makes you sweat
The bathroom's done in mirror tiles
The toaster wants your bloodEmbed
