In the Name of Talent (Italian Western Two) LyricsWhat suffering is born in the name of love...
He went through life sometimes crying
Never trying
Sometimes crying
The books that he read and the TV set
All wasted time
He began to think that his future lay in the hands of fate
(You see) He'd move this way
He'd move that way
Or just hesitate
It comes out the same
He wondered what was to blame
He travels light
No excess baggage
His religion saved him but there was a price to pay
His friends could see it in the way he stared that day
A life on over ride (repeats)Embed
