Desire LyricsYou're the buyer or the seller
Makes you want what you can't have
I'm glad I made you cry
Makes you go where you can't go
Makes you want what you can't have
Desire
Don't think, x4
Don't buy
Don't think, x3
Buying the moment
Sometimes I want to die in my bed
All I can think about is "When are we leaving?"
Everytime I think of you I want a cigarette
Man chooses himself
Hero with a thousand faces
It's the third night and the walls are shaking
Boys buying boys
Pleasure bringing pain, it's all the same
I put my hand near my mouth so I know I'm still breathing
So we joke about the TV set
Calling it the "eye of Hell"
I would love to have people see what I see
I would love to be a pillar of strength in my community
A little order, a little grace
Something new to fill up this place
Live a thousand lives by picture
Mark, this song is for you
I'm a lousy lover - I give but never take
Makes you go where you can't go
Makes you want what you can't have
Makes you want what you can't have
Makes you want what you can't have
Makes you want what you can't have
Makes you want what you can't have
Live a thousand lives by picture
Live a thousand lives by picture
Live a thousand lives by picture
Live a thousand lives by picture
Live a thousand lives by pictureEmbed
