Victims of the Dance LyricsFeel like Cassandra dancing
The last dance of the bones dancing
In spite of sudden death as if at last
She knew in a breath
We'll all be dancing on our own
With no past, with no regrets
But Cassandra had problems
She denied a God love
(We are all victims of the dance)
And He ruined her gift of prophecy
She could see it all
But no one believed her, no one believed her
(We are all victims of the dance)
No one believed her when she said
We are all victims of the dance
And seeing the future
Foreseeing the future
Foreseeing the future's not for us
It's unimaginable
Out of the black the faces come faster
Than the vague slips into sleep eyes rolled
Back in pain from unconsidered sources
The waves of shock when you realize where you've been
Faces you slighted razoring the hours
(We are all victims of the dance)
Like you do with that self-marauding
Edge of ineptitude that calls it all back
(We are all victims of the dance)
For one last questioning
(We are all victims)
One last questioning
We can't see the stoplights
Can't see the stoplights
With no fore or hindsight
We just go blind
DA da da da da da
We are all victims of the dance
We are all victims of the dance
Victims of the dance
We met at a dance
Was it my dream or yours?
Who knows
It was so long ago
It hit me Friday evening stained with purple mirth
The longer you stay away the crazier I get
Crowded at faceless parties so gutted and sunk
Winking at the warm bodies, taking deception for granted
Trying to dance just an immortal ghost
(We are all victims of the dance)
Trying to dance just an immortal ghost
(We are all victims of the dance)
(Victims of the dance)
Who fall and recover
Fall and recover
And fail to discover
First things first
With an unquenchable thirst we drink
(Let's have another drink on the host)
(Let's have another drink on the host)
We are all victims of the dance
We are all victims of the dance
Victims of the dance
Millions are living
Millions are living
And millions are dying
Without a chance
It's no romance
The dance goes on, the natives get down
The slit-eyed cats go wild, the shit faced boys
We are rolling with each other their and their sisters too
Everyone is too well dressed, too friendly, too serious
(We are all victims of the dance)
You are too serious, you are too serious
(We are all victims of the dance)
You are too serious, you are too serious
(We are all victims of the dance)
Just like Cassandra
Just like Cassandra
We dance like Cassandra
To the endEmbed
