The Only One Lyrics
Mmmm… Yeah… Yeah… Mmmm…

Whatever you confess
The feelings you express
No matter how you dress
You're different from the rest

The way you live your life
The way you live your life
You are the only one who thinks like you
You are the only one who dreams like you
You are the only one, the only one

Behind the bluest flame
They'll never guess your game
Your version of success
Is different from the rest

And the way you live your life
The way you live your life
You are the only one who thinks like you
You are the only one who dreams like you
You are the only one, the only one
Mmmm… Yeah… Yeah… Mmmm…

You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only oneEmbed
