You Look Like Rain Lyrics
Your mind and your experience call to me
You have lived and your intelligence is sexy

I want to know what you got to say
I want to know what you got to say
I want to know what you got to say
I can tell you taste like the sky 'cause you look like rain

You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain

You think like a whip on a horse's back
Stretched out to the limit, you make it crack
Send that horse round and round the track

I want to know what you got to say
I want to know what you got to say
I want to know what you got to say
I can tell you taste like the sky cause you look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain

Yeah, you look like rain
You look like rainEmbed
