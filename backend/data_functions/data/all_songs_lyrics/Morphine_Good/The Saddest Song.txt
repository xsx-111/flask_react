The Saddest Song Lyrics
On my first day back, my first day back in town
First day, my first day back in town
The clouds up above, they were hummin' our song
Hummin,' hummin' our song

My biggest fear is if I let you go
You'll come and get me in my sleep
My biggest fear is if I let you go
You'll come and get me in my sleep

Come and get me…

I set my course, sail away from shore
Steady, steady as she goes
A crash in the night, two worlds collide
And when two worlds collide, no one survives
No one survives and…

The reddest of reds, bluest of blues
The saddest of songs I sing for you and…
My biggest fear is if I let you go
You'll come and get me in my sleep
My biggest fear is if I let you go
You'll come and get me in my sleep

Come and get me
Come and get me in my sleep
Come and get me
Come and get me in my sleep6Embed
