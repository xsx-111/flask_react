Do Not Go Quietly Unto Your Grave Lyrics
Listen young people, I'm 74
And I plan to live 60 or 70 more
Yeah, I've been all around, I've done a few things
And I spent a few nights on the floor, oh!

Did everything wrong, but I never got caught
So of course I would do it all over again
I surprised many people who'd written me off years ago
Now they're way underground

Nobody asked me, but here's my advice
To a young man or woman who's living this life
In a world gone to Hell, where nobody's safe

Do not go quietly unto your grave
Do not go quietly unto your grave


Learned a few tricks and I'll learn a few more
And I got enough bullets to fight a small war
Nobody asked me, so here's my advice
To a young man or woman who's living this life
In a world gone to Hell where nobody's safe

Do not go quietly unto your grave
Do not go quietly unto your grave
Do not go quietly unto your grave
Do not go quietly unto your graveEmbed
