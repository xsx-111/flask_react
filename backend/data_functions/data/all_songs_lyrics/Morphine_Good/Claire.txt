Claire Lyrics
Treat me wrong, honey, I don't care
You never liked me much anyway
You told me meet you about half past eight
You said you'd kill me if I was late, Claire

Oh, Claire

You drove me up and down the street
You used me up like gasoline
I still remember everything you said
That's the reason had to stay away from Claire

Oh, Claire
Oh, Claire

You know what?
That's funny you know, I don't miss you at all
Not even a little, you bitch
I still love you

I still remember seeing you sleep
All twisted up inside the sheets
And I still remember everything you said
Every time I hear your name, Claire
Oh, Claire
Oh, Claire
