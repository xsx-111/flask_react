Good Lyrics
You're good, good, good
Good
You're good, good, good
You're good

Somethin' tells me, somethin' tells me
Somethin' tells me you can read my mind
Somethin' tells me, somethin' tells me
Somethin' tells me you can read my mind

Somethin' tells me you can read my mind
Your brain is callin' to me one more time

Your brain, your brain
Your brain is callin' to me one more time
Your brain, your brain
Your brain is callin' to me one more time
You're good

You push, push, push
So good
You push, push, push
You're good
Somethin' tells me, somethin' tells me
Somethin' tells me you can read my mind
Somethin' tells me, somethin' tells me
Somethin' tells me you can read my mind

Somethin' tells me you can read my mind
Your brain is callin' to me one more time
Somethin' tells me you can read my mind
Your brain is callin' to me one more time

Your brain, your brain
Your brain is callin' to me one more time
Your brain, your brain
Your brain is callin' to me one more time
You're good, good, good
So goodEmbed
