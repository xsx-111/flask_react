The Other Side Lyrics
I'm going down to the river
There's a man I wanna see
Yeah, he's the ferryman
He'll recognize me

I'm going down now to the riverside
There's a place I wanna be
I'm going to talk to the ferryman
He'll be expecting me

I'm crossing over now to the other side

Life is better there on the other side
The grass is greener there on the other side
And I, I get even there on the other side
And everything will turn out all right on the other side

I'm crossing over now to the other side
The other side…

I walked by the church house late last night
Yeah, I walked by the church house, but I didn't go inside
'Cause I, I once slept with the preacher's wife
She handed me a ticket to the other side
I'm crossing over now to the other side
To the other side…Embed
