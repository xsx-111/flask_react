You Speak My Language LyricsAll around the world, everywhere I go
No one understands me
No one knows what I'm trying to say
Everywhere I go no one understands me
They look at me when I talk to them
And they scratch their head
They go, "What's he trying to say?"
But you… you speak my language
But you… you speak my language
Yeah! Yes!
All around the world, everywhere I go
No one understands me
No one knows what I'm trying to say
Even in my home town
My friends make me write it down
They look at me when I talk to them
And they shrug their shoulders
They go, "What's he talking about?
But you… you speak my language
But you… you speak my language
Yes!
