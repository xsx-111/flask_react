How Deep It Goes LyricsIn the quiet afternoon you
Left and went down into town
And I just watched the empty road behind you
Where the fog lies kissing the mountainside
You want to lie sleeping, deep inside
Believing that the hungry world won't find you
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine
You've got to believe
And I don't know, I don't know
What I believe anymore
Or whether to leave, or whether to stay
Or what I can say
To make you know
How deep it goes
Somebody turned on the dirty blues
I know you don't like the blues
'Cause the words are always the same
And they kind of remind you
Somebody turned the blues on me
Well I don't like the blues 'cause I can't see
Through the tears that come and make it hard to find you
Come on down
Come on down
You've got to come lay down here
And say those things, those warm things
Right here in my ear
The times that you had that water like wine
So clean and so fine
To make me know
How deep it goes
Well, that's just fine, that's just fine
You've got to believe
And I don't know, I don't know
If I could leave anymore
Even though there's a scar
Still fresh from the war
Don't think about it no more
Letting new love flow
How deep it goesEmbed
