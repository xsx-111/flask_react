Dreamboat Annie LyricsHeading out this morning, into the sun
Riding on the diamond waves, little darlin' one
Warm wind caress her, her lover it seems
Oh Annie, dreamboat Annie
Ship of dreams
Oh Annie, dreamboat Annie
Little ship of dreams
Going down the city sidewalk
Alone in the crowd
No one knows the lonely one
Whose head's in the clouds
Sad faces painted over with those magazine smiles
Heading out to somewhere
Won't be back for a while
Won't be back for a while
Won't be back for a while
Won't be back for a whileEmbed
