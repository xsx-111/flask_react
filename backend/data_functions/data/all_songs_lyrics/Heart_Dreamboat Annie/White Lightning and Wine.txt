White Lightning and Wine LyricsLast night's gone, we're moving on
Highways call out loud
I bring them in with their eyes of sin
It's a down drinkin' freaky crowd
I chew you up and spit you out
Never want to know your name
Don't want to know you
Sure want to show you
Never will forget I came
Oh, the world's all mine
White lightning and wine
Came on so fast, when did I last
Feel this fine? Ooh, yeah
Ooh, White lightning and wine, yeah
Sweet little one, let me love you some
Take me or leave me alone
The gooder they come, the harder they fall
Turn around you are a nasty joke
Ah, yeah, we all laugh ah, hah, what a gas!
Watching you chew on the bones
In the morning light you didn't look so nice
Guess you'd better hitch hike home
Well the world's all mine
White lightning and wine
Came on so fast, when did I last
Feel this fine? ohh
Ooo, well the world's all mine
White lightning and wine
Came on so fast, when did I last
Feel this fine?
Yeah, yeah
Ah huh, drink white lightning and, ah
Ooh white lightning and wine, yeah
Ooh yeah
Aah, hey
Alright
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Alright
Alright
Alright
Uh uh, yeah
AlrightEmbed
