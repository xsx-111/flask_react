Your Time Will Come LyricsShe is but a shadow
Of her former self
You can't recognise her
She is someone else
Your time will come
She is not the same person
She just keeps changing
She is but a shadow of her former self
Your time will come
In the garden...
In the stillness of morning
Your time will comeEmbed
