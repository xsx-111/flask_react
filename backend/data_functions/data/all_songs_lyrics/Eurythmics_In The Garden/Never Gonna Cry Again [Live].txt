Never Gonna Cry Again  LyricsI'm never gonna cry again
I'm never gonna die again
I shed some tears for you
I shed more tears for you than the ocean
I didn't wanna let you know
I didn't wanna take your time
I didn't wanna bring you down
I didn't want to hang around you
So we're living in desperate times
Oh such an unfortunate time
I can't relate to you
I just can't find a place to be near youEmbed
