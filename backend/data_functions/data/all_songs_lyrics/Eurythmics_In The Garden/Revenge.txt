Revenge LyricsShe said revenge can be so sweet
I like to take it when I can
I need to play with the ones I hate
I like to see them suffer
It has to be dangerous
It has to be refined
It has to be skillfull
You need to take your time
She said I take care
Of my resources
You never know
When you might need them
I'm fast and I'm strong
My reflexes are good
It doesn't take long
To achieve my deserved revengeEmbed
