Vibes Lyrics
Skin to skin, seeping in
Flickering, our eyes go wide
You're giving me studder sight
Painting stars in our hearts
Yeah, you know I'm down for you
I want you to lick my wounds

What's your line, though?
That I'm fine, oh
Heard that before
But somehow, it means more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high, falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high, falling into you
Break away all the things
Stopping me from letting go
Temperature is taking hold (Oh)
Heart beating faster and faster
I'll be your (You'll be my) brand new disaster
But I don't know
Seems like what you're looking for

What's your type, though?
Am I right, no?
Heard that before
But still, you want it more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high, falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high, falling into you
What's your type, though?
Am I right, no?
Heard that before
But still, you want it more

Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
These vibes, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes
Whisper pretty little things
Heart sings, I feel it, oh
Dreamer, trippin' on your highs
Feelin' all the vibes

Tell me, do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high, falling into you
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Do you feel 'em, too?
I feel ya, feel ya, feel ya
Feeling so high, falling into you10Embed
