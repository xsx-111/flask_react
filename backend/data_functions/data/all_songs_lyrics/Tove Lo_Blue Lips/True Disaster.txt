True Disaster Lyrics
Pretty boys, they didn't teach me things I didn't know
They don't have the thing that I need
But they don't know they don't
You got that whole thing about ya and I can't hide my feels
Pretty girls, they always die out, need another sex appeal

I said, come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on, I know I'm gonna get hurt
Come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on

Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Pretty girls, they like it fancy, but you don't keep it clean
We get dirty and we go hard, some things we don't mean
Tell me, "No one's gonna get ya," I'm just straight up mad
I fool in love, roll up beside me, and you're just as bad

I said, come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on, I know I'm gonna get hurt
Come on, give zero fucks about it
Come on
Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Keep playing 'em like
Keep playing 'em like
Yeah, keep playing 'em like
Keep playing 'em like
Yeah, keep playing 'em like

I'm gonna get hurt
I'm gonna get hurt
Ah, come on

Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster
Keep playing my heartstrings faster and faster
You can be just what I want, my true disaster

Keep playing 'em like
Keep playing 'em like
You keep, you keep, you keep playing 'em like
Yeah, keep playing 'em like
Keep playing 'em like
Yeah, keep playing 'em like30Embed
