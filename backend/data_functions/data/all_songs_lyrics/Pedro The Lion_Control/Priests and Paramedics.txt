Priests and Paramedics LyricsParamedics brave and strong
Up before the break of dawn
Putting poker faces on
Broken bodies all day long
The neighbors heard a fight
Someone had a knife
It must have been the wife
Husband's lost a lot of blood
He wakes up screaming "oh my god"
Am I gonna die?
Am I gonna die?
As they strapped his arms down to his sides
Times like these
They've been taught to lie
"Buddy just calm down, you'll be alright."
Several friends came to his grave
His children were so well behaved
As the priest got up to speak
The assembly craved relief
But he himself had given up
So instead he offered them
This bitter cup
You're gonna die
We're all gonna die
Could be twenty years
Could be tonight
Lately I have been
Wondering why
We go through so much trouble
To postpone the unavoidable
And prolong the pain of being aliveEmbed
