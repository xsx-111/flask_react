Second Best Lyrics
The impact
The aftershave
The European cigarettes
The taxi
The alcohol
That lingers on your breath
The lipstick
The street lamp
The woolen overcoat
The front desk
You tell yourself
It isn't over yet

Second best, oh, second best
I can learn to live with this
Plus, I really need a rest
After all, what's wrong with second best
What's wrong with second best

The motel
The distances
Cave into kisses, cold and wet
Familiar exchanges
Like needle pulling thread
The empty movements that once were so inspired
Desperate attempts to fan the flame without the fire

The mattress creaks beneath
The symphony of misery and cum
Still, we lie jerking back and forth
And blurring into one
