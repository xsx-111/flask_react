Options Lyrics
We were walking, holding hands
With our bare feet in the sand
And the seagulls overhead
When I broke the spell and said

I could never divorce you
Without a good reason
And though I may never have to
It's good to have options

But for now, I need you
But for now, I need you
But for now, I need you

But it was only in my head
Because no one ever says
What they really mean to say
When there's so much at stake

So I told her I loved her
And she told me she loved me
And I mostly believed her
And she mostly believed me5Embed
