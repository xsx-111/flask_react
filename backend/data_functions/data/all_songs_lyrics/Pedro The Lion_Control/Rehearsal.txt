Rehearsal Lyrics
It's so priceless when you say you have to work late
When we both know you're at a motel
Here's the thing that's so much more depressing
Than the infidelity itself

Darling, you are so unoriginal
Each move more obvious than the one before it

You know I always said that I would kill you
If I ever caught you stepping out
Now I see I did not know the half of
What hatred and revenge were all about


And I guess I could be bigger but I'd rather make you pay

Darling, you are so unoriginal
You'll see that I can be so unoriginal just like youEmbed
