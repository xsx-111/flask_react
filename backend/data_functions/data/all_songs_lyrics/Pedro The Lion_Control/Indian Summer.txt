Indian Summer LyricsUltra-violet rays are washing over all the boys and girls
As their moms lay tanning by the pool
Oh look their dad's arriving home
All the children hug his neck unaware of their inheritance
All of the experts say you ought to start them young
That way they'll naturally love the taste of corporate cum
God bless the indian summer
God bless the indian summer
God bless the indian summer
Don't you just love the sun?
Doesn't it make you feel good, all over?
It's my pleasure to announce
In conjunction with the fed
And my recent popularity
Thanks in part to Mother Nature
It will never rain again
It should do wonders for the GNP
If you're just joining us now
You missed a brilliant speech
We go now live in the streets
To find out what the voters think
He's worked a miracle
I just now bought a brand new car
God bless the indian summer
God bless the indian summer
God bless the indian summerEmbed
