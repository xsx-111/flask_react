Heart Attack Man - Unplugged LyricsDrink a six pack and then you play some ball
Walking down the stairs and then he starts to fall
Add on two joints and then he starts to sweat
Two hundred seventy five pounds, that you can't forget
Heart attack, heart attack man
Spend all your money on your health insurance plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Keep on getting bigger, because you know that you can
Why do you force yourself on top of that girl?
Laugh with all your buddies, because it's a man's man's world
Someday that shit will come back to you
You've been throwing your weight around and your shit is through
Heart attack, heart attack man
Going nowhere, got no master plan
Heart attack, heart attack man
Heart attack
Weighs in at two seventy five
Yeh, my man is lucky to be alive
Smokin' and drinkin' too
My man, the heart attack man, is gonna be running over you
Got no God damn respect
Had to put the big big bitch ass in check
Heart attack, heart attack man
Lungs full of tar and a stomach full of spam
Heart attack, heart attack man
Time to change your ways heart attack man
{What do we know about partying or anything else?}Embed
