Resolution Time LyricsActin' like the last generation on earth
You're gonna fuck up a place for new birth
You're cutting the last of the forests on the planet
Only a few hundred years since Columbus landed
Well it's due time that we look and pay attention
As the windows who knows show the knowledge with us
Cause it's the one that we prayed for, from on the earth
I give the wisdom to folks, you know whole worth
In these great times we still neglect
When they invent this land, don't give the due respect
Cause the FBI and the CIA
The whole federal government, the FDA
Well, the system doesnâ€™t work and it must be changed
And there's more people in the pen everyday
So I visualize resolution
Yo, everyday is in a state of evolution
Evolution time
Evolution time
Revolution time
Revolution time
Revelation time
Revelation time
Resolution time
Resolution
We come a long way with the peace in the East
But on the home front, they're wild in the streets
As it gets got hear a changing in same
And this is the Millennium still felt today
I hear the same stories time after time
The stories of fear, through violent crimes
Committed by hatred by satient beings
Who shall loose by kindness and it's plain to see
Now we don't have to stand for this oppression any longer
If we stand together, there's nothing stronger
We must interconnect it as though we sure have won
If we want to avoid planetary destruction
So I work and I work because the hate in my mind
Has assumed the truth and I know I'll find
And I visualize resolution
See it all as a state of constant evolution
Evolution time
Evolution time
Revolution time
Revolution time
Revelation time
Revelation time
Resolution time
Resolution
The world leaders were terrified of loosing their pride
Their spoiled children tellin' little wack lies
Vanishing numbers of unimaginable destruction
Sure as we boast they're at their last production
Threatening and challenging nature against nation
Walkin' down the road of total annihilation
Sprouting threats is insecure
Guns are for the fighting and they're immature
And it all stems from self-important police
Thinking that we're better than our fellow human beings
So I wanna empower the limit I can
And pass it along so we can do pass the pan
Sometimes I sit and I watch my mind
Watchin' my thoughts as they reel and wind
And stop and visualize resolution
For everyday is in a state of evolution
Evolution time
Evolution time
Revolution time
Revolution time
Revelation time
Revelation time
Resolution time
