Dope Little Song LyricsIt's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
Like Frankenstein or Count Dracula
I grab the mic and then I fuck it up
I never settle for less and that's a fact
I'm lettin' you know we not the wack wack
Been nice and all that, c'mon and I'm a keep goin' yup
Bound to make money off the shit that I'm growing
Like that y'all and you don't quit
Keep it on y'all rock the sure shit
I put the pen to the paper and I went off
I'm dropping knowledge and wisdom like a mad head dog
Step into the function cause I'm representing
Lyrics on the brain and they sit fermenting
I try to go and learn the give and the go
Free up my mind let loose with the lyric flow
Trying to get Frank get back, get back, right
Trying to stay positive and feeling alright
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
"Keep goin' on and on and on and on and on"
So pass the pen and then pass the pad
Like DJ Run there was nothin' ever like the
The sex rhyme kid is back in the panic
Gonna drop the ball on my damn mechanic whoo
Fuckin' up my Nova, naw fuckin' up my life, shit
Fuckin' with my world, cause he's fuckin' with the pipe, aw damn
Like the saying goes, you gotta call and duke it off
Ask Juanito, he'll tell you all about it
Gettin' blind in the mind, two hits and a cough
Put my pager on vibrate, and jerk myself off
Weight on my shoulders and now I'm stressin'
Gotta get back and count my blessings
Stuck on my cellular, I can't get off
This ride is in motion and I can't get let off
Get my penis double clepped and my balls rotated (what?)..
Realized I was trying to get my brain notated
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quit
It's like that y'all and ya don't quitEmbed
