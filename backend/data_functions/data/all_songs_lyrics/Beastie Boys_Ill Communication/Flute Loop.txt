Flute Loop Lyrics
I ain't goin' no place
Move? Me?!
Give it up and you don't quit
Like that y'all pop some more shit

So, so, so, just sit back and max and relax
Off the tracks that I kick, come on and live it up
Cause I get funky like diaper rash (Nah)
And you know I'm mad spunky, and I'm making cash
Well, I got sex rhymes like Victoria got secrets
To all you porno peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing
Like getting shot out the barrel of a wave
Like virgin pow on the peaks of AK
Like a sound that goes to the depths of the soul
Well, that's the feeling that I make my goal

Music to rock the nation
Music to rock the nation
Uh, uh, check it out
Uh, leave it out
A little wine with my dinner so I'm in my Grape Ape
I feel like a winner when I make a mixtape
Cause I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill and you can't say nothing
More soul on this train than Don Cornelius
Got the mad sub-woofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
The wires hitting switches connected at the junction
Perlman's got beats and it ain't no secret
Dante found his shit but you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Down in SD50 'til the early morning

Music to rock the nation
Music to rock the nation2Embed
