The Maestro (Live) Lyrics{Yo Cory this is Al, you can kiss my ass
I ain't interested in you anyhow
I'm just interested in the B-boys, so fuck you my man}
Yeah!
Who is that?
Who is the man coming down your block?
It's me you see with the funk in my walk
'Cause I'm doin' just what I like to
Today is my day yeah, and I'm a get nice too
You gotta keep movin' and you can't say nothing
I'm a keep bouncin' and bumpin' and struttin'
One thing you ought to know
Well I am the maestro
Yeah you motherfuckers, I am all that
I see you lookin' at me sayin', how can he be so skinny and live so phat?
You know why? 'Cause I'm the maestro, yeah you know and I'm
You got that?
I feel like Rufus Thomas, the crown prince of dance
I'm Mike D and I'm known for romance
I'm the crazy baldhead with the part on the side
And I'm riding down the block like I'm on a water slide
'Cause it's the type of day I feel like pressing my luck
'Cause I got nothing to lose 'cause I don't give a fuck
See a player, I play, don't play to win, I play to show
Yeah, I'm the maestro!
Aw yeah, I need everybody's cooperation right about now
I'd like to find out whose favorite detective it is
Is it Mannix? (No!)
Barnaby Jones? (No!)
Somebody say Columbo (Yeah!)
Micky Mahoney?
Clancy Claranin?
Barnaby Jones?
I said that already
Yeah that's right ya'll, you know I got my own shit
See this ain't America's Most Wanted, this is America's Most Mackin'
That's right other people oughta call it mockin'
When I get on there is no stoppin'
Who is that?
Who is the man? Who is the man? Who is the man?
(The maestro)
Three cheers for the maestroEmbed
