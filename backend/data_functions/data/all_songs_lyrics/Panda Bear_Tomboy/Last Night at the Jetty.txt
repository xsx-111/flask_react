Last Night at the Jetty Lyrics
Dreams that we once had
Did we have them anyway?
Seems that we once had
Now we'll have them all the time

Didn't we?
Didn't we?
Didn't we have a good time?
I know we
I know we
I know we had a real time now
Who could say we're not just as we were?
No one could deny
My, my

I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know  I know
I know I know

I don't want to describe something that I'm not
I don't want to hide the hopes that I have
I want to enjoy what's meant to enjoy
Not try to find slights and slurs to employ
Say what you will
I've a pretty sound mind to go
I know I could not go
Even if I had the eyes to try

You have your ways
I have my ways
We have our ways
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my-

Dream that I once had
Did I have it, anyways?
Seems that I once had
Now I'll have them all the time
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
Didn't I have a good time?
I know I
I know I
I know I had a real time now
Who could say I'm not just as I was?
No one could deny
My, myEmbed
