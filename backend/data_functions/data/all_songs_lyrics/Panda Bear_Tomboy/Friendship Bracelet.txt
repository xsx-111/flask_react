Friendship Bracelet Lyrics
I always thought that I'd move further from
Further and further and further and even further from
The very people closest to me
I see these in daydreams

And like so many other things
It happened
Slowly happened, slowly happened
And without notice I've become someone who's out of reach
I'm as much to blame

But I don't want to sound as though I'm wishing
Always wanting, always hoping
I had not made the choices I have made
Because what's in that?
One is gained, one lost

And still to say I've made grave mistakes
And every upon every upon every
I think about and hope it's all worked out to either end
What acts, what cost
 (x4)
Cannot be destroyed with a friend's ring at the side
Don't break ties that hold them round the ring
 (x10)
Don't breakEmbed
