Afterburner Lyrics
I'm not down to keep up, to keep up
Trying to keep up
One slip up
Up on our, up on our way
Up on our
I'm so tired of taking
Of taking it, of taking
One slip up
Up on our, up on our way
Up on our

I don't buy
I don't buy it
I say
Surely if alone

So it moves forwards
I'll always ask, I'll always
What's the point of making?
The makings are, the makings, our only hope
It's not late
It's not too late, it's not late
To keep it real
You ask me to keep it real
You ask me

Surely
 (x3)
I don't buy
Don't buy it
I don't buy
Don't buy itEmbed
