You Can Count on Me Lyrics
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it

Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it
Know you can count on me
I'll get so up for it

Know at least I'll try
Who are you if I'm not up for it?
Where are you if I'm not up for it?
Want to put a bubble 'round you
Like a force-field switch
Keep you secured just a little bit
But I know a secret child is just
A silly trick
Who grows up to lose that force-field switch
In between a hands on and a hands off
'Prenticeship
Where are you if I'm not up for it?
I'll get up for it
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it
Know you can count on me
I'll get so up for it

Know at least I'll try1Embed
