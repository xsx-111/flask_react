Underground Medecin Lyrics(Your nervous system, your nervous system)
(Underground medicine, underground medicine)
A spark inside
Traverse up my hide
And when it clicks
There's no resist
Every time I hear a new baby cry
I thank my spark inside
And you get underground medicine
Underground medicine
I'm but a nervous system
Underground medicine
I found a reason not to die
A reason for the ride
The spark inside
When it hits the mind you get
Underground medicine
Underground medicine
I'm but a nervous system
Underground medicine
I had a psychosomatic voice
And one time it might come back
Underground medicine
Underground medicine
I'm but a nervous system
Underground medicine
On my pants I spilled expectorant
And the colonel shot better with 30 pints
They took his cup away
Take it away, take it away
(Used to 'ground) medicine
(Used to 'ground) medicine
(Used to 'ground) medicineEmbed
