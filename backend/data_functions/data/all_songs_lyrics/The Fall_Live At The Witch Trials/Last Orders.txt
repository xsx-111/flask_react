Last Orders LyricsEverybody's telling me to listen up
They're trying to run my life for me
I'm gonna tell I'll tell 'em
Their term's up
(Chorus)
They've just given me their
Last orders (x4)
Everyone's in prison or in the army
All sincere, all phoney
Reading all the books, taking in the news
(Chorus)
I don't dig their dead-end options
I'm not hurt by their rejections
I'm no sell-out, and they've found out
(Chorus)
Everybody's telling me to listen up
They're trying to write my life story
Joke's on them
It's the end of the rap
(Chorus)Embed
