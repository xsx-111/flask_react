No Xmas for John Quays LyricsThe X in Xmas is a substitute crucifix for Christ
A one, two
A one, two, three, four!
No Christmas for John Quays
No Christmas for John Quays
No Christmas for John Quays
No Christmas for John Quays
Well the powders reach you
And the powders teach you
But when you find that they can't reach you
There is no Christmas for junky
He thinks he is
More interesting
Than the world
Ah but buying cigs
Puts him in a whirl
I'll have a packet of three-five fives
Will you fucking put the monitors on for Christ's sake?
I'll have a packet of three-five fives
I'll have 20 of those over there
I'll have 20 No.6 for a headache
And I've had enough right there, stop
Good King Wenceslas
Silly bugger, he fell out
He spits in the sky
It falls in his eye
And then he gets to sitting
Talking to his kitten
Talking about Frankie Lymon
Tell me why is it so?
Tell me why is it so?
Out of his face with the Idle Race
Out of the room with this tune
Although the skins are thin
He knows it's up to him
To go out or stay in
Oh, I'll stay in
I'll stay in, I'll stay in, I'll stay in, I'll stay in
You, me
X-Mas
X-Mas
Well the powders reach you
And the powders teach you
But when you find they can't reach you
There is no Christmas for John Quays
No girls
No curls
Just the traffic passing by
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
One, two, three, four
No Christmas for John Quays
No Christmas for John Quays
No Christmas for John Quays
No Christmas for John Quays1Embed
