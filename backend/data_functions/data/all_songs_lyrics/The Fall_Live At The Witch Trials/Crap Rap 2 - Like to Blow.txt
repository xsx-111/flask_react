Crap Rap 2 / Like to Blow LyricsWe are the Fall
Northern white crap that talks back
We are not black, tall
No boxes for us
Do not fuck us
We are frigid stars
We were spitting
We were snapping
"Cop Out, Cop Out!"
As if from heaven
Sucker, Sucker, Sucker
Sucker, Sucker, Sucker
Sucker, Sucker, Sucker
No stars in the zone
I stay at home
I live on snacks
Potatoes in packs
I like to blow
I like to blow
I like to blow
Concentration zone
The years go in circles
The years go in circles
Hopes goes, I'm gone
Smoke comes, i go
I like to blow
I like to blow
I like to blow
Concentration zone
A spurs fan, a warrior
Happy no-hoper
Dull, manage
I think slow
I like to blow
I like to blow
I like to blow
Concentration zone
Sucker, Sucker, Sucker
Sucker, Sucker, Sucker
Sucker, Sucker, BlowEmbed
