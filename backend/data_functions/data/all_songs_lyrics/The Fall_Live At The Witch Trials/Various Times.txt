Various Times Lyrics(Replaces Mother-Sisterand Industrial Estate on the U.S. version of the LP)
Alright we're going to go back
To 1940
No money
And I live in Berlin
I think I'll join up
Become a camp guard
No war for me
An old Jew's face dripping red
I hate the prisoners
I hate the officers
There's no fight
I think I'll join
The red rose
Leave Belsen
I'll go to Switzerland
A human resistor
Don't think, ask him
Present :
I don't like them
Said Ian
In his black-out threats
I think I'll drop out
Become a no-man
And live my rules
But I'm the sort that gets
Out of the bath with a dirty face
Everyone I meet's the same now
No brains or thought
A good case for the systems we like - we get
Human race
Various times
Don't think, ask him
Future:
1980
Black windows
And smokey holes
My head is full of lead
And the beer is so weak
Since they got rid of time around here
Dr. Doom fresh from Salem
And the witch trials
The Lathe of Heaven
Time mistaken
Three places at once
Human race
Don't think, ask him
Ask him
Ask himEmbed
