Live at the Witch Trials LyricsWe're still one step ahead of you
I still believe in the R and R dream
R and R as primal scream
Tied to the Puritan Ethic
Nonsympathetic to spastics
After all this, still a lonely bastard
Eggheads, boneheads, queue
Queue for them
We were early and we were late
But, still, live at the witch trials....Embed
