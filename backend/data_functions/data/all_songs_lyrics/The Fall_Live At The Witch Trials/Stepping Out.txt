I used to believe everything I read (x3)
But that's all changed and now I'm stepping out
That's all changed and now I'm
Stepping out (x3)
I used to stay in the house and never go out
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out
I used to stay in the house and never go out
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out, stepping out
I used to stay on my feet all 24 hours
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out
The light'd be on 24 hours
But now I'm stepping out, stepping out, stepping out
So people get ready, strip down your houses
Cause I'm stepping out, stepping out
So people get ready, strip down your houses
Cause I'm stepping out, stepping out, stepping out
I used to believe everything I read (x3)
But that's all changed 'cause now I'm stepping out
That's all changed cause now I'm
Stepping out (x3)
