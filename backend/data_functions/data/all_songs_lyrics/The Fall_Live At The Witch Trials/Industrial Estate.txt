Industrial Estate LyricsGet off the Ind. Est
Get off the Ind. Est
Yeah, yeah, industrial estate
Yeah, yeah, industrial estate
Yeah, yeah, industrial estate
Well you started here to earn your pay
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
Clean neck and ears on your first day
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
Well we tap one another as you walk in the gate
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
And we'd build a canteen but we haven't got much space
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
Yeah, yeah, industrial estate
And the crap in the air will fuck up your face
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
Boss can bloody take most of your wage
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
And if you get a bit of depression
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
Ask the doctor for some valium
(Yeah, yeah, industrial estate)
Yeah, yeah, industrial estate
Yeah, yeah, industrial estate
Yeah, yeah, industrial estateEmbed
