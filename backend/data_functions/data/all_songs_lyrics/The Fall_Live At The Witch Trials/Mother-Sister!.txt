Mother-Sister! Lyrics(Er, what's this song about?
Er, nothing)
No, no recipes
It was like a see-saw
No
It was like an up and down
Bye bye
Mother, sister
Mother, sister
Why did you put your head in?
Breach, reach
It's all a diminished return
Now floorboard creaks
Mother, sister
Mother, sister
Why did you push your head in?
Ashtray
Our friends
And the fathers are underground
Your mouth is sold out
Mother, sister
Mother, sister
Why did you put your head in?
Pile onEmbed
