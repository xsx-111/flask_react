Two Steps Back LyricsEverybody likes me
They think I'm crazy
I pull my string and I do my thing
Two steps back
Two steps back
Two steps back
Two steps back
I don't need the acid factories
I've got mushrooms in the fields
Julian said "How was the gear?"
They don't sell things to you over there
A cigarette goes out when you put it down
Two steps back
Two steps back
Two steps back
Two steps back
Had a look at the free festivals
They're like cinemas with no films
You could make a fire with the seats
You could boil up some cigar dimps
Or get into the sound
Wait for the ice cream to come around
Two steps back
Two doors down
Two steps back
Two steps back
I meet my old friends there
They queue up for cash there
They are part Irish
They have no conscience
They get threatened by the cracker factory
Two steps back
Two steps back
Two steps back
Two steps back
Cracker factory:
A place where you get into the working routine again
Rehabs for no hopes
Prefab for jobless dopesEmbed
