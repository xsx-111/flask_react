Music Scene LyricsOh aye you're a good lad
Here is a pound note
The stupid bitch
They were made for each other
You should have met his brother
His mother was deaf and dumb
Well that stupid get
Played games with names
Of the place he'd worked
Of the women he tupped
He thought he were envy of the music scene
Part of the choosy scene
Envy of the music scene
Here comes long hair for the fair
No pay just take on the way
Those bastards stripped me bare
In front of all those people
Spat peanuts in my hair
And all the leaves are brown
And be part of the music scene
Envy of the choosy scene
Part of the music scene
And aye you're a good lad
Oh here is a new flat
That stupid twat
Made for each other
You should have met his brothers
Real (fuckers)
That stupid kid
Played games with names
All the gigs he'd worked
And the women he'd fucked
He was part of the music scene
Envy of the choosy set
Part of the music scene
Leave a mark on the city
I'll smash your doors down
Become a demolition worker
A metal construction worker
And behind our conscious minds
Our affections are turning grey
Yeah, we're part of the music scene
Envy of the choosy scene
Part of the music scene
Part of the music scene
Part of the choosy scene
6 minutes!
6:40!
OK, studio, that's plentyEmbed
