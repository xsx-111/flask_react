Fair Game LyricsTake a look around you tell me if you see
A girl who thinks she's ordinary lookin' she has got the key
If you can get close enough to look into her eyes
There's something special right behind the bitterness she hides
And you're fair game
You'll never know what she'll decide
You're fair game
Just relax enjoy the ride
Find a way to reach her make yourself a fool
But do it with a little class disregard the rules
'Cause this one knows the bottom line couldn't get a date
The ugly duckling striking back and she'll decide her fate
And you're fair game
You'll never know what she'll decide
You're fair game
Just relax enjoy the ride
The ones you never notice are the ones you have to watch
She's pleasant and she's friendly while she's looking at your crotch
And try your hand at conversation gossip is a lie
And sure enough she'll take you home and make you wanna die
And you're fair game
You'll never know what she'll decide
You're fair game
Just relax enjoy the rideEmbed
