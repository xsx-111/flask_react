Cold Rain LyricsCold rain down on my face
Buses hurry on
Work's out here comes the race
People heading home
Wait a second, don't I know you?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You seem to be like someone I knew
Yes, he lived here but he left
When he thought that there was more
Than cold rain and nowhere to go
Many people share
Sad dreams and hopes that are stained
By the sulphur in the air
Don't I know you?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
You seem to be like someone I knew
He lived here but he left
When he thought that there was more
Than cold rain out on the streets
I am all alone
With cold rain down on my face
I am heading homeEmbed
