Anything at All LyricsAnything you want to know just ask me
I'm the world's most opinionated man
I'll give you an answer if I can (Answer)
Catch one passing through (Passing through)
That feels right for you
Anything you want to know just ask me
It's worth every cent it costs
And you know it's free for you
Special deal
Ah, ah, oh, oh
De, da ...
Anything you want to know it should be perfectly clear
You see just beneath the surface of the mud
There's more mud here
Surprise
Is there anything you want to know
On any subject at all?
I've go time for one more question here
Before I fall, fall
Is there anything at allEmbed
