I Give You Give Blind LyricsHey, would you dig to be alone?
And tell me when will you be back home?
And why did you leave me all alone?
You blew my mind
Fool listen on to yourself
You don't know even when you been left
Tomorrow maybe you'll see the rest
I told you so
You gotta believe in something
If you don't you will be lost
You gotta believe in someone
No matter the cost
Well, hell if I've been had
Then Jesus why's it got to hurt so bad?
And when could something come and make me glad
To be alive?
Look, you got a mind of your own
So listen when it says you could be wrong
The first time is usually when you hear the song
That sets you free
Too late you realize that burning bridges behind you
Every time you lose insisting on something
That perhaps cannot be had
You blow it away
You gotta believe in something
And give it some time
You gotta believe in someone
Go over the line
So love isn't lost so easy
And livin' ain't gonna be so cool and breezy
Look in my eyes know that I am speaking freely
I give you give blind, I give you give blind
I give you give blind, oh yeah, I give you give blind
Hey would you dig to be alone?
And tell me when will you be back home?
And why did you leave me all alone?
You blew it awayEmbed
