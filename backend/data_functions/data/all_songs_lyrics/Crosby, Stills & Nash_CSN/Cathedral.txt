Cathedral Lyrics
6 o'clock in the morning, I feel pretty good
So I dropped into the luxury of the Lords
Fighting dragons and crossing swords
With the people against the hordes
Who came to conquer

7 o'clock in the morning
Here it comes, I taste the warning
And I'm so amazed I'm here today
Seeing things so clear this way
In the car and on my way
To Stonehenge

I'm flying in Winchester Cathedral
Sunlight pouring through the break of day
Stumbled through the door
And into the chamber
There's a lady setting flowers
On a table covered lace
And a cleaner in the distance
Finds a cobweb on a face
And a feeling deep inside of me
Tells me this can't be the place
I'm flying in Winchester Cathedral
All religion has to have its day
Expressions on the face of the Saviour
Made me say, "I can't stay"

Open up the gates of the church
And let me out of here
Too many people have lied in the name of Christ
For anyone to heed the call
So many people have died in the name of Christ
That I can't believe it all
And now I'm standing on the grave
Of a soldier that died in 1799
And the day he died, it was a birthday
And I noticed it was mine
And my head didn't know just who I was
And I went spinning back in time
And I am high upon the altar
High upon the altar, high

I'm flying in Winchester cathedral
It's hard enough to drink the wine
The air inside just hangs in delusion
But given time, I'll be fine
Open up the gates of the church
And let me out of here
Too many people have lied in the name of Christ
For anyone to heed the call
So many people have died in the name of Christ
That I can't believe it all
And now I'm standing on the grave
Of a soldier that died in 1799
And the day he died, it was a birthday
And I noticed it was mine
And my head didn't know just who I was
And I went spinning back in time
And I am high upon the altar
High upon the altar, highEmbed
