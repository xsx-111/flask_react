Shadow Captain LyricsOh, captain what are we hiding from?
You've been hiding from the start
Did some lover steal your heart
Or did the full moon make you mad?
Oh, captain why these speechless seas
That never come to land?
Oh, I need to understand
Could a little light be that bad?
I can see your hands are roughened
By the wheel and the rope
I'd like to look to you for hope
I think it's hiding there
This boat is blacked out like a city
Awaiting bombers in the night
Oh, you hold your helm so tight
And yet the sky seems so fair
Who guides this ship
Dreaming through the seas
Turning and searching
Whichever way you please?
Speak to me
I need to see your face
Shadowy captain
In a darkened space
If I were to spy a city
Floating just above the sea
Could we stop and look for me
Among those playing on the pier?
Or would you turn away knowing
It was still a ways away
And if I was there today
You could not see me all that clear
Who guides this ship
Dreaming through the seas
Turning and searching
Whichever way you please?
Speak to me
I need to see your face
Shadowy captain
In a darkened space
Shadow captain of a charcoal ship
Shadow captain of a charcoal ship
Trying to give the light the slipEmbed
