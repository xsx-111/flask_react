Run from Tears LyricsI don't run from tears
That's my weakness
But I know you still love me
Though you don't believe it
And I never thought that we were a loser
Only didn't hear enough of the songs
Everything was always going to be smoother
All we needed was some time left alone
Something special
Is in me dying, yeah
Are you punishing me
For my weakness
When you know about me girl
I cannot be beaten down too far
And I didn't mean to take you for granted
Only knew that it felt good at home
But you left me so disenchanted
I was blind of course until you were gone
Yeah, I'm drowning
I'm fighting
Something special is in me dying, yeah
There's an empty place in my bed
And my heart is beating against my head, yeah
The blood rushing through my veins
Becomes a flood of tears once againEmbed
