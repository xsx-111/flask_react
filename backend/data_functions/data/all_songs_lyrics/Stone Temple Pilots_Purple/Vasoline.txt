Vasoline Lyrics
One time a thing occurred to me
What's real and what's for sale?
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the vasoline

Two times and it has rendered me
Punch drunk and without bail
Think I'd be safer all alone

Flies in the vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the vasoline
You'll see the look and you'll see the lies
You'll eat the lies and you will


Flies in the vasoline we are
Sometimes it blows my mind
Keep getting stuck here all the time

Isn't you, isn't me
Search for things that you can't see
Going blind, out of reach
Somewhere in the vasoline7Embed
