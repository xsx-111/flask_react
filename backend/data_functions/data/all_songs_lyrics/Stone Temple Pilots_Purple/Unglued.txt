Unglued Lyrics
Moderation is masturbation
What is what and what makes you feel good
All these things I think about, I think about
Always come unglued

Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me

This confusion is my illusion
Nowhere to look, but nowhere to find you
All these things I'm sick about
I'm sick about
Always come unglued

Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me


Moderation is masturbation
What is what and what makes you feel good
All these things I think about
I think about
Always come unglued
Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me
Yeah, I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this thing, it's coming over me
I got this feeling coming over me, over me
Yeah, wah-woo3Embed
