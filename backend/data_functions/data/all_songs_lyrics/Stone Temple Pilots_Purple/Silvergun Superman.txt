Silvergun Superman Lyrics
Find you in the dark
Read you like a cheap surprise
Without shame
Sell me out, and frame your name

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell

You towed the line, and I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
Let me know, can I, friend, ask you why?

Rolling back the days
With my friend I love to play
The "little one"
Superman with silver gun

I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell
You towed the line, and I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
Let me know, can I, friend, ask you why?

Wait for me, take a dive
Take a piece of my life
(Leave me numb)
Wait for me, tell a lie
Try to take my life
(Leave me numb)
Wait for me, take a dive
Take a piece of my life
(leave me numb)
Close to me, and I'll leave you numb

You towed the line, and I know it was mine
Couldn't hide, write a wave, ride a lie
Let me know, can I, friend, ask you why?2Embed
