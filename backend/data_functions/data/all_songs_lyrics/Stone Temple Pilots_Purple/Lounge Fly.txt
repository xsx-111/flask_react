Lounge Fly Lyrics
It's okay, it's okay
Okay, believe me
Pins in me, pins in me, in me, you kill me
The lounge fly, the lounge fly
The fly you bring me
I think I'm free but the dogs they won't release me
Don't have a nickel or a dollar but you feed me
My bottle's empty but you always refuel me
I feel I'm sinking but you won't let me drown me
I want to fuck, I want to fuck
But do you need me?

I can't give what I take away
And the other understands
She said she'd be my woman
She said she'd be my man
I can't live this way
Please refill my soul

It's okay, it's okay
Okay, believe me
Pins in me, pins in me, in me, you kill me
The lounge fly, the lounge fly
The fly you bring me
I think I'm free but the dogs they won't release me
Don't have a nickel or a dollar but you feed me
My bottle's empty but you always refuel me
I feel I'm sinking but you won't let me drown me
I want to fuck, I want to fuck
But do you need me?
I can't give what I take away
And the other understands
She said she'd be my woman
She said she'd be my man
I can't live this way
Please refill my soul

She said she'd be my women (Hurry up)
She said she'd be my women (Will you be my women?)
She said she'd be my man (Will you be my man?)

I can't give what I take away
And the other understands
She said she'd be my woman
She said she'd be my man
I can't live this way
Please refill my soul

She said she'd be my women
She said she'd be my man
She said she'd be my women
She said she'd be my man
She said she'd be my women
She said she'd be my man
She said she'd be my women
She said she'd be my man
She said she'd be my women
She said she'd be my man
She said she'd be my women
She said, she said, she said
She said she'd be my man
She said she'd be my women3Embed
