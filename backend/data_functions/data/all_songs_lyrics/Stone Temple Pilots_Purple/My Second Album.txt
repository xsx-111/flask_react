My Second Album Lyrics
The second album
12 gracious melodies

Worth listening
Hope you enjoy them
Like if it's sung to me
Listen to 12 great tunes
Playing on your stereo
Dining and dancing too
Entertain on the piano

The second album
12 gracious melodies
To listen
Include this number
Keeping you company

Well
Getting on the record soon
Grooving on an afternoon
That's on my album too
This album cover
Looks similar like Johnny Mathis
For Mathis lovers this album has his style
Beautiful numbers are heard on the car radio
After all records are cut in the recording studio
My second album
One dozen melodies
To listen
Include this number
Keeping you company

Well hoping that this record sells
Singing by your wishing well
That's on my album too
The second albumEmbed
