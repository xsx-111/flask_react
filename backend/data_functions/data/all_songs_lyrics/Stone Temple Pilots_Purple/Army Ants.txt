Army Ants Lyrics
You don't look, but you kick me
You can't feel, but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

Why we all have to look this way
I got a heart, I got blood, feel pain

Time, time is not on my side
Because the way I am
Gotta gotta now, got to find the reason why
A woman ain't a man

You don't look, but you kick me
You can't feel, but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

Why do you all have to think this way
I got a heart, I got blood, feel pain

Fall in those single file lines
Like army ants
Yeah, fall on into those single file lines
And complete the plan
You don't look, but you kick me
You can't feel, but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

Why do we all have to feel this way
I got a heart, I got blood, feel pain

You don't look but you kick me
You can't deal with the way I prayEmbed
