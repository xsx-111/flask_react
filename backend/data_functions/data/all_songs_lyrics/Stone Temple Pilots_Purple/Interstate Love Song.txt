Interstate Love Song Lyrics
Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
For what I've read between the lines
Your lies
Feeling like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry
Reply?

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathing is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for
You
You lied
Goodbye

Leaving on a Southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things I said to you20Embed
