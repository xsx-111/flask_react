Pretty Penny Lyrics
Have you seen your mother, girl?
Has she gone away?
Gone away and found the pearl
But the price she paid

Gone when you wake in the morning
Gone when you find that there's no one sleeping
Gone, Pretty Penny was her name
She was loved and we all will miss her

How far will you go I say
Just to bait a mouse?
Shorter lived and longer gone
Can you figure out?

Gone when you wake in the morning
Gone when you find that there's no one sleeping
Gone, Pretty Penny was her name
She was loved and we all will miss her

Have you lost your sister, girl?
She's all but blown away
Blown away and lost the pearl
And the price she paid

Gone when you wake in the morning
Gone when you find that there's no one sleeping
Gone, Pretty Penny was her name
She was loved and we all will miss her

Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
