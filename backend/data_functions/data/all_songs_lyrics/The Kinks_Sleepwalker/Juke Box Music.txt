Juke Box Music Lyrics
There's a lady plays her favorite records
On the jukebox every day
All day long, she plays the same old songs
And she believes the things that they say
Other ladies like to prance around
And flirt and dance the whole night through
But she just sits and listens to her jukebox records
'Cause that's all that she wants to do

She sings along with all the saddest songs
And she believes the stories are real
She lets the music dictate the way that she feels

It's only jukebox music
Only jukebox music
It's only music
Only jukebox music
Only jukebox music

Seems to me she's in a fantasy
She's livin' in a world of her own
And we all agree that she's a mystery
Because she'd rather be all alone
Every guy will do his best to try
To put that music out of her head
Forget all the songs
And just dance to the music instead
It's only jukebox music
Only jukebox music
It's only music
Only jukebox music
Only jukebox music

It's all because of that music
That we're slowly driftin' apart
But it's only there to dance to
So you shouldn't take it to heart

Music, only jukebox music
Only music
Only jukebox music

It's only music
Only jukebox music
It's only music
Only jukebox music
Music
Only jukebox music
Music
Only jukebox music
Music
Only jukebox music
Music
Only jukebox music
Only jukebox musicEmbed
