Counterfeit Reality Lyrics
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fеll in love with the drugs, I fell in lovе with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs

Lean with the plug I connect like a psychic
Got racks in my pocket, I don't need a wallet
Everytime I hit up checks go to B.O.A
Either way its to make a deposit
Designer pack went to the face, what I face
Outerspace everyday I get high like a pilot
She wanna come to the spot, just to have a little talk
But I'm busy so baby let's quiet
Broke out the shrooms so we tripping with baddies in Vegas
We made it, you mad and you hating
Everyday grinding I gotta go get it, that fire I spit it
I'm not talking skating
Niggas they really not bout it
I doubt what you saying
It's true you so cap and a goofy
I can just tell that you pussy
Yeah you and yo nigga just by the way y'all nigga looking
I'm eating lamb and you eating McDonald's
You fumbled the bag but we still doing numbers
Having exotic and you wanna come shop in the trap house
I go dumber I'm running up commas
I'm tryna go buy a mansion and shit for my moms and my fam
By the end of the summer
How do you niggas just lurk on these dames
And just act like you having my nigga stop capping
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugs
I fell in love with the drugs, I fell in love with the drugsEmbed
