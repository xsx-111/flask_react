Illusion Lyrics
(R-R-Rxlvnd)

I'm too high like pilots
Highest young nigga in the cockpit
I don't need no stylist
Stop all the cap, no mileage
I'm in this bitch with my brother
Sticked up, Call of Duty
Call your bitch to come do me
Hit your lil' hoe with no rubber
Hop on the road with that Uzi
Hop in her mouth like this
Snakes in the grass, they hiss
Neck wet like jacuzzi
Neck wet, make me so oowee
No I'm not takin' no risks
When I shoot my shot, won't miss

Yeah, all of this shit an illusion
These niggas really can't see me
And my life is a movie
These niggas watch like T.V
She slurp on the dick like noodles
X pill got me booted
X pill boost my mood
Too geeked up, on the moon
Highest young nigga in the room
These niggas pussy like boom
These niggas pussy like womb
Young nigga stoned like tomb
Can't play me, no fool
I'm in this bitch with my brother
That bitch tryna' be my lover
I could not go and cuff her
I'm too high like pilots
Highest young nigga in the cockpit
I don't need no stylist
Stop all the cap, no mileage
I'm in this bitch with my brother
Sticked up, Call of Duty
Call your bitch to come do me
Hit your lil' hoe with no rubber
Hop on the road with that Uzi
Hop in her mouth like this
Snakes in the grass, they hiss
Neck wet like jacuzzi
Neck wet, make me so oowee
No I'm not takin' no risks
When I shoot my shot, won't miss

Let's goEmbed
