Need4Speed Lyrics
Can't fuck with these sheisty ass niggas

Alien hoe, pretty toes, my bitches on go
I'm tryna get geeked up
Like pole on me, keep it tucked on the motherfucking low
Just in case, try to sneak up
Like see a little boy tryna go and match my speed
These niggas can't keep up
When I'm in the pussy you can call me scuba steve
I just went Need for Speed

My little bitch she too bad to the bone
Dreadloc Rockstar put that shit on
Like Dreadloc Rockstar, dripping in chrome
I'm E.T geeked can't find my way home
Post up with a freak, make a flick on my phone
You know I'm too geeked, you can tеll by my tone
Just roll up the leaf and thеn chief till its gone
Dreadloc Rockstar the beat real
When I wake up in the morning, its 50s and hundreds
I'm wanting and yawning
You know how I'm coming
She love me and suck me
She lucky its lust, so I know it mean nothing
I never did trust, but I'm thinking bout money
But I'm running it up, from a couple of bucks
I was just stuck in the mud
Hammer its on me like Judd
These niggas be holding a grud
I'm strapped the fuck up like a stud
Like boy you too broke you down bad in a rut
You claim that you love her I treat he like slut
These bitches be dogs I'm calling em mutts
I'm rolling that zaza that shit smell like must
I hop in a foreign get left in the dust
I'm overseas off a bean like wasup
I told them little niggas, it's us or it's stuck
Alien hoe, pretty toes, my bitches on go
I'm tryna get geeked up
Like pole on me, keep it tucked on the motherfucking low
Just in case, try to sneak up
Like see a little boy tryna go and match my speed
These niggas can't keep up
When I'm in the pussy you can call me scuba steve
I just went Need for SpeedEmbed
