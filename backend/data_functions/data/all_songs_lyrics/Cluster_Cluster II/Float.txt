Float Lyrics
I'm tryna fuck on you and yo bestie (bitch yo bestie)
Baby girl give me that neck neck get real messy
Yeah I'm rolling off a Tesla please don't test me
Yeah I'm popstar step it up I came correct
Yeah I'm walking pop my shit like who gone check me
Damn baby girl get wet just like a jetski
Shoota pull up with a stick, like Wayne Gretsky
You niggas ain't on shit so stop that flexing

Did this shit all on my own
All by my lonely

Know these niggas be cap, stop that tough talk
Niggas weren't talking bout shit so they got cut off
Hang with pussy niggas that shit gone rub off
Bitch I came up from the dirt had to wipe that mud off
She want me to fuck her raw but I still use a latex
Foreign hoe on go even though I didn't bought my plane yet
Bad bitch overseas on her knees she give me brain yeah
These hoes wanna fuck on me even though a young nigga not famous

Did this shit all on my own
All by my lonelyEmbed
