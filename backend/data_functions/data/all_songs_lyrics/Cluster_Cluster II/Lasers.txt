Lasers Lyrics
Fresh nigga on my block, Fresher than all my opps
All these niggas some opps, these niggas be moving like cops
I pulled up with a little Glock, pulled with a little glick
Pulled up with a little stick, pulled up ready to rock
Riding round town with my brother, I'm riding round town with my cousin (cuzzo)
Burn a nigga out like an oven
Better suck me but I can't cuddle
Try a pussy get wet like a puddle
Sucker real tight like a huddle
Try to ride on me like a shuttle
If it ain't one thing its another
I'm a rockstar just like my mother
Rock a rick with a little undеrcover
Shawty wanna be my lover
But I can nеver go and cuff her
Watch these niggas touch
Pistol on me I'm clutch
These niggas wasn't talking bout nothing
These niggas be holding they nuts
He can't do it like us
I'm rollin' I'm finna get stuck
Esco he be turnt
But all these niggas be burnt
All these bitches gone learn
You ain't next up wait yo turn
Walk in that bitch like Big Worm
Niggas be on that sweet shit
I can not believe this
No I will not sneak diss
Pop my shit, I'm tatted rock the show just signed her cleavage
Shawty she a freaky bitch
I'm with the gang getting geeked and shit
I'm with the gang getting geeked and shit
Niggas be on that sweet shit
I can not believe this
No I will not sneak diss
Pop my shit, I'm tatted rock the show just signed her cleavage
Shawty she a freaky bitch
I'm with the gang getting geeked and shit
I'm with the gang getting geeked and shit
Geeked and shit, geeked and shit
Geeked and shit
I'm with the gang getting geeked and shitEmbed
