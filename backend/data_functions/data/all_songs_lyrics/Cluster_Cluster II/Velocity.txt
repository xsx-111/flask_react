Velocity Lyrics
You cap on the net and its sad niggas go out bad
Catch me with a check, hit the gas I won't come in last
I'm in first place, do the dash when it comes to cash
Nigga like the flash, run a race, nigga counting cake

Bitch I'm bout a bag, I can't lag, hoe I'm going fast
Pull up in a scat, hellcat, nigga I won't crash
Really I just laugh niggas mad and these niggas ass
Got a lot of swag, peep the tags shit you never had
We just get the racks, hoe relax you broke just like a cast
I'm an outkast like three stacks ain't no time to chat
I'm not going back, got a sack bitch I had to stack
I'm getting fly by the speeding ticket
Having exotic you smoking the midget
Hop in the coupe and I'll race you to Lenox
Nut on her tooth and I feel likе a dentist
Hop in the booth and I turn to a menacе
I'm living proof and you niggas some gimmicks

The bitch wasn't talking about nothing
The bitch wasn't talking about nothing, so there's no discussion
Smoke on the zaza blunt give me head rush
Give me head on tour, lets keep in touch
The bitch wasn't talking about nothing
The bitch wasn't talking about nothing, so there's no discussion
Smoke on the zaza blunt give me head rush
Give me head on tour, lets keep in touch
You cap on the net and its sad niggas go out bad
Catch me with a check, hit the gas I won't come in last
I'm in first place, do the dash when it comes to cash
Nigga like the flash, run a race, nigga counting cake

Yeah, let's get it, chopper came with extensions
Big benjis, big racks get her attention (big digits)
I'm geeked, in this bitch with a freak
Y'all nigga trying to go and be just like me
Fuck a little hoe now she trying to be my wife
I can never save a hoe that's on my life
I'm in her mouth and I know that you kissed it
Hit up yo hoe, I just paid her a visit
Niggas don't get it they don't see the vision
Focused on Mary you know that's the mission
You know I'm a boss, I don't need no permission
Fucked em up there ain't no competition
I'm rocking chrome, balenci, and ricky
Hit from the back and the pussy so sticky

You cap on the net and its sad niggas go out bad
Catch me with a check, hit the gas I won't come in last
I'm in first place, do the dash when it comes to cash
Nigga like the flash, run a race, nigga counting cakeEmbed
