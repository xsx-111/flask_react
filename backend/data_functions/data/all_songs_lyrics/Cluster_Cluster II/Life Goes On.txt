Life Goes On Lyrics
I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go man
We get so gone can take it slow man
Thi-thi-this life goes on, can’t lose control man
I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go

I'm in the sky like an extra terrestrial
I am a king, need a crown and a pedestal, bitch
Rolling up gas and medicinal
Going out sad and you broke and its pitiful
Ricky my feet when I step in the void
Back to the future the present is boring
I have ascended I’m gifted, I'm lifted
My vision to vivid it can't be ignored
I pull up, I'm whipping a cyber truck
I just been going in all on you stupid fucks
I am not giving up, made the bih give me suck
Made the bih get a nut, made the bih lick it up
I'm in all black and I feel just like Morpheus
If it get personal, turn em to corpse
I ride with that fye, I gone slide with the torch
I'm stepping on necks we can't show no remorse
I married the money can't get no divorce
Little nigga you pussy couldn’t step off the porch
Rocking the chrome, balenci, and Ricky
You know I’m a rockstar, just call me Lil Jimmy
I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go man
We get so gone can take it slow man
Thi-thi-this life goes on, can’t lose control man
I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go
Bitch it's lil alien, Bitch it's lil alien

Imma go up nigga this year
Imma run it up then disappear
Let me make this shit clear
You niggas couldn’t reach this tier right here
They bite on the drip like they having vaneer
Just hopped in the foreign, I'm switching the gears
I know they gone watch like a movie premiere
Little bitch I'm an alien I'm not from here

I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go man
We get so gone can take it slow man
Thi-thi-this life goes on, can't lose control man
I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go

I ride with young RXLVND, he empty the clip
Got blues in my pocket, hell nah I'm not crip
Rocket on me I'm not talking bout the ship
My pockets obese and yo pockets on limp
Stuffed crud backwood, can't do the skimp
I know that he mad cause we up like a blimp
I'm a P-I-M-P, no I can't be a simp
I'm bathing in ape, and you niggas some chimps
She do what I say I control her like sim
You niggas best lay low, we pop out with dracos
I gave 'em a halo, she thicker than J-LO
I'm geeked up like Fabo, I wrapped up my payroll
Got cheese in my denims, not talking bout queso
Got syrup no maple, you niggas get k rolled
I'm really unstable, got hoes in a stable
And I'm plugged in like cable
I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go man
We get so gone can take it slow man
Thi-thi-this life goes on, can't lose control man
I-I-I-I don't know why these hoes on go
