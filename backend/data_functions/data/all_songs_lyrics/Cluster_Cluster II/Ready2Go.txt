Ready2Go Lyrics
Baby come here, baby give me that physical
Get it on film, baby tryna go digital
Sing to that pussy or I can get lyrical
So baby like what are you tryna do
You freak me turn into an animal
Eat that pussy like mufuckin' cannibal
When I'm geeked I know just how to handle you
And I know that these drugs they can damage you

I think that she ready 2 go

Yeah, I don't got time to be playing and shit
I turn up I go super saiyan and shit
I know that these niggas be fans and shit
I'm hella high, need a landing strip
They said that I can't but I can and shit
She give me head first like a ram and shit
Ride around feel like the man and shit
Ride around town with them bands and shit
I'm trying to fuck her on cam and shit
I fuck but I'm not her man and shit
Baby just please understand and shit
She wanna go and make plans and shit
Baby just want some companionship
Baby come here, baby give me that physical
Get it on film, baby tryna go digital
Send to that pussy or I can get lyrical
So baby like what are you tryna do
You freak me turn into an animal
Need that pussy like mufuckin' cannibal
When I'm geeked I know just how to handle you
And I know that these drugs they can damage you

I'm a real player, can't tell you too much
I tell you the truth and still get what I want
Hit from the back put my thumb in her butt
Hit from the front put my cum in her gut
Say that she love me I know its just lust
Fuck being humble they stumble too much
Ricky my feet and you thought they were chucks
I know she a freak ain't no teeth when she suck
Don't come around if you not one of us
Toting that gun I post up with some thugs
No I don't want her she still show me love
Number one stunna get stepped on like Lugs
Just like a virgin not giving no fucks
Fresh like detergent, this drip came with suds
I was fucked up had to scrape that shit up
Remember back when I was riding the bus
No competition and ain't no comparison
I'm popping my shit yeah they think that I'm arrogant
I'm a little pimp yeah it's all in my heritage
I'm a little player, that bitch tryna marry me
The way that you little niggas move so embarassing
She gave me that pussy and told me to cherish it
I move with a tool what the fuck is you staring at
I am that dude that yo bitch always glaring at
She blow like a flute, she gone blow like a clarinet
These pussy little dudes always talk on the internet
They talking that shit but I swear we not fearing it
I am too sharp they like Esco be spearing that
Not talking money you know we not hearing that
I fucked that bitch, if you want I can give her back
We smoke up exotic until I have a heart attack
You nigga be talking to feds yeah you been a rat
Baby come here, baby give me that physical
Get it on film, baby tryna go digital
Sing to that pussy or I can get lyrical
So baby like what are you tryna do
You freak me turn into an animal
Eat that pussy like mufuckin' cannibal
When I'm geeked I know just how to handle you
And I know that these drugs they gone damage you

I think that she ready 2 goEmbed
