Highspeedchase Lyrics
Push to the limit, Push to the limit, Push to the limit
Push to the limit, Niggas can not see my vision I'm commited
Fast life how I’m living, bitch it's never ending
Push to the limit, Push to the limit, Push to the limit, Push to the limit, High as fuck I'm not Earth bitch I’m lifted
Push to the limit, Push to the limit

I'm on a high speed chase in outerspace (high speed chase)
I'm on a high speed chase accelerate (high speed chase)
High speed chase no need for breaks (high speed chase)
I told her I need space get out my face (I need space)
On a high speed chase fuck the chase
This ain't no scrimage
These niggas finished
The coupe not rented
The coupe came tinted
Revoke the engine
Just give me a minute

Push this bitch to the limit, Push to the limit, Push to the limit
Push to the limit, Niggas can not see my vision I'm commited
Fast life how I'm living, bitch it's never ending
Push to the limit, Push to the limit, Push to the limit, Push to the limit, High as fuck I'm not Earth bitch I’m lifted
Push to the limit, Push to the limitEmbed
