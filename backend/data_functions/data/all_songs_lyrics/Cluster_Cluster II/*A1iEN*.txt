*A1iEN* Lyrics
Lemme just dumb this shit down
I got a freak and I’m bending her down
Drip like a leak, I'm a king, where my crown?
We counting them racks and we holding shit down
You smoke on a gram bitch we smoke out the pound
That bitch is nat, I’m just putting you down
That nigga a rat, he cannot come around
Hit from the back, she gon' scream, she gon' shout
Having them racks, what the fuck is a drought?
Yeah, lil' nigga, yeah
Bitch you know I am a alien
I am not playing, these niggas just really be saying it
Fuck it, might go outer space again
I might just face again, I might just go fuck her face again
I spit that flame like I’m Satan
I go Super Saiyan, the fuck do these niggas bе saying?
Like now can you come gimme top, lil’ bitch?
Camе from the bottom, turned up to the top
All of my new shit, you know that shit rock
Motherfuck 12, we don’t fuck with the cops
Pull up, I’m piped up, I’m swinging my locs
Bro tote a pump 'cause he don’t got a Glock
My other bro told me, "Put money in stocks"
I am too smooth, kinda move like a fox
Basically I am too turnt on you simpletons
Say he the plug but he cap, he the middleman
Racks in my pocket, I’m cool like a ceiling fan
Making deposits and stacking these dividends
He acting tough on the internet
We get them sticks and pull up and get into that
(Sticks and pull up), up, up
Up, up, up, up
Like up, up
Up, up, I'm feeling like Uzi Vert
Little nat tryna come do me first
Told her ass bag back, ho lemme do the verse
Like up, up
Up, up, I'm feeling like Uzi Vert
Little nat tryna come do me first
Told her ass bag back, ho lemme do the verse
Like up

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Lay that bitch down in the bed
Oh, oh, oh
Beam on the Glock and it’s red, yeah
Rockstar, my denim, my pants, uh
I am so high, in demand, yeah
I am so high, I can’t land, uh
And my fit came from Japan, uh
Rockstar, my denim, my pants
And I’m so geeked, I don’t know where to land
Heard you just told on your mans, yeah
Me and lil’ bro, we just hit for some bands
Dig what the fuck I am saying?Embed
