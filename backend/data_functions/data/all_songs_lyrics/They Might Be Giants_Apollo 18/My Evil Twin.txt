My Evil Twin LyricsMy evil twin, bad weather friend
He always wants to start when I want to begin
It scares me so, like I scare myself
With that book of Nostradamus up upon my shelf
Playing hangman 'til the morning light
Doing doughnuts on the neighbor's lawn
Then sleep all through the day, get up and start again
I can hear some sirens somewhere but I don't know why
My evil twin runs home again
Search lights look for an alibi, but I'll be home by then
Here he comes again, my evil twin
My friends have seen him hiding underneath my skin
Who cut the arm off the voodoo doll
That resembles a Republican president from long ago
I'd hate to see you leave
'Cause I have grown so grateful for the blame you save me from
My twin
My twin
My twin
(My twin) I know he looks like me
(My twin) Hates work like me and walks like me
(My twin) He's even got a twin like me
My evil twin, bad weather friend
I know some day I'll meet him
But I don't know where or whenEmbed
