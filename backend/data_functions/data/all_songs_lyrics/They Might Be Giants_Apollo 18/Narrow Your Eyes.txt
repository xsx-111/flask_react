Narrow Your Eyes LyricsI don't want to change your mind
I don't want to think about your mind
They say love is blind
I don't think you're blind
You don't want to understand
I don't want to shake your father's hand
And walk in the sand
And act like a man
I get on the bus, ride past our stop
And though I'm late, I can't get off
I just can't bear to tell you some lies
So narrow your eyes, narrow your eyes
We'll take back everything we've said
Spilt up all the things and move ahead
Forgot how you said
We'll split the side off the bed
I get on my bike, ride down our block
Ride through the world, through the green lights
But when I think of all your advice
I narrow my eyes, narrow my eyes
Now let's toast the sad cold fact
Our love's never coming back
And we'll race to the bottom of the glass
So narrow your eyes, narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyesEmbed
