Mammal LyricsGlass of milk
Standing in between extinction in the cold and explosive radiating growth
So the warm blood flows through the large four-chambered heart
Maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have
Mammal, mammal
Their names are called, they raise a paw
The bat, the cat
Dolphin and dog, koala bear and hog
One of us might lose his hair
But you're reminded that it once was there
From the embryonic whale
To the monkey with no tail
So the warm blood flows
With the red blood cells lacking nuclei
Through the large four-chambered heart
Maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have
Mammal, mammal
Their names are called, they raise a paw
The bat, the cat
Dolphin and dog, koala bear and hog
Placental the sister
Of her brother Marsupial
Their cousin called Monotreme
Dead uncle Allotheria
Mammal, mammal
Their names are called, they raise a paw
The bat, the cat
Dolphin and dog, koala bear and hog
The fox, the ox, giraffe and shrew
Echidna, caribouEmbed
