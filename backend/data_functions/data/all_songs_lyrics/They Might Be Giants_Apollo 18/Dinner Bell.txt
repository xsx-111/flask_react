Dinner Bell Lyrics
I've been leaving on my things
So in the morning when the morning bird sings
There's still dinner on my dinner jacket
'Til the dinner bell rings

Experimental dog
Salivating dog
Good dog
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing
Dinner bell dinner bell ring

I've been leaving on my things
So in the morning when the morning bird sings
There's still dinner on my dinner jacket
'Til the dinner bell rings

(I don't want a pizza, I don't want a piece of peanut brittle, I don't want a pear
I don't want a bagel I don't want a bean I wouldn't like a bag of beef or a beer
Or a cup of chowder, corn, cake, or creamed cauliflower cause I'm)
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing Dinner bell dinner bell ring
Shoulder, bicep, elbow, arm
Forearm, thumb, wrist, knuckle, palm
Middle, pinky, index, ring
Dinner bell dinner bell ding
(I don't know whether I'd rather be having a bottle of vinegar, I don't know whether I'd rather be having an egg
I don't know whether I'd rather be having an order of bacon or whether I'd rather be having a basket of garlic bread
I don't know whether I'd rather be having some pie or saving my appetite cause I'm)
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing
Dinner bell dinner bell ring
I've been leaving on my things
So in the morning when the morning bird sings
There's still dinner on my dinner jacket
'Til the dinner bell does the bell thing
Dinner bell dinner bell do the bell thing
I'm waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing
Dinner bell dinner bell ding ding ding
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing
Dinner bell dinner bell ding ding ding
Waiting for the dinner bell to do the bell thing
Dinner bell dinner bell dingEmbed
