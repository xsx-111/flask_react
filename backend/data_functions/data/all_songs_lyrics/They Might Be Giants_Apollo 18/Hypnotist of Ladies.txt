Hypnotist of Ladies LyricsHe's a hypnotist, hypnotist of ladies
He's a hypnotist, hypnotist of ladies
You're getting sleepy, very sleepy
He's a hypnotist, hypnotist of ladies
Never had a pocket watch, never counted backwards
You won't remember why you liked him
You won't remember why you liked himEmbed
