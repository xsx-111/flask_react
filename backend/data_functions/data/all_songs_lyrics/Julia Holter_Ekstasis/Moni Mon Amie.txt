Moni Mon Amie Lyrics
Moni, mon amie, you'd be the death of me
With your silver lips and lies
Moni, mon amie, I feel so ordinary
When you go out with your friends
And your passion's transparent

O, Moni
O, Moni
O, Moni

O, Moni
Serve me heaven even when you're gone!
O, Moni
In my dreams
O, Moni
O, Moni
Hours become years
O, Moni
When you're gone!
O, Moni

O, Moni
I look at you
O, Moni
And I would rather look at you
O, Moni
And I would rather look at you
Than all the portraits in the world
I look at youEmbed
