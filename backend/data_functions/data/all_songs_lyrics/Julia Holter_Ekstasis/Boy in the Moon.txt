Boy in the Moon LyricsOh, baby salt, baby tears
Go catch me under the window
Go catch me under the doorway
Doorway
Baby salt, feeding tears
Go catch me under the window (Why tears speech me?)
Go catch me under the doorway (Why tears so slow?)
You are the weight of the moon (Baby salt)
You are the perfect story
I can see you drinking my thoughts
Why tears so slow?
Why tears so...
This plane is taking off
This plane is taking off
Both eyes on the moon
Wait for youEmbed
