In the Same Room Lyrics
In this very room
We spent the day and looked over antiquities
Don't you remember?

I can't recall this face, but I want to, but I want to

In this very room
We flew across the sea
(I can't remember your face
But I hope that ship will carry us there)
In the ship Saturnia
Don't you remember?

I can't recall this face, but I want to

Remember your face but I want to
But I know the ship will carry us there
Will carry us, will carry us there

I can't recall this face
I can't recall this face, but I want to, but I want to
I don't remember when
But I hope we'll meet again in the same room
In the same room
In the same room1Embed
