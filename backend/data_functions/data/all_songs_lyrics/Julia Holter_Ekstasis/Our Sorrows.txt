Our Sorrows Lyrics
All voices move out from the order that we left them
Turn up and turn around
Hear them call your name

If you call out, call out, call out
I will follow
If you call out, call out, call out
I will follow you

Meeting at the bus-stop
The early morning look-out crowd
Dizzy from the tire view
Hear them call your name

"Then the others follow;
One, two;
One, two;
One, twoâ€¦
Birds are singing up and down, and all around us"

If you call out, call out, call out
I will follow
If you call out, call out, call out
I will follow you
If you call out, call out, call out
I will follow
If you call out, call out, call out
I will follow you1Embed
