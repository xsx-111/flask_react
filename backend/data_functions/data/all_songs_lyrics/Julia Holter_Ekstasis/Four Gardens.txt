Four Gardens LyricsThere's a song sung over my head
But I can't see who is singing
Still closer than the buildings are far
Will you come go? Will you come go?
Will you come go with me?
Will you come go? Will you come go?
Will you come go with me?
Will you come go? Will you come go?
Will you come go with me?
O, wake in my heart!
I wait in four gardens patiently
O, wake in my heart!
I wait in four gardens patiently
Many many moons, many many moons
I don't see you
Over my head
Many many moons, many many moons
I don't see you
Kicking so fast
Many many moons, many many moons
I don't see you
Over my head
Ooh, what I've just said?
A hard blues
May I skip through, may I skip through
These three words to you?
May I skip through, may I skip through
These three words to you?
O, nothing reveals to your feelings built inside me!
O, nothing reveals to your feelings built inside me!
Will you come go? Will you come go?
Will you come go with me?
Will you come go? Will you come go?
Will you come go with me?
Will you come go? Will you come go?
Will you come go with me?
O, nothing reveals to your feelings built inside me!
Mister, kicking so fast
Do you know where this wave is for you?
Me, a fighter for what is lovely and always flowing
Me, a fighter for what is lovely and always flowing
Is there some shore, is there some shore
Two can swim to?
Is there some shore, is there some shore
Two can swim to?
O, fly right behind my one heart's sea city scenery!
O, fly right behind my one heart's sea city scenery!
O, fly right behind my one heart's sea city scenery!
O, fly right behind my one heart's sea city scenery!
O, fly right behind my one heart's sea city scenery!
O, fly right behind my one heart's sea city scenery!
Many many moons, many many moons
I don't see you
Many many moons, many many moons
I don't see you1Embed
