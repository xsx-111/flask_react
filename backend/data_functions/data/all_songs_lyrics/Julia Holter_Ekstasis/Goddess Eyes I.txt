Goddess Eyes I Lyrics
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry

A plotting goddess tripped him and he fell
A plotting goddess tripped him and he fell

Nowhere
Yet in your dying you are dear to me
Dear to me
No more
Yet in your dying you are dear to me
Dear to me

I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry

A plotting goddess tripped him and he fell
A plotting goddess tripped him and he fell
A plotting goddess tripped him and he fell

Nowhere
Yet in your dying you are dear to me
Dear to me
No more
Yet in your dying you are dear to me
Dear to me
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry

I see you but eyes are not allowed to me
Allowed to me
I see you but eyes are not allowed to me
Allowed to me

Allowed to cry
Allowed to cryEmbed
