This Is Ekstasis Lyrics
3 to 2 to 1
We're losing "I"
In dreams of distance, you crawl close
And as I hover over you
As we are always FarNear
We are far from us too

Near Far!
Near Far!

This is not the quietness, this is the ekstasis
This is not ekstasis, this is the quietness
Near Far!
This is the ekstasis
This is the ekstasis

3 to 2 to 1
We're losing "I"
In dreams of distance, you crawl close
As we are always FarNear, FarNear
As we are always FarNear
We are far from us too
Here to me to you—so far!
Here to me to you—so far!
Here to me to you—so far!
Here to me to you—so far!
Here to me to you—so far!

Joy!
Ekstasis!
Joy!
Ekstasis!

De toutes choses
Le malheur!
De toutes choses
Le malheur!

Joy!
Ekstasis!Embed
