Marienbad Lyrics
I can hear a statue
Wonder why they're so still
All able heels in a garden
Summer's water runs so quickly beside them! (Could it be it for them?)
Could it be, could it be it runs for them?

Dull to be, too staid to be, too bold or stunned
Too young and growing

Ten signs that read "silence"
Ten signs that read "silence"

Ten signs that read "silence"
Too cold to remember a face
Impossible to say
Ten signs that read "silence"
So bored in mammalian skin!
Impossible to say
Ten signs that read "silence"

In frozen green
What's alive?
Impossible to say
Oh, I can hear a statue
I can hear a statue (I can hear)
Wonder why they're so still (A statue)
All able heels in a garden (Wonder why)
Summer's water runs so quickly beside them! (They're so still, all able heels)
Could it be it runs for them? (In a garden)

Could?
Summer's water runs so quickly
Dull
Dull to be, too staid to be
Ohhh
Dull to be, too staid to be
Too bold or stunned

Over stone so still
Like birds so stoically by the drain
Gardens carved of stone
The human whispers, so cold
A fountain ices over
A story over
A mouth says nothing
A few more seconds
Forever marble
Topiary moment
Waiting, I'm waiting by the drain
See the ice never thawing
Their legs always still
Like hearts so stoically
By the drain see gardens carved of stone
The human whispers, so cold
A fountain ices over a stone so still a statue's will to move
Like birds so stoically by the drain
Gardens carved of stone
The human whispers, so cold
A fountain ices over
A story over
A mouth says nothing
A few more seconds
Forever marble
Topiary moment
Waiting, I'm waiting by the drain
See the ice never thawing
Their legs always still
Like hearts so stoically
By the drain see gardens carved of stone
The human whispers, so cold1Embed
