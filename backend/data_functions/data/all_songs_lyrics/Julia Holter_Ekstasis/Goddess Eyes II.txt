Goddess Eyes II Lyrics
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry

I know my killer
I feel her power
I know my killer
I feel her power

All wars, human and god
All wars, human and god
All wars, human and god

I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry

You rush through our stars, but not your sun
Oh, all wars, human and god
All wars, human and god

And my heart hurts so!
And my heart hurts so!
And my heart hurts so!
Come sorrow, sit down

I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry

No more
Yet in your dying you are dear to me, dear to me
No more
Yet in your dying you are dear to me, dear to me

I see you but eyes are not allowed to cry
I see you but eyes are not allowed to cry

I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
No more
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
No more
I can see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry

I see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry
I see you but my eyes are not allowed to cry, allowed to cry
I see you but my eyes are not allowed to cryEmbed
