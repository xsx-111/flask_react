Garf LyricsWell I could be a boy
Without hair in the country
Relaxed and wild
Running down by the creek
Catching those crayfish
And being kinda frightened
But mostly just in awe
Of them mighty crab claws
(now I'm glad I do)
I've wasted
(the way that we're leaving the way that we go)
All my free time
(our lives are better left to chance)
And I've worried
(...pain that... I had to miss the dance)
Just as most kids are of my age
I could be home
With a beer and a movie
Straighten my back
And raping my lungs
While completely maintaining
My absolute innocence
My absolute innocence at all times
And I looked at jewelry
(now I'm glad I do)
For your little finger
(the way that we're leaving the way that we go)
It's so skinny
(our lives are better left to chance)
I can hardly believe you
(...pain that... I had to miss the dance)
I could be standing
For what seems like hours
Shifting my weight
From one foot to another
While watching live music
With the earplugs on
Our nice conversation
Is becoming quite loud
And I'm weary
(now I'm glad...)
Of your ugly pop culture
(the way that we're leaving the way that we go)
You're so pretty
(our lives are better left to chance)
Standing beside the desk
(...pain that... I had to miss the dance)
And I could be sitting
By the telephone tomorrow
To receive a call
By the overweight Garth Brooks
Who would then try to offer me
Like a hundred thousand dollars
Just for me to go the fuck away
And he's waiting
For my kind of reply
I am serious
I couldn't leave you if I triedEmbed
