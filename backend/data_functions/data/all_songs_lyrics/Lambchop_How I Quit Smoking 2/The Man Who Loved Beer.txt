The Man Who Loved Beer LyricsTo whom can I speak today?
The brothers they are evil
But the old friends of today
They have become unlovable
To whom can I speak today?
The gentleness has perished
And the violent man has come down on everyone
To whom can I speak today?
The wrong which roams the earth
There can be no end to it
It is just unstoppable
Death is in my sights today
And when a man desires
To see home after many years in jail
February through December
We had such a tragic year
As separate as the fingers
Or suddenly
As one
As the hand
And the violent man comes down on everyone
And the violent man comes down on everyone
And the violent man comes down on
Everyone1Embed
