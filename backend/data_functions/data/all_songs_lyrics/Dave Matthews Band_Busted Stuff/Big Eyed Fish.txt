Big Eyed Fish Lyrics
Look at this big-eyed fish swimmin' in the sea
Oh, how it dreams to be a bird, swoopin', divin' through the breeze
So one day caught a big old wave up on to the beach
Now he's dead, you see
Beneath the sea is where a fish should be

But, oh, God
Under the weight of life
Things seem brighter on the other side

You see this crazy man decided not to breathe
He turned red and blue, purple, colorful indeed
No matter how his friends begged and pleaded the man would not concede
And now he's dead, you see
The silly man should know you got to breathe

But, oh, God
Under the weight of life
Things seem brighter on the other side
Oh, God
But under the weight of life
Things seem so much better on the other side
No way
No way
No way out of here

You see the little monkey sittin' up in his monkey tree
One day decided to climb down and run off to the city
But look at him now, lost and tired, livin' in the street
As good as dead you see
Do what a monkey does, stay up your tree

But, oh, God
Under the weight of life
Things seem brighter on the other side
Oh, God
Under the weight of life
Things seem so much better on the other side

No way
No way
No way
No way out of hereEmbed
