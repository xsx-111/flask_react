Raven Lyrics
"What you got
What you got in your hand?"
A father said to son
I got the whole world here, Daddy
Between my fingers and my thumb
Well, you take care of it please
It's the only one
Well it would take me a lifetime, old man
To undo what you've done, undo what ya done
Oh come on now boy think
What would Jesus do?
He'd shake his head like an angry mother
Spoke the boy and say I did what I could do
But you take care of it please
It's the only one you got
And it'd take ten lifetimes boy to undo what I've done

Boy shrugged, walked away
The man stood and watched as he was leaving
Boy just walked away
The man stood alone thinking

One hand is bleeding
And the other hand holds a gun
While everything is open
Everything is shut down, down, down
Begin to ending
Is really just a go round and round and round
And as I stand here
The ground beneath is nothing more than one point of view
What you got what you got in your hand?
Your secret's safe with me
Well I found the truth friend
Let me whisper in your ear
Take good care of it please
It's the only one there is
Can I twist it please?
Can I give it just a little twist?


One hand is bleeding
And the other hand holds the gun
Everything is open now
Everything coming down, down, down
No one is holding
Even if you're sure
You never know it all
The ground beneath is nothing more than my point of view


One hand is open
And the other hand holds the gun
Everything is open
Or is everything coming down, down, down
No one is holding
Even if you, even if you know
You never know it all
Nothing more than, nothing more than my point of view
