Busted Stuff Lyrics
Not enough, never too much
Baby, look just like love
Rolling stone gathers no moss
But leave a trail of busted stuff

You know she's going to leave my broken heart behind her
I'll take what she's giving up
You know she's going to leave my broken heart behind her
I'll take what she's giving up yeah

Moveing to kiss those sweet sugar lips
Baby look just like love
Without a care she floats above me
She got me down here looking up

You know she's going to leave my broken heart behind her
I dig what she's giving up
You know she's going to leave this broken man behind
She's the one for me

When she move, she move so cool
Got me feel just like a fool
But inside is where the devil rides
Woman look just like love

You know she's going to leave this broken man behindEmbed
