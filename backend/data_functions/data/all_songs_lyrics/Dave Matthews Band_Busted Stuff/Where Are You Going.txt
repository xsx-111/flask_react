Where Are You Going Lyrics
Where are you going? With your long face
Pulling down, Don't hide away
Like an ocean That you can't see but you can smell
And the sound of the waves crash down

I am no Superman, I have no reasons for you
I am no hero, Oh that's for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are is where I belong
I do know where you go, Is where I want to be
Where are you going?
Where do you go?

Are you looking for answers
To questions under the stars?
Well, if along the way
You are grown weary
You can rest with me until
A brighter day and you're okay

I am no Superman, I have no answers for you
I am no hero, Oh that's for sure
But I do know one thing
Is where you are is where I belong
I do know where you go, Is where I want to be
Where are you going?
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where are you going?
Where do you go?

Where are you going?
Where do you go?
Tell me, where are you going?
Where?
Well, let's go2Embed
