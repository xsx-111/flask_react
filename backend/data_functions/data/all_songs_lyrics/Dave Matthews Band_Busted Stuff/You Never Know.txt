You Never Know LyricsSitting still as stone watching, watching
People walking by you wondering why
No one ever stops to talk or thinks about it
If they ever did
What if God shuffled by?
One day we might see
Doing not a thing
Breathing just to breathe
We might find some reason
But rushing around seems
What's wrong with the world
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there 'til you're dead
Dream
Lying on the roof counting
The suns that fill the sky I wonder is
Someone in the heavens
Looking back down on me -I'll never know
So much space to believe
Funny when you're small
The moon follows the car
Doesn't no one but you see
Hey, the moon is chasing me
I worried if I looked away she'd be gone
Don't lose the dreams inside your head
They'll only be there 'til you're dead
Dream
Walking through the wood
No cares in the world
The world she's come to play
She's all mine just for a day
There's not a moment to lose in the game
Don't let the troubles in your head
Steal too much time you'll soon be dead
So play
All fall down
It won't be so long now
Out of the darkness comes light like a flash
You think you can, you think you can
Sometimes that is the problem
Dream little darling, dream
Spinning on the wind
The leaf fell from the limb
But everyday should be a good day to die
Oh, all fall down
It won't be too long now
Every fire dies
I find it hard to explain how I got here
I think I can, I think I can
And then again, I will falter
Dream
Oh I think I can
I think I can, I think I can
I think I can, I think I can
Dream little darling dream
Spining on the wind
The leaf fell from the limbEmbed
