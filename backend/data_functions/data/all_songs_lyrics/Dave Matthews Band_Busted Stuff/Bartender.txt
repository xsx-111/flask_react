Bartender Lyrics
If I go before I'm old
Oh, brother of mine please don't forget me if I go

Bartender please, fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free
After three days in the ground

Oh, and if I die before my time
Oh, sweet sister of mine please don't regret me if I go
 x2
Bartender please, fill my glass for me
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free
After three days in the ground

I'm on bended knee, I pray
Bartender, please
When I was young I didn't think about it
But now I can't get it out of my mind
I'm on bended knees, father, please

Oh, if all this gold, should steal my soul away
Oh, dear mother of mine, please redirect me if this gold
Bartender, you see, this wine that's drinking me
Came from the vine that strung Judas from the devil's tree roots
Deep deep in the ground
In the ground

I'm on bended knee, I pray
Bartender, please
I'm on bended knee, please, father, please
When I was young I didn't think about it
But now I just want to run and hide
I'm on bended knee
Bartender, pleaseEmbed
