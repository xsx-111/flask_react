Grace Is Gone Lyrics
Neon shines through smoky eyes tonight
It's 2 am, I'm drunk again, it's heavy on my mind
I could never love again so much as I love you
Where you end, where I begin is like a river going through
Take my eyes, take my heart, I need them no more
If never again they fall upon the one I so adore

Excuse me, please, one more drink
Could make it strong? Cause I don't need to think
She broke my heart, my Grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on

One drink to remember, then another to forget
How could I ever dream to find sweet love like you again?
One drink to remember and another to forget

Excuse me, please, one more drink
Could make it strong? Cause I don't need to think
She broke my heart, my Grace is gone
One more drink and I'll move on
One more drink and I'll be gone
You think of things impossible and the sun refuse to shine
I woke with you beside me your cold hand lay in mine

Excuse me, please, one more drink
Could make it strong? Because I don't need to think
She broke my heart, my Grace is gone
One more drink and I'll go
Excuse me, please, one more drink
Could make it strong? Because I don't need to think
She broke my heart, my Grace is gone

One more drink and I'll move on
One more drink and I'll be gone
One more drink, my Grace is gone3Embed
