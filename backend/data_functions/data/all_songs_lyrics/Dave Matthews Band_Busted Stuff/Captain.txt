Captain Lyrics
Crazy as I may
Make my way through this world
It's for no one but me to say
What direction I shall turn now

I am the captain of this ship
Curious hands and fingertips
Day after day
How I long for you my love
How I long

Strange but it seems
Like there's a mutiny brewing inside of me
But I don't want your pity
Only the promise that you'll stay with me tonight

I am the captain of this ship
Curious hands and fingertips
Day after day
How I long for you like crazy

Oh, our love how you do me
Oh, our love, come now lets go again
Oh, our love everything
Oh, won't you play with me again?
We got all night
Same old song
Won't you come stay, my love?
After all

Oh, how could I even try to fight
After falling into your arms?
Oh, mesmerized by your smile
The way it lights up under your eyes
Oh, how could I even try
Love won't you stay with me?


The same old song
Won't you come dance with me, my love?
After allEmbed
