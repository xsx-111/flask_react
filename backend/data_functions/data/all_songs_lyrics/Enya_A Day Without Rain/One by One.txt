One by One Lyrics
He-he-he, he-he-he
He-he-he, he-he-he
He-he-he, he-he-he
He-he-he, he-he-he

Here am I
Yet another goodbye
He says "adios", says "adios"
And do you know why
She won't break down and cry?
She says "Adios", says "Adios, goodbye"

One by one my leaves fall
One by one my tales are told

It's no lie
She is yearning to fly
She says "adios", says "adios"
And now you know why
He's a reason to sigh
She says "Adios", says "Adios, goodbye"
She says "Adios", says "Adios, goodbye"
One by one my leaves fall
One by one my tales are told

My, oh my!
She was aiming too high
He says "Adios", says "Adios"
And now you know why
There's no moon in her sky
He says "Adios", says "Adios, goodbye"
He says "Adios", says "Adios, goodbye"

Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da
Da-day-da-day-da
No goodbyes
For love brightens their eyes
Don't say "Adios", say "Adios"
And do you know why
There's a love that won't die?
Don't say "Adios", say "Adios, goodbye"
Don't say "Adios", say "Adios, goodbye"
Don't say "Adios", say "Adios, goodbye"1Embed
