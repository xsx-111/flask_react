Standing in the Swing LyricsI don't know what you're doing here
When there's murder on the street
I appreciate your concern
But don't waste your time on me
I'm ashes on the water now
Somewhere far away
You think you came here just in time
But you're twenty years too late
You won't have long to wait
"Easy, you said I was easy. This world sharpens teeth. Eat your words..."Embed
