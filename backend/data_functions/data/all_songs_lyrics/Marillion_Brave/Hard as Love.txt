Hard as Love LyricsWell I hear that you were looking out to hunt me down
And I guess you're used to having everything you want
But you know that love can be hard as sticks and stones
I tell you nothing else can be as hard as love can
Well I hear you got my number and you want my name
I'm a stream of noughts and crosses in your R.A.M
But you know that love can be as hard as algebra
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love
Hard as love
Well I hear that you were lookin out to take me home
And I hear that you can handle it and you're not scared
Have you heard about the pictures on my bedroom wall?....
Baby nothing else has ever been as hard as love
Hard as love
Well it makes you hungry and it makes you high
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry
But it's all worthwhile
It makes you humble and it makes you crawl
It makes you tremble and it makes you fall
But it's all worthwhile
It makes you desperate and it makes you dream
It makes you dangerous and it makes you scream
But it's all worthwhile
Just lie back and smile.......
(They will continue to love you even though the rest of the world hates you...)
It makes you hungry and it makes you high
It makes you suffer and it makes you cry
It makes you panic and it makes you vain
It makes you primitive.....Sick inside
It makes you angry and it makes you blind
It makes you guilty and it makes you lie
Tied up and beaten
Spat out and eaten
Suicidal
NOTHIN'S EVER BEEN AS HARD
Well I hear that were lookin' out to change my faith
You can bash me with your book of words
Hammer me down!
But you know that love can be as hard as six inch nails
Baby nothin else has ever been as hard as love
Hard as love
Hard as loveEmbed
