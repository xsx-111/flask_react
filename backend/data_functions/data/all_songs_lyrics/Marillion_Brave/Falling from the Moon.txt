Falling from the Moon LyricsDon't ask me why I'm doing this
You wouldn't understand
You're asking the wrong questions
You couldn't understand
A bridge is not a high place
The fifty-second floor
Icarus would know
A mountain isn't far to fall
When you've fallen from the moon
There's murder on the street
I'm ashes on the water now
Somewhere far away
I have fallen, fallen, from the moon
