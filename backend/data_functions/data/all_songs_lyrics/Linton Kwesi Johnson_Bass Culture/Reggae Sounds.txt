Reggae Sounds LyricsShock, black double down-beat bouncin'
Rock-wize tumble doun sound music
Foot drop, find drum blood story
Bass his'try is a-movin' is a-hurtin' black story
Thunder from a bass drum soundin'
Lightnin' from a trumpet and a organ
Bass and rythm and trumpet double up
Keep up with drums for a deep pound searchin'
Ridim of a tropical, electrical storm
Cool doun to de base of struggle
Flame ridim of historical yearnin'
Flame ridim of de time of turnin'
Measurin' de time for bombs and for burnin'
Slo' drop, make stop, move forward
Dig doun to de root of pain
Shape it into violence for de people
They will know what to do, they will do it
Shock, black double down-beat bouncin'
Rock-wize tumble doun sound music
Foot drop, find drum blood story
Bass his'try is a-movin' is a-hurtin' black story
Riddim of a tropical, electrical storm
Cool doun to de base of struggle
Flame ridim of historical yearnin'
Flame ridim of de time of turnin'
Measurin' de time for bombs and for burnin'
Slo' drop, make stop, move forward
Dig doun to de root of pain
Shape it into violence for de people
They will know what to do, they will do it
Shock, black double down-beat bouncin'
Rock-wize tumble doun sound music
Foot drop, find drum blood story
Bass his'try is a-movin' is a-hurtin' black storyEmbed
