Bass Culture LyricsMuzik of blood
Black reared
Pain rooted
Heart geared;
All tensed up
In the bubble and the bounce
An the leap an the weight-drop
It is the beat of the heart
This pulsing of blood
That is a bublin bass
A bad bad beat
Pushin gainst the wall
Whey bar black blood
An is a whole heappa
Passion a gather
Like a frightful form
Like a righteous harm
Giving off wild like is madness
BAD OUT DEY
Hotta dan di hites of fire
Livin heat doun volcano core
Is di cultural wave a dread people deal
Spirits riled
An rise an rail thunda-wise
Latent powa
In a form resemblin madness
Like violence is di show
Burstin outta slave shackle
Look ya! boun fi harm di wicked
Man feel
Him hurt confirm
Man site
Destruction all aroun
Man turn
Love still confirm
Him destiny a shine lite-wise
Soh life tek the form whey shiff from calm
An hold di way of a deadly storm
Culture pulsin'
High temperature blood
Swingin' anger
Shattering di tightened hold
The false hold
Round flesh whey wail freedom
Bitta cause a blues
Cause a maggot suffering
Cause a blood klaat pressure
Yer still breedin love
Far more mellow
Than di soun of shapes
Chanting loudly
SCATTA-MATTA-SHATTA-SHACK!
What a beat!
For di time is night
When passion gather high
When di beat jus lash
When di wall mus smash
An di beat will shiff
As di culture alltah
When oppression scattaEmbed
