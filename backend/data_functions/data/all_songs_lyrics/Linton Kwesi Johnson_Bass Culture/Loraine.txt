Loraine LyricsWhenever it rains I think of you
And I always remember that day in may
When I saw you walking in the rain
I know not what it was nor why
For usually I'm quite shy
I ax'd your name, you smile and said "Lorraine"
I ax'd if I could share your umbrella
You smiled and said "what a cheeky little fella"
Now I'm standin' in the rain in vain, Loraine
Hoping to see you again
Tears fall from me eyes like rain, Loraine
A terrible pain in me brain, Loraine
You're drivin' me insane
Whenever it rains I think of you
And I always remember that day in may
When I saw you walking in the rain
I know not what it was nor why
For usually I'm quite shy
But from the moment I saw you
I knew, that I needed you in my life
From that moment on I knew
That I wanted you for my wife
Now I'm standin' in the rain in vain, Loraine
Hoping to see you again
Tears fall from me eyes like rain, Loraine
A terrible pain in me brain, Loraine
You're drivin' me insane
Whenever it rains I think of you
And I always remember that day in may
When I saw you walking in the rain
I know not what it was nor why
For usually I'm quite shy
I said " let's go back to my place for some coffee"
You frown and said "boy, kiss me batty"
I fell so ashamed, I did not even notice
When your bus came, and went again
Now I'm standin' in the rain in vain, Loraine
Hoping to see you again
Tears fall from me eyes like rain, Loraine
A terrible pain in me brain, Loraine
You're drivin' me insane, Loraine, Loraine, LoraineEmbed
