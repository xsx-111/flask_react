X-French Tee Shirt LyricsSay what?
You
Move really fast
I saw you screaming at the top floor
Big window crash
I'm deaf
So what'd you have to do that for?
Him?
In giving it up
You chew a little foil
You can't return
To us, to us, to us
You chew a little foil
You can't return
To what, to what, to what, to what
Do
Giving it up and chewing on foil
Have in common?
Bags are packed and out, back, out
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me in just to
Pour me down their mouths
Hold back the road that goes
So that the others may do
That you let me...Embed
