Sweet Year Old LyricsThe fools are slow to leave
So the angels aren't scared no more
Man, they don't quite rush in but
Well, well, well
They move at a comfortable clip
Ooh, they may never leave
Will she ever live?
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Down, down they all file
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Down, down they all file
They all file
Fools gold rush in
Fools slow to leave
So the angels aren't scared no more
Man, they don't quite rush in but
Well, well, well
They move at a comfortable clip
Ooh, they may never leave
Will she ever live?
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Down, down they all file
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Down, down they all file
They all file
Fools gold rush in
Made a, made a man out of you, oh
Get up and go
Dear, my heart, heart
Get up and go
Dear, my hard of heart
Get up and bring
Me the heart of
A sweet year oldEmbed
