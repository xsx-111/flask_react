Trackstar LyricsDo you love him?
Who knows
Why
Got no time for bad black jokes
You
Goodbye
Suitcase
You're wrap 'round dime-store clerk because
The lunch pail
Won't hold two hips that size I'm sure
Objecti-what you say?
Eyes for sneezing allergic cats away
220 miles per hour
M-I-S-S-I-MISUSE-YOU-C-P-R
M-I-S-S-I-MISUSE-YOU-C-P-R
Caste the state I'm spelled in your charge
Three cars
Hard drugs
Which street?
Bang... retreat
Pow... r-repeat?
Retreat
Bang... pow
The sound of shitty radio
It drags
To the future
I can't imagine a worse fate
I think about you all the time
To the future
I can't imagine a worse fate
I think about you all the time
I did some damage so (to the future)
And it gets me down
I think about you all the time
We did some damage, whoa
And it gets me down
To the future
I can't imagine a worse fate
We did some damage so (to the future)
And it gets me down
We did some damage on your truck
I think about you everywhereEmbed
