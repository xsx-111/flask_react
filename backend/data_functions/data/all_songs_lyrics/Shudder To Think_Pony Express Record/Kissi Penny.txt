Kissi Penny LyricsGet dressed said the first cop to the major
Who's in distress?
Some damsel with a canceled subscription to an ambulance
She climbed a tree on call and caught a branch mid-fall
Cheers, the truth, it wears sharp clothes and
So, you cannot undress it
Ooh, a kiss on the mouth instead
Who's in distress?
Some damsel with a canceled subscription to an ambulance
She climbed a tree on call and caught a branch mid-fall
Cheers, the truth, it wears more clothes and
Ooh, you cannot forget
Ooh, my little kiss on the mouth of a friend
Boys you've got a great house
But it's got major holes, a heart-shaped
Five years
And I can't even seem to get to you
Five years
It's a major to-doEmbed
