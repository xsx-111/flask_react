Earthquakes Come Home LyricsYou looked bored but very fine after tea
Everyone moves too slow guaranteed
Buried deep in snow
Dear earthquakes come home
Scare the piss out of the bedpans
The things I like I care for, ooh
Do you care what you're like?
I'd trade a lock of hair for, ooh
You to care what I
Buried deep in snow
Dear earthquakes come home
Scared of
Heaven is holding out for high scores
Up where tears pour
I look good completely bored to the teeth
Everyone moves too slow guaranteed
The things I like I care for, ooh
Do you care what you're like?
I'd trade a lock of hair for, ooh
You to care what I
The things I like I care for, ooh
Do you care what you're like?
Heaven is holding out for high scores
Up there tears pour
Heaven is holding out for high scores
Up there tears pour down
Heaven is holding out for high scores
Up there tears pour down
Heaven is holding out for high scores
Up where tears pour down
Heaven, only out for high scores
Hope your tears dry down the ropeEmbed
