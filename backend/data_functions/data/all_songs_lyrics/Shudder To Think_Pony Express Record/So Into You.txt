So Into You LyricsI am so into you
I can't think nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think nothing else helps
But I'm wondering, yeah I'm wondering
How it's gonna be
The minute I get you near
I am so into you
I can't think nothing else
I am so into you
I can't think nothing else helps
But I'm wondering, yeah I'm wondering
How it's gonna be
The minute I get you next to me
It's gonna be good, don't you know
Gonna love you all over, over and over
So into you, ooh ooh
I am so into you
I can't think of nothing else
I'm wondering how it's gonna be
The minute I get you next to me
It's gonna be good, don't you know
Gonna love you all over, over and over
Me into you, you into me, me into you, oh
