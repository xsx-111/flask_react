Own Me LyricsGirl
You don't own me
You don't own me
You and only
You do not
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Goodbye (farewell)
You don't own me
You don't own me
You and only
You do not
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, farewell
Got you by who knows what
Dumb patrol car blues, red
Eyes no sense how to make you smile
I'm barely born
Too old for drugs but too young
To know how to not get too high
My head's a bomb, the life of a soldier
Oh ooh
You don't own me, no
You don't own me
You and only (all must)
Could you drive the whole world, dear, over?
I feel blind tonight
Tell me what'd you do with the body, girl?
Got you by who knows what
Dumb patrol car blues, red
Eyes no sense how to make you smile
I'm barely born
Too old for drugs but too young
To know how to not get too high
My head's a bomb, the life of a soldier
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, la da yee ah
Oh ooh, uhEmbed
