Hit Liquor LyricsDead asleep
Wonder, when she'll come to
My hip liquor
Party of mouths, a finger fan courtship
The case of her bones are softer than loose meat
A day on the belt, so surely I'll get thin
Then really rock
Dead asleep
Wonder, when she'll come to
My hip liquor
Party of mouths, a finger fan courtship
The case of her bones are softer than loose meat
A day on the belt, so surely I'll get thin
Wanna watch?
One tag, fingers fold up
Get your, movies close down, ooh
Moving wild back stabs
My only one is one well fassblack gunEmbed
