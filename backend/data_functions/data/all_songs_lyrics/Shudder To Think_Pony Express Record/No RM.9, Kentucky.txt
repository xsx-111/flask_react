No RM.9, Kentucky LyricsHappy birthday, baby, yeah
You make me feel blue
Swollen eyes worth since you left
Happy birthday, baby, yeah
I love only you
Swollen eyes worth since you left
That's approval
A stamp of a knife with initials on rubber
A doodle of some ancient mother fucking her son
I predict by 3 am the pill bottle top will have come undone
Doo doo ooh, la doo doo doo
Tongue kiss through the kitchen screen
Doo doo ooh, la doo doo doo
Tongue kiss through the kitchen screen
By 3 am the pill bottle top will have come undone
She'll hand you one long wind short sigh story
That starts with the words
There's no room, Kentucky
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9
I guess you'll do just fine
By 3 am the pill bottle top had come undone
She'll hand you one long wind short sigh story
That's untrue
There is no room nine
No room nine
Doo, doo
Whoa
Doo, doo (doo, doo)
Whoa
She'll hand you one long wind short sigh story
That's untrue
Cause there is no room nine
Nine, nine, nineEmbed
