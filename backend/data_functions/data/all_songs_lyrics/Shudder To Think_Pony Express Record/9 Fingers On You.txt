9 Fingers On You LyricsHello, it's a long road
You’ve got some ape-guy, eight-by-tens
And I can tell what you're thinking
Girl, you get the hustle for your muscle machine
Girl, you've got the muscle for your muscle machine
Girl, you get the hustle for your hustle machine
Girl, you’ve got to hustle for your muscle machine
Hello, it's a long road
You've got some ape-guy, eight-by-tens
They can't tell what I can
(What you think? A-think? A what you thinkin'?)
Only the best in me gets  for everyone (whoa)
Only the best, only the best
 the muscle for  machine
Where'd you get the muscle for your hustle machine
Where'd you get the muscle for your hustle machine
Girl, you've got to hustle for your muscle machine
Hey, I’ve got nine fingers on you
So where’s the 10th pro, get foxy, bottom bin dollar record
A record player entitled "Biddy, I Gotta Bump"
Only the best in me gets  for everyone (whoa)
Only the best, only the best
Oh, I've got nine fingers on you
Whoa, nine fingersEmbed
