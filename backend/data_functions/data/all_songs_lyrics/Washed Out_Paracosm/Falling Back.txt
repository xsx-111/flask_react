Falling Back LyricsYou call my name out at the darkest hour
You try to deny it to forget why, you know inside it's right
You're falling back, you're falling back
Falling back, you're falling back
You can't fight it, you don't know why
You run in circles from what's inside, it's all you've got
You're falling back, you're falling back
Falling back, you're falling backEmbed
