Paracosm LyricsYou're safe, it's over now and we're all alone inside
Our sanctuary where we can get away, a place to run and hide
You're safe, the curtain's drawn and we're all alone inside
In our special place where we can get away escape it all tonight
Inside, we're all alone tonight
You and I, we're far away from it all
Inside, we're all alone tonight
You and I, tonight2Embed
