Weightless LyricsClose your eyes, you're weightless now
Floating safely off the ground
Dear fire above, keep rising up
You're racing towards the stars
You've waited all of your life to leave it all behind
Rise up, forget about yourself forever
Float up, forget about the pain, leave it all and start again
Don't you cry, you've made it out
You're safe from all the low
And over trust he needs it back
I'm far alone and done
You've waited all of your life to leave it all behind
Rise up, forget about yourself forever
Float up, forget about the pain, leave it all and start again1Embed
