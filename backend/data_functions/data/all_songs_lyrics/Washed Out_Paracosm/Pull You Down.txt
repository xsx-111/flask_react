Pull You Down LyricsTry and try to leave behind
All the thoughts reeling by
Hide them all deep inside
They all come back
To pull you right back down
'Til you drown
You drown
You drown
You drown
Looking back at all you had
See it all, back in mind
Pushing thoughts from your mind
They all come back
To pull you right back down
'Til you drown
You fight so hard
To push it back
To push it back
You're screaming out
She pulls you down
She pulls you down
And you drown1Embed
