Great Escape LyricsAll I want is someone I can lean on
All I need is the simple life
Make believe the world has vanished around us
We could sneak away and not come back
We'll run far away and make a great escape
We can hide out, won't look back, slow it down for a while
We'll be alright, you and I far away from it all
All I want is a place I can belong
All I need is some peace of mind
We could sneak away and start all over
We could leave today and not come back
We'll run far away and make a great escapeEmbed
