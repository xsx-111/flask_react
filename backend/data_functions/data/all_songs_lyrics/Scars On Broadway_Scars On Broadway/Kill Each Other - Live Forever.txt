Kill Each Other / Live Forever Lyrics
I am the one that's calling inside of your brain
I am the one that makes you feel all the shame
Never mind my name

We don't want to believe that the world can still move on
We don't want to believe that the sun can still shine on

If we're gonna kill each other how we gonna live forever
If we're gonna live forever how we gonna kill each other

I am the one that's calling inside of your brain
I am the one that makes you feel all the shame
Never mind my name

We don't want to believe that the world can still move on
We don't want to believe that the sun can still shine on

If we're gonna kill each other how we gonna live forever
If we're gonna live forever how we gonna kill each other
If we're gonna kill each other how we gonna live forever
If we're gonna live forever how we gonna kill each other
We don't want to believe that the world can still move on
We don't want to believe that the sun can still shine on
We don't want to believe that the world can still move on
We don't want to believe that the sun can still shine on

I am the one that's calling inside of your brain2Embed
