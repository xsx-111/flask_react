World Long Gone Lyrics
Sometimes, well I said sometimes
I go crazy like I'm crazy
It takes patience, lots of patience
Then it's over, fucking over

I look (I look) at the sky (At the sky)
Faded (Faded)
I read (I read) the stars (The stars)

Maybe I don't know
How many people are starving
In this world long gone

Sometimes, well I said sometimes
I go crazy like I'm crazy
It takes patience, lots of patience
Then it's over, fucking over

I look (I look) at the sky (At the sky)
Faded (Faded)
I read (I read) the stars (The stars)
Maybe I don't know (maybe I don't know)
How many people are starving (how many people are starving)
Maybe I don't know (maybe I don't know)
How many people are starving (how many people are starving)
In this world long gone


I look (I look) at the sky (At the sky)
Faded (Faded)
I read (I read) the stars (The stars)

Maybe I don't know (maybe I don't know)
How many people are starving (how many people are starving)
Maybe I don't know (maybe I don't know)
How many people are starving (how many people are starving)
In this world
