Stoner Hate Lyrics
Super-cala-fra-jalistic-expi-ela-docious is a word to me, mama mia
Losing all my patience with all these fabrications, it's so easy to say, easy to say
When you sing: La, la, la, la, la, stoner hate has got your back
California's been invaded by a hippie psychopath
When you sing: La, la, la, la, la, stoner hate has got your back
California's been invaded by a hippie psychopath

Cause I'm rude (Rude), obnoxious (Obnoxious)
With an intent to kill
Rude (Rude), obnoxious (Obnoxious)
With an intent to kill

Super-cala-fra-jalistic-expi-ela-docious is a word to me, mama mia
Losing all my patience with all these fabrications, it's so easy to say, easy to say
When you sing: La, la, la, la, la, stoner hate has got your back
California's been invaded by a hippie psychopath
When you sing: La, la, la, la, la, stoner hate has got your back
California's been invaded by a hippie psychopath

Cause I'm rude (Rude), obnoxious (Obnoxious)
With an intent to kill
Rude (Rude), obnoxious (Obnoxious)
With an intent to ki-i-i-i-i-i-ill
Super-cala-fra-jalistic-expi-ela-docious is a word to me, mama mia
Losing all my patience with all these fabrications, it's so easy to say, easy to say
When you sing: La, la, la, la, la, stoner hate has got your back
California's been invaded by a hippie psychopath
When you sing: La, la, la, la, la, stoner hate has got your back
California's been invaded by a hippie psychopathEmbed
