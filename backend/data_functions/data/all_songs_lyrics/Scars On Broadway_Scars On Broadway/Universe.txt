Universe Lyrics
A line is drawn up in the sand
Is this the way to know a land?
You never seen the sky like this
You never wanna die like this
Comets falling for the Earth
Is this the end or a rebirth?
You never seen the sky like this
You never wanna die like this

Mother, are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?


Fire burning on the sun
Is killing almost everyone
You never seen the sky like this
You never wanna die like this
Dancing in the acid rain
That's falling on the streets of shame
You never seen the sky like this
You never wanna die like this
Mother, are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?
We are crying to you
Mother, are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?


Mother, are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying through the universe?
We are crying to you
Mother, are we flying through the universe?
Are we dying in the universe?


Comets falling for the Earth
Is this the end or a rebirth?
You never seen the sky like this
You never wanna die like thisEmbed
