Whoring Streets Lyrics
Is there anybody here
Who hears me crying? I'm dying
Is there anybody here?
When it's over, over, I'm just passing the time
Wondering how you people will ever survive

Whoring down your whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me
It's time to show all you people you will never survive
Whoring down your whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me

Is there anybody here
Who hears me crying? I'm dying
Is there anybody here?
When it's over, over, I'm just passing the time
Wondering how you people will ever survive

Whoring down you're whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me
It's time to show all you people you will never survive
Whoring down you're whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me
Killing you while you're killing me
Whoring down your whoring streets
Killing you while you're killing me

Is there anybody here
Who hears me crying? I'm dying2Embed
