Funny LyricsFunny, how you turned red
When I first said
Let's join the dead
Funny, I was driving by
Feeling really high
It made me cry
Funny, there were swastikas
On Santa Monica
Where they were scarred
Funny, that no one said
That you were dead
And painted red
Where do you go when you fall on your
Face it's a place that you never should
Know
Is there a reason why people should
Change and then change in the way that They go
If I was there with you for long, would
You be singing me this song
I'm holding on
Where do you go when you fall on your
Face it's a place that you never should
Know
Is there a reason why people should
Change and then change in the way that They go
If I was there with you for long, would
You be singing me this song
I'm holding on1Embed
