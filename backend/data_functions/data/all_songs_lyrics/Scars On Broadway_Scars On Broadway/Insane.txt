Insane Lyrics
So many ways to hide
I see the trouble deep inside

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again

Run, run baby, run
You'll see the things to overcome

Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again


Dream, dream your broken dream
You'll see the things I never see
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again
Let's go insane again
Bring back the pain again1Embed
