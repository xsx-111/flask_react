3005 LyricsLet's clap our hands, for the president
And Jesus Christ, and did I mention Charlie Manson
And everybody else who was nice?
Let's sing a song, for the people scared
Searching in the air, if you search real hard you'll see that I'll be there
Shooting up your world, watching all the resurrection junkies losing ground
Yeah I'll be there, shooting up your world, watching all the resurrection junkies losing ground
Let's do high five, for a genocide
And the Internet, and all the communication skills that are lost when we are dead
You'll never survive 3005
While you be sinking in the ocean I'll be in my spaceship still alive
Yeah I'll be there
Shooting up your world, watching all the resurrection junkies losing ground
Yeah I'll be there, shooting up your world, watching all the resurrection junkies losing ground
Let's clap our hands, for the president
And Mickey Mouse, and every other motherfucker that's burning up in this house2Embed
