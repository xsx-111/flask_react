Babylon Lyrics
Running to Babylon
Run all the way to Babylon
Meet you there in Babylon?
Meet you there in Babylon?
Running to Babylon
Run all the way to Babylon
Meet you there in Babylon?
Meet you there in Babylon?

Marooned again, you were the one that threw me into life
Marooned again, you were the one that loomed from a satellite
I like the way we slept on rooftops in the summertime
If we were all marooned again, I'd give my soul to save you

Marooned again, you were the one that put me in defense
Marooned again, you were the one that took my confidence
I like the way we slept on rooftops in the summertime
If we were all marooned again, I'd give my soul to save your life

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Running from Babylon
Run all the way to Babylon
Meet you there in Babylon?
Meet you there in Babylon, Babylon?1Embed
