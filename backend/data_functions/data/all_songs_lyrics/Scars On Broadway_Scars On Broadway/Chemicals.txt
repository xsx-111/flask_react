Chemicals Lyrics
I smacked your face, you fell in love when I said "fuck your mom"
I looked at you, said it's all over
I turned around and walked away and you just grabbed my arm
I looked at you, said I can't stay sober

Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals

Madness, feeling scared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world, let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock
Madness, no one cared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world, let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock

Oh maybe, baby, won't you rape me? Won't you fantasize
About the time when we were lovers?
I try to phone you, try to warn you, but no compromise
I grab your ass under the covers
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals

Madness, feeling scared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world, let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock
Madness, no one cared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world, let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock

Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals

Madness, feeling scared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world, let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock
Madness, no one cared
Looking around and nobody there
When I say fuck the world, let's get ready to rock
As I piss on your face while you suck on my cock
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicals
Come eat some chemicals with me, come eat some chemicalsEmbed
