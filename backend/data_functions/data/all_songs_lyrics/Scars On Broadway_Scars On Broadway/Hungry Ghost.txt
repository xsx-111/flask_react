Hungry Ghost Lyrics
Lying there inside of a tomb
Like lying there in your mother's womb
Written bare in blood that were red
We're following the book of the dead

Feed the hungry ghost
Feed the hungry ghost
All we are looking for is life
All we are searching for is life

Lying there inside of a tomb
Like lying there in your mother's womb
Written bare in blood that were red
We're following the book of the dead

Feed the hungry ghost
Feed the hungry ghost
All we are looking for is life
All we are searching for is life

Feed the hungry ghost
Feed the hungry ghost
All we are looking for is life
All we are searching for is life
All we are looking for is life
All we are searching for is life
All we are looking for is life
All we are searching for is life
All we are looking for is life
All we are searching for is lifeEmbed
