Tug of Peace Lyrics
It's a tug of war
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace
It's a tug of war
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace
What with one thing and another
It's a tug of war
No, no, no, no

It's a tug of war
No, no, your troubles cease
When you learn to play the pipes of peace
It's a tug of war
Learn to play the pipes of peace

Pushing, pushing
Pulling, pulling
Pushing, pullingEmbed
