So Bad Lyrics
There is a pain, inside my heart
You mean so much to me
Girl I love you, girl I love you so bad
And if you leave my pain will go
But that's no good to me
Girl I love you, yes I love you so bad

Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had

There was a pain but now you're here
And I don't fear a thing
Girl I love you, yes I love you so bad
And she said, boy I love you
Boy I love you so bad

Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you so bad

Well it feels so good, sometimes it feels so bad
This is worse than anything I've ever had
There was a pain but now you're near
And I don't fear a thing
Girl I love you, girl I love you so bad
She said, boy I love you
Boy I love you so bad

Girl, I love you
Girl, I love you1Embed
