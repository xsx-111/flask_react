Keep Under Cover Lyrics
Love, I'm going to pick you up in the morning
Love, I'm going to take you out on a journey
I don't know where I'm going to
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side

What good is butter if you haven't got bread?
What good is art when it hurts your head?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover 'til the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble 'til the prisoners are released

What good's a puzzle when you haven't a clue?
What good is me when I'm not with you?
Might as well stay in bed
Keep under cover till the clouds disappear
Keep out of trouble till the weather is bright and clear

Love, I'm going to pick you up
I'm going to take you out
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side
Without you by my side

What good is tennis when there isn't a ball?
What good's a curtain without a call?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover till the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble till the prisoners are released

Love, I'm going to pick you up (I'm going to pick you up)
I'm going to take you out (Yes, I'll be taking you out)
I don't know what I'm going to do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side (Without you by my side)
Without you by my side

Keep under cover
Keep under cover, yeah
Keep under cover, ooh
Keep under cover, ah ah ah ah
Keep under cover1Embed
