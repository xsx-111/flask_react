Men for Miles LyricsDon't freeze up
You gotta believe
Yeah you're a good apple
Now shake it, shake it, shake it, go
It's a shame that
We would have to go there
Patiently I'll wait while you run up
If your dirt is in a jar
That's where shit is gonna grow
If I'm being honest
Who would want to live here
Fourteen clocks and
Half as many rooms
Slip off, slip off, slip off, slip off
Get lost
Your dark side
You find it
There's nothing here, boys
The monument
You climb it
And what did you see? What did you see?
What did I see? What did I see?
When I set off I found that
There were men for miles
There were men for miles
And doesn't it just bring a tear to your eye, yeah
A tear to your eye, a tear to your eye 
When it comes in around
Am I gonna be ready?
For I know who we are
Could I give it a name?
Go!
Excuse me, is there a window?
Do you have a light?
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Get down tonight
Excuse me, would you say there's a chance
Of bringing this whole fucker down?
Get down
It came with
Instructions
It's neither here nor there
The monument
You climbed it
And what do you see? What did you see?
What did I see? What did I see?
Well certainly you could say that
There were men for miles
There were men for miles
And doesn't it just bring a tear to your eye, yeah
A tear to your eye, a tear to your eye 
A tear to your eye, a tear to your eye 
Get off the ground
Are you gonna be ready?
When you see who we are
When you’re looking in the eye
And you’re going to say
That’s mine punk, mine punk
When you’re looking in the sky
You think that the stars are jerking
The stars are jerking
My feet are tired
But I’m feeling ready, feeling ready
And where I go I'll say
That’s my decision, my decision
We are enflamed
For a star, it’s the same
And we are1Embed
