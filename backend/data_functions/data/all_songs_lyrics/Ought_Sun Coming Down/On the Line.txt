On the Line Lyrics
Featureless stranger, up on the ridge
Don't fear on your approach, there's shade all the way
Ave Maria, I am your dog
There on the horizon line, I'll be your man inside
There on the horizon line, I'll cut it all away
Could not get up, life and living, ipso facto not at all
Tie my heart up like a bull, ipso facto not at all
Something went wrong, didn’t know about Chicago
She sees only the hill, where the buffalo roam

Are my cities gonna fall away? 

Sweet pastures no matter, I'm a lover in the hay
Keep the golden sons coming, push the broken ones away
Well, Ave Maria, I am your dog
Ave Maria, I am your dog
And in the dead of night, I'll be your man inside
And in the dead of night, I'll cut it all away
Cut it all away
What do you think you’ve done here (x4)
Could not get up, life and living, ipso facto not at all
Tie my heart up like a bull, ipso facto not at all
Are my cities gonna fall away? 
I'm gonna call that, are you wasted
I'm gonna be calling it, a genocide

It’s a very astute observation
Don’t you say
It's a very astute observation
If I do say so myself
Put on your evening attire
We got a lot of forgetting to do
He's a good looking man, with a mild affectation
And if you treat him all right, he's gonna get you to the station
But if you treat him all wrong, you better perfect your line
With your sisters all gone, he's out to ruin your night
Oh what a glow, he wants you to know
It's all yours if you'll just, sign here on the line
Well, oh my, oh my I've never heard a lie
I've never hesitated, so I'll sign here on the line
If you did it all wrong, lost in this song
Guess you spoke wrong about religion once more
Oh halle-fucking-lujah, I'll take you
Give me what I want, and I assure you I will break you
Well halle-fucking-lujah, what I’m taking you to
You love, if I love I want it all
And it is, as an aside, it isEmbed
