Never Better Lyrics
Flame, shadow, many in life
The quiet eyes, deciding
Who's coming to ground
Dead-nighted, the chain
The left hand, the wave
The right calm, the ram
The reason for life

Sorry, sorry, we won’t be around
We are never better
Sorry, sorry, for bringing you down
We are never better, yes
What do I know?
The superstition, this is what it said

Style, steel, the nodding, the deal
Double noise, the cunning
The turn, the pain
Polish, frame
The sentence to life
The quiet eyes, reminding
Of keeping it down
Sorry, sorry, we won’t be around
We are never better
Sorry, sorry, for bringing you down
We are never better, yeah
What do I know?
Come and tell me
Superstition, this is what it said
 
I am driving a truck filled with everything
This is the high water mark of civilization
But if you ask me, I will say it is easy
It is easy, I am writing
I am writing with a cum alphabetEmbed
