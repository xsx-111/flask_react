Passionate Turn LyricsI imagined a perfect room
Never been so far away
Though my feet never touched the floor
I don't know what I came here for
But I have given up love
You have given up love
It doesn't mean that I held it right
Doesn't mean that I held it at
All comes back here when I
Hang my head and cry out
It's too much all for you
It's too much all alone
I don't know why do I become when I
Hang my head and cry out
Stoned life
I don't know why
Stoned life
I can't say why
Though I stayed out on the road
I'm the last in every town
Everything's in plenty here
Just can't seem to stay around
I am digging the silence
Don't need no house on the moon
I'm gonna take mine in the valley
Goodbye to everyone I know
Those who come back when I
Hang my head and cry out
It's too much all for you
It's too much all alone
I don't know why do I become when I
Hang my head and cry out
I am mobile
I am modern
I am fitting in the constancy
I am waking
In disgrace
I'm a distance from grace and I'm
Losing my face
Stoned life
Don't ask me why
Stoned life
Don't ask me why
Didn't take, it didn't go
I can't say, I don't know
Didn't take, it didn't go
I can't say, I don't know
Didn't take, it didn't go
I can't say, I don't know
I imagined a perfect room
Never been so far away
Though my feet never touched the floor
I wouldn't leave if you paid me to
It was a passionate turn
But now I'm waiting in greyness
It doesn't mean that I held it right
Doesn't mean that I held it at
All comes back here when I
Hang my head and cry out
It's too much all for you
It's too much all alone
I don't know why do I become when I
Hang my head and cry out
Didn't go
I can't say I don't know3Embed
