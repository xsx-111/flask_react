Beautiful Blue Sky Lyrics
With the light coming down over your shoulders
Saying, "What is that sensation?
What is that sensation?"
With the light coming down over your shoulders
Saying, "What is that sensation?
What does that sign say?"

War plane
Condo
New development
Time again
People coming up
They been together now
And time again
I feel alright
War plane
Condo
Oil freighter
New development
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
I feel alright, I feel alright
Well, how's the family? How's the family?
How's the family? How's the family?
How's your health been? How's your health been?
How's your health been? How's your health been?
Fancy seeing you here, fancy seeing you here
Fancy seeing you here, fancy seeing you here
Time and off again, time and off again
Time and off again, time and off again
Beautiful weather today, beautiful weather today
Beautiful weather today, beautiful weather today
How's the church? How's the job?
How's the church? How's the job?
How's the family? How's the family?
How's the family? How's the family?
Beautiful weather today, beautiful weather today
Beautiful weather today, beautiful weather today
Fancy seeing you here, fancy seeing you here
Fancy seeing you here, fancy seeing you here
Time and off again, time and off again
Time and off again, time and off again
It's all that we have, it's all that we have
Just that and the big, beautiful blue sky

I'm no longer afraid to die
Cause that is all that I have left
Yes! Yes!
And I'm no longer afraid to dance tonight
Cause that is all that I have left
Yes! Yes!
