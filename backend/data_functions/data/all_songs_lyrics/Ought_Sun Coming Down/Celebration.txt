Celebration LyricsSuit and tie
Fits okay
Don't take much
To make my day
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
Everyone's eating
Just more than enough
A bottle of something
A hand for your glove
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
In here it is
The perfect temperature
Gonna figure it out
And then bring it on in
There's a group here
You'll fit right in
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
Ten an hour
Open it up
Just enough
To fill my cup
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
Celebration
Yes!
Alright! I'll take it!
Okay! Let's do it!
Who said it came with a
Bottle of wine but
I didn't say much
I didn't mind, well
These situations can
Be such a drag but
Don't take 'em from me
I wanna get high
I come to make contact with
All of your friends
But they've been waiting for you
They're here to the end
You said the end came with
What ever you like but
I didn't say much
I didn't mind, well
Turn around
Can of soup
Letâ€™s take a look
Boot to suit
