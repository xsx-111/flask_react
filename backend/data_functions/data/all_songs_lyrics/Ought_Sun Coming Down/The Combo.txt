The Combo Lyrics
Time without time, and I'll see that I'm right, I got 

Nothing takes, nothing holds
Nothing holds, nothing takes 
Nothing holds over your line

Go without gold, and I'll wait till I'm old,  I said 

Nothing takes, nothing holds
Nothing holds, nothing takes 
Nothing holds over your line

Entire families are waiting in line
It's a little bit strange, yeah, a little bit strange
I'm looking for something to cover my scars
It's a little bit strange, yeah, a little bit strange
Yeah, a lot of bit strange
 
Well that's all right
Better get your things in line
Step on the cross and must say go
This deep shit
Didn't get enough
Cars decorated, many venerated
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Didn't get enough
Jubilation darlin' 
Concentration honey
The Combination 
You gotta get it with itEmbed
