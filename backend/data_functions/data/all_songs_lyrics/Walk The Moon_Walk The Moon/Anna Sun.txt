Anna Sun Lyrics
Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
We tore up the walls, we slept on couches
We lifted this house, we lifted this house
Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene

Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun

What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart

Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene
Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun

What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart

Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling around the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all a wash
Now it's all a wash
(Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges)
Live my life without
(My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes)
Coming up for air
(We tore up the walls, we slept on couches)
Now it's all a wash
(We lifted this house, we lifted this house)
I want everyone
(Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south)
Racing down the hill
(Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth)
I am faster than you
(I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine)
Wait for summertime
(We rattle this town, we rattle this scene)
Wait for summertime
Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun
Sun

What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town

This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart
(We tore up the walls, we slept on couches)
This house is falling apart
(We lifted this house, we lifted this house)
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart27Embed
