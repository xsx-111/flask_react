Lisa Baby Lyrics
When my baby is a mess
My baby is a dancing queen
When my baby wears a dress
It's like she's not even a human being

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else has you down
But me

I behold the beauty
But the beauty got a hold on me
With all the other boys in the runnin'
Never thought this could happen at 20

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else has you down

When my baby is a mess
My baby is a dancing queen
When my baby wears a dress
It's like she's not even a human being
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else has you down
Has you down
Oh, has you down
But me

Singin' a-ooooooh
Singin' a-ooooooh
Singin' a-ooooooh1Embed
