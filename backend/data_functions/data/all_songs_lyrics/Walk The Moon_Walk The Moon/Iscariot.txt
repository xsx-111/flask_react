Iscariot Lyrics
Until now, I knew this of myself
That if you had thrown yourself down
Into the lion's den
My brother, I'd follow you in

Perhaps I lack some foresight (Should have known)
But, brother, you were so right
Sure as the setting sun
You can't trust just anyone

That's what you want
But it's not what you're asking for
I said, that's what you're asking
But you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said, that's what you had
But you don't have it anymore
You had it coming

I never imagined you dead (I never)
But tell me, are you even aware?
That all that we did, you undo
Iscariot, you fool
Well, that's what you want
But it's not what you're asking for
I said, that's what you're asking
But you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said, that's what you had
But you don't have it anymore
You had it coming
Ooh, that's what you want
But it's not what you're asking for
I said, that's what you're asking
But you're gonna get more than you bargained for
I said, that's what you had
But you don't have it anymore
You had it coming

You know you had it coming, my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming, my brother, my brother
Had it coming, my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming, my brother, my brother
Had it coming, my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming, my brother, my brother
Had it coming, my friend, my friend
You had it coming
Oh, my brother
Had it coming, my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming, my brother, my brother
Had it coming, my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming, my brother, brother, my brother
Had it coming, my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming, my brother, my brother
Had it coming, my friend, my friend
You had it coming
