Jenny Lyrics
You've got curves like the ocean
Gonna take it in slow motion
Got emotions that'll make it last
You've got freckles on your shoulder
Ammunition like a soldier
And visions, ambitions to be the best

Oh and Jenny, why don't we-
Jenny, why don't we be getting together?
I said, Jenny, shouldn't we-
Jenny, shouldn't we be getting together?

Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
I'm taking my time, taking my time
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, slow, slow
Oh and make it last

Jenny, got your number
And I got you for the summer
It's a bummer that things go so fast
It's been a ride like days of thunder
But these days have been runnin'
Like sand through the hourglass
And I've been dreaming that we could-
Dreaming that we could be sticking together
And I got evidence
'Cause every time we turn the corner
It's up against the wall as the rest of the world fades out
As the rest of the world fades out

Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
I'm taking my time, taking my time
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, slow, slow
Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
But I'm taking my time, taking my time
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, slow, slow

But I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
I said I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
I said I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
I said I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
Yeah, I said I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
I said I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
I said I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
Yeah, I said I'm not gonna take it from you
I'll let you give it to me
Let you give it to me
Let you give it to me
Let you give it to me
Let you give it to me

J-J-J-Jenny's got a body just like an hourglass
I'm taking my time (taking my time)
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, slow, slow

Jenny's got a body, yeah
Jenny's got a body
I wanna be the sand inside that hourglass
Take it slow, slow, slow
Gonna make it last6Embed
