Shiver Shiver Lyrics
You grip your hands around my throat (hands around my throat)
And you strip the buttons off my coat (buttons off my coat)
And I choose the methods I do best (methods I do best)
And the thump, thump, the thumping in your chest

When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver (shiver)

You leave these marks upon my neck (marks upon my neck)
And it's still there, I know but I still check (but I still check)
And the thump, thump, the thumping in my chest (thumping in my chest)
As I lose the feeling in my fingertips

When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver (shiver)

Owley, you're dear to me
Please check your clothing at the door
And who you're suppose to be
You always leave me wanting more
Owley, you're dear to me
Shall we get intimate again?
Owley, you're dear to me
Shall we get intimate again?
Shall we get intimate again?
Shall we get intimate again?
I think so, I think so
Shall we get intimate again?
Owley, you're dear to me (me, me)
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver (shiver)
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver
When you are close to me I shiver (shiver)4Embed
