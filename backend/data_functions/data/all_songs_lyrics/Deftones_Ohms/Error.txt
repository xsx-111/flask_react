Error Lyrics
Tell me something
Have we escaped?
Are we just lost?
The mirrors taunting us against the walls

We are running across the grid
Chasing honey and closing in

We're bound together
In neon tape
I taste in your mouth
We hang upside down

We are gliding above the planes
Dripping honey that prances through our veins

Beyond the gates
Outside the grid
We follow in your grace
Let's find a way through
Shiny candy
Glowing fruits
Drop from the trees
I watch the sеrpents writhe benеath

We are floating above the grid
Dripping honey that's rushing through our veins

Beyond the gates
Outside the grid
We follow in your grace
But someday
The clouds will break
And we'll all drift through

In lions' trance
We'll create some way through

Frozen in time
Sinking underground
I've thrown out fear
I've shouted these hymns
I kept drowning
Kept nothing
I kept trying
Kept floating1Embed
