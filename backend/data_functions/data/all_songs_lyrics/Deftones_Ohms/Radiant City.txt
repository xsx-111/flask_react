Radiant City Lyrics
There's something inside this
Confusion we face
We marvel in silence
As time ticks away

Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it's so close
Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it's close

Sit lonely inside these
Delusions we face

Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it's so close
Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it's close
No one alive has taken me here
Nothing I've tried will replace your tricks
If ever I choose to break in again
Promise me now you'll follow me in, into

A moment of conscience
Then shock to the head

Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it is so close
Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it's close

We marvel in silence
Let time tick away

Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it's so close
Where's the ledge?
I can't touch it
But I feel it's close
No one alive has taken me here
Nothing I tried replaced your tricks
Whenever I choose to break in again
Promise me now you will follow me in
'Cause nobody else cuts me the same
You've pulled me into a permanent trance
If ever you choose to break in again
I promise you now, I'll follow you in
Promise you now, I'll follow you in1Embed
