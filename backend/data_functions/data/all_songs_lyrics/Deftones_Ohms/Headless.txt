Headless Lyrics
I think it's obvious we are a mess
We cut against the grain
It's contagious how we live
If you're curious of the valiance I can show you, wait

'Cause I forget all of this is obvious

We're entirely insane, they claim
They wanna climb into our brain waves

I know you're wondering
How the two of us, we adapt these traits
I can teach you how we play
And you're curious how the brilliance controls you, wait

'Cause I forget all of this is obvious

We're entirely insane, they claim
They'd like to violate our brain waves
You seek desire
(Stop, think, show what you fear)
Our desire
(Stop, think, dying out there)
But

Ooh, your attempt is useless
Ooh, your attempt is useless

Sway from the top off the ledge
Swim in a bottomless lake, it's true

We are entirely insane, we'd claim
You'd like to dive into our brain waves

You seek desire
(Stop, think, show what you fear)
Our desire
(Got made, flying out there)
Real desire
(Stop, think, shows we're losing)
True desire
(Stop, think I'm nowhere)
Ooh, your attempt is useless
Ooh, your attempt is useless2Embed
