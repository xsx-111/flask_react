Ceremony Lyrics
How can't you see this is the end?
Let's face the truth, it's obvious
A different morning, the same charade
Tell me, what's left?

It's an illusion
It's all an illusion

Prep the surface, bound my limbs
Place the chair beneath the rail
On the outside, just skin and bones
Show me, what's left?

It's an illusion
It's all an illusion

So I'm leaving you tonight
It's not fun here anymore
I'll be joining the parade
Of the ghosts who came before
Before leaving you complete, no surprise
With one kiss, one caress, ooh
Ooh, the world we shared
Ooh, it was never there, ooh

I'm leaving you tonight
It's not fun here anymore
I'm joining the parade
Of the ghosts before
Leaving you complete for all time
With one kiss, one caress, ooh2Embed
