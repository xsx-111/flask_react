The Spell of Mathematics Lyrics
I drink the poison right from your hands
A sacred vow, it engulfs me
We slip and we slide and in time, we create
A feeling
Of warmth inside of you

Holy and strict
Six times a day
We will exchange
Our violent wings
But the beauty is when
You touch me

I believe your love
Has placed its spell on me
And I believe your love
Is the only thing needed to survive
I believe your love
Creates this space whеre we can breathе
But I believe your love
Beholds this sacred key to life

The snakes come pouring out of your heart
And you know that I can't deny them
So I sink inside where we writhe and create
That feeling that pangs my time with you
We sway in the wind
Inside a haze
Where you speak your language
What am I to say?
I'll just wait for your limbs
To touch me

I believe your love
Has placed its spell on me
And I believe your love
Is the only thing needed to survive
I believe your love
Creates this space where we can breathe
I believe your love
Beholds this sacred key to lifeEmbed
