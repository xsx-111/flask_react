This Link Is Dead Lyrics
Thanks, you want action?
Yeah, I'm aware which form you think I should try
That shit means nothin'
You see, I'm done
Right now I think it's time that you know
Pay attention
Watch me close
As I decide which fucking way I move

I'm filled up with true hatred

No, that don't work
You would swear you're why I am here
That don't mean nothing
There's nothing wrong
I can choose how this will unfold
And I feel like fire, but my heart is cold
Open your eyes, you'll see this shit's no fun

'Cause I'm filled up with true hatred
And I relate to no one
It's a useless game
I'm slowly crashing down
You snap your fingers and you think I'll respond
Fuck, I will never need your guide
Someday, yeah, you can show me, right?
That shit means nothing
You see, I'm done
Take your ideas and fucking have some fun

You're on your own
You're on your own
You should, you should

Look deep inside
You might see I'm just fine
Look close, close inside
Don't miss this moment, you may never get back
I'll show you something, something prized
Well, you were there, you think you know what it's like?
I have no patience now for expectation, wow
Fuck this shit, leave me alone

You're on your own
You're on your own
I'm sure, I'm sure
