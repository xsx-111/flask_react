Genesis Lyrics
I reject
Both sides of what I'm being told
I've seen right through
Now I watch how wild it gets
I finally achieve
Balance, balance, balance, balance
Approaching a delayed
Rebirth, rebirth, rebirth, rebirth
I'm positive
There's no sense to what I'm being sold
Yet here I go
I watch how wild we get
Oh, can you taste your life?
Balanced, balanced, balanced, balanced
How will you spend your time?
Reborn, reborn, reborn, reborn

Climbing out of the ashes
Turning time inside out
We're miles beyond the sound

We'll start again
Taste a lifestyle that never gets old
Yet here we go
Just watch how wild it gets
I finally achieve
Balance, balance, balance, balance
Approaching a delayed
Rebirth, rebirth, rebirth, rebirth
Climbing out of the ashes
We're turning time inside out
We're floating off in the ether
We're miles beyond the sound

We're everywhere
No need to return
I'll show you the way
We're everywhere
No need to return
I can show you where
No need to return
I can show you

Climbing out of the ashes
We're turning time inside out
Floating off in the ether
We're miles beyond the sound

Oh, can you taste your life?
Balanced
How will you spend your time?
