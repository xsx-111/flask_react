Pompeji Lyrics
Deep in the bottomless depths of the ocean
Empty bodies, we sink
Open your eyes, you smile and release me
We slip down beneath and

Jesus Christ, you watch us fail
We raise our glasses and drink in hell

Locked in the core of the tower, I'm patient
In no hurry to leave
Life has been lonely, it might be forever
Making hard to believe in

Jesus Christ, we hold you to blame
You gave your life, but we died in vain

And ooh, we drink from the fountain of intent
And ooh, we choke on the water, then repent

In the street, violent behavior
In chaos, where it's warm
Black omens call, our cage is electric
So we signal, we wait for
Jesus Christ, God raised you as
We raised our glasses and drank in hell

Ooh, we sip from the fountain of intent
And ooh, we choke on the water, then repent
Ooh, we drink from the fountain of intent
Ooh, we choke on the water, then repent1Embed
