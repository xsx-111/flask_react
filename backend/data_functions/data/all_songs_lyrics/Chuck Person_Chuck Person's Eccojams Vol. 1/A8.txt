A8 LyricsBaby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Baby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
Baby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
When I make you mine
When I make you mine
When I make you mine
When I make you mine
When I make you mine
When I make you
Baby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
Baby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
Baby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
Baby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
Baby, baby when I make you mine
I’ll be fine, ‘cause I miss your body
When I make you mine, I’ll be fine
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
Baby, baby when I make
Baby, baby when I make
Baby, baby when I make
Baby, baby when I make
