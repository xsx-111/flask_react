B1 LyricsIt's not the letters, that you just don't
That you just, that you just
It's not the letter, that you just don't
It's not the letters, that you just do-
It's not the letters, that you just do-
That you just do-, that you just do-
It's not the letters, that you just don't
That you just don't, that you just don't
It's not the letters, that you just do-
That you just do-, that you just do-
It's not the letters, that you just do-
That you just do-, that you just do-
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easy
Don't give up now, we're proud of who you are
Don't give up, you know it's never been easyEmbed
