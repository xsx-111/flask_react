B3 LyricsAnother year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy, but you-

There was no way, to compromise
There was no way, to compromise
