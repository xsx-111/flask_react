Worry B Gone Lyrics
Oh, gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone
I'm plannin' on feelin' much better before too long
I got a world of trouble I need to forget
I'm on my way, but I ain't there yet
So gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone

Well, everywhere I look trouble is all I see
Can't listen to the radio and I hate TV
There's trouble with the air, trouble with the water
People ain't treatin' one another like they oughta

So gimmе just one more puff of that worry be gonе

Well, I don't wanna hear no preacher preachin'
No more politician bitchin'
All them songs 'bout love gone wrong
Got me wonderin' where my baby's gone
Well, I can't suffer fools wastin' my time
Don't gimme no more advice that rhymes

Hey-hey-hey, gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone

Don't gimme no shit, just gimme a hit
Hey, I'm smokin' all day and I can't get lit
Don't gimme no guff, just gimme a puff
'Cause you know how I love that stuff

Oh, gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone
Yeah, gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone
Oh, gimme just one more puff of that worry be goneEmbed
