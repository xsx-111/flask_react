Whiskey Sunrise Lyrics
There's a tear in the mud on the banks of the river
And the sound of a lover's goodbye
And a pain in my heart 'cause I could not forgive her
That's as deep as the river is wide
I'm lost and I'm lonesome when I look in the mirror
I don't like the man that I see
And the more that I look, the more it gets clearer
Pride made a fool out of me

So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
When I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
To a whiskey sunrise

The cold wind blows and the leaves start to scatter
And the rain will be comin' on soon
And everything's wrong and nothin' don't matter
And a black cloud is crossin' the moon

So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
And I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
To a whiskey sunrise2Embed
