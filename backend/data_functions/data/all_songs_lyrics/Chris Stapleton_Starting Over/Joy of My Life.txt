Joy of My Life Lyrics
I tiptoed in the room
I know you got to have your rest
She says, "Come lay beside me
I been waitin' since you left"

She's sweet to me
Must be the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?

The first time that I saw you
Mmm, you took my breath away
I might not get to Heaven
But I walked with the angels that day

She takes me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?

Some may have their riches
Some may have their worldly things
As long as I have you
I'll treasure each and every day
Just take me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?
Did I tell you, baby
You are the joy of my life?Embed
