Arkansas Lyrics
Took a Nine Eleven 'bout a hundred and seven down a back road
Where the white river runs and the southern sun makes the kudzu grow
And what I found in the Ozark mountains, I ain't ever seen
It sure does feel like you're sittin' on top of the world to me

Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas


Well, we burned through the one light towns like a scaldеd dog
When we lit out of Fayettеville, they were callin' the hogs
We made a pit stop in Little Rock for some barbecue
And when we hit West Memphis there were blue lights in our rear view

Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas1Embed
