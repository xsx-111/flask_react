Watch You Burn Lyrics
Only a coward would pick up a gun
And shoot up a crowd tryna have fun
Now the Vegas lights, they won't lose their glow
And the band will play and go on with the show

And you're gonna get your turn
Yes, you're gonna get your turn
Son, you're gonna get your turn
Devil gonna watch you burn

I wasn't there, I didn't see
But I had friends in your company
If I could snap my fingers, if I could flip a switch
I'd make that last bullet first, you son of a bitch

You're gonna get your turn
Yes, you're gonna get your turn
Oh, you're gonna get your turn
Devil gonna watch you burn

To the evil ones, you know who you are
I beg of you, don't you go too far
Just know this, let it give you pause
Before you mail out your bombs or pull a trigger in a synagogue
You'rе gonna get your turn (You're gonna get your turn)
Oh, you'rе gonna get your turn (You're gonna get your turn)
Yes, you're gonna get your turn
Devil gonna watch you burn1Embed
