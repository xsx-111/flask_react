Cold Lyrics
Girl, the way you broke my heart
It shattered like a rock through a window
I thought we had it so good
Never really saw this comin'

Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl, you know you left this hole
Right here in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to be so cold?

What am I supposed to say
If anybody asks me about you?
I guess I'll tell 'em I'm without you
How am I supposed to live
When I built my life around you?
Try to put yourself in my shoes

Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl, you know you left this hole
Right hеre in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to bе so cold?
I can only feel my love hangin' on
I don't feel like it's over
I'm still on fire
Why you gotta be so...


Oh, why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to go and cut me like a knife
And put our love on ice?
Oh, girl, you know you left this hole
Right here in the middle of my soul
Oh-oh, oh, why you got to be so cold?

Why you got to be so cold?
Why you got to be so cold?
You got to be so cold1Embed
