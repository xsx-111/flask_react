Devil Always Made Me Think Twice Lyrics
I take a little smoke in the evenin'
I take a little whiskey on ice
I never get behind on killin' my mind
It's just the kind of things I like
Just the kind of things I like

The minute that I saw you walkin' over
I figured I was diggin' my grave
Well, you had the shovel, I knew you were trouble
But you're just the kind of trouble I crave
Just the kind of trouble I crave

And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think

Someday I'm goin' six feet under
And when I'm standin' at the gate
They'll tally up my sins, they won't let me in
Sayin' "Son, you're just a little too late"
"Son, you're just a little too late"
My mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me
Devil always made me
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me
Devil always made me
Devil always made me think twice1Embed
