Old Friends Lyrics
It's like when you're makin' conversation
And you're tryin' not to scream
And you're tryin' not to tell 'em
You don't care what they mean
And you're really feelin' fragile
And you really can't get home
And you really feel abandoned
But you wanna be alone

Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em
You know it's old friends, after all

And when the house is empty
And the lights begin to fade
And there's nothin' to protect you
Except thе window shade
And it's hard to put your finger
On the thing that scarеs you most
And you can't tell the difference
Between an angel and a ghost
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em
You know it's old friends, after all
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em
You know it's old friends, after allEmbed
