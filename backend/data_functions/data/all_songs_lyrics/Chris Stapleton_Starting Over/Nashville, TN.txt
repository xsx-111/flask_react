Nashville, TN Lyrics
I met you when I had a dream
Not so long ago, it seems
We closed down a million bars
Yeah, you and me, we've come so far
You showed me how to write a song
We wrote some right, we wrote some wrong
I was down and out, you let me in
At times you were my only friend

So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time, I wish you well
You build me up, you set me free
You tore down my memories
So you be you and I'll be me
So long, Nashville, Tennessee

Now you won't miss me when I'm gone
You're custom made for movin' on
And time to time I'll pass you by
Face that I don't recognize
And who knows? Maybe years from now
You'll be the one I think about
But I just can't imagine that
'Cause I'm not one for lookin' back
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time, I wish you well
You build me up, you set me free
You tore down my memories
So you be you and I'll be me
So long, Nashville, Tennessee

So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time, I wish you well
You build me up, you set me free
You tore down my memories
You're not who you used to be
So long Nashville, TennesseeEmbed
