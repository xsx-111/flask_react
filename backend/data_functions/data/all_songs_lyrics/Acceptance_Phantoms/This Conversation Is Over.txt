This Conversation Is Over Lyrics
I never thought I'd be the one to fool you
If I told you now, it would be over (it's over)
To steal all we had
Be a part of all I've been without
All I've been without

We stop waiting or I start going home
You don't have to follow
You don't have to follow
Take this call as a hint we're moving on
You don't have to follow
You don't have to follow

I never got a single thing that I wanted
I never got a single thing that I wanted
I never spoke a single word that you told me
I never spoke a single word that you told me
You told me

We stop waiting or I start going home
You don't have to follow
You don't have to follow
Take this call as a hint we're moving on
You don't have to follow
You don't have to follow
This conversation
Information that you wanted me to share
But I didn't want to be there
So I'll grant you one wish that won't come true

We stop waiting (we stop waiting, take this call)
You don't have to follow
You don't have to follow
We're leaving you, we're leaving (we stop waiting)
You don't have to follow
You don't have to follow
We stop waiting or I start going home
You don't have to follow
You don't have to follow
Take this call as a hint we're moving on
You don't have to follow
You don't have to followEmbed
