Different Lyrics
Tell myself on the ride home
Getting tired, hating all I've known
Holding on like it's all I have
Count me out when it's clear
That I find it hard to say
And you find it hard to care

I wanted to see something that's different
Something you said would change in me
Wanted to be anything different
Everything you would change in me

Got this way, up front but never true
God, I'm wrong, it's just the way I am
Crashing down any chance you'll hear
Caving in any chance
That you could see inside of me
And I, I'll know what to say
It's fine, this isn't Hollywood
So fine, getting in your way

I wanted to see something that's different
Something you said would change in me
Wanted to be anything different
Everything you would change in me
I'm taking a chance
This could be different
This could be all I'm waiting for
Taking a chance
This could be different
This could be all I'm waiting for

I wanted to see something that's different
Something you said would change in me
Wanted to be anything different
Everything you would change in me

Something that's different
Something that's differentEmbed
