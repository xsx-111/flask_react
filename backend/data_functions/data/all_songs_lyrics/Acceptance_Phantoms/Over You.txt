Over You Lyrics
Getting over you, oh
Getting over you, oh

Hopeless: a single word that you would not expect from me, from me
I take it like it's coming from an enemy
The scene was meant to be
I see it coming, after all
The worst of me would fall
Make this now or never

See it on my face, I'm getting over you (oh)
I'm getting over you (oh)
The place it takes me now
Well, is it far enough?
I'm getting over you (oh)
(Make this now or never)

Countless: the moments I would kill to keep this day away, away
I see it coming, after all
The worst of me would fall
I take it like it's coming from my greatest enemy
Make this now or never
See it on my face, I'm getting over you (oh)
I'm getting over you (oh)
The place it takes me now
Well, is it far enough?
I'm getting over you (oh)
(Make this now or never)

Hopeless
I don't have to take this
Countless
See it on my face

Getting over you, oh
Getting over you, oh
See it on my face, I'm getting over you (oh)
I'm getting over you (oh)
The place it takes me now
Well, is it far enough?
I'm getting over you (oh)
(Make this now or never)

Hopeless
I don't have to take this
Make this now or never
Countless
See it on my face
I'm getting over you (oh)Embed
