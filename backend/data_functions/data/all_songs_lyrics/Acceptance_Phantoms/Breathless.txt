Breathless Lyrics
Watch her go, watch her go, watch her go
She'll have to cut it away to save her life
And she knows
See, she knows
It's like a fatal disease
You'll hear her cry, oh
Take this, make it something beautiful again
Make this, make this happen 'cause you're beautiful to them
(To them, to them)

Got you anyway
I'm gonna say that I've been taken over
Go, let's go again
You tell me when and I'll be taking over

And you know that I'll never (I will do it again)
Do it again, again (I'll take it away from you, away from you)
And I'll tell you I love you (I'll take it again)
(Just give me the chance, I'll take it again)
(I'll take it away from you, away from you)
Say it again, again
(To them, to them)
Got you anyway
I'm gonna say that I've been taken over
Go, let's go again
You tell me when and I'll be taking over

And time stands still
Inside a picture
(I think of every word you say)
And time moves on to the next one
(I think of every word you said)
With every word you said
With every word you said

Got you anyway
I'm gonna say that I've been taken over
Go, let's go again
You tell me when and I'll be taking over
Got you anyway
I'll be taking over
Go, let's go again
You tell me when and I'll be taking overEmbed
