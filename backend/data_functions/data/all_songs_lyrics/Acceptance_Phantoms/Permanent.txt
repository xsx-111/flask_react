Permanent Lyrics
Sometime ago
I keep losing track, over again
All these promises won't turn golden until you touch them

(It's permanent)
Nothing is permanent
(It's permanent)
We'll be watching your back
(Following)
Indecision's lasting for years
(Touching there)
Indecision's lasting for years

Sometime ago
Memories in my head are starting again
Speaking fast, still moving slow
Running through the country
Maybe they will find me

(It's permanent)
Nothing is permanent
(It's permanent)
We'll be watching your back
We'll be watching your back
(Following)
Indecision's lasting for years
(Touching there)
Indecision's lasting for years
Like a river in Arizona
Dried up before you were born
It's starting up again
It's starting up again
It's starting up again (we'll be watching your back)
It's starting up again
It's starting up again
(We'll be watching your back)

(It's permanent)
Nothing is permanent
(It's permanent)
We'll be watching your back
(It's permanent)
Nothing is permanent
(It's permanent)
Time is pushing us back
(Following)
Permanent, permanent, permanent1Embed
