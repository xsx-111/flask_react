Take Cover Lyrics
She's a liar
It comes to this
All we had 'til now is gone
And I'm the other piece to this

Every time I feel this inside
I don't wanna be the one who...

Caught you
So take cover
(Never saw it comin', so you put me on again)
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting old

She starts to feel it on her own
She makes the city seem like home
All you had from me is gone
And I give and I give
But you hope in return
Never thought I'd be the one to burn

Every time I feel this inside
I don't wanna be the one to
I don't wanna be the one who...
Caught you
So take cover
(Never saw it comin', so you put me on again)
Had you and no other
The game, the lie is getting oldEmbed
