Looking for a Love Lyrics
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' lookin' for a love

I'm lookin' for a love oh
I'm lookin' for a love oh
Lookin' here and there
Searching everywhere
I'm lookin' I'm lookin'
I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for
Lookin' for a love
To call my own


Someone to get up in the mornin'
And rub my head
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own,)
Someone to fix my breakfast
And bring it to my bed
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own.)
Someone to do a little housework
And back with me again
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own,)
With lots of love and kisses
And people until then
(I'm lookin' for a love to call my own.)



I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
Lookin' for a love
Lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love
I'm lookin' for a love oh
I'm lookin' for a love ohEmbed
