Heaven Lyrics
Bar illuminations shiver
Shadows on the street
The Cypriot sailors
Find the world back at their feet

Endless days of tobacco nights by the radio
I wonder if they'll ever go to heaven
Heaven

The beer mats are wading
In a table of froth
The bar girl is serving
With a checked drying cloth

She'll bend over backwards
Even though she's knackered
I wonder if there'll have her up in heaven
Heaven

Like the sailors I walk home, it's 6:00 a.m
Heaven's 'round the corner in a comfortable bed
And I love her
The officers and seamen
Elbow places at the bar
Words that tempt the goddess
Don't leave beats upon the heart

But she'll service his pleasure
And never know the treasure
That his wife keeps forever up in heaven
Heaven

The first light of the morning
Proves too much for the streets
No one sees each other
Just their presence there to meet

Your chin takes to stubble
At the sight of a funnel
And the gangplank is no trouble up to heaven
Heaven

Like the sailors I walk home, it's 6:00 a.m
Heaven's 'round the corner in a comfortable bed
And I love herEmbed
