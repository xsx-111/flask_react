Take Your Hand Lyrics
Hey, I feel like I just blow on up
Anytime I could just lose control, caught up
In your loving, everytime I feel your touch
Second thoughts, more doubts started building up

You're everything I wanted
Before I knew just what I wanted
And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside
And you're the only one I want, I can't deny

Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I go?

Hey, I feel like I just blow on up
Every time I feel your love, I get so caught up
It's your kissing, your touch, it's just everything
But I'm feeling like I wanna just run away
I'm here to tell you what I want
But you're everything I want
And hey, hey, it's killing me on the inside
'Cause you're all I ever wanted, so I can't deny

Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I go?

Somebody tell me (Oh)
Is it that I'm so wrong? I can't say (say)
Or is it my life? So young, careless ways
And in your eyes, so much love you wanna give
But the more I hold you in my arms
The pressure starts to build (Build)
Build it up (Build, build, build)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let go?Embed
