Follow Me Lyrics
What we gon' do now? (Oh Lord, try some if you like it)
Is slow it down on the floor (you know you like that)
(Try some if you like that)
Oh Lord, uh oh
Uh oh, yeah, peep game
Come on

When you look from outside
All you see is videos and shows (yeah)
But there's more to my life than people could ever know (uh huh)
Sometimes I gotta smile (smile) when I don't feel like smiling
Sit back and ride (ride) when I feel like driving
Nobody understands but you, girl (fo' sho')
I can always be myself with you, girl
That's why I'm singing

Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now (right now)
Since you've been in my life, when I'm away from you, I hurry home (aww yeah, I hurry home)
You live in my mind, so I never feel like I'm alone, yeah (alone)
Sometimes I gotta go (go) where I don't feel like going
And when it gets too fast (fast) and I feel like slowing down (slowing down)
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you

Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
(Real girls stay down, that's fo' sure)
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (come now)
Come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me (girl come follow me now)
Come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me now (oooh), right now (right now)
You've been there for me and I'll (so I'll)
I'll be there for you girl

Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way (oh, shorty)
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
(What we gon' do now)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
(Is slow it down on the floor)
Come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me now, right now
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me...1Embed
