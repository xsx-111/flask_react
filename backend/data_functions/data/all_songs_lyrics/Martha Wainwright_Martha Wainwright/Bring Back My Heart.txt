Bring Back My Heart LyricsBring back my heart
You can't have it
It is mine
You can't have it
I know I said
For you to take it
But you don't use it
And I got none in return
So find it amongst
All the other broken ones
It's probably somewhere near the top
When we last hooked up
I have no more blood
Running through my veins
You left
There is only pain
And I know you tried
To cherish my love
But let's admit
You're not interestedEmbed
