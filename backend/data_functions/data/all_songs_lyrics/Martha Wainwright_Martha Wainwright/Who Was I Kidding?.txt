Who Was I Kidding? LyricsLeft the pain before the dawn
She never thought it would or could be easy
Been inclined to carry on
Hold my hard head
And watch you walk out on me
See the tears one by one
They fall down my hard head
Forevermore
Fall around into the ground
Deep down
Far as you can
Go out tonight and meet the dawn again
It'd be nice to see an old friend
Learn to accept the things I am
I never liked myself before
Now even less
When it rains it pours
Down my hard head forever more
Fall down into the ground
Deep down
Far as you can
Who was I kidding?
Who was I kidding?
Oh, your record label hasn't come through yet
You've gained some weight
And all you can think is
When the Romeo's gonna show
Oh, and I know, babe
You're the best thing yet
But take it from me
I would if I could
Fuck it all
Your mother loves you
Your daddy needs you
Your brother feeds you
Far as you can
Who was I kidding?Embed
