When the Day Is Short LyricsWhen the day is short
And the nights are long
It's a different world
Where the rules are wrong
And I, I will go home with who
Whoever is sure
Are you sure?
And I don't care if you
If you love me tomorrow just
Love me tonight and I
I will be all right
I'll be all right
I'll be all right
Until tomorrow night
And it's oh so long
Meet your, meet your friends at the bar
And is that who those people are?
They, they seem so very...oh, far
They seem so far
Is that who they really are?
And on the jukebox is your
Is your only song and I
I have never remembered the words
Now I've waited, waited too long
I've waited too long
Our love is gone
No more sober words of love
No more walks in the park side
No more sweet and shy touches, yeah
We're just lovers in the dark
Feel nothing, leave no mark
But it was fun when we saw sparks
When the day is short
And the nights are long
It's a different world
Where the rules are wrong
I'll be all right
I'll be all rightEmbed
