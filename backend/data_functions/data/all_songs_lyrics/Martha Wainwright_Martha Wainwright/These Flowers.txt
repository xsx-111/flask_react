These Flowers LyricsThese flowers are coming up wild
They're coming up, they're coming up
They're coming up wild
These flowers are coming up wild
They're coming up, they're coming up
They're coming up wild
They are like those children
Go off to school & don't come back
And I am like their mother
Waiting around about to crack
Crack
Crack
I want them back
Crack
Crack
I want them back
Back
Back
Back
You are like a flower
You rise & rise to the sun
You do not look back at where you came from
I wanna be like that
That
That
That
And the boys they run faster
And they throw harder
And they get stronger
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
I wanna be like that
That
That
That
And the girls they are pretty
And they get silly
When they get giddy
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
I wanna be like that
That
I'm on my knees in the corner
Wiping my floor, wiping my forehead, yeah
And they are gone, they are gone, they are gone
I wanna be like that
That
That
That
These flowers are coming up wild
They're coming up, they're coming up
They're coming up wildEmbed
