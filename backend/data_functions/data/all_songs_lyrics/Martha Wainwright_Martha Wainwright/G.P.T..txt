G.P.T. LyricsCop a ride or catch a feel
I won't be late, I won't decline
Your invite tonight this starry cold night
It's six o'clock get up the block
Don't be scared don't be shocked
I'll be there tonight on yours & mine's night
I'm yours and mine tonight
And oh bring back my memory
And say goodnight to Irene
The sun is down
You'll act the clown, I'll dance around
We'll hit the town
Your shirt is stained my dress is frayed
But later they'll go
I've laid my claim, I thought for sure
That I'd be yours oh but your friend is much more
But he's got a date and she's got a name
I don't care
And oh bring back my memory
And say goodnight to Irene
There was six drunk men
Six drunk men
See how they fail
See how they fail
Catch a ride or cop a feel
I won't be late I won't decline
Your invite tonight this starry cold nightEmbed
