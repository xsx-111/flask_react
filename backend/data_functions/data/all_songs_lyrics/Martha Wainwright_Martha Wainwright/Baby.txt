Baby LyricsOh, every morning I wake up
Happy for the first time
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It's in vain because you're in pain most of the time
Oh baby, I wanna have your baby
And I know it's a crazy bad time
Falling in love with you, I know, I know
It's in vain because you're in pain most of the time
Throw a couple down the hatch
I might just tell you how lonely it gets
This feeling, the party's finally coming to an end
It's for the best, I guess
Pick up the pieces and leave in the mess
Oh honey, I know I owe ya money
But I'm gonna pay you back
If you would just take out my trash
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
It's in vain because you're in pain all of the time
Should I be fucking you more?
Should I be closing the door?
Should I be learning to turn out the light
When you're coming on strike? Oh yeah
Look what you've done to me
I'm in a fantasy
I wanna be your little lady
Won't you be my big daddy
And oh, oh Lord, I never thought
It could be so hot underneath your rock
But it feels pretty nice but I got some advice
You better start to be nice
Or I think I'm gonna cry again
And oh, Lord, I never thought
It could be so hot underneath your rock
But it feels pretty nice but I got some advice
You better start to be nice
Or I think I'm gonna cry again
Ohh honey, do you think you're too old for me?
I know you like 'em even younger
But that might make people shudder
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I knowEmbed
