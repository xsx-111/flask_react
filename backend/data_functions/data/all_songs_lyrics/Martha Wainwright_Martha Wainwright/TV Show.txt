TV Show LyricsI'm not such a good lover
I'm a better talker
So when you touch me there
I'm scared that you'll see
Not the way that I don't love you
But the way that I don't love myself
There are things these days
That can help you through a phase
Like food and health and fear
I prefer the beer
Not the way that I don't love you
But the way that I hate myself
Oh when the cityscape is born
From the ocean floor
It speaks its native tongue
Physical, subliminal
Not the way that it left you cold
But the way that you left yourself
And the Moon falls from the Earth
And the Sun, it fills its girth
And I know we'll go howl at the night
Oh, howl at the night
But still the sun will not hide our fight
Oh, hide our fight
I laugh a lot
But that's just a plot
I found a way to make the night stay
Not the way that I don't love you
But the way that I hate myself
It was Oprah
On the TV show
She told me so
It was Oprah
On the TV show
She told me so
Not the way that I don't love you
But the way that I love myselfEmbed
