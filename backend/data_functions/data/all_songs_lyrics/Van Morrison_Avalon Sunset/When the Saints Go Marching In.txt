When the Saints Go Marching In LyricsWe are traveling in the footsteps
Of those who've gone before
But we'll all be reunited (But if we stand reunited)
On a new and sunlit shore (Then a new world is in store)
Oh when the Saints go marching in
When the Saints go marching in
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
And when the sun refuse (begins) to shine
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
When the moon turns red with blood
When the moon turns red with blood
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
On that hallelujah day
On that hallelujah day
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh when the trumpet sounds the call
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
Some say this world of trouble
Is the only one we need
But I'm waiting for that morning
When the new world is revealed
When the revelation (revolution) comes
When the revelation (revolution) comes
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
When the rich go out and work
When the rich go out and work
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
When the air is pure and clean
When the air is pure and clean
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
When we all have food to eat
When we all have food to eat
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching in
When our leaders learn to cry
When our leaders learn to cry
Oh Lord I want to be in that number
When the Saints go marching inEmbed
