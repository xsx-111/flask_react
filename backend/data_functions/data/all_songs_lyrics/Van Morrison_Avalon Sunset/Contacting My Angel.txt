Contacting My Angel Lyrics
Contacting my angel, yeah, contacting my angel
She's the one, she's the one, that satisfies
Contacting my angel she's the one that satisfies
She's the one that I adore

Got a telepathic message from my baby
In a little village through the fog
Here comes my baby, I can tell
I can tell by the way she walks
Said I've been on a journey up the mountain side
And I drank the water from the stream
It was pure, pure water and healing

I met a presence on the mountain side
And he looked so radiant and he was
The youth of eternal summers
Like a sweet bird of youth in my soul
In my soul, in my soul, in my soul, in my soul
In my soul, in my soul, in my soulEmbed
