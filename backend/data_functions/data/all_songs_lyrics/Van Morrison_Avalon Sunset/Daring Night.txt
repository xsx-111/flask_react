Daring Night Lyrics
In the daring night when all the stars are shining bright
Squeeze me don't leave me in the daring night
Galactic swirl in the firmament tonight
Oh with the Lord of the Dance
With the Lord of the Dance in the daring night

I see Orion and The Hunters standing by the light of the moon
In the daring night, in the daring night
And the heart and the soul
As we look up in awe and wonder at the heavens
Oh and we go with the Lord of the Dance
With the Lord of the Dance, with the Lord of the Dance
In the daring night

In the daring night when all the stars are shining bright
Oh baby squeeze me don't leave me in the daring night
In the firmament we move
We move and we live and we have our being
Squeeze me don't leave me, baby in the daring night
(Alright)

In the firmament we move and galactic swirl
And we live and we breathe and have our being, yeah
Baby in the daring light
Darling squeeze me squeeze me
Don't ever leave me in the daring night
When all the stars are shining bright
And don't let go, and don't let go
And don't let go, don't let go in the daring night
And we move and we move and we move and we move
And we move and we move and we move
Baby don't let go in the daring night
Baby in the daring night

In the daring night when all the stars are shining bright
Baby squeeze me, squeeze me, don't leave me
Oh in the daring night
Capture it all baby baby baby with the Lord of the Dance
Oh with the Lord of the Dance, ah in the daring night
With the Lord of the Dance in the daring night

With the Lord of the Dance
Ad the great Goddess of the eternal wisdom
Standing by the light of the moon oh in the daring night

And the bodies move and we sweat and have our being
Baby don't leave me (Don't leave me) in the daring night
In the daring night (Daring night)
When all the stars are shining bright (Shining bright)
Squeeze me don't leave me (Squeeze me don't leave me)
Baby in the daring night (In the daring night)
Oh baby in the daring night
In the daring night (In the daring night, in the daring night)
Squeeze me don't leave me in the daring night
One four, one four
In the daring night, in the daring night (In the daring night)
Yeah
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go (Ooh)Embed
