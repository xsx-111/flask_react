Coney Island Lyrics
Coney Island

Coming back from Downpatrick stopping off at St. John's Point
Out all day birdwatching and the craic was good
Stopped off at Strangford Lough early in the morning
Drove through Shrigley taking pictures and on to Killyleagh
Stopped off for Sunday papers at the Lecale District
Just before Coney Island

On and on over the hill to Ardglass in the jam jar
Autumn sunshine, magnificent and all shining through
Stop off at Ardglass for a couple of jars of mussels
And some potted herrings in case we get famished before dinner

On and on, over the hill and the craic is good
Heading towards Coney Island
I look at the side of your face
As the sunlight comes streaming through the window
In the autumn sunshine
And all the time going to Coney Island I'm thinking
Wouldn't it be great if it was like this all the time?Embed
