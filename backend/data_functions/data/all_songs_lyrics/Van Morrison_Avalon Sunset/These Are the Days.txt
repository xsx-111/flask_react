These Are the Days Lyrics
These are the days of the endless summer
These are the days, the time is now
There is no past, there's only future
There's only here, there's only now

Oh your smiling face, your gracious presence
Oh the fires of spring are kindling bright
Oh the radiant heart and the song of glory
Crying freedom in the night

These are the days by the sparkling river
His timely grace and our treasured find
This is the love of the one magician
Turned the water into wine, alright

These are days of the endless dancing
And the long walks on the summer night
These are the days of the true romancing
When I'm holding you oh so tight

These are the days by the sparkling river
And His timely grace and our treasured find
This is the love of the one great magician
Turned the water into wine
These are the days now that we must savour
And we must enjoy as we can
These are the days that will last forever
You've got to hold them in your heart

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na
These are the days (Oh)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na (Ooh)
These are the days
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na
These are the days (These are the days, ooh)
Na na na na na na na na (Ooh yeah)
Na na na na (Ah)
These are the days (These are the days)
Na na na na na na na na (Ooh)
Na na na na
These are the days
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na naEmbed
