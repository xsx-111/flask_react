When Will I Ever Learn to Live in God? Lyrics
The sun was setting over Avalon
The last time we stood in the west
Suffering long time angels enraptured by Blake
Burn out the dross innocence captured again
Standing on the beach at sunset
And all the boats keep moving slow
In the glory of the flashing light in the evenings glow

When will I ever learn to live in God?
When will I ever learn?
He gives me everything I need and more
When will I ever learn?

You brought it to my attention
That everything was made in God
Down through centuries of great writings and paintings
Everything was in God
Seen through architecture of great cathedrals
Down through the history of time
Is and was in the beginning and evermore shall ever be

When will I ever learn to live in God?
When will I ever learn?
He gives me everything I need and more
When will I ever learn?
Whatever it takes to fulfill His mission
That is the way we must go
But you've got to do it your own way
Tear down the old, bring up the new

And up on the hillside it's quiet
Where the shepherd is tending his sheep
And over the mountains and the valleys
And the countryside is so green
Standing on the highest hill with a sense of wonder
You can see that everything is made in God
Head back down the roadside and give thanks for it all

When will I ever learn to live in God?
When will I ever learn?
He gives me everything I need and more
When will I ever learn?
When will I ever learn to live in God?
When will I ever learn?
He gives me everything I need and more
When will I ever learn?
When will I ever learn to live in God?
When will I ever learn?
He gives me everything I need and more
When will I ever learn?Embed
