Desert Rose LyricsDesert Rose that dances
In the heat of the sky
I must pattern my life around you
You can make the most
When the waters run dry
Look into the well
Deep inside you
My Desert Rose
Born are the few
Always with me
(A) Vision of you
Acrolith reflection that
Crawls through my dreams
Arid is the dust underneath me
Something far away
A mirage so it seems
What I long to see
Oh could it be...
My Desert Rose
Born are the few
Always with me
(A) Vision of you
My Desert Rose
Born are the few
Always with me
(A) Vision of you
My Desert Rose
Born are the few
Always with me, oh yea
(A) Vision of you
My Desert Rose
Born are the few
Always with me
(A) Vision of you
So... Don't fade away1Embed
