High Landrons LyricsWay down here on the edge of these snows
I hear a strong wind whine
Goin' to where the freedom bells ring
Into the Highlands I must climb
On this journey, I have been here before
Tryin' to reach the other side
I just can't get through the top of these hills
Without a mountain guide
Took such a while to find you
Oh could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons
All right
Up ahead, I know the trailway stops
From there on, only eagles fly
Burning visions of the way back to you
They're burnin' through the eastern sky
Now and then I see a shooting star
Lighting up the silver blue
It's shining all the way down the mountain skyway
Oh, it's shining straight from you
Took all my life to find you
Oh could you show me the way?
To get to the land I once knew
You're the only one, so take me through High Landrons
Ooh yeah
Up ahead
Took all my life to find you
Oh could you show me the way?
To get to the place I once knew
You're the only one, that gets through the High Landrons
Up ahead
Ooh yeahEmbed
