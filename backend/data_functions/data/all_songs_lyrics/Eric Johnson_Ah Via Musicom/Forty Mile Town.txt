Forty Mile Town LyricsI got a way I can find you
Down the melody ranch, I know you're there most everyday
That's where you like to spend some time alone
I need to talk to you
Tell you what I feel, like warm hellos in the morning mist
And you're the magic that turns my heart around
Seems to me, we're really living way too fast
Oh when we should let the story of love last
Sometimes I just want to go and drift away...
And move on to some fourty mile town
I got a way I can see you
Close my eyes to watch the ancient water flow
Like a crystal dance that paupers know so well
That's the way kings keep dreamin'
Hold their head up high and live below fourty mile skys
The way that it can be in ocean towns
Things of this world, guess we never really own;
Oh that mountain falls, and then we're goin' home
We should try to make the best and get away...
And work on towards a fourty mile town
Seems to me we really need to feel love more
Oh, and ordinary simle opens the door
Sometimes all I want to do is dream away...
And wake up in some fourty mile townEmbed
