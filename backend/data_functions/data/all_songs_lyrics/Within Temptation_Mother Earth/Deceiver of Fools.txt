Deceiver of Fools LyricsHe feeds on fear
He feeds on pain
He rules again
With growing hate
He will guide
Their faith again
No light in the darkness
Is too small to see
There's always a sparkle of hope
If you just believe
He told the tale so many times
About the dream not meant to be
In a world of the free
(He plays with your mind)
As faith for the future faded fast
He grows strong with their displeasure
It sets him free
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again
He feeds on fear, poisons the truth
To gain their faith, to lead the way
To a world of decay
(He rules your heart)
He'll sell your soul to the grave
Without a hesitation to make
He belongs to the dark
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again
Please awake and see the truth
He can only be if you believe what he tells you
Remember who you are, what you stand for
There will always be a way
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
He rules again
In my heart there is a place
In my heart there is a trace
Of a small fire burning
A sheltering ray shines through this night
Although it's small it's bright
But darkness is lurking
He will sell your soul
To bitterness and cold
Oh, fear him
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hopes
Deceiver of fools
Shall he rule again?Embed
