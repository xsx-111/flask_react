Mother Earth Lyrics
Birds and butterflies
Rivers and mountains she creates
But you'll never know
The next move she'll make
You can try
But it is useless to ask why
Cannot control her
She goes her own way

She rules
Until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules
Until the end of time
She goes her way

With every breath
And all the choices that we make
We are only passing through
On her way
I find my strength
Believing that their soul lives on
Until the end of time
I'll carry them with me
She rules
Until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules
Until the end of time
She goes her way

Once you will know, my dear
You don't have to fear (you don't have to fear)
A new beginning (beginning)
Always starts at the end
Once you will know, my dear
You don't have to fear
Until the end of time
(Until the end of time)
Until the end of time
(Until the end of time)
Until the end of time
She goes her way

She rules
Until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
She goes her way2Embed
