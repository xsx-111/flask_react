Never-ending Story Lyrics
Armies have conquered
And fallen in the end
Kingdoms have risen
Then buried by sand
The Earth is our mother
She gives and she takes
She puts us to sleep
In her light, we'll awake
We'll all be forgotten
There's no endless fame
But everything we do
It's never in vain

We're part of a story, part of a tale
We're all on this journey
No one's to stay
Wherever it's going, what is the way?

Forests and deserts
Rivers, blue seas
Mountains and valleys
Nothing here stays
While we think we witness
We're part of the scene
This never-ending story
Where will it lead to?
The Earth is our mother
She gives and she takes
But she's also a part
A part of the tale
We're part of a story, part of a tale
We're all on this journey
No one's to stay
Oh, where is it going, what is the way?
We're part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful, sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began
We're part of a story, part of a tale
We're all on this journey
No one's to stay
Oh, where is it going, what is the way?
We're part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful, sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began1Embed
