Caged Lyrics
These are the darkest clouds
That have surrounded me
Now I find myself alone
Caught in a cage
There's no flower I can find in here
Not withering, not pale to me
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside

He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face, he just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside, sorrow has frozen my mind

My heart is covered with thoughts entangled
How could it ever have felt so real?
Is there a place more lonely
Than I feel within?
Could I have seen? Could I have known?
I just took it as the truth
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside
He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face, he just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside, sorrow has frozen my mind

Always there to remind me
It keeps me from believing
That someone might be there
Who frees me and never ever leaves me

He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face, he just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside, sorrow has frozen my mindEmbed
