World of Make Believe Lyrics
On golden wings she flies at night
With her dress, it's blinding white
Countless diamonds and her long blonde hair
The queen is coming so you'd better be aware
Her plants and flowers, they are never the same
Blue and silver, it's all her game
Flying dragons and enchanted woods
She decides, she creates, it's her reality

In her world of dreams and make believe
She reigns forever with all her glory

Unicorns appear in her sight
Her fireflies lead her through these woods
At night in search of the legendary amulet
And its secrets
In the big oak, there is a door
Which will lead her to the wizard's shore
And she'll ask him for the wind to sail her home
To the world where she belongs

In her world of dreams and make believe
She reigns forever with all her glory
In this world of endless fantasy
She makes it happen, it's her reality
In her world of dreams and make believe
She reigns forever with all her glory
In this world of endless fantasy
She makes it happen, it's her realityEmbed
