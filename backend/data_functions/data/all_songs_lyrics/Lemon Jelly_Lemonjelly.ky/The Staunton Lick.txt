The Staunton Lick LyricsThis is basic plucking, or, the Staunton Lick
Hold down the chord of C, pluck a fretted bass string with the thumb of the right hand
And pluck the third, second and first strings altogether with the first, second and third fingers of the right hand
This is the Staunton Lick
The Staunton Lick
