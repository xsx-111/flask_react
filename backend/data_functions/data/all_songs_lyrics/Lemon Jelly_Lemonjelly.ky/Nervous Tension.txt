Nervous tension
Nervous tension
Is an unseen enemy of the human mind
Nervous tension can cause you to lack confidence in yourself
To lose your powers of concentration and to be inefficient in your work
Nervous tension can prevent you from relaxing, can spoil your leisure hours
And rob you of the sleep you need at night
Nervous tension
Nervous tension
The purpose of this record is to train you in the art of relaxing
Both your mind and your body
Use it regularly
Train your mind through repetition, to follow the suggestions
Then you'll be ready to progress to side 2
The mind remains tense when it is restlessly turning over personal problems
Worrying about financial matters, or the conflicts of daytime employment, or
Fretting over the troubles of the world
A mind so strained and tense cannot relax, even in sleep
Night passes in uneasy dreams, the body is not refreshed as it should be
But you can overcome this difficulty if you thoroughly relax your mind
Before you go to bed (?)
Better still you can learn to relax from time to time during the day, so
That nervous tension never builds up to an unpleasant degree
Nervous tension
Nervous tension
You will carefully plan your course through life
You will think about your plans often
Think about it with interest
Think with pleasure of the satisfaction you'll feel as the plan becomes reality
You will firmly imprint in your mind this phrase:
'I maintain at all times a calm, confident, cheerful state of mind.'
You will repeat it aloud to yourself at least 3 times daily
You will give your mind and body the rest they need to restore energy
Very shortly you will no longer need to listen to my advice
You will absorb and understand the suggestions I have given you, and you will
Learn to give them to yourself
Nervous tension
Nervous tension
And now we shall beginEmbed
