Page One LyricsImagine if you can what it is like to have no posessions at all
Nothing. Very few people are able to imagine such a thing, to have nothing at all
Well let us, you and I, try to imagine something a hundred times harder
Not just to have nothing at all, but when there was nothing at all
The very beginning of time. The dawn of history. Page one
Nothing at all
The earth itself with out form, and void
Only an emptiness, formless, a dark endless waste of water
No living thing, no plant or tree, no bird or animal
Nothing
This is before people. Before anything at all. A void. Sitting silent
Still
And then...
NothingEmbed
