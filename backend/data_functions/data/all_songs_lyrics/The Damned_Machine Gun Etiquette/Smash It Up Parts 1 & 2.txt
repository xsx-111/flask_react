Smash It Up Parts 1 & 2 LyricsWe've been crying now for much too long
And now we're gonna dance to a different song
I'm gonna scream and shout til my dying breath
I'm gonna smash it up til theres nothing left
Oooh ooh smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
Oooh ooh smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
People call me villain oh its such a shame
Maybe it's my clothes must be to blame
I don't even care if I look a mess
Don't wanna be a sucker like all the rest
Oooh ooh smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
Oooh ooh smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
Smash it up
Smash it up
Smash it up
Smash it up
Smash it up
(Smash it up) You can keep your krishna burgers
(Smash it up) And your Glastonbury hippies
(Smash it up) You can stick your frothy lager
(Smash it up) And your blow wave hairstyles
We've been crying now for much too long
And now we're gonna dance to a different song
I'm gonna scream and shout til my dying breath
I'm gonna smash it up til theres nothing left
Oooh ooh smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
Oooh ooh smash it up, smash it up, smash it up
And everybody's smashing things down
I said everybody's smashing things down yeahEmbed
