Plan 9 Channel 7 LyricsShe plays her mouth into a smile
And offers that he stay a while
Two hearts that beat as one
And eyes that hardly ever saw the sun
Hollywood babbles on
She lays a wreath of lilies on his grave
His flame gone along with the love he never gave
Not to be seduced by those red lips
Two dimensional comic clips
Hollywood babbles on
On and on and on and on and...
Channel 7, with shades of grey
Too close but two worlds away
Plan 9, hello may
Too close but two worlds away
They say
Step into the night
She plays her mouth into a smile
And offers that he stay a while
Two hearts that beat as one
And eyes that hardly ever saw the sun
Hollywood babbles on
She lays a wreath of lilies on his grave
His flame gone along with the love he never gave
Not to be seduced by those red lips
Two dimensional comic clips
Hollywood babbles on
On and on and on and on and...
Channel 7, with shades of grey
Too close but two worlds away
Plan 9, hello may
Too close but two worlds away
They sayEmbed
