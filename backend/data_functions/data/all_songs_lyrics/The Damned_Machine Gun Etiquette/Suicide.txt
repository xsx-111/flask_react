Suicide LyricsThere's too much confusion for
A young man to take
Look at my eyes that ain't easy to fake
I've got no spirit left to break
I'll slash my wrists ain't no mistake
Help me
Oh help me
Help me
Oh help me
Suicide suicide it's happening again
Suicide suicide I'm losing my brain
Suicide suicide what can I do
I'm gonna kill myself because of you
I've lost track of logical thinking
I'm sitting in a room not even blinking
Into the darkness I am sinking
About to hear the angels singing
Help me
Oh help me
Help me
Oh help me
Suicide suicide it's happening again
Suicide suicide I'm losing my brain
Suicide suicide what can I do
I'm gonna kill myself because of you
My mind's going round faster and faster
The scripts been read and
There's no disaster
I was in with a chance but I'm a bastard
I'm lying awake in a hospital plaster
Help me
Oh help me
Help me
Oh help me
Suicide suicide it's happening again
Suicide suicide I'm losing my brain
Suicide suicide what can I do
I'm gonna kill myself because of youEmbed
