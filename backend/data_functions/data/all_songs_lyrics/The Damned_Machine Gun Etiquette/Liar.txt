Liar LyricsTheres not a word of truth in anything that I say
I don't really want to listen till they go away
I haven't finished and I never try
If you ask me reasons I just lie
I'm a liar, liar, I never tell the truth
I'm a liar, liar, I never tell the truth
I tell you how I feel and why it is
And what you are if you don't start to give
I love spending hours watching television
I stole the best lies and then I call up your crepid politicians
I'm a liar, liar, I never tell the truth
I'm a liar, liar, I never tell the truth
I smoked your last cigarette I say that someone else did
I send your mum to the bed to find if your sisters frigid
You ask me why, I just lie
I'm a liar, liar
I'm gonna be the biggest liar in the world
I'll be so good you'll believe every word
I could even make you believe Adolf Hitler
Send him to Russia for the winter
I'm a liar, liar, I never tell the truth
I'm a liar, liar, I never tell the truthEmbed
