Melody Lee LyricsMelody Lee, a broken mind and a broken dream
A burst of speed, a change of heart
Your life was cruel they called it art
Melody Lee, you need a mirror to set you free
You know you can't cheat tomorrow
If you hide it'll end in sorrow
Melody Lee, you gotta find your secret enemy
You're on the run with nowhere to go
If you die there's no-one to know
Forget your heart, you need not stay
A second longer than today
Melody Lee, a broken mind and a broken dream
A burst of speed, a change of heart
Your life was cruel they called it art1Embed
