Machine Gun Etiquette LyricsI remember what you said (second time around)
Don't you wish that we were dead (second time around)
No more getting pushed around (second time around)
Not that we've gone underground (second time around)
Now its time for you to see (second time around)
What the Love Song did for me (second time around)
Really famous stinking rich (second time around)
Straight up there without a hitch (second time around)
I remember what you said (second time around)
Don't you wish that we were dead (second time around)
No more getting pushed around (second time around)
Back to haunt you with our sound (second time around)Embed
