These Hands LyricsThese are the hands of a demented circus clown
Outside I'm laughing but inside I'm really wearing a frown
I see you laughing at me
But baby in my dreams
It's quite a different scene
Chasing you through the night with my hands around your neck
Funny how everything seems in technicolour, yet
I find I'm laughing at you
And you are turning blue
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha
Ho ho hoEmbed
