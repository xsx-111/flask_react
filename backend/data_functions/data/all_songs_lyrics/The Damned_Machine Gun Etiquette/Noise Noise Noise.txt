Noise Noise Noise LyricsAt 7am on a brand new day
I'm gonna start it in the perfect way
Put the greatest record on
I kick the dog, I kick the cat
Insult my mum insult my dad
Sing out loud and sing along
We say noise is for heroes (heroes)
Leave the music for zeroes (zeroes)
Noise Noise Noise is for heroes (heroes)
Oh yeah
I'm down the pub and the time is one
Hit the jukebox for my favourite song
Gonna turn it up too loud
Have a couple of games of pool
Argue with a drunken fool
Have a beer with the usual crowd
We say noise is for heroes (heroes)
Leave the music for zeroes (zeroes)
Noise Noise Noise is for heroes (heroes)
Oh yeah
It's noise that makes the world go round
I can't survive without that sound
The sound torments me
It's 8 o'clock down the church hall
I've enough amplifiers 6 feet tall
Gonna turn them up full blast
The vicar waves his arms and looks absurd
The noise drowns out his godly words
And he can't get out too fast
We say noise is for heroes (heroes)
Leave the music for zeroes (zeroes)
Noise Noise Noise is for heroes (heroes)
Oh yeah
