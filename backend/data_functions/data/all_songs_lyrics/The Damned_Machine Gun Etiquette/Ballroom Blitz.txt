Ballroom Blitz LyricsIt's been getting so hard
Living with the things you do to me
My dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see
I see a man at the back as a matter of fact
His eyes are as red as the sun
And a girl in the corner let no one ignore her
'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one
Oh yeah, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing and they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And the man at the back said "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said, "Boy I wanna warn you"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
Ballroom blitz
I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing's all I ever do
I softly call you over
When you appear there's nothing left of you
Now the man at the back is ready to crack
As he raises his hands to the sky
And the girl in the corner is everyone's moaner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye
Oh yeah, it was electric, so frightfully hectic
And the band started leaping
'Cause they all stopped breathing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the man at the back said "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said, "Boy I wanna warn you"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
Oh yeah, it was like lightning
Everybody was frightening
And the music was soothing
And they all started grooving
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the man at the back said "Everyone attack"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
And the girl in the corner said, "Boy I wanna warn you"
And it turned into a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz
It's, it's a ballroom blitz, yeahEmbed
