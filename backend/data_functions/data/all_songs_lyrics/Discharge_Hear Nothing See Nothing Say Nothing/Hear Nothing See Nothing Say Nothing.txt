Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing LyricsLied to, threatened, cheated and deceived
Hear nothing see nothing say nothing
Led up garden paths and into blind alleys
Hear nothing see nothing say nothing
Lied to, threatened, cheated and deceived
Hear nothing see nothing say nothing
Led up garden paths and into blind alleys
Hear nothing see nothing say nothingEmbed
