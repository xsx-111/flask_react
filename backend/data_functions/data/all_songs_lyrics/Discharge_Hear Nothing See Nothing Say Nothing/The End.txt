The End LyricsA smouldering wilderness
Mass death and destruction!
Mass death and destruction!
Millions dead and dying
Mass death and destruction!
Mass death and destruction!
A smouldering wilderness
Mass death and destruction!
Mass death and destruction!
Now in darkness world stops turning
Mass death and destruction!
Mass death and destruction!Embed
