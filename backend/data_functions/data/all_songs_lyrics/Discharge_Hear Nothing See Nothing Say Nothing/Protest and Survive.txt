Protest and Survive LyricsThe savage mutilation
Of the human race
Is set on course
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!
It is up to us
To change that course
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!
The savage mutilation
Of the human race
Is set on course
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!
It is up to us
To change that course
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!
Protest and survive!Embed
