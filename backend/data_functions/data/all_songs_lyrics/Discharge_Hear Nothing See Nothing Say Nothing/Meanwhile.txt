Meanwhile LyricsHalf the world is starving dying of disease
World military expenditure increases
Half the world is living in poverty
World military expenditure increases
Half the world is starving dying of disease
World military expenditure increases
Half the world is living in poverty
World military expenditure increasesEmbed
