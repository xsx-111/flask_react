Q: And Children? A: And Children LyricsIn agony they cry and scream
And children and children
And children and children
Skin peeled hanging in strips
And children and children
And children and children
In agony they cry and scream
And children and children
And children and children
Skin peeled hanging in strips
And children and children
And children and childrenEmbed
