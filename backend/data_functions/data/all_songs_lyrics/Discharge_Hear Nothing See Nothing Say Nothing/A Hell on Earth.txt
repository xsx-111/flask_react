A Hell on Earth LyricsA claring light, an unnatural tremor
Suffocating heat, suffocating heat
A hell on earth, hell on earth
Men women and children groaning in agony
From the intolerable pains of their burns
A hell on earth, hell on earth
A claring light, an unnatural tremor
Suffocating heat, suffocating heat
A hell on earth, hell on earth
Men women and children groaning in agony
From the intolerable pains of their burns
A hell on earth, hell on earthEmbed
