Drunk with Power LyricsFor how long do we tolerate
These fools drunk with power?
Drunk with power, obsessed with death
Death and destruction, drunk with power
A giant game of chess they play
With you and I as the disposable pieces
Drunk with power, obsessed with death
Death and destruction, drunk with power
For how long do we tolerate
These fools drunk with power?
Drunk with power, obsessed with death
Death and destruction, drunk with power
A giant game of chess they play
With you and I as the disposable pieces
Drunk with power, obsessed with death
Death and destruction, drunk with powerEmbed
