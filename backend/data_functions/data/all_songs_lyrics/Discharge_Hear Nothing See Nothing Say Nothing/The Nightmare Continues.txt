The Nightmare Continues LyricsAnd still men and women drag out their lives in misery
The nightmare continues
Blinded disfigured and mentally scarred
The nightmare continues
And still men and women drag out their lives in misery
The nightmare continues
Blinded disfigured and mentally scarred
The nightmare continues1Embed
