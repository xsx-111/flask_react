Dolphins Lyrics
This old world may never change
The way it's always been
I know all the ways of war
Cannot change it back again

I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

I'm not the one to tell this world
How to get along
I only know that peace will come
When all the hurt is gone

I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me

Sometimes I think about
Saturday's child
And all about the time
You and me were running wild
I've been searching for the dolphins in the sea
Sometimes I wonder do you ever think of me
This old world may never change
This old world may never change
This old world may never changeEmbed
