Pedestal LyricsI've been sitting so high on this pedestal
No need to tell how I might feel if I were to fall
'Cause you don't know how hard it is to cry
Ever since you have said goodbye
You can't feel this and not a little strong
You can't feel this but not a little wrong
How're you gonna know all the answers
When you don't know how to question it?
And you don't know all the questions yet
There's a look in your eye
Of which we never speak
Will it make you too strong
Or am I gonna feel so weak?
Well, I'm not the same as you
And I don't want the things you do
And all that preaching never let anyone know
You cannot reap what you cannot sow
You cannot reap what you cannot sow
And they never had the patience to let it be
Sometimes I've waited years for what I cannot see
It must be them, not the whole world, that lies
To neither do I wanna have to say goodbye
You can't feel this and not a little strong
You can't feel that but not a little wrong
How'm I gonna know all the answers
If I don't know how to question it?
And I don't know all the questions yet
There's a look in your eye
Of which we never speak
Will it make me too strong
Or are you gonna feel so weak?
Well I'm not the same as you
And I don't have the things you do
And all this preaching never let anyone know
You cannot reap what you cannot sow
You cannot reap what you cannot sowEmbed
