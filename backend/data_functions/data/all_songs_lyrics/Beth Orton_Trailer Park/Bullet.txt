Bullet LyricsSomething's buzzing round your brain and it won't let go
Could be saying all you need to know
It could control who you are 'til you become a passenger
When all is said and done
Where credits due the blame was true
It isn't all up to you
There's too many people take more than they can use
Still too many people taking more than they can use
They'd rather drown you in self pity
Than find the will to live
When there's no consequence there's no easy route
Find your bullet and aim and shoot
When there's no compromise no easy route
Find your bullet and aim and shoot
You've got to aim and shoot
Time is rushing through your veins
And it won't let go
Time can tell you all you need to know
It doesn't matter who I am if I'm not part of its greater plan
When all is said and done
Where credits due the blame it isn't all down to you
There's too many people take more than they can use
Still too many people taking more than they can use
They'd rather drown you in self pity
Than find the will to live
When there's no compromise there's no easy route
Find your bullet and aim and shoot
When there's no compromise no easy route
Find your bullet and aim and shoot
You've got to aim and shoot
Too many people taking more than they can give
Still too many people taking more than they can give
There's too many people taking more than they could give
Still too many people taking more than they can give
Time can tell you all you need to know
Time can tell you all you need to know
Time can tell you all you need to know
Time can tell you all you need to know
Too many people taking more than they can give
Oh there's too many people taking more than they can give
I'd rather drown you in self pity
Than find the will to live
When there's no consequence no easy route
Find your bullet and aim and shoot
Find your lovin' and aim and shoot
Find your lovin' and aim and shootEmbed
