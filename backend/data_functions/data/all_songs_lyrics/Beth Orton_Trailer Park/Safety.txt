Safety LyricsYou saw a time to come
Where the eyes of the world would see as one
You saw a time to come
Where all of our laughter is seen through the eyes of the son
And you'll get angry in this town
'Cause you've seen more than what's been found
Can't be too needy in this town
'Cause there's enough of that around
Safety in lovers
Freedom from therein
Safety in lovers
And somewhere to begin
You saw a time to come
Where the eyes of the world will cry as one
You saw a time to come
Where all our work's not done as for the good of one
And you'll get angry in this town
'Cause there's not more than what's been found
Can't be too needy in this town
'Cause there's enough of that around
Safety in lovers
Freedom from therein
Safety in lovers
And somewhere to begin
Safety in lovers
Freedom from within
Safety in lovers
And somewhere to beginEmbed
