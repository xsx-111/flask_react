How Far LyricsI heard you saying, rightly so
Turn our backs on what we most need to know
Give in too fast, then give in to no
Once they've got you where they want you they don't wanna know
I could leave or I could stay
It doesn't make a bit of difference any more anyway
With each and every circumstance
I lose knowledge and gain innocence
You won't find me grieving
There's no regret in leaving
When I had to come here
Like I know I had to come here
I can see I had to come here
For my view to be clear
For my view to be clear
It's easy to forget how far we've come
How near I feel to where we first begun
Pushed it too far, I won't pull it too slow
Cos' where this story ends depends on how far we go
I could leave or I could stay
It doesn't make a bit of difference any more anyway
With each and every circumstance
I lose knowledge and gain innocence
You won't find me grieving
There's no regret in leaving
When I had to come here
Like I know I had to come here
Oh I know I had to come here
For my view to be clear
You know I see I had to be here
Oh I know I had to be here
I can see I had to be here
For my view is now clear
So roll on blue skies
Roll on grey
Just roll away
So roll on blue skies
Roll on grey
Just roll away
Come on blue skies
Come on grey
Then roll away
Just roll away
Just roll awayEmbed
