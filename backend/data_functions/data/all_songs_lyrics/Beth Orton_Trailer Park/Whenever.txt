Whenever LyricsWhenever I need a friend
It's you I come round to see again
You know that I'll always be near
You're flesh and blood and you're my memory
Live on in my memory
I send you nothing but love
Just wait and see
I send you nothing but love
Just wait for me
Wait and see
Wait and see
Great words
You know all the right words to say
You don't always lean in my way
You don't always mean what you say
Whenever I need a friend
It's you I come 'round to see again
And everything that you do
Is everything I will ask of you
You could ask me too
I send you nothing but love
Just wait and see
I send you nothing but love
Just wait for me
Wait and see
Wait and see
Great words
You know all the right words to say
You don't have to lean in my way
We don't have to mean what we sayEmbed
