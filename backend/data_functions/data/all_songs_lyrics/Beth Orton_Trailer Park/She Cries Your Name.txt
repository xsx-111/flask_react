She Cries Your Name Lyrics
Falling from the western selves
To find yourself alone again
Wonderin' where you have been
Your lonely voice
Calls across the star lit coast
Reaching out to be seen

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?

Cut beneath the surface screen
Of what we say and what we seem
Is there truth to be seen?
She keeps cryin' out your name
But her scream sounds the same
How fickle fate can be

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?
Birds which scream for territory
Can learn to sing euphorically
Given time that is revealed
And there's a wasteland in your soul
The burned out trees will leave you cold
Living out an ideal

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?

She cries your name
Three times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?

She cries your name
Twelve times again
She cries your name
How long can this love remain?Embed
