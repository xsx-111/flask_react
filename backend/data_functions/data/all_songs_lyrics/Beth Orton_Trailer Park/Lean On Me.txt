Lean On Me Lyrics
You've seen sad times
Your eyes have told me so
Blue and bad times
You think that I don't know
But there'll be glad times
Just you wait and see
And I'll be your sunrise
If you lean on me
I imagined I could comfort you
I had forgotten
The things that you'd been through
But here's one thing
On which we can agree
When you're ready darling
You can lean on me

And the love I bring
Will grow into a lasting thing
Put your heart on wings
And set you free
And as you rise
Up into the clearing skies
Maybe you will realize
You can lean on me
And lean on me, yeah
You can lean on me
Lean on me, yeah
You can lean on me
Lean on me, yeah
You can lean on me, yeah
Lean on me
You can lean on me

All your heartache
Hidden deep inside
So there's no telling
How many tears you've cried
But like the river
Told the weeping willow tree
I can hold your teardrops child
So lean on me

And the love I bring
Will grow into a lasting thing
Put your heart on wings
And set you free
And as you rise
Up into the clearing skies
Maybe you will realize
You can lean on me
And lean on me
You can lean on me
Lean on me
You can lean on me
And lean on me, yeah
You can lean on me, yeah
Lean on me
You can lean on me
And lean on me, yeah
You can lean on me, yeah
Lean on me
You can lean on me
And lean on me, yeah
You can lean on me, yeah
Lean on me
You can lean on meEmbed
