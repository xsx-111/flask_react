I Wish I Never Saw The Sunshine LyricsBaby do you know what you did today
Baby do you know what you took away
You took the blue out of the sky
My whole life changed when you said goodbye
An' I keep crying, crying
Ooooh baby
Ooooh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
An' if I never saw the sunshine baby
Then maybe I wouldn't mind the rain
Every day is just like the day before
All alone a million miles from shore
All of my dreams I dreamed with you
Now they will die and never come true
An' I keep crying, crying
Ooooh baby
Ooooh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
An' if I never saw the sunshine baby
Then maybe I wouldn't mind the rain
Ooooh this pain
And I know there would not be
This cloud that's over me
Everywhere I go
Ooooh baby
Ooooh baby
I wish I never saw the sunshine
I wish I never saw the sunshine
An' if I never saw the sunshine baby
Then maybe I wouldn't mind the rain
Ooooh this pain
I wouldn't mind the rain
There wouldn't be this pain
I wouldn't mind the rain
I wouldn't mind the rainEmbed
