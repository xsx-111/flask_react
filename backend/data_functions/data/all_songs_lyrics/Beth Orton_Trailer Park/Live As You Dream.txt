Live As You Dream LyricsIf there's something you wanna do
You'll know when you've seen it through
Yeah, we live as we dream alone
But that's not all you've ever known
Stop, look, listen I can find you
I've been standing right beside you
You don't have to remind me
I know and I won't let go
And if you've taken me for someone who cares
Then there's a dream I know we both have shared
If I talked to you after all's been done
I know we'll find home where ever we've gone
You're not the only one
But there's something I wanna show
Though not sure that I should do
So while we live all our dreams for free
But that's not all they ever could be
Stop look listen I can find you
I've been standing right beside you
You don't have to remind me
I know and I won't let go
And as I've taken you for someone who cares
Then there's a dream I know we both have shared
If you talk to me after what's been said
Then I know there's a home where ever we live
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
And if you've taken me for someone who cares
Then there's a dream I hope we both can share
If I talk to you after what's been said
Well you'll admit there's home where ever we live
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
We live as we dream alone
But that's not all we've shown
We live as we dream alone
And that's not all we've known
We live as we dream alone
That's not all you've shownEmbed
