Sugar Boy Lyrics
Sugar boy, it's all over now
Sugar boy, it's all over now
Ain't your loving
But the things you do
Listen boy I'm getting tired of you
Sugar boy, what you trying to do?

Well, I told you I loved you
Now what more can I do?
Told you I loved you
You beat my heart black and blue
I told you I loved you
Now what more can I do?
Do you want me to lay down
And die for you?
Do you want me to lay down and die?

Sugar boy, it's all over now
Sugar boy, it's all over now
Went to the doctor
Told me something was wrong
Listen girl, you shouldn't feel so alone
Sugar boy, what you trying to do?
Well I told you I loved you
Now what more can I do?
Told you I loved you
You beat my heart black and blue
I told you I loved you
Now what more can I do?
Do you want me to lay down
And die for you?
Do you want me to lay down and die?
Lay down and die
Lay down and die
Well I'm not gonna lay down and die
No I'm not gonna lay down and die
Oh no I won't lay down and die
Never gonna lay down and die
Oh no I'm never gonna lay down and die for you
Oh no I'm never gonna lay down and die for you
I'm never gonna lay down and dieEmbed
