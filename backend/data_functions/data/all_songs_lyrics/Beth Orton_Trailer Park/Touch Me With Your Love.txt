Touch Me With Your Love LyricsI dreamed of you last night
You had a different face
Or maybe just a haircut
You were older and wiser
Yet more like a child
I was amazed to still find you
There at the back of my mind
This dream was short
This dream was happy
This dream was short
This dream was happy
Put your loving on a slow burner
If you want to keep your loving warmer
Put your loving on a slow simmer
If it helps to keep a light from growing dimmer
Now hold on, hold out
You're still thrown against that wall
Never looking to be picked up
Or left alone to fall
Can you touch me with your love?
Would I feel it if I trust enough?
Could it almost be a lust for life?
Would I feel it if I'd not known it by sight?
You could put it on a cold burner
Deception never kept it any warmer
The truth is cooking on a slow simmer
A light still shining even when it's dimmer
Hold on, hold out
You're still thrown against that wall
Never looking to be picked up
Or left alone to fall
Can you touch me with your love?
Would I feel it if I trust enough?
Could it almost be a lust for life?
Would I feel it if I'd not known it by sight?
Troubled waters locked so far down below
Will have to find another place to go
If the truth in my heart gets put aside
Just let me go and wait for the next tide
Hold on, hold out
I've been thrown against that wall
Never wanted to be picked up
And left alone to fall
Then it touched me just like love
Still feel it when I trust enough
Could almost be a lust for life
I can feel it though I'd not know it by sight
I can feel it 'cause I know it's all right
It's all right1Embed
