Skimming Stone LyricsYou been trying to find the line
To define the strength in weak hands
Read the first page, then guess the rest
I don't always know what's best
You been trying to swim up the sun's burning reflection
And trying to skim a boulder in the very same direction
Where it goes
No one knows
No one follows
Where it goes
No one knows
No one follows
I'll be a flame burning in the darkness
And I will light what's in your heart
I'll be a flame in the dark
But I can't light what's not in your heart
I can lie, I can lie, I can lie
I can lie
Lie, I could lie
You can lie
You can lie
You can lieEmbed
