It Hurts Me Too LyricsYou said you was hurtin', almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you love, hurts you all the time
But when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me too
You love him a little more, when you ought to love him less
Why pick up behind him and take his best?
'Cause when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me too
You love another man, Oh, but I love you
But you love him darlin', stick to him just about like glue
But when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me too
Well, he better leave you, or you best put him down
Cause you know, I just can't stand to see, see you pushed around
Cause when things go wrong, wrong with you, it hurts me tooEmbed
