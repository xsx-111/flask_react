I Know You Rider Lyrics
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms1Embed
