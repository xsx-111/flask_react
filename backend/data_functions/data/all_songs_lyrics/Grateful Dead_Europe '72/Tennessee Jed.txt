Tennessee Jed Lyrics
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

Rich man step on my poor head
When you get up, you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee


Drink all day and rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning and it, all it read:
"You better head back to Tennessee, Jed"
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee


I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
"Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed"

I woke up a-feeling mean
Went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned 'round and the letters read:
"Better head back to Tennessee, Jed"
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee



Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee1Embed
