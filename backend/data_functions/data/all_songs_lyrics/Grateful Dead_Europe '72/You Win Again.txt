You Win Again Lyrics
The news is out, all over town
That you've been seen out running around
I know that I should leave her there
I just can't go Lord, You win again

This heart of mine, could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
I just can't go Lord, You win again

What can I do Lord? You win againEmbed
