Ramble on Rose Lyrics
Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City, just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow

Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the sailor
One heat up, and one cool down, leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor

Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band
Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

Goodbye Mama and Papa, goodbye Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose
