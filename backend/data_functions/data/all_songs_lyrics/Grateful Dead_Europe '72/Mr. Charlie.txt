Mr. Charlie Lyrics
I take a little powder
Take a little salt
Put it in my shotgun
I go walking

Jubba jubba, wolly bully
Looking high, looking low
Going to scare you up and shoot ya
Mister Charlie told me so

I won't even take your life
Won't even take a limb
Just unload my shotgun
Take a little skin


Well you take my silver dollar
Take those silver dimes
Fix it up together
In some alligator wine
I can hear the drums, voodoo all night long
Mister Charlie tells me
I can't do nothing wrong

Now Mister Charlie told me
Won't you like to know
Give you little warning
Before I let you go


Going to scare you up and shoot ya
Mister Charlie
Mister Charlie told me soEmbed
