Odds Lyrics
Back and forth the same
Be careful how you frame
Your argument, your argument
We've been giving all we can
And it finally showed the end
Of our tolerance, our tolerance

I know it's hard to say
We'll throw it all away
But the odds are
We'll be better off
And it's a painful thought
To try another start
But the odds are
We'll be better off

Cast another vote
In our sad terminal
Democracy, democracy
The word is out on us
We have gone delirious
The floor is falling out from under us
It always does!
I know it's hard to say
We'll throw it all away
But the odds are
We'll be better off
And it's a painful thought
To try another start
But the odds are
We'll be better off

I know it's hard to say
We'll throw it all away
But the odds are
We'll be better off
And it's a painful thought
To try another start
But the odds are
We'll be better off
But the odds are
We'll be better off
But the odds are
We'll be better off, ohEmbed
