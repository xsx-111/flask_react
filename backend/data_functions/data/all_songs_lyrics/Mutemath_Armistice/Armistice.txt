Armistice Lyrics
Out of time and out of inclinations for warrin'
How's it feel to watch a man relentin'
Let's just say that I might be a sucker for progress
It's all in how you cope in spite of knowin'

You don't have to say it, I know
It's all my fault
You don't have to worry, I know
It's how we are
You don't have to say it, I know
It's all my fault
The give and take is taking its toll

It's an honest work if I can stand to own it
Maybe we're not as far apart as it appears
Swallowing the blame is second nature
I got to keep on handling my business my way

You don't have to say it, I know
It's all my fault
You don't have to worry, I know
It's how we are
You don't have to say it, I know
It's all my fault
The give and take is taking its toll
I know it's all my fault
I will take the fall if it takes us somewhere
I know it's all a bluff
I will take the fall if it takes us somewhere

The give and take, the give and take
The give and take is taking its toll
The give and take, the give and take
The give and take is taking its toll

You don't have to say it
You don't have to say it
You don't have to say it
You don't have to say itEmbed
