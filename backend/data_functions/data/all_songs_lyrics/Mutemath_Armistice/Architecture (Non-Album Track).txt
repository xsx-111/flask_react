Architecture (Non-Album Track) LyricsAre you not unaware of the signs your silence bears out loudly
So all these notes, the lucky dares to fill my spaces, lose my cares for speaking
How do I get lost inside the center of the thoughts when everybody's got a plot for me
How can I explain in a structure words cannot contain
There's no more slogans in the frame from me
There's no architecture, architecture
There's no architecture for how I feel
There's no architecture, there's no architecture
There's no architecture for how I feel
There's smoke, words become
Diplomats holding on to empty guns
They're out hunting
A tired love has found me
It can't be got
The mixture of the heart is free
All this building and building
There's no architecture, architecture
There's no architecture for how I feel
There's no architecture, there's no architecture
There's no, there's no architecture for how I feel
There's no architecture
There's no architecture
There's no architecture
How I feel
There ain't no architecture how I feel
