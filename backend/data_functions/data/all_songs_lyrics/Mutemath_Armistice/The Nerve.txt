The Nerve Lyrics
Can you believe this world's got the nerve to insist they won't trade for a better one?
Can you believe this world's yelling out in the dark it wants to be left alone?
Can you believe this world never would have had the chance without us giving it blood?
Can you believe this world lacks the common courtesy to thank us all for the love?

Set it on fire!
Set it on fire!
Set it on fire!
Set it on fire!
Set it on fire! 

Can you believe this world's like a glassy eyed swiller caught sipping another one?
Can you believe this world's like a tyrant taking over anything that it wants?
Can you believe this world's like a wounded martyr worried if his commitment is gone?
Can you believe this world's like a vagrant in the gutter talking nothing is wrong?


Can you believe this world's just a double dealing joker, going to stick to his guns?
Can you believe this world's just a television blaring, a million devils at once?
Can you believe this world's just a charmer in disguise with a lavender soul?
Can you believe this world's just exactly as we built it, running out of control?
