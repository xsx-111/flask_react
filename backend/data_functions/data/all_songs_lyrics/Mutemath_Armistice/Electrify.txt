Electrify Lyrics
She knows every little way to get the thing that she wants
My heart is an oven
And she's pushing the buttons right now
Right now
She's going to kill me with a stare and I'm very aware
No matter what I say
She's just walking away right now
But I'll be ready when she calls

I'm in love with this girl, that's got my head
Electrified
I hope that someday she might go too far
Go too far
'Cause all I can think about is me and her
Electrified
I hope that someday she might take me home
And lose control

Stall and wait is the game she plays
She knows better than to try
But I'm hoping she might wear down
Wear down
Oh it's just tearing me apart getting stuck in the dark
I'm doing what I can
But she can't understand right now
But I'll be ready when she calls
I'm in love with this girl, that's got my head
Electrified
I hope that someday she might go too far
Go too far
'Cause all I can think about is me and her
Electrified
I hope that someday she might take me home
And lose control

I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it running through my bones
Ohh
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it running through my bones
My bones
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel you running through my bones
Ohh
I feel you running through my bones
Yaaohhh

I'm in wires for you girl
You're coursing through my mind
All I think about is you
Yeah I'm electrified
I'm in love with this girl, that's got my head
Electrified
I hope that someday she might go too far
Go too far
'Cause all I can think about is me and her
Electrified
I hope that someday she might take me home
And lose control

Maybe sometime, sometime, sometime
Say that you are mine, show me, sometime
You got to electrify

I can feel it running through my bones
Ohh
Ya I can feel it running through my bones
Ohhaaa!Embed
