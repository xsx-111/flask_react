Clipping Lyrics
Feeling overload
Carrying bottled skies around
I've been drowning all along
Wearing out in a faltered sea
And I give up

Common sense failed again
Meddling in a foreign scene
Foreign dream
Time won't spare another sun
Daring me with another choice another choice
 
Anymore, I don't know who to fight anymore
I don't know what is right anymore, anymore

Anymore, I don't know how to feel anymore
I don't know what is real anymore, anymore
Anymore, I don't know who to trust anymore
I don't know what I want anymore, anymore
Anymore, I don't know who to blame anymore
I don't know what to say anymore, anymore
Anymore, I don't know what I want anymore
I just don't know anymoreEmbed
