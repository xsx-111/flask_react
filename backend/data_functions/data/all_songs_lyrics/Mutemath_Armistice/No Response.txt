No Response Lyrics
I won the gun fight in my head
I won the gun fight in my head
I gathered up thoughts left for dead
I won, I won
I buried my head in the sand
I buried my head in the sand
I want pretend I understand
I don't, I don't

And if it all is black and white
Then tell me what is wrong and right
I don't suppose that anybody knows
And maybe when we reach the end
We'll ask imaginary friends
"Why no response?"

I've spoken my peace in the dark
I've spoken my peace in the dark
I've spoken just like I was taught
I'm caught, I'm caught
I've noticed my sense in the cold
I've noticed my sense in the cold
I've noticed some wars getting old
I'm done, I'm doneEmbed
