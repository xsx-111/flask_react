Valium Lyrics
I'll take it slow now
And be alright, yeah we alright
Hold yourself together
Because I lost mine, yeah I lost mine
But it's alright

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Knee-jerk reactions
Causing trouble, causing trouble
Got my condition
In a scuffle, in a scuffle


I won't concern myself
Any longer, any longer
On how to recover
From a stall out, yeah a stall out
I'll keep singing

I want to fly tonight
It's alright, it's alright
Follow the open sky
It's alright, it's alrightEmbed
