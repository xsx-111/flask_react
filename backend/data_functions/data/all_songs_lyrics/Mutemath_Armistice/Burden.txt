Burden Lyrics
Crime in the currency
Fire down a bendin' wall
Or would you care to be
In all the gamblin' that got started
No one is better off
Hope is a candle lit night
No one is meant to be
On anything afloat

We just lie awake in a stolen thought
We lie awake and imagine what we are
We hide and wait for some golden star
And hope the dirt is wearin' off

Fall like a domino
Lob up another mistake
All of it's killing me
Let's find a bitter end and restart it
Love isn't what you want
Hold if you can't believe
Facin' a loaded gun
In time to take a look at
What's causin' all the fuss
We mustn't buckle all at once
We just lie awake in a stolen thought
We lie awake and imagine what we are
We hide and wait for some golden star
And hope the dirt is wearin' off
We just lie awake in a stolen thought
We lie awake and imagine what we are
We hide and wait for some golden star
And hope the dirt is wearin' off

I just can't hold it together
I just can't hold it together
I just can't hold it together
I just can't hold it together
I just can't
I just can't hold it together
I just can't
I just can't hold it together

We just lie awake in a stolen thought
We lie awake and imagine what we are
We hide and wait for some golden star
And hope the dirt is wearin' off
The devil is not the nature that is around us
But the nature that is within us allEmbed
