Spotlight Lyrics(Ahh Ahh, Ahh Ahh)

There ain't a whole lot left to say now
You knocked all your wind out
You just tried too hard and you froze
I know, I know
What do you say?
What do you say?

Just take the fall, you're one of us
The spotlight is on
(Ahh ahh)
Oh, the spotlight is on

You know the one thing you're fighting to hold
Will be the one thing you've got to let go
And when you feel the war cannot be won
You're going to die to try what can't be done
Go on and say, say it out that you don't care
Now is there nothing like that inside of you anywhere?

Oh, Just take the fall, you're one of us
The spotlight is on
(Ahh ahh)
Oh, the spotlight is on, yeah it's on
Because everyone would rather watch you fall (We're all in trouble)
And we all are, yeah (All in trouble)
And we all are, yeah (All in trouble)

Just take the fall, you're one of us
The spotlight is on
(Ahh ahh)
Oh, the spotlight is on
(Just take the fall)

Now you're one of us
Now you're (oh)
Now you're (oh)
Now you're (oh)
Now you're one of us
Now you're (oh)
Now you're (oh)
Now you're one of us
Oh, the spotlight is on
(Ahh ahh)6Embed
