Clockwork Lyrics
Time is a thief with a loaded gun
The sky runs by while the days are gone
The night falls prey to another sun
All like clockwork they won't stop
They won't stop
They won't stop
They won't stop, oh

Don't stand still, or we'll lose our ground
The world keeps spinning just to wear us down
Say what you must while we're still around
The days go to sleep but they won't stop
They won't stop
They won't stop
They won't stop

We never should allow another sun to set
On all the words that we have held so long
I know we'd rather sort it out once tomorrow comes
But tomorrow already happened

Time is a thief with a loaded gun
The sky rolls by while the days are gone
The night falls prey to another song
The days go to sleep but they won't stop, no
They won't stop
They won't stop
They won't stop, oh


We can wait for the sunrise
To say what should matter
We'll know by tomorrow
But tomorrow, tomorrow just happened
Today we have to make the most of love
Tomorrow we don't have a choice
All we ever get control of is now
Today we have to make the most of love
Tomorrow we don't have a choice
All we ever get control of is now

I know we'd rather sort it out once tomorrow comes
But tomorrow already happened, oh
I know we'd rather sort it out once tomorrow comes
But tomorrow already happenedEmbed
