Lost Year Lyrics
Hold on to the way we started
How it all should have gone
Somewhere love was disregarded
And it all came undone
Undone

Because nothings a breeze
We suffer we bleed
For two hearts to beat as one
We learn as we go
At least now we know
Something we can't become
Become

If a talk could really solve this
What are we fighting for?
Words hurt more then they arm us
Don't say anymore
Anymore

Because nothings a breeze
We suffer we bleed
For two hearts to beat as one
We learn as we go
At least now we know
Something we can't become
Become
Oh for a year we were strong and courageous
But we lost it somehow
Oh if there was something that could have saved us
We'd have found it by now

Because nothings a breeze
We suffer we bleed
For two hearts to beat as one
We learn as we go
At least now we know
Something we can't become
Become

There's no luck
In our lives
No living under starlight
No sight
In your eyes
To keep us from running around in circles anymore
Whoaaa

Hold on to the way we started
How it all should have goneEmbed
