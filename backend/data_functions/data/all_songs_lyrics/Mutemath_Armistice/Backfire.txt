Backfire Lyrics
Please tell me why are we trying so hard
Why worry?
It's over
We always fall right back
To where we start

There goes another one of our
Sure-fired plans
It backfired again
We try to think it through
The best that we can
I bet it's going to backfire again

Take what is given you
How does that sound?
Everything is all thought through and fool-proof
Now watch it all crumble down and down again

There goes another one of our
Sure-fired plans
It backfired again
We try to think it through
The best that we can
I bet it's going to backfire again
Knives don't carry laws that vary
They're just what we fall on
Self-made coffins, scars are talking
Tell us where we are
Where we are now (Where we are now)
Where we are now (Where we are now)
They all, they all, they all are talkin'
They all, they all, they all will tell another story

There goes another one of our
Sure-fired plans
It backfired again
We try to think it through
The best that we can
I bet it's going to backfire againEmbed
