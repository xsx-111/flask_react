Goodbye Lyrics
You don't have to try
Running from each other
I read your eyes
You don't have to bother
Maybe we'll survive
If we don't discover
One life ties to another

Because the world won't turn
If the sun won't rise
And the stars won't burn
In a broken sky
And the wind won't surf
If the ocean's dry
And my heart won't work
If you say goodbye

If you say goodbye
If you say goodbye
If you say goodbye
My heart's in trouble

I'd rather die
Holding one another
Your hand in mine
It's easy and it's not for
Understanding why
The world is out of color
One life ties to another


Oh, before it never mattered at all
Oh, before it never mattered at allEmbed
