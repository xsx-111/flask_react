Pharaohs LyricsBoy I need a gold crown
Boy I need a gold crown
Boy I need a gold crown
Boy I need a gold crown
We're. On. A. Mission dust the stars. Light through dark
Blue. Gold. Shine. Fly. Seated at the opposite so you can see there is no time
Breath. Slow. Be. Low
Capacity is unfulfilled take-the-take-the lead you will
Head. Raised. Un-caged
More to do there's more for you
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharoahs. God. Golden
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharoahs. God. Kings and queens
Be-yond a system shaped with our gold radar
Fools. Know. Bright. Eyes
Rested at the opposite when you can really see through minds
Be slow. Real glow. Boy don't seem the fire will. Taste of what you feel
Head raised. Un-caged
More to do there's more for you
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharoahs. God. Golden
All I see is you. Stars. Open. Arms. Pharoahs. God. Kings and queens
Breath. Slow. Be. Low
Capacity is unfulfilled. Take the lead you will
Head. Raised. Un-caged
More to do there's more for you
Boy I-I need me a gold-en crown
Boy I-I need me a gold-en crown
Boy I-I need me a gold-en crown
Boy I-I need me a gold-en crown
All I see is you. Stars. Wide open Open-arms. Pharoahs. God. Golden
All I see is you. Stars. Wide open Open-arms. Pharoahs. God. Kings and queens
All I see is you. Stars. Wide open Open-arms. Pharoahs. God. Golden
All I see is you. Stars. Wide open Open-arms. Pharoahs. God. Kings and queens3Embed
