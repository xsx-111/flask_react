Sanctuary Lyrics
If I couldn't love you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down
If I couldn't turn you around
Maybe I can hold you back
If I couldn't love you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down...
If I couldn't love you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down
If I couldn't turn you around
Maybe I can hold you back
If I couldn't love you, baby
Maybe I can hold you down...

If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby
If I get to know you, baby4Embed
