Living Like I Do LyricsTime, oh time
Got sucked into a culture living like you do
Spending by the hour living like you do
Can't make ends meet living like you do
This life will turn you sober living like you do
And the tension builds
As the tension builds } x4
Up in you, oh, up in you, oh, up in you, oh...up in you (you you)
Living without worries need some space to move
Move in such a hurry .. so much time to lose
Staring out my window were so married too
Reflecting from the faint glow staring back at you
Think the best has passed, think the best has
Think the best has passed, think the best has passed
Passed for you, yeah passed for you, yeah passed for you, yeah passed for you
Now the tension, now the tension builds, as the tension build, as the tension builds
Up in you, up in you, up in you
Up in you
I need another in my life, a whole
I need another in my life, a whole
I need another in my life, a whole
Ohh I need another in my life, a whole. } x2
(got sucked into a)
I need another in my life, a whole
(got living like a)
I need another in my life, a whole
(i made you a)
I need another in my life, a whole
(got nothing let to)
I need another in my life, a whole. } x2
Got sucked into a culture living like I do
Can't make ends meet living like I do } x3
Living like I do } x3
Living like, living like I do
Living like...living like I doEmbed
