Right Thing to Do Lyrics
Walking alone I'm in the red lines
Trying to find, find the right time
Walking alone I'm in the red lines
Trying to find, find the right time
Walking alone I'm in the red lines
Trying to find, find the right time
Walking alone I'm on the wrong side
Try'na find, find the right lines

Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them
Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them

Walking alone with my eyes shut
On my own won't be giving up
Walking alone won't mean i'll come for you
Time runs when there's no truth
Such a hurricane, such a hurtin pain
Trapped in my soul and I can't explain
Such a hurricane, such a hurtin pain
Trapped in my soul and I can't explain
Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them
Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them

(Won't me I'll come for you)
(Time runs when there's no truth)
(Won't me I'll come for you)
(Time runs when there's no truth)

Such a hurricane, such a hurtin pain
Trapped in my soul and I can't explain
Such a hurricane, such a hurtin pain
Trapped in my soul and I can't explain

Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them
Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them
Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them
Let me eat all these lies up
Let me hide, let me hide them
Such a hurricane, such a hurtin pain
Trapped in my soul and I can't explain
Such a hurricane, such a hurtin pain
Trapped in my soul and I can't explain1Embed
