Something Goes Right LyricsYeah something goes right
Yeah something goes right
Yeah something goes right
And you're hoping that it goes right
That it goes right
That it goes right ooh
You wouldn't even hold
You wouldn't even care
You wouldn't even know, you wouldn't even care
But I've been in the dark
I've been in the dark
I've been in the dark
Standing in dream world
Sitting next to you
Up in the clouds
Up up in the clouds
Up up in the clouds
Sitting on the edge
Looking down at the end road
Looking up into space
Up up into space
Up up into space
Is it better to let you go
Or is better to let you know
That you should t t t t take it
That you should t t t t take it back
Is it better to let you go
Or is better to let you know
That you should t t t t take it
That you should t t t t take it back
I've only got my self self self to blame
Lots I'm thinking things will never change
These feelings flooding back still still remain
I was always hurt
And I've been feeling like this most, most of my life, woaah
I've been feeling like
Things ain't gonna change
Things ain't gonna get that better
Is it better to let you go
Or is it better to let you know
That you should t t t t take it
That you should t t t t take it back
Is it better to let you go
Or is it better to let you know
That you should t t t t take it
That you should t t t t take it back
I keep on having these conversations
And p p p p praying
I keep on staring at these constellations
And p p p p praying
And it's a bitch the thoughts that keep escaping
I wish that they were staying
And something will go right, go right
And something will go right, go right
Don't you break it down
Don't you bring me down
Don't you bring me down
Don't you break it down
Don't you bring me down
Don't you bring me down
Is it better to let you go
Or is it better to let you know
That you should t t t t take it
That you should t t t t take it back
Is it better to let you go
Or is it better to let you know
That you should t t t t take it
That you should t t t t take it back

Yeah something goes right
Yeah something goes right
Something goes right
And you're hoping that it goes right
That it goes right
That it goes right
You wouldn't even hold
You wouldn't even care
You wouldn't even know, you wouldn't even care
But I've been in the dark
I've been in the dark
I've been in the dark
Standing in dream world
Sitting next to you
Up in the clouds
Up up in the clouds
Up up in the clouds
Sitting on the edge
Looking down at the end road
Up into space
Up up into space
Up up into space4Embed
