Never Never Lyrics
It’s complicated when you gravitate towards yourself
On the other hand, it’s hard to talk to anyone else
You can't help, can't help where your mind goes
So let's harvest on the moon with the autumn snow

Cause I've never, never had so much to gain
And threw it all away
And if I ever, ever had the chance again
I'd probably do the same
Singing ooooh, I've only let you down
Singing ooooh, I've left you the crown

Open up, open up to see your, see your face
Watching yourself in your dreams like wide awake
Hoping, hoping you'll return my calls
Convince myself for my health that it's not my fault

Cause I've never, never had so much to gain
And threw it all away
And if I ever, ever had the chance again
I'd probably do the same
Singing ooooh, I've only let you down
Singing ooooh, I've left you the crown
Ahhhhh
Ooooh
Ahhhhh
Ooooohh

No one ever had so much to gain or so much to lose
No one ever had so much to gain or so much to lose
No one ever had so much to gain or so much to lose

If I ever had, if I ever had, if I ever had, if I ever had another

See I've never, never had so much to gain
And threw it all away
And if I ever, ever had the chance again
I'd probably do the same
Singing ooooh, I've only let you down
Singing ooooh, I've left you the crown

See I've never never had so much to gain
Or had so much to lose
And if I ever ever get past the shame
And get through the bruises
Singing ooooh, I've only let you down
Singing ooooh, I've left you the crown7Embed
