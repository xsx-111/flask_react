Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me) Lyrics
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!

I'm enlisting, overseas aid
Need assisting, help with a maid
Get the expert on mademoiselles
He could diffuse any bombshell

If I could only be tough like him
Then I could win my own small battle of the sexes

And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And make the girl mine, wave the victory sign

Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
I'm invading territories
Girls are foreign and strange to me
Get the expert at kissing and stuff
Well, he stays easy when things get rough

If I could only be tough like him
Then I could win my own small battle of the sexes

And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And make the girl mine, wave the victory sign

Sometimes relationships don't go as planned
Some girls can make themselves so cold
A no man's land

If I could only be tough like him
Then I could win my own small battle of the sexes
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
And Sgt. Rock is going to help me
Make the girl mine, keep her stood in line
Make the girl mine, wave the victory sign

Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey, rock, rock!
Hey!Embed
