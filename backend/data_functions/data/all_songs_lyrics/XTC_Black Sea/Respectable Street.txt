Respectable Street Lyrics
It's in the order of their hedgerows
It's in the way their curtains open and close
It's in the look they give you down their nose
All part of decency's jigsaw, I suppose

Heard the neighbor slam his car door
Don't he realize this is Respectable Street?
What d'you think he bought that car for?
'Cause he realized this is Respectable Street

Now they talk about abortions
In cosmopolitan proportions to their daughters
As they speak of contraception
And immaculate receptions on their portable
Sony Entertainment Centers

Heard the neighbor slam his car door
Don't he realize this is Respectable Street?
What d'you think he bought that car for?
'Cause he realized this is Respectable Street

Now she speaks about diseases
And which sex position pleases best her old man
Avon lady fills the creases
When she manages to squeeze in past the caravans
That never move from their front gardens
Heard the neighbor slam his car door
Don't he realize this is Respectable Street?
What d'you think he bought that car for?
'Cause he realized this is Respectable Street

It's in the order of their hedgerows
It's in the way their curtains open and close
It's in the look they give you down their nose
All part of decency's jigsaw, I suppose

Sunday church and they look fetching
Saturday night, saw him retching over our fence
Bang the wall for me to turn down
I can see them with their stern frown as they dispense
The kind of look that says they're perfect

Heard the neighbor slam his car door
Don't he realize this is Respectable Street?
What d'you think he bought that car for?
'Cause he realized this is Respectable Street

He realized this is Respectable Street
He realized this is Respectable Street
He realized this is Respectable StreetEmbed
