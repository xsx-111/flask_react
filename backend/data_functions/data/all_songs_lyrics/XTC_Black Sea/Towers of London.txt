Towers of London Lyrics
Towers of London
When they had built you
Did you watch over the men who fell?
Towers of London
When they had built you
Victoria's gem found in somebody's hell

Pavements of gold leading to the underground
Grenadier Guardsmen walking pretty ladies around
Fog is the sweat of the never-never navies who pound
Pound, pound, pound, pound
Spikes in the rails to their very own heaven

Towers of London
When they had built you
Did you watch over the men who fell?
Towers of London
When they had built you
Victoria's gem found in somebody's hell

Bridges of muscles spanning so long and high
Merchants from Stepney walking pretty ladies by
Rain is the tears of the never-never navies who cry
For the bridge that doesn't go in the direction of Dublin
Towers of London
When they had built you
Did you watch over the men who fell?
Towers of London
When they had built you
Victoria's gem found in somebody's hell

And I've seen it in a painting
And I've seen it in engraving
And I've seen it in their faces
Clear as children's chalk lines on the paving


And I've seen it in a painting
And I've seen it in engraving
And I've seen it in their faces
Clear as children's chalk lines on the paving

Towers of London
When they had built you
Did you watch over the men who fell?
Towers of London
When they had built you
Victoria's gem found in somebody's hell
Towers of London
Towers of London
Towers of London
Towers of London
