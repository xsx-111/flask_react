Paper and Iron (Notes and Coins) LyricsPaper, iron, won't buy Eden
Working for paper and for iron
Work for the right to keep my tie on
Working for paper and for iron
Work for the unicorn and lion
I pray the kids aren't starving
No chicken for the Sunday carving
I'll stay for one more farthing
I take home my notes and coins every week
I'm told I'm worth much more
But the church says turn the other cheek
The other cheek
Paper, iron, won't buy Eden
Working for paper and for iron
Work for the right to keep my tie on
Working for paper and for iron
Work for the unicorn and lion
I know the family needs me
Can't moan, the factory feeds me
Won't bite the hand that bleeds me
I take home my notes and coins every week
I'll inherit the earth, I'm told
But the church says to remain this meek
Remain this meek
Paper, iron, won't buy Eden
I'm still a proud man
Won't show anybody else my wage
A blend in the crowd man
Is this anybody's golden age?
Is this anybody's golden age?
Is this anybody's golden age?
Or am I dreaming of a golden cage?
La, la, lo, it's paper
La, la, lo, and iron
La, la, lo, just paper
La, la, lo, just iron
Working for paper and for iron
Work for the right to keep my tie on
Working for paper and for iron
Work for the unicorn and lion
I pray the kids aren't starving
No chicken for the Sunday carving
I'll stay for one more farthing
I take home my notes and coins
Paper, iron, won't buy Eden
(Working for paper and for iron)
Paper, iron, won't buy Eden
(Working for paper and for iron)
Paper, iron, won't buy Eden
(Working for paper and for iron)Embed
