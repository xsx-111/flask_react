Living Through Another Cuba LyricsLiving through another Cuba
It's 1961 again and we are piggy in the middle
Living through another Cuba
While war is polishing his drum and peace plays second fiddle
Living through another Cuba
Russia and America are at each other's throats but don't you cry
Living through another Cuba
Just on your knees and pray and while you're down there, kiss your arse goodbye
Living through another Cuba
We're the bulldog on the fence while others play their tennis overhead
Living through another Cuba
It's hardly love all and somebody might wind up red or dead
Living through another Cuba
Pour some oil on the water quick, it doesn't really matter where from
Living through another Cuba
He love me, he loves me not, he's pulling fins from an atom bomb
Living through another Cuba
This phenomenon happens every 20 years or so
Living through another Cuba
If they're not careful, your watch won't be the only thing with a radioactive glow
Living through another Cuba
I'll stick my fingers in my ears and hope they make it up before too late
Living through another Cuba
If we get through this lot alright, they're due for replay, 19983Embed
