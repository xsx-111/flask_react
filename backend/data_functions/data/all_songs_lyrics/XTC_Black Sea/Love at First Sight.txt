Love at First Sight Lyrics
See the lovers, all gone crazy
Looking for romance, it seems
Many sleepless nights will follow
Some may lose but some succeed

Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love

Make a play of lust intention
Only just one thing in mind
Make a slip, could be forever
Wedding bells, the shotgun kind

Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love

Mouse takes the bait
As soon as he leaves his seat
There's no escape
Very soon, their eyes will meet
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love

Mouse takes the bait
As soon as he leaves his seat
There's no escape
Very soon, their eyes will meet

Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love

Take your partner to surrender
Then your misdemeanor's done
Sacrifice of maidenhood
But little boys must have their fun
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, love
Love at first sight
What they want is, hey oh, loveEmbed
