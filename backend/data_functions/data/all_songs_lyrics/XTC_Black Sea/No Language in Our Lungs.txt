No Language in Our Lungs Lyrics
There is no language in our lungs
To tell the world just how we feel
No, no, no, no, no, no bridge of thought
No mental link
No letting out just what you think

There is no language in our lungs
Lungs, lungs, lungs

There is no muscle in our tongues
To tell the world what's in our hearts
No, no, no, no, no, we're leaving nothing behind
Just chiseled stones
No chance to speak before we're bones

There is no muscle in our tongues
Tongues, tongues, tongues


I thought I had the whole world in my mouth
I thought I could say what I wanted to say
For a second, that thought became a sword in my hand
I could slay any problem that would stand in my way
I felt just like a crusader
Lionheart, a Holy Land invader
But nobody can say what they really mean to say
And the impotency of speech came up and hit me that day
And I would have made this instrumental
But the words got in the way

There is no language in our...

There is no language in our lungs
To tell the world what's in our hearts
No, no, no, no, no, we're leaving nothing behind
Just chiseled stones
No chance to speak before we're bones

There is no language in our lungs
Lungs, lungsEmbed
