Travels in Nihilon Lyrics
You've learnt no lessons
All that time so cheaply spent
There's no youth culture
Only masks they let you rent

Travels, travels in Nihilon
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
We've seen no Jesus come and gone
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

Fashion, their vampire
Drapes itself across your back
As you fall from style
It weighs rebirth on its rack

Travels, travels in Nihilon
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
We've seen no Jesus come and gone
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

Building your whimsy
Hypnotizing you to need
Dance goes full circle
One step ahead of your greed

Travels, travels in Nihilon
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
We've seen no Jesus come and gone
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior

You've learnt no lessons
All those years to get it right
Flashes of promise
Burn out faster than strobe light

Travels, travels in Nihilon
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
We've seen no Jesus come and gone
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
Travels, travels in Nihilon
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warrior
We've seen no Jesus come and gone
A war, a war, a warrior, a warrior, a warriorEmbed
