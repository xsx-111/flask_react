I Want You Lyrics
Take me back to the place where I
Loved that girl for all time
Why must life just take away
Every good thing one at a time?

I want it back, well, yes, I want it back
Well, yes, I want you back, please, give it me back
'Cause I want you, love

How can I not even cry
For such a big thing in my life?
The pain, it takes the heart of me
To turn around and say goodbye

I want it back, well, yes, I want it back
Well, yes, I want you back, please, give it me back
'Cause I want you

How did you do it, females?
'Cause always you do it, angels
You always keep me on the run
So how did you do it, angels?
And always you do it, females
You always keep me on the run

I want it back, well, yes, I, I want it back
Yes, I want you back, please, give it me back
'Cause I want you, love
But I can't let myself love youEmbed
