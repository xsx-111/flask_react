See the World Lyrics
Do you want to see the world?
Do you want to see the world?
Do you want to see the world in a different way? Yeah
Do you want to see the world?
Do you want to see the world?
Do you want to see the world in a different way?

I remember how we used to sing
Writing poems in your bed sit
Finding time to be the passenger
But there you were, you never saw me leave

But there you go, you're sailing away
And you know you never come away
Yeah, but you should, you never lie to me
Yeah, but I will, you never come away
Yeah, but you should

What do you really want to see?
What do you really want to see?
What do you really want see on your television screen?
I remember how we used to be
Without the world upon our TV
Well, let it lie or you can take it back
Or wrap your life around evil's track

But there you go, you're sailing away
But there you go
And you know you never come away
Yeah, but you should, you never lie to me
Yeah, but I will, you never come away
Yeah, but you should

Well, do you want to see the world? (What, what?)
Do you want to see the world? (What, what?)
Well, do you want to see the? (What, what, what?)
Well do you want to see the world? (What, what, what?)
Well, do you want to see the world? (What, what, what?)
I know I do
Yeah, do you want to see the world? (What, what, what?)
I know I do
Well, do you really want to? (What, what?) I know I do
Well, do you really want to? (What, what?) I know I do
Well, do you really want to see?
I know I do, I know I do, I know I doEmbed
