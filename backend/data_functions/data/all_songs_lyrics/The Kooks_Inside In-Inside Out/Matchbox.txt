Matchbox Lyrics
Viciously, she sleeps and walks along her lonely beat
She trips, falls into it all and I wish I’d bite my lip
And crawl up away from you, my little one
Oh, from you, my little one

Don’t come too close, you don’t wanna see my ghost
You’re rotten but I’m betrayed by you, my sweetheart
And don’t you think that you went too far?
Do you want to see my heart bleed?
For you, you and him, him and you, you know my heart bleeds

All of us, we’re going out tonight
We’re gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we’re gonna steal your skies
All of us, we’re going out tonight
We’re gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, they’re gonna steal your

I’m sorry that I let you go
I let you down, I let you down, my dear
I always seem to play these games with you, my dear
I always, s-s-s-so
I always, so
All of us, we’re going out tonight
We’re gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we’re gonna steal your skies
All of us, we’re going out tonight
We’re gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, they’re gonna steal your skies

Oh, oh, my Juliet, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I’ll never betray you, my love
Oh, oh, my Juliet
I’ll never betray you, my love

All of us, we’re going out tonight
We’re gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we’re gonna steal your skies
All of us, we’re going out tonight
We’re gonna walk all over your cars
The Kooks are out in the street
Oh, we’re gonna steal your skies
And don’t come too close, you don’t wanna see my ghost
You’re rotten but I’m betrayed by you, my sweetheart1Embed
