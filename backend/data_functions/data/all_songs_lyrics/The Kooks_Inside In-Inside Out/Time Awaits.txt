Time Awaits Lyrics
And time waits for no man but you
And time waits for no man but you
Hold on and don't leave this town
Hold on and don't leave this town

Here we are with art in our hands
They tear you down 'cause they don't understand
You tried it once again to love me better
She tore those panties down and loved me wetter

Oh, woah-oh-oh
And life comes in twos and threes and fours
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And I hear you knocking at my door

To hold them down with blood on your hands
Is past the point where you don't understand
The worst you do is lie when you run for shelter
So cast aside these chains and love me better

Oh, woah-oh-oh
And life comes in twos and threes and fours
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And I hear you knocking at my door
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And life comes in twos and threes and fours
Oh, woah-oh-oh
And I hear you knocking at my door

I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or more
I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or more
I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or more
I hear you knocking at my door, darling, twenty times or moreEmbed
