Sofa Song Lyrics
Well, city freeze for I just realised I don't like you
Me and my girl are going out for some air
And I will do my best just to get under her dress
And catch you out if I can on the other side of my sofa

Won't you come on over the other side of my sofa?
Oh, won't you come on over?

The city heated up
It got blurry cause I'd had enough
And he tried to take your soul
But didn't realise you keep it in a different hole

Won't you come on over the other side of my sofa?
Oh, won't you come on over?

So here he comes, a man with a loaded gun
I don't know if he wants my soul or my cash flow
I suppose I don't know
So here he comes, a man with a loaded gun
I don't know if he wants my girl's heart or her pearls, oh
I suppose I don't know
I suppose I don't know
I suppose I don't know
I suppose I don't know
I suppose I don't know
I suppose I don't know4Embed
