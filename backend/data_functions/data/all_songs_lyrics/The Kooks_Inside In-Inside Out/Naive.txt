Naive Lyrics
I'm not saying it was your fault
Although you could have done more
Oh, you're so naïve yet so
How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
Is such an ugly word for something so beautiful
Oh, that every time I look inside

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be, well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be, she's still out to get me

I may say it was your fault
Because I know you could have done more
Oh, you're so naïve, yet so
How could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, and your sweet and pretty face
Is such an ugly word for something so beautiful
Will die every time I look inside
I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
And true or false, it may be, well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be, she's still out to get me

So how could this be done
By such a smiling sweetheart?
Oh, you're so naïve, yet so
Is such an ugly thing for someone so beautiful
I'll die every time you're on his side

I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be, well, she's still out to get me
And I know she knows that I'm not fond of asking
True or false, it may be, she's still out to get me

Just don't let me down, just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite
Just don't let me down, just don't let me down
Hold on to your kite, hey, girl, hold on
Just don't let me down, just don't let me down
Hold on to this kite, let it go
Just don't let me down, just don't let me down54Embed
