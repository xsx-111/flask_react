She Moves in Her Own Way Lyrics
So at my show on Monday, I was hoping someday
You'd be on your way to better things
It's not about your make-up or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey
So now you pour your heart out, you're telling me you're far out
But not about to lie down for your cause
But you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man moving on to better things

Well, uh-oh, oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
Well, uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day

And at the show on Tuesday, she was in her mind, see
Tempered furs and spangled boots
Looks are deceiving, make me believe it
And these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey, yeah
So won't you go far, tell them you're a keeper
Not about to lie down for your cause
And you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man moving on to better things
Well, uh-oh, oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
Well, uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day

Yes, I wish that we never made it there through all the summers
And kept them up instead of kicking us back down to the suburbs
Yes, I wish that we never made it there through all the summers
And kept them up instead of kicking us back down to the suburbs

But uh-oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
But uh-oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day
But uh-oh, oh, I love her because she moves in her own way
But uh-oh, oh, she came to my show just to hear about my day16Embed
