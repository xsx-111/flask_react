Jackie Big Tits Lyrics
I'd like to say that I was on your mind
So I phone you at ten past three in the afternoon
It's evening for you and another bare hotel room
So hard to believe that you're dreaming of me too, but it's true

You only go around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round

But Amsterdam, I never knew you so well
The stadium rings with laughter at every turn
And flying pianos, of all things, to set your scene
I'm such a nice man to you, but so obscene and it's true, girl

You only go around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round

Jackie Big Tits is hiding in the corner
"Respect" is the word she shouts as I implore her
To speak to the man, not me, for I was only speaking freely
And interrupt me once more and I'll take you to the cleaners
You can't push me around, 'round, 'round
You can't push me around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round
You only go around, 'round, 'round
