Seaside Lyrics
Do you want to go to the seaside?
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go
I fell in love at the seaside
I handled my charm with time and sleight of hand
Do you want to go to the seaside?
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go
I fell in love at the seaside
She handled her charm with time and sleight of hand, and oh

But I'm just trying to love you any kind of way
But I find it hard to love you, girl, when you're far away
Away

Do you want to go to the seaside?
I'm not trying to say that everybody wants to go
But I found love on the seaside
On the seaside, in the seaside15Embed
