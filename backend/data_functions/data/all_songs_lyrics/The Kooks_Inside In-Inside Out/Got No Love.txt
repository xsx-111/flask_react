Got No Love Lyrics
You, you ain't got no love today
You, you ain't got no love today
Don't let them bring me down

You, you ain't got no love today
Don't let them bring me down
Hold on, don't let them bring you down
Hold on, don't let them bring you down

Don't let them bring me down
Don't let them bring me down
Got no love
Got no loveEmbed
