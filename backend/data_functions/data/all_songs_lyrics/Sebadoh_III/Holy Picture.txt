Holy Picture Lyrics
Now's the time to melt to walls
Needles and pins and a voodoo doll
With you, I'll gladly overdose
One march to snow, the heavens know

Bring me through your please-me groove
Lost, bitter, pain is flowing through
She's just a flower choked by weeds
I've got to try to cure my need

Obsessed with selection, I'm a boy with horns
An eyeful of reflection, I know no form
Change the infusion, do it alone
Land jeeps stammering, disrupt the flow

Close to death, foolish and trashed
Heart drawn in ashes, drink down another glass
I wish that I couldn't stand
We could put this cyclone in a trance

Believe you angelic one, my nerves are tried
I aim to conquer and divide
I see the holy picture to know
Maybe a werewolf chewin' on your bones
Wondering forever, uncertain of my health
Like me I saw you hiding, drowning in yourself
Scrambling my heart, trembling a laugh
You can't fool me, you're no pussycatEmbed
