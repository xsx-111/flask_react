Hassle Lyrics
One, two

I used to be an angry guy
But I've grown beyond that now
I'm going to be somebody's baby tonight

As long as I'm singing
And that big bell keeps on ringing
I'm sure my life outside is out of sight

No more homosexual hassles
Life among the grownups is in full swing
But I'm not a swinger forever
I fully desire what I already have

No more psychosexual battles
Life above the hung-up is my new thing
And I'm going to keep it together

I'm a walking invitation
But no one invites me
I want to be excited
But no one will excite me
No one dare invite me
'Cause I'm waiting for you
No one could excite me
Any more than you

Still inside
I'm a healthy blue
'Cause I'm not complete
With these thoughts of you

Nothing satisfies me
When I'm thinking of you
No one could excite me
Any more than you

I have the truth, I held you
Loved you so sincere
Through all the shit-stained curtains
Our love was really quite clear

But all that you left me
Is the empty need
But I hurt you more evil
Before you hurt me
'Cause nothing satisfies me
When I'm thinking of you
No one could excite me
Anymore than you

You are the inspiration
Evil prince, I fear
That's not the truth
Rock-hard life lying right here
It's just a lie I told, ohEmbed
