Spoiled Lyrics
Spoiled children soon to fall
Freedom is the lie we live
We will wait for tragedy
And scatter helpless to the fire

Sorry for ourselves
Sorry for the things we've seen
No one cries for help
Waiting for the fire

When all our toys are broken
All these empty urges must be satisfied
Acted outside
Precious strength to turn the game to history

Giving up, I'm blown away
He said all I had to say
The final days have come and gone
Safe inside is nothing wrong

Nothing in these words
Sorry force of habit
Could it be way over my head?
Helpless to describe it
Could it be way over my head?
Helpless to describe it
Could it be way over my head?
Helpless to describe it

Dumb and cruel
Cut before it's grown
Rhyme so forced in bored control
It learned all that it cares to know1Embed
