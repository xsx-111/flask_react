Limb by Limb LyricsI'm moving on, plowing through
A violent landscape
Candlelight, oh, Devil Bride
Crisp until you break
Well I give so the ranks in fear
You could not mystify
Limb by limb, I'll feed you in
I, the Serpent in the tide
From haunted dreams her bloke did speak
"To expand is to slay"
A tunnel to infinity, dazzling all the way
Radiant matter's bouncing out, thunder purified
Truer than sides, sees the lie
Laughter in the sky
There's a cry ringing out o'er land and sea
Star-crossed our weary hearts
Absorbed for light, he set us free
Walk so weak, too stoned to speak
I keep it to myself
Don't fuck with me, I'm hovering
I'm higher than hellEmbed
