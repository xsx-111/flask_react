Downmind Lyrics
I feed on you
You feed on me
When we agree
It's good to be bold
When you act frightened
I'll make you feel stupid
'Cause nothing's more stupid
Than thinking I'm evil
But if you smile
Then I'll smile too
There's nothing better to do

I'm just me, listen to me
A old All-American original

You're down in the mind
And don't say I don't see
You're treating me badly
It's pulling me downmind
Can't bring me downmind
Sorry-sack downmind
You're not an only
Fully true sad man
Though I may seem
A flaming total bitch
I'm a special friend
I'm just me, listen to me
A old All-American original

You're not the cool-cool
You're just a scared fool
Thinking I'm evil
And sure of your sickness
Sick just to follow
Follower gutless
Mistaken for goodness
And pulling me downmind
Down in the mind
You're sick in the soul
You're treating me nicely
It's pulling me downmind

(I'm just me)
I'm just me, listen to me
A old All-American originalEmbed
