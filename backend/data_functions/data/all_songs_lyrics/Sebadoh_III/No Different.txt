No Different Lyrics
There is no soul
It’s an everlasting tease
In scared control
Patterned easy, pleasing
Why try to understand?
It’s never meant to be understood
Logic is the bottomless pit
A no-cure find, questions behind
Take what you can
Cut out the heart
Who could ever blame you, man?
Nothing’s fair
We’re all doomed from the start

No different for us
No different for us
We’re just like the others
No different for us

Can’t stop the change
The change can’t stop
Though we leave our souls
For a hopeful trust
It’s different for us
It’s different for us
We will survive the change
It’s different for us

It’s not cool to fall in love
Scared and desperate in this life
Safer, cool to judge outside
Oh, to be complaining, cool
Never cool, though too excitable
All that we will ever be
They don’t have to feel the pain we feel
Master, judge, be sure
Decide what’s real
I don’t have to cry
To make this realEmbed
