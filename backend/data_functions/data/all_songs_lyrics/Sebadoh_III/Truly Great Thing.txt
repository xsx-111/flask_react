Truly Great Thing Lyrics
1, 2

Make it easy and I’ll hold it against you
I’m on a string dangled right in front of you
Make it hard and I’ll run away
Keep tomorrow as I kill today
Trying to figure just what I deserve
Slashing lines all across the earth
Patience only makes the dream come true
Everything I see, I hold to you

Tell me, this is it, the truly great thing
The love you’ve hoped to find
Any doubt will simply wipe itself out
As we’re rising deeper the first and last time

Lift me up and drop me down again
Every day I feel confusion, pain
And love is what we’ve all been waiting for
Something powerful to smash it all apart
Can’t love if you’re locked up tight
The dream of perfection, nothing ever seems right
All the world will tell you, you’re all wrong
Big, big deal if you’re wrong

This is it, the truly great thing
The love you’ve hoped to find
And any doubt will simply wipe itself out
To rising deeper the first and last timeEmbed
