Total Peace Lyrics
All I need is one true friend
I want total peace of mind
To leave the hurting world behind

I'm not scared, I swear, I'm free
It may collapse the fear
That burns to bring the worst from me

Much too smart to sound uptight
Not to cheat what I deserve
Nothing hidden and nothing wasted
So far from dead, frustrated

Too smart to ask for more
This is all I've waited for
Nothing hidden and nothing wasted
Nothing past the love I've tasted

It's wrong but right, magic change
I finally hurt to live on up to this name
Not right, it never changes
When finally hurt to live on up to this thingEmbed
