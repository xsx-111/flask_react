God Told Me Lyrics
This land is very small
A bummy scrawl where people crawl
America's the greatest way
I'm counting thoughts, I'm counting days

I know it's true
'Cause God told me to tell it to you
I know it's true
A god told me to tell it to you

This metal cuts my skin
America has eaten my cousin
Green boots and a hard green helmet
I feel so bad 'cause I'm left and spent

I know it's true
'Cause God told me to tell it to you
I know it's true
A god told me to tell it to you

A god told me to tell it to you
A god told me to tell it to you
A god told me to tell it to you
A god told me to tell it to youEmbed
