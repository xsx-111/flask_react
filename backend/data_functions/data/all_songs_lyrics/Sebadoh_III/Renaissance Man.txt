Renaissance Man Lyrics
Post-hardcore, pre-apocalyptic
Science-fiction, drone-loving
Renaissance man

Oh, what is true? What is real?
No bullshit, brother
Pot-smoking, Renaissance man

Wasted effort to stand up
Real things happen when you're down
Soul core worship, whirling sound

Brother, make a list, pierce your dick
Future tribal-thought and rebel
Greedy Renaissance man

Backbeat bloody conviction
Power-sludge storm sucking down

Violence is cool
One of two things real
Violence is free for all
Live for revenge, ideal
Don't wimp out, kill the pig
There is no doubt, kill the pig
Post-hardcore, hard ass
Intellectual, drone-loving
