Kath Lyrics
I’m so glad I waited for this
Every nervous moment worth it
Every anxious wave rode through
To find me lying safe with you

All too right, righteous coward
Chicken-head waiting for a storm in paradise
Push, whine, push to gripe to her at me
We killed the jealous, killed the judgment right

I’m so glad the wait is through
I’m so glad I waited for youEmbed
