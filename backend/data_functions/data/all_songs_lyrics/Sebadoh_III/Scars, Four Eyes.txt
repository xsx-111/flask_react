Scars, Four Eyes LyricsTrailing on next to sick
Only broken magic sticks
Evil pins never snare
Figured out how to get nowhere
Flying lead-filled flapping gills
Phantom God in frozen time
Comfort crawls into flight
Wait for men grown, thunder dying
Free toes roost on dancing wire
Puzzling out a selfish high
Commandment of meadow mouse
Kiss the ground, lift up the house
Wrapped in blankets of the mother’s skin
Perpetuate a freedom
But there’s nowhere to begin
Bind one sky, ground to soil
No one could care how your blood is boiling
Grab a rubber needle, try to stick someone
Needle is inverted to a rotten heart
Simple, plain and simple
Stars for eyes
He’s eager and overripe
His tongue gets tied
Weakened by a mighty blow
Scars, four eyes
A limping "fell to stupid man"
Whose tongue is tiedEmbed
