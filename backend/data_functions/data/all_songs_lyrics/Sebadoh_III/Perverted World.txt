Perverted World Lyrics
It’s no drama or a hurting kind of love
That never gives
I’ve got a sister with an open mind
And the sweetest urge

Whisper, fight it, she bet for me
Warmth rising to share with me
Not damaged, a restless love
Or just wasting time?

The wait has been satisfied
I’m not jerking to lose my mind again
I’m not smart enough to fake it
No fool could fake a feeling this good

Come on girl, let’s walk
Through this perverted world

A few times it’s too insane
A 'No-trust monster' stomping in my brain
Broken solid, solid shattered
Forgot it forever and ever and ever
Slow down to a loving pace
To the place I’d rather be
A special sister love inside of meEmbed
