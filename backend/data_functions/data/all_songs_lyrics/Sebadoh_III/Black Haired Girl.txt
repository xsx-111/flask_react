Black Haired Girl Lyrics
Hey, little girl how long's it been?
The air is thick and you're still thin
My mind is blank so fill me in
What kind of trouble I got myself in?

Black-haired girl, head full of lies
The truth is all up to you tonight
I read the letters that you sent
Your perfume well won't catch me again

Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh

You don't care 'til you compete
For the affection that you cheat
I read the letters that you sent
Your perfume well won't catch me again

Ooh

Hey, little girl how long's it been?
The air is thick and you're still thin
My mind is blank so fill me in
What kind of trouble I got myself in now?Embed
