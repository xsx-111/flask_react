Rockstar Lyrics
We're not here to crawl away
Or find blame from wasted time
Straight or high is not wasted time
Feeling true in poor Paranoia Ville
Excuses are so easy
When any jerk could push you down
We got reason to learn how
Trust any reason to rise now
Turn your weakness on itself
Not right for you
It's all right with me
To fight with my friends

When faith is near impossible
And trust just isn't practical
It's all right with me
To feed on my friends

You know what? He's got nothing to say
They just want to be rich and say
"Fuck those groups who get the four star"
Nothing could be better, a rock star
Blood-stained avant-garde pop star
Peace doesn't under push
Exploit science, space jam, rock star
Rock star, rock star, rock star
Trust any reason to rise now
Don't let the simple truth bring you down
Money brings freedom, brings a new day
Trust any reason, get rich, crawl away

Faith is near impossible
Trust just isn't practical
It's not right for me
To feed on my friendsEmbed
