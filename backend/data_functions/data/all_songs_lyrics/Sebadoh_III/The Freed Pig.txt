The Freed Pig Lyrics
You were right, I was battling you
Trying to prove myself
I tried to bury you with guilt
I wanted to prove you wrong
I've got nothing better to do
Than pay too much attention to you
It's sad but it's not your fault

I'm self-righteous and rude
I guess I lost that cool
Tapping 'til I drive you insane
I'm self-righteous but never right
So laid back but so uptight
Destroying your patience to tolerate me
And all the negative spirit I bring

Right, I was obsessed to bring you down
Watching your every move
Playing a little boy game
Always with something to prove
Waiting to cut you down
Making it hard to live
With only one thing to do
And cut me first, make it easy
Now you will be free
Now that nothing depends on me
Tapping 'til I drive you insane
Now you will be free
With no sick people tugging on your sleeve
Your big head has that more room to grow

A glory I will never know
A glory I will never know
