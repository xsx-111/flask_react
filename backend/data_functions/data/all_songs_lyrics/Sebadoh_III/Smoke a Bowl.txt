Smoke a Bowl Lyrics
If you just want to smoke
A bowl of the finest homegrown
No matter where you're coming from
You can find my man there on the street
You can find a man that'll peddle and you meet

Weed makes you feel happy
When you're feeling down, oh, yeah
Weed even makes you smile
When there's no one around, oh, yeah

It's the weed that makes you sing
When you're
Half-asleep, you can sing
Bored and nothing to do
We sit in a beat up old Chevy

He'll tell you
He'll tell
He'll tell you
Yeah, he'll tell you
Yeah, I guess he'll tell you
No problemEmbed
