Mother Whale Eyeless Lyrics
I can think of nowhere
I would rather be
Reading morning papers
Drinking morning tea
She clutches the tray
And then we talk just like a kitchen sink play
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Living so close to danger
Even your friends are strangers
Don't count upon their company

This is for the fingers
This is for the nails
Hidden in the kitchen
Right behind the scales
What do I care
I'm wasting fingers like I had them to spare
Plugging holes in the Zuiderzee
Punishing Paul for Peter
Don't ever trust those meters
What you believe is what you see
In my town, there is a raincoat under a tree
In the sky, there is a cloud containing the sea
In the sea, there is a whale without any eyes
In the whale, there is a man without his raincoat

In another country
With another name
Maybe things are different
Maybe they're the same
Back on the trail
The seven soldiers read the papers and mail
But the news, it doesn't change
Swinging about through creepers
Parachutes caught on steeples
Heroes are born, but heroes die
Just a few days
A little practice and some holiday pay
We're all sure you'll make the grade
Mother of God, if you care
We're on a train to nowhere
Please put a cross upon our eyes
Take me
I'm nearly ready, you can take me
To the raincoat in the sky
Take me
My little pastry mother take me
There's a pie shop in the sky5Embed
