The Great Pretender Lyrics
Monica sighed, rolled onto her side
She was so impressed that she just surrendered
She was moved by his wheels, she was just up from Wales
He was fuelled by her coals and he was coming to catch her
Lose the sense of time, nail down the blinds
And in the succulent dark, there's a sense of ending
Joking aside, the mechanical bride
Has fallen prey to the Great Pretender


Let me just point out discreetly
Though you never learn
All those tawdry late-night Weepies
I could make you weep more cheaply
As the empty moon enamels
Monica with spoons and candles
Bangs around without the light on
Furniture to get it right on
Settled in a homely fishpool
Hung with little eels
Often thinks that travel widens
Stay at home; the Trout obliges
Monica sighed, rolled onto her side
She was so impressed that she just surrendered1Embed
