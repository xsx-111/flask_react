Third Uncle LyricsThere are tins
There was pork
There are legs
There are sharks
There was John
There are cliffs
There was Mother
There's a poker
There was you
Then there was you

There are scenes
There are blues
There are boots
There are shoes
There are Turks
There are fools
They're in lockers
They're in schools
There was you
Then there was you
I'll burn my fingers
Burn my toes
Burn my uncle
Burn his books
Burn his shoes
Cook the leather
Put it on me
Does it fit me or you?
It looks tight on you
I'll burn my fingers
Burn my toes
Burn my uncle
Burn his books
Burn his shoes
Cook the leather
Put it on me
Does it fit me or you?
It looks tight on you
There are tins
There was pork
There are legs
There are sharks
There was John
There are cliffs
There was Mother
There's a poker
There was you
Then there was you
There are scenes
There are blues
There are boots
There are shoes
There are Turks
There are fools
They're in lockers
They're in schools
There was you
Then there was you
I'll burn my fingers
Burn my toes
Burn my uncle
Burn his books
Burn his shoes
Cook the leather
Put it on me
Does it fit me or you?
It looks tight on you
There are tins
There was pork
There are legs
There are sharks
There was John
There are cliffs
There was Mother
There's a poker
There was you
Then there was you
There are scenes
There are blues
There are boots
There are shoes
There are Turks
There are fools
They're in lockers
They're in schools
There was youEmbed
