Burning Airlines Give You So Much More Lyrics
When I got back home I found a message on the door
Sweet Regina's gone to China crosslegged on the floor
Of a burning jet that's smoothly flying
Burning airlines give you so much more

How does she intend to live when she's in far Cathay?
I somehow can't imagine her just planting rice all day
Maybe she will do a bit of spying
With micro-cameras hidden in her hair

I guess Regina's on the plane, a Newsweek on her knees
While miles below her the curlews call from strangely stunted trees
The painted sage sits just as though he's flying
Regina's jet disturbs his wispy beard

When you reach Kyoto send a postcard if you can
And please convey my fond regards to Chih-Hao's girl Yu-Lan
I heard a rumour they were getting married
But someone left the papers in Japan

Left them in Japan, left them in Japan
Left them in Japan, left them in Japan
Left them in Japan, left them in Japan
Left them in JapanEmbed
