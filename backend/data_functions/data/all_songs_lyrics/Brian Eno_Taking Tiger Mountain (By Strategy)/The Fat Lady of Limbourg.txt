The Fat Lady of Limbourg Lyrics
Well I rang up Pantucci
Spoke to Luchi
I gave them all
They needed to know
If affairs are proceeding
As we're expecting
Soon enough
The weak spots will show
I assume you understand that we have options on your time
And will ditch you in the harbour if we must:
But if it all works out nicely
You'll get the bonus you deserve
From doctors we trust

The Fat Lady of Limbourg
Looked at the samples that we sent
And furrowed her brow
You would never believe that
She'd tasted royalty and fame
If you saw her now
But her sense of taste is such that she'll distinguish with her tongue
The subtleties a spectrograph would miss
And announce her decision
While demanding her reward:
The jellyfish kiss
Now we checked out this duck quack
Who laid a big egg, oh so black
It shone just like gold
And the kids from the city
Finding it pretty, took it home
And there it was sold
It was changing hands for weeks till someone left it by their fire
And it melted to a puddle on the floor
For it was only a candle
A Roman scandal, oh-whoa-oh
Now it's a pool

That's what we're paid for
That's what we're paid for
That's what we're paid for here
That's what we're paid for
That's what we're paid for
That's what we're paid for here1Embed
