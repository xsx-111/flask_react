Makeshift Swahili (Live) Lyrics"Makeshift", she sings
In her native German
You try to understand what she's trying to say
She says, "You're only as good
As the words you understand"
And you, you don't understand a word
Tower of Babel, Swahili
It's all Greek to me
Bi-lingual, double dutch
Gift of the gab, gift of the gab
We give you firewater, you give us your land
"White man speak with forked tongue"
But it's too late now to start complaining
Too late
Monosyllabic, hieroglyphic
Et cetera, et cetera
Tower of Babel, Swahili
It's all Greek to me
New lamps for old, new lamps for old
Rhubarb rhubarb, rhubarb rhubarb
Rhubarb rhubarb, rhubarb rhubarbEmbed
