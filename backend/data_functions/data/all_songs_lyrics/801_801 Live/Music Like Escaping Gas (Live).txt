Music Like Escaping Gas (Live) LyricsThere she blows out of thin air
Cloud-pump-filter-cylinder
A nation gets the clouds it deserves
And all because of our
Silent prayer, "give me hydrogen
Nitroglycerin
Give me carbon monoxide
Give me the tools of desire
Designed to set fire to my face
Throw me into the fireplace
Ashes and a red rose
Put spots before my eyes"Embed
