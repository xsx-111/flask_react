Twilight Furniture (Live) LyricsSurveilling the twilight furniture
Telescope pressed to patched eye
Love is blind, so we are told
Don't pull the wool over our eyes
Shuttered eye, metal eye
Eye and brain, I and brain
Shapes policed and disinfected
Searchlights stop towers and dead sky
Tommy guns, typewriters aimed and loaded
Fountain pen and a .35
Careless talk costs lives
Careless love costs lives
Cease-fire ends at midnight
Curfew starts at ten
Unclear vision our .....
Nuclear fission our friend
We must shake him by the handEmbed
