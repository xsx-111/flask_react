Hard Times Lyrics
My mother told me before she passed away
Said, Son, when I'm gone, don't forget to pray
Because there'll be hard times, Lord, those hard times
Who knows better than I?

Well, I soon found out just what she meant
When I had to pawn my clothes just to pay the rent
Talkin' about hard times, oh those hard times
Who knows better than I?

I had a woman who was always around
But when I lost my money, she put me down
Talkin' about hard times, Lord, those hard
Yea yea, who knows better than I?

Lord, one of these days
There'll be no more sorrow when I pass away
And no more hard time, no more hard
Yea yea, who knows better than I?Embed
