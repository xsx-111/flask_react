Anything for Your Love Lyrics
God has got a plan, He is making it clear
Sweet little love song in your ear
Like hearts made of diamond, love will prevail
Put a little wind in your sail

And I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love

Listen now, baby, I'll tell you true
Just how much that I love you
I got a sweet feeling I know is real
This kind of love you can't conceal

I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your love
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of
I'd do anything, anything for your love
For your love
For your loveEmbed
