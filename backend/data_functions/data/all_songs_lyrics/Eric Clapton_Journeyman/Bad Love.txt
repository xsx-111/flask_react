Bad Love Lyrics
Oh, what a feeling I get when I'm with you
You take my heart into everything you do
And it makes me sad for the lonely people
I walked that road for so long
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
Your love is making me strong

I've had enough bad love
I need something I can be proud of
I've had enough bad love
No more bad love

And now I see that my life has been so blue
With all the heartaches I had until I met you
But I'm glad to say now that is all behind me
With you here by my side
And there is no more memories to remind me
Your love will keep me alive
