Running on Faith LyricsLately, I've been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you
Lately, I've been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way
I've always been one to take each and every day
Seems like by now I'd find a love who'd care just for me
And we go running on faith
All of our dreams will come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
I've always been one to take each and every day
Seems like by now I'd find a love who cares just for me
Then we'd go running on faith
All of our dreams would come true
And our world will be right
When love comes over me and you
When love comes over you
Said when love comes over you
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
I said when love comes over you
All of our dreams will
All of our dreams will come true
When love comes over you
All of our dreams will come true
Love comes over you
Love comes over you
Love comes over you2Embed
