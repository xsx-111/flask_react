No Alibis Lyrics
I beg your pardon, hello darling
This is me you are talking to
Sit down and tell me about it
You don't have to shout it at me
Tell me what you really want to do

Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie

Mountain gets steeper
The hole you dig gets deeper
You better stop and climb out
I'm trying to give it all to you
But baby, I can see right through you
Sometimes you lose what it's all about

Don't give me no alibis
Can't go through life trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie
Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie

Mountain gets steeper
The hole you dig is getting deeper
You better reach and pull yourself out
Nobody ever going to love you the way that I love you
I never want to see you doing without

Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lie
Don't give me no alibis
No untrue stories you're trying to justify
Don't want no alibis
Just another reason for another lieEmbed
