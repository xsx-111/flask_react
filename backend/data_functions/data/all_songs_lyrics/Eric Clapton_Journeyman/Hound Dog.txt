Hound Dog Lyrics
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snooping around my door
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Been snooping around my door
You can wag your tail, I ain't going to feed you no more

You told me you was high class
I could see through that
You told me you was high class
I could see through that
And baby, I know you ain't no real cool cat


You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
I'm looking for a woman, all you're looking for is a home
