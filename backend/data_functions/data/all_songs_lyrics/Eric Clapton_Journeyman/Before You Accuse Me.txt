Before You Accuse Me Lyrics
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
Taking money from someone else

I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Well your mama said, "Son, don't call my daughter no more"

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else

Come back home, baby, try my love one more time
Come back home, baby, try my love one more time
You know I don't know how to quit you, I'm gonna lose my mind

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I've been spending my money on other women
You're taking money from someone else1Embed
