Got To Be A Better Way Home Lyrics(S. Van Zandt)
Baby just believe me don't try to read me
I've got to catch the 5:05
I've got a ragged hungry band full of stone survivors
We're out here tryin' to keep it alive
No more favors fuckin' strangers say I owe
Don't care about your problems baby all I want to know
How am I gonna get it
How am I gonna get it
How am I gonna get it tonight?
I work hard enough
I'm tired of smiling at liars
I never said I'd try to set the world on fire
Leave me alone
Got to find a better way home
I do it all in an hour
Could you talk a little louder
I don't open my eyes until midnight
They're screamin' to please me, got to make it look easy
'Cause I'm fighting for my life in the spotlight
I'm dancin' in my corner but the bell won't ring
I've got no time to argue, baby, but tell me one thing
How am I gonna get it
How am I gonna get it
How am I gonna get it tonight?
I work hard enough
Tired of smiling at liars
I never said I'd try to set the world on fire
Leave me alone
Got to find a better way home
I hear the motor revvin' baby, I've got to go
But just before I leave there's one thing I've got to know
How am I gonna get it
How am I gonna get it
How am I gonna get it tonight?
I work hard enough
Tired of smiling at liars
I never said I'd try to set the world on fire
Leave me alone
Got to find a better way home
Comin' home, baby
Comin' home, baby
Comin' home, baby
Comin' home, baby
