I Played The Fool Lyrics(S. Van Zandt)
Like the child who's soul's a flame that loves to burn
I'm just the kind of guy who never learns
I guess you had to go
Why was I the last to know?
I played the fool, girl
I did just what you expected
I played the fool
And you're making it so hard to leave this time
I see so much when I look in your eyes
I just can't help myself - I'm hypnotized
It's my turn to walk away
But, baby, I'll be back someday
I played the fool, girl
I did just what you expected
I played the fool
And you're making it so hard to leave this time
It's my turn to walk away
But baby I'll be back someday
I played the fool, girl
I did just what you expected
I played the fool, girl
And you're making it so hard to leave this time
It's my turn to walk away
But baby I'll be back someday
I played the fool, girl
I did just what you expected
I played the fool
