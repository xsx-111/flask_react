Trapped Again LyricsHere I am, baby, right where you found me
Trying to break these chains that surround me
If I look a little different it's 'cause I've changed
Half-painted pictures are all that remains
I can't let my past mistakes, let 'em bring me down
I ain't waitin' on no angel of mercy
I tried my best and I can't help myself
I'm trapped again
I can't get out without losing you
I'm trapped again
Why can't you feel what I'm going through?
I'm trapped again
I need an answer, girl, can't you see?
I'm trapped again
Come and rescue me
Monday morning came so fast
What a fool to think that dreams would last
Close my eyes and it's still so clear
Remember the night, girl, the world disappeared
Can't let the hand of fate, let it drag me down
I can't get no angel of mercy
I came to stay but I got swept away
I'm trapped again
I can't get out without losing you
I'm trapped again
Why can't you feel what I'm going through?
I'm trapped again
I need an answer, girl, can't you see?
I'm trapped again
Come and rescue me
Can't let the hand of fate, let it drag me down
I can't get no angel of mercy
I came to stay but I got swept away
I'm trapped again
I can't get out without losing you
I'm trapped again
Why can't you feel what I'm going through?
I'm trapped again
I need an answer, girl, can't you see?
I'm trapped again
Come and rescue me
