Take It Inside Lyrics(S. Van Zandt)
Try to understand
Before you judge
Now I'm the kind of man
That looks before he touch
But I ain't never touched nothin'
That didn't hit me back, oh no
And the way we live is the way we die
How bad do you want it?
How hard do you try?
You don't ask no questions
You don't find out why
As you watch your life pass you by
You've got to take it inside
Take it inside
Take it inside
Take it inside
Now I do believe
A wound heals if you let it
I can learn to forgive
But I will never forget it
You call my name
And like a fool I'm back again
And I'm watching you die girl
A little at a time
While I stay hard pretending
That I don't mind
I turn my head
But I can't deny
The hurt that I try to hide
You got to take it inside
Take it inside
Take it inside
Take it inside
It's your life, girl
I can't take you there
I try to help
But you're still nowhere
I tell myself, girl
That I don't care
I still can't let it ride
