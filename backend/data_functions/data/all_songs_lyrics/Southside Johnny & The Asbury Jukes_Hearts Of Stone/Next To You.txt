Next To You Lyrics(S. Van Zandt)
The same old places hurt inside
But I still take that one sweet ride
Baby, when I can
The same old faces I despise
Coming 'round here tellin' lies
Sayin' they understand
I'm trying to make it, baby, but it's no good
I wouldn't give the satisfaction even if I could
Well there's nothing that I wouldn't do
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To get next to you
The money came, the money went
And all the time, baby, we knew it wouldn't last too long
You spent your life on easy street
Well that's one game I never beat
You know, on me it always looked so wrong
You can't walk away, baby, without getting scarred
I want it so badly, I'm trying too hard
Well there's nothing that I wouldn't do
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To get next to you
You say there's nothing left to believe in
That somehow it wasn't meant to be
Oh don't you believe in me?
Oh, baby, there is nothing that I wouldn't do
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
To get next to you
Oh, I gotta get next to you, girl
Baby, I gotta get next to you
Honey there's nothing, nothing I wouldn't do
Oh, baby, I got to, got to, got to get next to you, girl
