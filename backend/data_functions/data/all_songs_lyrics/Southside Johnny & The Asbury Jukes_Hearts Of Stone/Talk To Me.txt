Talk To Me Lyrics(B. Springsteen)
Well every night I see a light up in your window
But every night you won't answer your door
But although you won't ever let me in
From the street I can see your silhouette sittin' close to him
What must I do?
What does it take?
To get you to
Talk to me
Until the night is over
Come on, baby
Talk to me
Well until the night is over
I got a full week's pay
And, baby, I've been working hard each day
I'm not asking for the world you see
I'm just asking, girl
Talk to me
Well late at night I hear the music that you're playing soft and low
Yes and late at night I see the two of you swayin' so close
I don't understand, darling, what was my sin?
Why am I down here below while you're up there with him?
What did I do?
What did I say?
What must I pay?
To get you to
Talk to me
Until the night is over
Little darling, won't you
Talk to me
Well until the night is over
Yea yea yea
I got a full week's pay
And baby I've been working hard each day
I'm not asking for the world you see
I'm just asking girl
Talk to me
I don't understand, darling, what was my sin?
Why am I down here below while you're up there with him?
What did I do?
What did I say?
What must I pay?
To get you to
Talk to me
Until the night is over
Come on, baby
Talk to me
Well until the night is over
Yea yea yea
I got a full week's pay
And baby
I've been working hard each day
I'm not asking for the world you see
I'm down on my bended knees
I'm just asking darling please won't you
Talk to me
Until the night is over
Come on talk to me
Until the night is over
Talk to me
Till the sun comes up
