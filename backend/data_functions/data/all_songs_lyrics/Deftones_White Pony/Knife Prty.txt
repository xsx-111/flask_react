Knife Prty Lyrics
My knife, it's sharp and chrome
Come see inside my bones
All of the fiends are on the block
I'm the new king, I'll take the queen
'Cause in here, we're all anemic
In here, anemic and sweet, so

(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
And come in
(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
And lay down
(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
Now kiss me

I can float here forever in this room
We can't touch the floor
In here, we're all anemic
In here, anemic and sweet, so

(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
And come in
(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
And lay down
(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
Now kiss me
I could float here forever
You are ever sweet
I could float here forever
Anemic and sweet, so

(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
And come in
(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
And lay down
(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
Get filthy
(Go get your knife, go get your knife)
And kiss me12Embed
