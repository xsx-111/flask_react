Back to School (Mini Maggit) Lyrics
So run
Run, right back to school
Check it

Look back, I sift through all the cliques
Roaming' the halls all year, making me sick
While everyone's out trying to make the cut (What)
And when you think you know me right, I switch it up
Behind the walls, smokin' cigarettes and sippin' vodka
I hop a fence to catch a cab, ain't no one can stop us
Give me a break about some other mess
What were you? Act like it's everything you got

Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all, so

Stop that quit, all that quit
Who ruined it? You did, now grab a notebook and a pen
Start taking notes on me and everyone who's on the top
You think we're on the same page, but I know we're not
I'll be the man, watch your backpacks, pens, and pencils
Just like Keith, I'm flippin' it, while you just keep it simple
You just can't go on rocking the clothes
Coppin' the stance, 'cause really it's everything that you're not
Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all

So transpose
Or stop your lies
It's what you do
Transpose or stop your lies
So run
So why don't you run, so why don't you run?
So why don't you run back to school?
So why don't you run, so why don't you run?

All you are, now I'm on the next page
All you are, it's time to close the book up
All you are, I'm on the next page
All you are, close the book up now

Push back the square
Now that you need her but you don't
So there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all
We are the leaders of all
We are the leaders of all
So why don't you run, so why don't you run?
So why don't you run back to school?
So why don't you run, so why don't you run?4Embed
