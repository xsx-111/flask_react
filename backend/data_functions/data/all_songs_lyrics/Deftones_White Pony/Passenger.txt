Passenger Lyrics
Here I lay, still and breathless
Just like always; still, I want some more
Mirrors sideways, who cares what's behind?
Just like always, still your passenger
Chrome buttons, buckles, and leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses
Now to calm me, this time, won't you, please?
Drive faster

Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger

Drop these down, then put them on me
Nice, cool seats there to cushion your knees
Now to calm me, take me around again
Don't pull over, this time, wonâ€™t you, please?
Drive faster

Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows down
To catch my breath
And then go and go and go
Just drive me home and back again
Here I lay
Just like always
Don't let me go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Take me to the edge15Embed
