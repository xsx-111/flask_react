Street Carp Lyrics
It's not that I care, truly
But you're that girl with sharp teeth
Who grabs at the walls and pulls meat down

Well, here's my new address
6-6-4, oh, I forget

It's not like I care, truly
But you're that girl with gold teeth
Who snaps at the walls and won't calm down

Well, here's my new address
6-1-5, oh, I forget
There's all your evidence
Now take it home, run with it

Now, write it down
Now did you get? Get it?
So write it down
Now did you get it? Get it?
So write it down
Now did you get it? Get it?
So write it down
Now did you get it? Get it?
Well, here's my new address
6-6-5, oh, I confess
There's all your evidence
Now take it home and fuck with it

Now, so write it down
Now did you get it, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get it? Get it?
So write it down
Now did you get it? Get it?
So write it down
Now did you get it? Get it?2Embed
