Feiticeira Lyrics
Fuck, I'm drunk, but I'm on my knees
The police stopped chasing
I'm her new cool meat
She pops the trunk and she removes me
And a machine takes pictures of us
Now my jaw and my teeth hurt
I'm choking from gnawing on the ball

And just before I come to
Move to the back of the car
She made me touch the machine
New murderer, fuck 'em

First, untie me
Untie me for now
You said you would, right?
And you were right

(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
Soon this will be all over
Well, I hope soon, she sang
Soon this will be all over
Well, I hope soon, so she sang
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
So she sang
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
So she sang
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
So she sang
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)2Embed
