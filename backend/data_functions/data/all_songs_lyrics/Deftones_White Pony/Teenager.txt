Teenager Lyrics
I climbed your arms, then you pulled away
New cavity moved into my heart today
The more she sings, the more it seems
Now, oh

Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you

I drove you home, then you moved away
New cavity moved into my heart today
The more I scream, the more it seems
Now I'm through

Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
Now I'm through
With the new you
New you3Embed
