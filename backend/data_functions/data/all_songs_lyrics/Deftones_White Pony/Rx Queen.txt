Rx Queen Lyrics
I won't stop following you
Now help me pray for
The death of everything new
Then we'll fly farther

'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't mind

We'll stop to rest on the moon
And we'll make a fire
I'll steal a carcass for you
Then feed off the virus

'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't mind
'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't

(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)
I see a red light in June
And I hear crying
You turn newborn baby blue
Now we're all the virus

'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't mind
'Cause you're my girl and that's alright
If you sting me, I won't

(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)
(And now look at 'em
Look at 'em now, look at 'em, sting)4Embed
