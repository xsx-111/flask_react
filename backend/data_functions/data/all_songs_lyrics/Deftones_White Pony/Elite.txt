Elite Lyrics
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

You like attention
It proves to you you're alive
Stop parading your angles
Confused? You'll know when you're ripe

When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
You're pregnant
With all this space
Thick with honey
But I lost my taste

You're into depression
'Cause it matches your eyes
Stop the faux to be famous
Confused? You'll know when you're ripe

When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

You're pregnant
With all this space
Thick with honey
But I lost my taste
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control3Embed
