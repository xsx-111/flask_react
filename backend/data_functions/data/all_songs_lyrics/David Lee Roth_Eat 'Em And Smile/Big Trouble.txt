Big Trouble LyricsAh yeah
Ahh
Well, Mousy Joe got the master plan
He got a hat full of sugar. Folks said, "You a lucky man."
One night he just disappeared
And all we found was his hat in a clearing
Down by the 7-Eleven
Folks cried, someone said he died
But I know Joe didn't go to heaven, no
He went looking for trouble, wow
It was in his eyes, woah
She was a dime a dozen
And they were two of a kind
Cherry Blue and Mighty Mouse
Kinda quiet dude and she was 'sposed to be back at the house
With the kids and the dog
"And tonight we're Rocketeers," said Mouse
"And I know a little joint upstairs in the back
Where we can sweat it all out and laugh."
And without a doubt they were out
Looking for trouble, wow
The real kind, woah
She was a dime a dozen, ha ha ha
And they were two of a kind
How many times have you said to yourself
"Hey, I feel like a yo-yo, I've been here too long."
I bet if you asked them, our heroes would say
"Hey, we're already gone." I know
Somehow I know
How many times have you said to yourself
"Hey, pack up and go, I've been here too long."
I bet if you asked them, our heroes would say
"Hey, we're already gone." I know
How do I know that, fellas?
Yeah, and off they drove, late night still life
Paper moon shinin' brilliantly
And Cherry thinks that's cool
'Cause any moon of Mouse's is a friend of hers
And this one will do just fine
So what do you say we go lookin'?Embed
