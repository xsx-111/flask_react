Tobacco Road LyricsOh
I was born in a trunk
Mama died and my daddy got drunk
Left me here to die alone
In the middle of Tobacco Road
Growin' up, rusty shack
All I had was hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
This place called Tobacco Road
But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe
Tobacco Road
Gonna leave, get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money, get rich and old
Bring it back to Tobacco Road
But it's home
The only life I've ever known
Only you know how I loathe, huh
Tobacco Road, wow
Bring that dynamite and a crane
Blow it up, start all over again
Build a town be proud to show
In the name Tobacco RoadEmbed
