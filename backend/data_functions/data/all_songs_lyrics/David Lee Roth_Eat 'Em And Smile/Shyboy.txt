Shyboy LyricsWow, oh
Ah yeah, ow
On the stage I'm in a rage
But you I never fool
Well I can rock with anyone
But never alone with you
Somethin' starts a boilin'
Now deep inside of me
I need agressive women
To knock me off my feet
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
Ooh, you make me nervous
More than I had planned
Would you wanna know me
If I wasn't in the band?
Crazy feeelings
Deep inside of me
I need a wild woman
To knock me off my feet
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
Gotta keep things moving
Till my personality starts improving
Ow, shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
Gotta keep things moving
Till my personality starts improving
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy
Shyboy, shyboy, give it one more time boy
