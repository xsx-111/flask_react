Elephant Gun LyricsWow
Every outer inch of you looks like a lady
So don't get caught here in the city at night
And if you wanna take a chance and go gun crazy
I sell protection for a price
We'll call it love or call it murder
This ain't the crime of the century, no
Don't point that thing at me
All in all my aim is better
Shots as clean as a mean goal-getter
It's a bad man on the run
I'm gonna be your dark stranger
Contact man 'tween you and danger
And I'll protect you babe, with my elephant gun
Every minute counts when you play both sides of the law
Mmm, these dangerous days
Mean nine lives doin' anything at all
A lot of folks been blown away
We'll call it love or call it murder
This ain't the crime of the century
Don't aim that thing at me
Woah, all in all my aim is better
Shots as clean as a mean goal-getter
It's a bad man on the run
I'm gonna be your dark stranger
Contact man 'tween you and danger
And I'll protect you babe, with my elephant gun
Bang
We'll call it love or call it murder
This ain't the crime of the century
Don't try to use that thing on meEmbed
