Bump And Grind LyricsAh yeah
Lookin' for love in the back of a taxi
Got lucky in a cheap hotel
Hot pants, mm.. nasty
Don't bother knockin' 'cause you know damn well
This blind date is cash and carry
Dead ringer for the big first prize
Chance meeting in the roaring eighties
And you ain't going home tonight
So shake it slowly
And do that bump and grind
Well, I can tell you a few reservations
More value, bang for the buck
I may be wrong but I think she kinda likes ya
Think quick or you're out of luck
This blind date is cash and carry
We have a winner for the big first prize
Chance meeting in the roaring eighties
And you ain't going nowhere tonight
Shake it slowly
And do that bump and grind, woah
Rotate slowly
Make it bump and grind, woah yeah, huh
Ooh, I feel romantic
Oh, I wanna let you know
Have you ever really studied dancing
Or do you make it up as you go?
Wow, shake it slowly
Do that bump and grind, woah
Move it slowly
And make it bump and grind
Wow, bump itEmbed
