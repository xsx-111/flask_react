Yankee Rose LyricsWhat?
Well, let me roll up on to the sidewalk and take a look, yes
Whoa! She's beautiful!
I'm talking about a Yankee Rose
Ha ha ha ha ha
And she looks wild, wild, wild, wild!
Are you ready for the new sensation?
Well, here's the shot heard 'round the world
All you back room boys salute when her flag unfurls
Well, guess who's back in circulation
Now, I don't know what you may have heard
But what I need right now's the original good time girl
She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey sister, you're the perfect host (care to toast)
Show me your bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talkin' 'bout the Yankee Rose, yeah
Your bright lights
And your city lights, all right
I'm talkin' 'bout it
When she walks, watch, the sparks will fly
Firecrackin' on the fourth of July
No sad songs tonight, somethin's in the air
Yeah, the feeling getcha, wow
A real state of independence
So pretty when her rockets glare
Still prove it any night that her flag's still there
She's a vision from coast to coast (coast to coast)
Sea to shining sea (sea to shining sea)
Hey sister, you're the perfect host (make a toast)
Show me your bright lights and your
City lights, all right
I'm talkin' 'bout the Yankee Rose, yeah
Bright lights in your
City lights, all right
I'm in love with the Yankee Rose
Ah, she's beautiful, alright
Mmm, nothin' like her in the whole world
Yeah
She's right on time
I'm on the case
Pick up the phone
No time to waste
She got the beat
And here's a little bit comin' your way, wow
Aah, raise 'em up there, let's see who salutes, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Little bit, little bit, little bit higher
Here's the national anthem, here
I wanna get a little bit a' apple pie, man
Bright lights, city lights
Bright lights, city lights
Bright lights, city lightsEmbed
