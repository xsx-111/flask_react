White Teeth Teens Lyrics
We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it, then we'll stay
Impress the empress; take a shot now

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

If you want, we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling, but the notes from my admirers
Fill the dashboard just the same, ah, ah-ah

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop us when we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no-one could

I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join, but never did
The way they are, the way they seem
Is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights
In the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing, and love it

And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no-one could
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no-one could

We got the glow in our mouths
(And everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no-one could)
White teeth teens are out
(And everything works out so good)
(I wear the robe like no-one could)
White teeth teens are out75Embed
