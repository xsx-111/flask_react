Glory and Gore Lyrics
There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
(Drop-drop-drop-drop) Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious
Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring and we're coming for blood

(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious

No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises
We'll always win at this, I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughin' up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain
"Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But we're the gladiators
(Oh, oh) Everyone a rager
(Oh, oh) But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
(Oh, oh) You could try and take us
(Oh, oh) But victory's contagious
