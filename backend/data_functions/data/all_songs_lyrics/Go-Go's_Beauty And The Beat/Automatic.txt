Automatic LyricsQuiet now
Still of night
Inside fire burning bright
Right moment
Laying down
Oh, still no sound
It's all automatic
No thought
Automatic
Golden hair
Skin glisten
Beating heart but don't listen
Angles sharp
Crash together
Time and consciousness sever
Mind in automatic
Time stop
AutomaticEmbed
