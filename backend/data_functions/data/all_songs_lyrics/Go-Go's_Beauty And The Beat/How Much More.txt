How Much More Lyrics
Every night I see you walk
Walking by and walking by
You hold your head so close to hers
I could cry, yeah, I could cry
I want to be that girl tonight
Girl tonight, girl tonight

How much more can I take
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
Crazy, oh yeah
How much more heartache
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
Crazy, oh yeah

Love is in your eyes
Making me cry
Why isn't it me?
She's looking good
Just like I would
If it could be me

How much more can I take
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
Crazy, oh yeah
How much more heartache
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
Crazy, oh yeah
Every night I see you walk
Walking by and walking by
You hold your head so close to hers
I could cry, yeah, I could cry
I want to be that girl tonight
Girl tonight, girl tonight

How much more can I take
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
Crazy, oh yeah
How much more heartache
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
Crazy, oh yeah
Crazy, oh yeah, yeahEmbed
