Skidmarks on My Heart Lyrics
You sure know how to hurt a girl
Fewer hugs and no more kisses
Just water for your carburetor
And bearings for your pistons
Rev her engine for your pleasure
Caress and fondle her steering wheel
When you moan and hug her gear shift
Stop! Think how it makes me feel

Oh skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love
Oh skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

Spend all your time and money
On that Pontiac GTO pile
Getting tired of your greasy antics
My pride's getting hurt by the mile
Blow her engine, blow my mind
Keep her shocks and brakes aligned
I see that you're all jacked up
Leaving me and your exhaust behind
Oh skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love
Oh skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love
1 2 3 4!

I buy you cologne
You want axle grease
You say get a mechanic
I say get a shrink
I need promises
You needs Motor Trend
Our love needs an overhaul
Oh this, this may be the end

Oh skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love
Oh skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love
I'm driving in risk
I'm driving in risk
I'm driving in risk
I'm driving in riskEmbed
