Ballad of Bird Love LyricsI'm goin' huntin' by the sea, I'll take my brothers with me
Yeah, and we'll camp out by the shore and wait for mornin' time
Before it's  light, through the driftin' of trees
Yeah, just my brothers and me
Oh, out huntin' lovers by the sea, yeah
It's a tricky kind of thing, you'd better know how to sing
And when the ocean starts to row you gotta give all you got and then some more
So when your lover hears you, yeah, she know where you are
And she'll come driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
Just driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
 now, driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
(Yeah)
Out huntin' lovers by the sea, yeah
So if you're comin' alone you'd better work up a song
And get your feathers straightened out because it won't be very long
Before you're flyin' high, makin' a "V", oh yeah, my brothers and me
Out huntin' lovers by the sea, yeah, oh
Out huntin' lovers by the sea, yeah
So if you hunt your lover down make sure there's no one around
And when you do your little dance don't miss your chance
'Cause she'll be  and maybe leave you for another bird
Oh yeah, you know what I mean
And she'll be driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
Just driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
There she goes now, driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
Oh, say bye bye, yeah
Just driftin' through the trees on the breeze, yeah
Yeah, guess what, I'm goin' huntin' by the sea, I'll take my brothers with me
Yeah, and we'll camp out by the shore and wait for mornin' time
Before it's  light, through the driftin' of trees
Yeah, just my brothers and me
Out huntin' lovers by the sea, yeah
Yeah, just my brothers and me, yeah
Aw, here we come now, driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
Yeah, just my brothers and me
(ban ba ban ba bam)
Just driftin' through the trees on the breeze
(ban ba ban ba bam)
Here it come now, yeah, out huntin' lovers by the sea, yeahEmbed
