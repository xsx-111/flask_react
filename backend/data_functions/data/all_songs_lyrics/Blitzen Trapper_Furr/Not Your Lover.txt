Not Your Lover LyricsIn my sleep, I'm not your lover anymore
When I wake, I have to remind myself
That I'm lying on your shore
Cause I'm a moonwalking cowboy, dusty ridin'
And I don't know what's in store
All I know is, in my sleep, I'm not your lover anymore
When I'm dreaming, I could be anyone
Yeah, a brother or a friend
Or a husband, baby, with a golden touch, yeah
Or just another dead end
Yeah, I'm a moonwalking cowboy, dusty ridin'
And I don't know what's in store
All I know is, in my sleep, I'm not your lover anymore
In my sleep, I'm not your lover anymore
So if you watch me, while I'm sleepin' in my bed
Well, I'm a million miles away, inside some other stranger's head
So put your fingers to my cheek and call my name
But I can't hear you now, my girl, cause your voice it don't sound the same
Cause I'm a moonwalking cowboy, dusty ridin'
And I don't know what's in store
All I know is, in my sleep, I'm not your lover anymore
When I'm awake, I'm yours, and I'm stickin' 'round
I'm gonna walk on down your shores
But, in my sleep, I'm not your lover anymore
In my sleep, I'm not your lover anymoreEmbed
