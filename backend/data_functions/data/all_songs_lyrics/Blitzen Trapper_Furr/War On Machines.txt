War On Machines LyricsI'm goin' home like a tiger in the rain
My blood is drippin' but I'm bringin' you a brand new name
Salty ocean full of tears will bring me home again
I'm comin' after you a killer, lover, brother or friend
So don't wait
The weather's makin' war on machines
In the night, breakin' out like a fight
I'm gonna catch you by the tail and teach you how to live
The world's an empty river waitin' for the levy to give
So don't wait
The weather's makin' war on machines
In the night, breakin' out like a fight
So don't you worry darlin' 'bout the things you got
'Cause what you're not
Just toss into the wind
I'm goin' home like a tiger in the rain
My body's crazy but it's gonna to make you whole again
The river's winding around the mountains here before the bend
A rushing waterfall will never rest it only begins
So don't wait
The weather's makin' war on machines
In the night, breakin' out like a fight
So don't you worry darlin' 'bout the things you're not
'Cause what you got
Just toss into the wind
I'm gonna catch you by the tail and teach you how to live
The world's an empty river waitin' for the levy to give
I'm gonna catch you by the tail and teach you how to live
The world's an empty river waitin' for the levy to giveEmbed
