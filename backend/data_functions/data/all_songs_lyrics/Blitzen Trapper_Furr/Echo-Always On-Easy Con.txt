Echo/Always On/Easy Con LyricsDid I ask you to call me, darling
Got no time for a bitter end
I could come around Thursday, maybe
But I know you're gonna be with your friends
'Cuz every day is like a rooftop catching the sun
And if no one is watching does our love leave any trace
Or just an echo out in space
Yeah...
If you knew what a fool I've been
You'd strike a match for every day that's been lost
What I wouldn't give to see you make a livin' breaking even
Or just counting the cost
'Cuz every day is like a newborn still as the sun
And if no one is watching does our love leave any trace
Or just an echo out in space
Or just a broke down empty place
Yeah...Embed
