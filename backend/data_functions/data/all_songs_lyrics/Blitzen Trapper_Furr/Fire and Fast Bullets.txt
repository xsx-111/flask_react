Fire and Fast Bullets LyricsThere's dragons and demons alive in the skies
Their belt buckles, golden shades cover their eyes
It's a cool-headed kid
Who can swallow his pride
When the fire starts fallin' and the fast bullets fly
A breakdancing wizard
He's all wrapped up in blue
He's weapons are fat-free
His footwork is true
His shield is a remote control that points at the sky
When the fire starts fallin' and the fast bullets fly
(Uh oh uh oh)
Okay, this city is a warzone
Inferno of love
This dangerous fiction will rain from above
But billboards go  are  hot
Until the fire starts fallin' and the fast bullets fly
(Here it comes)
So keep your eyes to the sky
Let me into the door
For the clicking of heels on the plasticine floor
The scent of upholstery and burning will rise
When the fire starts fallin' and the fast bullets fly
(Uh oh uh oh)
There's dragons and demons alive in the skies
You can run for the hills but you know you can't hide
If you try you will die in the blink of an eye
As the fire starts fallin' and the fast bullets flyEmbed
