Rent A Cop LyricsWell, I got some  in the parking lot
In a shopping mall elevator headed for the top
When I got to the helipad I probably got shot
By a teenage, female rent-a-cop
I sit in the  nimble as a chimp
Through a back alley breakin' I was blind as a bat
An uptown suit with a flute and a hat
And a face like a tripper with a baseball bat
So you'd better make change,  smile
You're a good shot  headed for the pile
I lit it on fire in the middle of the road
Then I lit up a rock and let my brain explode, yeah
So, that female rent-a-cop sittin' in my trail
Like a drunk with a unicorn tryin' to read braille
So I stole a few hubcaps dusted off my 
 a gas can to get the wheels greased
(Now I'm huffin' down fumes in a room with a broom)
Till that rent-a-cop  picked the lock with a spoon
I didn't like the drink much  a day
Wearin' nothin' but a badge and her underwear, yeah
(When the cop started talkin' I could feel it in my spine)
(It's a song that I know was a language of mine)
I danced like a punk  on the floor
She just ran out around and  for the door
But a thick-wrist sucker punch comin' through the air
Comin' right to the kisser then she grabbed me by the hair, yeah
She said you got my  and I ain't gonna stop
Till you either take a shit or you get off the pot
There's a listenin' there but I can't tell where
Maybe they've  woman if you're tryin' to 
(And while you're takin' advice from a girl at )
(From a wild, trash rent-a-cop driven by Thor)
Take a tip from me, you can take it on the road
You can never be a rent-a-cop if you lock and loadEmbed
