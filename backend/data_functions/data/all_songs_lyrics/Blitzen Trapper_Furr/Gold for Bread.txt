Gold for Bread LyricsI’m a broke down wreck with a ball and chain
Just sitting in the kitchen with my fortunate fame
There’s a monkey in a mask and he's calling my name
There’s a midget on his back, he’s waiting for the midnight train
For the midnight train
'Cause we’re pulling up stakes
Gotta load up the car
Get my right beat back
Do some air guitar
'Cause I’m running from the air-jets
Inside of my head
On my bed with a leg full of lead
We're trading gold for bread
Well the militarised mistress yeah you sink like a stone
Well I’m out here on the sidewalk where the buffalo roam
I can see it in your crystal dancing in like a storm
Blowing dusty through the kitchen while you’re standing in your high heels in your hall
In your high heels in your hall
'Cause we’re pulling up stakes
Gotta load up the car
Get my right beat back
Do some air guitar
'Cause I’m running from the air-jets
Inside of my head
On my bed with a leg full of lead
We're trading gold for bread
Yeah there’s this choice you gotta make and it’ll cut to the coil
Like a preacher throwing dice instead of seeds on the soil
There’s a lady and her lover and they’re covered in oil
Slipping down through the cracks with the attack and a face full of foil
And a face full of foil
'Cause we’re pulling up stakes
Gotta load up the car
Get my right beat back
Do some air guitar
'Cause I’m running from the air-jets
Inside of my head
On my bed with a leg full of lead
We're trading gold for breadEmbed
