Booksmart Baby LyricsOh Maya, raise a lake in time
Burnt hills, beautiful, and Maya
Oh Maya, maybe you're booksmart baby
Maya deep in the dark, or not
Old eye, dragon drink in time
Someday you'll be beautiful
And Maya, maybe your pop pulled stakes
To keep you clear and clean
Hillside slippin' in the storm
Long line, slippers on the cold linoleum
"What'll I do with you?" she cried
Into the wet, wet ragEmbed
