War is Placebo LyricsStill, baby, stay in cars, tell me where you are
If this war is placebo, yeah, I know
Stories in the stars, clutch your handlebars
If you started believin' that love is an empty road
Gets darker the more you know
'Cause you're cheatin' your own
Makin', breakin' your promises
Caught like a bird in the snow
I know, I know you're in there
You're black and blue like fall
I'm  and stupid
I know, I know you know, oh, oh
Yeah, look at all the ways I confuse your pain
Such a sorry and ruthless way
To explain that love is an empty rain
I don't even know why I came
Still, baby, stay indoors, lock yourself in stores
Shine a light on the climbers 
And still, baby, stay in cars, tell me where you are
If this war is placebo, yeah, I know that love is an empty road
Gets darker the more you know
'Cause you're cheatin' your own
Makin', breakin' your promises
Caught like a bird in the snowEmbed
