Love U LyricsI love you baby
Like a thief love money
Like a wheel gotta roll
Like a shoe got soul!
I've been walking around, thinking about you
About the way you got to break me in two
Baby can you appreciate just what I've been through
Yeah
Girl I love you but you're made of clay
I should go back to the earth one day
Leavin' me to wonder in this broken down way
Yeah
You're for this war
-----
Sweeping through the western world we love
Godspeed us home
With fire and stone
Sweeping through the western world we loveEmbed
