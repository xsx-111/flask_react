Lady on the Water LyricsLady on the water make me rich and make me poor
Lay your flowers at my door
Lady on the water, bring me branches, bring me twine
Graft my heart upon the vine
With your wine down my feathers, as the cock crows given time
Oh to wake my lady on the water, share my bread share my drink
Pay no mind what others think
Lady on the water whip this wind into a flame
With your grapes and bottled rain
Make your wine of my worship  divinely strange refrain
(Oh to make it rain)
My lady on the water, place your thumb upon my tongue
Leave a song no one has sung
Lady on the water with your jacket blue and strange
Change these rivers in my veins into wine
Learnin', burnin', driven deep into this maze
(All of my days)
My lady on the water, lead me from the wilderness
Through countless deserts, dreams and jests
Lady on the water rest my head upon your chest
Leave me only when I'm blessed
'Cause I'll be in my own country, good and dead and gone to rest
(It's the way that's the best)Embed
