On My Way to the Bay LyricsOn my way to the bay
For to get my pay
I got waylaid
By an engine 
His shades were dark
And his car was parked
In a grove of apple trees
And it wouldn't start
So I drew my gun
And I made a beam
On the snow-white girl
Sittin' in an apple tree
I said, "she is the one
Who is keeping you here
She's a witch with an itch
So you'd better steer clear"
Well, that engine boy
He took one good look
Then he took my gun
And shot that witch in the foot
Yeah, she fell with a sigh
Through the grass, to the ground
But that's all just a part
Of her plan, I have found
'Cause when we got up close
Well, she turned with a grin
With her eyes painted black
And her lips painted thin
She beckoned to me
But I said not a word
Then she scooped up that boy
Like a dog with a bird
Well, I shot her once more
Direct through the eye
But she shook it off quick
And she called me aside
She said, "you know how this works
I think better than most"
Then she kissed my mouth
And I wept like a ghost
On my way to the bay
For to get my pay
I came upon a girl
At an engine 
I'd known her once
And it made me sad
For her magic had wandered
And her teeth had gone badEmbed
