Maybe Baby LyricsMaybe baby check your head
Now, if you're around make a sound
Like a speedball, hammer, and twine
Change your mind and then discover
Set me free but leave the key
See what would I be
Oh, if you knew just how to read, write, add, and subtract
My attack is undercover, yeah
Don't you ignore, we gotta even the score
Settle down, cover ground, and then discover, you know
(Maybe baby check your head)
(Now if you're around make a sound)
(Like a speedball, hammer, and twine)
(Change your mind and then discover, yeah)
Maybe baby keep your head
Was it something I said, or just a slow sliding fall
All your lines in a knot
Now you're caught and undercover
Don't you ignore, we gotta even the score
Settle down, cover ground, and then discover, you know
Maybe baby mess my head
If you think I'm still dead
What a joke full of smoke signs rise on the wind
Let me in, I'm undercover, yeah
Maybe baby check your headEmbed
