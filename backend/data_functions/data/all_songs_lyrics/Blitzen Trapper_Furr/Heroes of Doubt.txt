There is a column collapsing upon my 
You know I'm part of you to lose
Your love is an empty storm 
The clatter of words on the curb as I talk to you

The clatter of words on to lose
Your love is an empty storm drown
The clatter of words on to lose
That feeling of empty storm drown
The clatter of words on to lose
Your love is an empty storm drown
The clatter of words on to lose
That feeling of empty storm drown
The clatter of words on the curb as I talk to youEmbed
