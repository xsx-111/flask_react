Sleepytime in the Western World LyricsYour eyelids are made of lead, you can't keep them up
'Cause it's sleepytime, and that's no crime in the western world
'Cause when the sun goes down you’re bound to follow through
Sleepin' through the afternoon, I just can't seem to leave my room
Waitin' for the moon and a love so true it's gonna see me through
You know it's gonna see me through
'Cause when the sun goes down I'm gonna make like a tree and run
Sleepin' through the afternoon, I just can’t seem to leave my room
Waitin' for the moon and a love so true it’s gonna see me through
You know it’s gonna see me through
Driftin' down the sleepy river, wakin' like a child
You're never gonna know what the spirits say unless you drift down for a while
You're never gonna know what the wind is whisperin' now
You're never gonna know unless you leave this world somehow
(Unless you leave this world somehow)
I woke up on the street, so apprehensive, feelin' weak
And, as I finally tried to speak, twelve birds flew straight-ways from my mouth, yeah
They circled high above the sky, began to cry with kissing sounds
A crowd gathered on the ground all speakin' strangely through their teeth
(Yeah, through their teeth)
I , I spoke once more into the wind
A storm of birds contained therein, began to spin
(Yeah, they began to spin)
Your eyelids are made of lead, you can't keep them up
'Cause its sleepytime, and that's no crime in the western world
'Cause when the sun goes down you’re bound to follow through
Sleepin' through the afternoon, I just can't seem to leave my room
Waitin' for the moon and a love so true it's gonna see me through
You know it's gonna see me throughEmbed
