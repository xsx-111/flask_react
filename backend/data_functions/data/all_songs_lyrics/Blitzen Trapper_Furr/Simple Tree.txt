Simple Tree LyricsYou were cool, slippin' out of your skin after school
Driftin' warm through the trees to the pool
And all the kids comin' out never knew just exactly the score
Baby where is the girl that I knew
Just before, fast asleep in her clothes on the floor
Back two birds with one stone in a storm
With your sweater on backwards and torn
There was nothin' to warn me, I slept like a lamb in the corn
'Cause I'm goin' like I'd break the speed of sound
Kickin' up the dust  all around
Comin' like a cougar after me
Until you break down around these simple trees, tree
This is now, watchin' you and some curtains and clouds
If you could get up the nerve to relate
To the people with faces you hate
I'm gonna write you a song and explain everything that went wrong
'Cause I'm goin' like I'd break the speed of sound
Kickin' up the dust  all around
Comin' like a cougar after me
Until you break down around these simple trees, treeEmbed
