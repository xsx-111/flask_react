Saturday Nite LyricsJump down, turn around
Shake it on a Saturday night
You don’t have to play the crowd
But if you ‘re gonna say it
Say it out loud
Cheap ride, running and
Leaving town and hoping to fly
But everybody’s dying to try
And there’s only so much room in the sky
This love is gonna move you like a wind chime
Gonna toss you like the ocean til you’re mine oh mine
There’s a bright light shining white
Gotta lead my people through the night
If you wanna make change, better rearrange
Cause there’s not a lot of land in sight
Jump down, turn around
Shake it on a Saturday night
You don’t have to play the crowd
But if you ‘re gonna say it
Say it out loud1Embed
