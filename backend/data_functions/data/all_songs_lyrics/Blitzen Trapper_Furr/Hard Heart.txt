Hard Heart LyricsMy heart is breakin' stones
My heart is breakin' stones, oh oh
I had my heart in the coals, oh no
If I catch you on the windy side I'll break your hard, hard heart
You know I will
And it won't rise until the sun is gone for good
My heart is breakin' stones
My heart is breakin' stones, oh oh
I had my heart in the coals, oh no
Like a blade of grass, the sun will cut right through your hard, hard heart
I know you know
And it won't rise until the sun is gone for good
Gone for good, for goodEmbed
