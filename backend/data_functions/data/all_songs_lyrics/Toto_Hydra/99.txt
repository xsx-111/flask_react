99 Lyrics
99, I've been waiting so long
Oh 99, where did we go wrong
Oh 99, I love you
99, I keep breaking your heart
Oh 99, how can we be apart
Oh 99, I love you

I never thought it would happen, I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out, no one to blame
You know I love you, 99

99, you keep holding my hand
Oh 99, they don't know who I am
Oh 99, I love you

I never thought it would happen, I feel quite the same
I don't want to hurt you anymore
I never knew it would work out, no one to blame
You know I love you, 99
99, I can't take it no more
Oh 99, oh we were so sure
Oh 99, I love you
99

I love you
99
La la la la la la la la la
I love you2Embed
