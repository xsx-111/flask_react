Dries Lyrics
Warning! Poisonous black smoke pouring in from Jersey marshes. Reaches South street. Gas masks useless. Urge population to move into open spaces . . .automobiles use Routes 7, 23, 24 . . . Avoid congested areas. Smoke now spreading over Raymond Boulevard . 

Cardinal cuts
Moves a line
Makes it shine
For everyone
Remembers cuts
There's those times
Dries
