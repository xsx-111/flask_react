Private LyricsI never asked you
To come in my room
I never asked you
To play with my toys
I never asked you
To mess with my private life
I never asked you
To tie my shoes
I never asked you
To come in my room
You weren't invited in
I never asked you
To play with my toys
I never asked you
To play with my private life
So don't so don't
I never asked you
To take me to war
Keep your hands to yourself
To yourself
I never asked you
To come in my room
I never asked you
To play with my toys
I never asked you
To mess with my private life
I never asked you
To take me to war
I never asked you
To come in my room
You weren't invited in
I never asked you
To play with my toys
I never asked you
To fuck with my private life
So don't don't
I never asked you
To take me to war
Keep your hands to yourself
To yourself
Hands to yourself
To yourself
Hands to yourself
Self
Self
To yourself
Hands to yourself
Self
Self
Stay the fuck out of my private lifeEmbed
