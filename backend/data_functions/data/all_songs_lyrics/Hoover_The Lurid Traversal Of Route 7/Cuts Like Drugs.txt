Cuts Like Drugs LyricsWire carries distress
It's almost late
You can't control your pain
You can't contain it
Broken back for reassurance
Broken back, I know
I know your back is broken
I know your back is broken
I know you're tired
I know you're tired
I know you're tired
Don't sleep, don't sleep, don't sleep
Cool cat, hold your head
Cool cat, hold your head
Cool cat, hold your head, hold your head, man
Cool cat, hold your head, hold your head, man
Cuts, cuts, cuts somehow satisfy
Cuts, like drugs, somehow satisfy
Cuts, like drugs, somehow satisfy
Cuts, like drugs, somehow satisfy
Cuts, like drugs, somehow satisfy
Cuts, like drugs, somehow satisfy
Cuts, like drugs, somehow satisfy
Cuts, cuts, cuts like drugs
I told ya, cuts, cuts, cuts, like drugs
I told ya, cuts, cuts, cuts, like drugs
I told ya, cuts, cuts, cuts, like drugs
I told ya
Somehow satisfy
Somehow satisfy
Somehow satisfyEmbed
