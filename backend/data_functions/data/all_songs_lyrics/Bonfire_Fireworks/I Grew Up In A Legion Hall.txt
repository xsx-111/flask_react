I Grew Up In A Legion Hall LyricsI wouldn't call it romantic
While veterans drank in the basement
Of the packed hall where we met that fall
There's nothing I'd rather do
Than break fire codes with you
And my spend my nights on your front lawn
When these couple years won't let me catch a break
And keep throwing me on the ground
You make it feel like it's nothing at all
You make me feel stronger than all
With you I didn't care I slept through lectures
I only stayed those two semesters
It's always been those pieces of plastic
That I arranged alphabetically on a shelf
That taught me how to be myself
How to be...
You make it feel like it's nothing at all
You make me feel like I am stronger than it all
You make it feel like it's nothing at all
You make me feel like I am stronger than all
Stronger than all
You will always have my attention
It's something I don't even have to think about anymore
You will always be the life lesson
In a world that just lets down, you stand up with me now
You will always have my attention
(You make me feel like it's nothing at all)
It's something I don't even have to
(You make me feel)
Stronger than all
Stronger than all
