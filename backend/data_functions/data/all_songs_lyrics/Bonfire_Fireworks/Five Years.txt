Five Years LyricsI follow the signs to dead ends every time
For reasons you refuse to understand
No gleam in the future, just a shadow of doubt
But you take my hand and we walk so proud
You were the first and you may be the last one to enter my life
You were the first and you may be the last one to turn on the lights
(I follow the signs to dead ends every time
For reasons you refuse to understand.)
(No gleam in the future, just a shadow of doubt
But you take my hand and we walk so proud.)Embed
