Seasick LyricsYeah
We don't sink to the bottom, we rise
As your life slowly rots from the inside
Your throne is slowly slipping
From the side of the world
It's down to you in the corner
You've been pushed into
A mold of your father is what you've become
Melting in the neighborhood sun
You're living proof
Misery loves the company
I live how I want
And hope it never catches up on me
No, not on me
We don't sink to the bottom, we rise
I've learned to block out the world on the outside
Disconnect, disconnect
It never helps to reflect
It's down to you in the corner
You've been pushed into
A mold of your father's something you never wanted
Melting in the neighborhood
You're living proof
Misery loves the company
I live how I want
And hope it never catches up on me
No, not on me
Some are meant to wander
Some are meant to be what they wanted to be
Yeah, I live how I want
And hope it never catches up on me
Hope it never catches
Here's to feeling seasick
Here's to feeling seasick
While living landlocked
Living proof
Misery loves company
I live how I want
And hope it never catches up on me (2, 3, 4)
Here's to feeling seasick
While living landlocked
You're living landlocked
Before the anchor goes upEmbed
