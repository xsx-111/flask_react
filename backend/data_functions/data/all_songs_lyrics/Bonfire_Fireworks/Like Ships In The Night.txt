Like Ships In The Night LyricsI didn't need drugs to teach me not to care
My feet were already downers to a world up in the air
I'm on the outside and I'm choosing not to look in
I never fell too fast
My friends and I just like being those you see at night
Walking through graveyards like zombies
I want to soak in the moonlight
It's always been the common life
That always makes it self seem right
But I'll pass it like -
What matters most is how well you can walk through the war that's inside of your head
I can't stop this war inside my head
Trying to find myself. I can't give up on everything I've ever known before
But if I could write a letter to the person I once was
The return address would be, "I miss you, but I don't want to
Know you anymore" (don't know you anymore)
It's always been the common life
That always makes itself seem right
But I'll pass it like -
What matters most is how well you can walk through the war that's inside
Of your head
I can't stop this war inside my head (in my head)
I'll pass it like ships in the night
I won't let this world make my life an appointment
Time's just a measurement1Embed
