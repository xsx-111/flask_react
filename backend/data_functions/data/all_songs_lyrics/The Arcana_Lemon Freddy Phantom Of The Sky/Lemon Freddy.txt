Lemon Freddy Lyrics
Twisted lemon Freddy, Champagne at the ready, groovanorianum, celebrated phantom

See him in a pattern, dressed in purple satin, driving kinda lazy, checkpoint crazy

I can’t catch him, he’s jumping too high
Lemon Freddy, Freddy’s the phantom of the sky
I can’t catch him, he’s jumping too high
Lemon Freddy

Crypto publiciser, genuine disguiser, comes in any flavour, lemon drop blazer

Effervescent flunky, Hyde Park junky, prestidigitator, mind manipulator

I can’t catch him, he’s jumping too high
Lemon Freddy, Freddy’s the phantom of the sky
I can’t catch him, he’s jumping too high
Lemon Freddy

Golden arrow beamer, Murciélago screamer, terrifying sinner, cemetery winner
Futuristic Freddy, chain-gang ready, mademoiselle or madam, never out of fashion

I can’t catch him, he’s jumping too high
Lemon Freddy, Freddy’s the phantom of the sky
I can’t catch him, he’s jumping too high
Lemon Freddy

Phantom of the sky (pretty, pretty, pretty lemon Freddy)
