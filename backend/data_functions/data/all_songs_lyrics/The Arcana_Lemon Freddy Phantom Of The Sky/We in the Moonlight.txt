We in the Moonlight Lyrics
We in the moonlight see you down
We in the moonlight see you round
Looking up-up inside your lunar dream
We in the moonlight hear your scream

We in the moonlight love you, but that is not why
We in the moonlight lie

We in the moonlight draw you near
We in the moonlight sense your fear
Take a step up-up through our silver beam
We in the moonlight never dream

We in the moonlight love you, but that is not why
We in the moonlight lie

We in the moonlight cleanse the soul
We in the moonlight take control
Gliding up-up more, merge with the sky
We in the moonlight testify
We in the moonlight love you, but that is not why
We in the moonlight lieEmbed
