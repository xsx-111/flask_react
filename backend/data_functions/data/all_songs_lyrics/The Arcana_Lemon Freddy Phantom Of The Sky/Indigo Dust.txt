Indigo Dust Lyrics
Misty inside my curtains
I feel like Iâ€™ve gone away, hey
Oh no, something is hurting
Angels flying to day, hey

People getting lighter
Lighter in the air
Indie dust is rising, rising everywhere
Indigo dust

Silence falls in my echo
Laughter all disappears
Lightning, lighting my window
Raindrops falling like spears

Left behind the memory
Of the void gone by
Indie dust is rising, rising in the sky
Indigo dust . . 1Embed
