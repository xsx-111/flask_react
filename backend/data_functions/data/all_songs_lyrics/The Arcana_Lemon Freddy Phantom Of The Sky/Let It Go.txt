Let It Go Lyrics
Tell me something can you feel the pain that’s in my heart?
Never knowing where to place the blame

Is there any wonder that the Earth has come apart?
Still the papers print the Sunday game

Do you ever wonder why we’re here?
Is it time to open up our ears?
I can always wander wide and far
Take a trip and tell you where you are
All I need is time to let it go

Tell me something have you found a cloud so we can hide?
Will it burst and flood an empty sky?

Angel’s wings and Dante’s rings are in the ocean rise
Steal a kiss and dream with unshut eyes

Do you ever wonder why we’re here?
Is it time to open up our ears?
I can always wander wide and far
Take a trip and tell you where you are
All I need is time to let it goEmbed
