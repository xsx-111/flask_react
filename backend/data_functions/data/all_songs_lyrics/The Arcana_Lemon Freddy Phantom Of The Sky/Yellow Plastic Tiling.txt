Yellow Plastic Tiling Lyrics
Yellow plastic tiling floating through the air
Yellow plastic tiling nearly everywhere
The grass is green and the trees are brown
Silence is on the way
Orchard embers seed the ground
No-one who comes will stay

I’m falling down on my mind again
No matter what I just cannot keep awake
Sleepwalking and I might find a friend
But I am waiting for a knock on the gate
And we’ve all got something true
So we’re waiting for the light in you

Yellow plastic tiling has all disappeared
Yellow plastic tiling is no longer here
The world is hollow and I have found
An echo with no refrain
The milkman makes his plastic round
But nobody’s home again

I’m falling down on my mind again
No matter what I just cannot keep awake
Sleepwalking and I might find a friend
But I am waiting for a knock on the gate
And we’ve all got something true
So we’re waiting for the light in youEmbed
