Here I Am Lyrics
Here I am all alone
In a land of my own
Trees of glass fields of stone
Here I am far from home

But I know that it’s not real
Something here that I can feel
And I’d like to make those things come true

Here I am in the sea
Floating round endlessly
Mermaids swim up to me
Here I am can you see?

But I know that it’s not real
Something here that I can feel
And I’d like to make those things come true

And I like to know when it’s time to go
Will you wake me up with sounds that are fantastic?
We could walk through snow reading Sherlock Holmes
And recall the times and days when there was magic
Here I am in the moon
Witches fly on their brooms
Nightingales sing a song
Here I am shining on

But I know that it’s not real
Something here that I can feel
And I’d like to make those things come trueEmbed
