Rain Down Drifter Lyrics
Looking out the window at the rain
Your mind’s not the same but I can’t find a reason

Staring in your empty eyes at night
Where there once was a light
That shone like a beacon

But you, you’re in my dreams
And I never thought I’d miss you
And though, although it seems
From the moment when I kissed you
No, I never thought I’d miss you

Shapeless figures dancing in the glass
As the rain washes past
And the scene starts to wither

Standing gazing through me at the door
With your bags on the floor
Playing a part in a picture
But you, you’re in my dreams
And I never thought I’d miss you
And though, although it seems
From the moment when I kissed you
No, I never thought I’d miss you

Rain Down Drifter, never come back, never come back to me
Rain Down Drifter, never come back, never come back to me
Rain Down Drifter, never come back, never come back to meEmbed
