Pistol Grip Pump Lyrics
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas' shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine

I was raised in the hood called what the dif?
Where the brothers in the hood, we chivalrous
So I rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin' it
Full life, living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up
On my lap, it's on your lips, so track shot
A steel dick, more clip for pump but
All I'm saying there ain't no question who the man is
In my Civic or in this showbiz
I shit a fool, kill the fool, come on, what you say?
I think I can take care of all you motherfuckers, don't delay right away

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas' shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times, right?
'Cause tricks be out for your blind side
Never understood it, but remember I showed you
That in these times, you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well, that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin' high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If you're ever in trouble or on the double, best to call your pals
If you ain't got none now, sucka, I got a million
Styles around me
Are we getting along? We family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back, kid
Just don't be pointing one of them guns, aight man

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas' shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
They can be fuckin' wit' other niggas shit, but they can't be fuckin' wit' mine2Embed
