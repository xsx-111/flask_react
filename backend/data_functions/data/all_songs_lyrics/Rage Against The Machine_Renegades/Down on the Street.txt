Down on the Street LyricsDown on the street where the faces shine
Floatin' around on a real low mind
See a pretty thing in a wall
See a pretty thing in a wall
In a wall
In a wall
In a wall
Yeah

Yeah, deep in the night I'm lost in love

A thousand eyes, they look at you
A thousand eyes, they, they look at you
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Uh, where faces shine (Where face shine)
A real low mind (A real low mind)
Faces shine (Shine)
A real low, a real low, a real low, a real, real low
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
