Beautiful World LyricsIt's a Beautiful world we live in
A sweet romantic place
Beautiful people everywhere
The way they show they care
Makes me want to say
"It's a beautiful world
Oh, what a beautiful world
For you"
It's a wonderful time to be here
It's nice to be alive
Wonderful people everywhere
The way they comb their hair
Makes me want to say
"It's a wonderful place
Oh, what a wonderful place
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
Not me"2Embed
