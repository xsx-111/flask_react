Shellstar Lyrics
Nothing changes the condition
Dormant sooted desertion

When a violet peeling shows teeth glowing
Horizons fleeing, lilacs swaying
A sublime wander through summer fire
The char, the ash, the cough, the roar

I question the reason for the freedom in unfeeling
I question the reason in this furnace of revealing

Salvage the illusion
Of once mint gardens

Before a violet peeling showed teeth glowing
Horizons fleeing, lilacs swaying
When it takes you, you'll be remembered
Young and kind for all time

I question the reason for the freedom in unfeeling
I question the reason in this furnace of revealing
All my reasons gone

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Flooded with raining, levees are breaking
Houses are bursting, sisters are sleeping

Yearning for touch, but it's all too muchEmbed
