Lament for Wasps Lyrics
Frigid bedroom capture
In a spring without desire
Harvesting brightness despite
Drawn to the heat, not the light

I lay steady, stare at the ceiling
Waking fears of nothing
You lament for wasps, you glow cobalt
In the home of the friendliness

Another night spent fussing, feasting like the lords
Laughing at the fronting, singing to the chords
Of Hell imagined
To the chords of Hell imagined
Hell imagined
Hell imagined

In this perfect hour
Gasping in a sleepless kneel
Holding onto gleaming teal

I lay steady, stare at the ceiling
Waking fears of nothing
You lament for wasps, you glow cobalt
In the home of the friendliness
Another night spent fussing, feasting like the lords
Laughing at the fronting, singing to the chords
Of Hell imagined
To the chords of Hell imagined
Hell imagined
Hell imagined

Lament for wasps, cobalt blue
Lament for wasps, cobalt blue
Lament for wasps, cobalt blue
Lament for wasps, cobalt blue
(Once again this color sees an end)
Lament for wasps, cobalt blue
(Once again this color sees an end)
Lament for wasps, cobalt blue
(Once again this color sees an end)
Lament for wasps, cobalt blue
(Once again this color sees an end)
Lament for wasps, cobalt blue1Embed
