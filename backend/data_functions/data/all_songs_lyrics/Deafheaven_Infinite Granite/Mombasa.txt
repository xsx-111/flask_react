Mombasa LyricsStranded naked on the sandbar, echoed from the stars
Neon sea snake, cemetery roaming under dusk
Doberman visions, you're undressing
Mute and bleary
Hillside castles baking down to sand
Hillside castles baking down to sand
Shamed red Chopin plays awful sounds from the dresser
Nurses' hands carving in slate, hummingbird gestures
Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom
Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom
The hospital bed filled with your apathy
In a haze of heat, a father hums his tragic song
Before the cold sees its ceremony in your icy eyes
The daybreak glance given
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now4Embed
