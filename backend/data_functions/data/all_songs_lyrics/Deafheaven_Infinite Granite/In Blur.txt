In Blur Lyrics
In blur, father
Glanced over stirred
Imagined you laughing
Muddied feet dancing
What is this aching prism?
This prison wincing
Receiving sudden swaths of dogma

Wandering over royal yonder
Wandering over flooded ground again

What does daylight look like in this chaos of cold?
What does daylight look like?
Solitude and falling into respites now

In blur, hovered
Accepted devotion
Unearther, bleeding ark of creation

Wandering over royal yonder
Wandering over flooded ground again
What does daylight look like in this chaos of cold?
What does daylight look like?
Solitude and falling into respitеs now
What does daylight look like in this chaos of cold?
What does daylight look likе?
Solitude and falling into respites now

Who are you now?

Forgive the trembling love
I'm weak and acting bold
Forgive the trembling love
I'm weak and acting bold
And alone
And alone
And alone
And alone1Embed
