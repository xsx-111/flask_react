The Gnashing Lyrics
Buried secrets, mythic meanings
In tender oceans spilling crimson
A leaking thimble flowing fragile
Oozing tension into blue

Hear these howls hurling our present
I know what this costs us
Hear these howls, embrace the gnashing
I know what this costs us, I know it's exhausting you

A hush, a hush
Like cloaking garments over shivers
In this honeyed season, why are the boys bleeding?
Have your tears touched someone's eyes tonight?

Hear thesе howls hurling our present
I know what this costs us
Hear thеse howls, embrace the gnashing
I know what this costs us, I know it's exhausting you

Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason1Embed
