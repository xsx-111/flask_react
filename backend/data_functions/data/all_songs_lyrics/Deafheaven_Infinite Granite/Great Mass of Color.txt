Great Mass of Color Lyrics
Quiet as a cradle
I laid in a middle night drift, spinning
Hissed at the moon
Conjured up the flowers to fix my impression of the gloom

I feel them all, great mass of color
Flooded in my bed
I feel them all, big mass of color
Flooded in my bed, dissolving into red

Half-awake holding my ghost in the morning
Sunlight coming down the bend, maroon sky on the send
My great former terror when trees gave doves the leaves
And I was grim drunk death, a stranger to myself

I feel them all, great mass of color
Flooded in my bed
I feel them all, great mass of color
Flooded in my bed, dissolving into red

(Can I accept I'm real?)
Do I need this affection? (Do you?)
Do you need this confusion? (Do you?)
Living trapped inside this body
Soft, haunted, waiting, wanting
Measured change evades real healing
Taking love with little reason
Seeing you as I was, behind a locked door, nervous and a (Fool)
Seeing you as I was, desperate for men to guide (You)

You are the sea and nobody owns you, owns you
You are the sea and nobody owns you, owns you
Owns you, owns you, owns you, owns you2Embed
