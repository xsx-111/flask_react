Other Language Lyrics
In dreams speaking
In other language
Held you closely
Fed on lightning

How could you see
Beacons shining in the shallow?
How could you know
Relief while sinking to mirages out of view?

Crawl and wander
Tears to water
Growing this garden alone

How could you see
Beacons shining in the shallow?
How could you know
Relief while sinking to mirages out of view?
Blues and golds
Jewels for Heaven knows
I know I hear the sound
Imagine loving you at funerals for the few
Navel gazing, birds escaping
Before the quake comes crashing
Navel gazing, birds escaping
Waiting in the light to die
Bound wet legs splayed for the heat wave
For the heat wave
Bound wet legs splayed for the heat wave
Waiting in the light to dieEmbed
