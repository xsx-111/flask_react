Villain Lyrics
A cold floor fit for you
In all your midnight itching
No one coming quickly to save you from the after
Hurried with the hounds now

He's my own
(Eclipsing my love, his rottweiler sermon)
He's my own
(Driving the talons, my own villain rising)

Thirty months, I'm still asking if thirty months feels strong
Thirty months, I'm seeking a thirty months' fortune
Inform my mother's people thirty months is war
Dealing with the blood of thirty years well worn

He's my own
(Eclipsing my love, his rottweiler sermon)
He's my own
(Driving the talons, my own villain rising)

You're not alarmed by this heady division?
You're not alarmed by this heady division?
My own villain rising
My own villain rising1Embed
