Crash Into Me Lyrics
You've got your ball, you got your chain
Tied to me tight, tie me up again
Who's got their claws in you my friend?
Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock, and sweet you roll
Lost for you, I'm so lost, for you

Oh, when you come
Crash into me
And I come into you
And I come into you
In a boy's dream, in a boy's dream

Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare boned, and crazy for you

Oh, when you come
Crash into me
Yeah, baby, when I come into you
In a boy's dream, a boys dream
If I've gone overboard
Then I'm begging you
To forgive me for my haste
When I'm holding you so girl
Close to me
And you come
Crash into me, baby
And I come into you

Hike up your skirt a little more
And show the world to me
Hike up your skirt a little more
And show your world to me
A boy's dream, in a boys dream
Oh I watch you there
Through the window
And I stare at you
You wear nothing but you
Wear it so well
Tied up and twisted
The way I'd like to be
For you, for me, come crash
Into me
Baby, come crash into me, yeah
Crash into me
Crash into me
Oh, you know
I'm king of the castle
You're my dirty rascal
Crash into me
Please crash into me baby
We both know
See the way, come crash into me
See the way you come rash into me
Crash into me
Oh no no no no hey
Oh no no no no hey, yeah15Embed
