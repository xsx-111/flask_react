Too Much Lyrics
Ooh, straight in, suck up and go
Cool it, swallow, swallow
Bow, breathe deep, take it all
It comes cheap
Push it through the doors
Cause in between the lines
I'm gonna pack more lines
So I can get in
Ooh traffic jam got more cars
Than a beach got sand
Suck it up suck it up suck it up
Fill it up until no more
I'm no crazy creep, I've got it coming
To me because I'm not satisfied
The hunger keeps on growing

I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much

I've got to get it somewhere
I mean, you never know, maybe
You're dreaming
Who do you think you're watching
Who do you think you need
Play for me, play more
Ten times in the same day
I need more
I'm going, over my borders
I'm going to take more
More from you, letter by letter
I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much


I told god I'm coming
To your country
I'm going to eat up your cities
Your homes, you know
I've got a stomach full it's not
A chip on my shoulder
I've got this growl in my tummy
And I'm gonna stop it today

I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much

Hey
Suck it up, suck it up
Suck it up, suck it up, suck it up, yeah
Suck it up, suck it up, suck it up
Suck it up, suck it up, suck it up baby
I eat too much
I drink too much
I want too much
Too much

(Gotta get it somewhere)
(I eat too much)Embed
