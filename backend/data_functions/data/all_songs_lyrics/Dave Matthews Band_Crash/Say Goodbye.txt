Say Goodbye Lyrics
So here we are tonight
You and me together
The storm outside and the fire is bright
Oh, and in your eyes I see
What's on my mind
You've got me wild
Turned around inside
And then desire, see, is creeping up heavy
Inside here
And know you feel the same way I do now
Now let's make this an evening
Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight
Stay here with me, love, tonight
Just for an evening
When we make
Our passion pictures
You and me twist up
Secret creatures
And we'll stay here
Tomorrow go back to being friends
Oh, go back to being friends
But tonight let's be lovers
Oh, we kiss and sweat
We'll turn this better thing
To the best
Of all we can offer, just a rogue kiss
Tangled tongues and lips
You see me this way
I'm turning and turning for you
Oh, girl, oh, just tonight
Float away here with me
Oh, an evening, oh, just wait and see
But tomorrow go back to your man
I'm back to my world
And we're back to being friends
Oh, wait and see me
Oh, tonight, oh, let's do this thing
All we are is wasting hours
Til the sun comes, it's all ours
On our way here
And tomorrow go back to being friends
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, go back to being friends
Tonight let's be lovers, oh, please
Tonight let's be lovers, say you will
Tonight let's be lovers, oh, yes
Tonight let's be lovers
And hear me call
Oh, soft spoken, whispering love
A thing or two I have to say here
Oh, tonight let's go all the way then
Oh, love, I'll see you
Just for an evening
Oh, let's strip down, trip out at this
One evening's love starts with a kiss
And away here
And tomorrow back to being friends, yeah
But now lovers, love, yeah
Just for tonight, one night, love you
Tomorrow say goodbye
Tomorrow say goodbye
Tomorrow say goodbye1Embed
