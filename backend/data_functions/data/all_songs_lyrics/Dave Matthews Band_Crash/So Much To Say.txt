So Much To Say Lyrics
I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside
Can't see the light
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky
Got central heating and I'm alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, can't see the light
Keep it locked up inside don't talk about it
T-t-talk about the weather
Yeah, yeah, yeah, can't see the light
Open up my head and let me out little baby
Cause here we have been standing for a long long time
Treading trodden trails for a long long time
I say my hell is the closet I'm stuck inside
Can't see the light
And my heaven is a nice house in the sky
Got central heating and I'm alright
Cause here we have been standing for a long long time
Treading trodden trails for a long long time, time, time, time, time, time, time

I find sometimes it's easy to be myself
Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else

I see you young and soft oh little baby
Little feet
(Little hands)
Little hands
(Little feet)
Little baby
One year of crying and the words creep up inside
Creep into your mind, yeah
So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say
So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say
Cause here we have been standing for a long long time
Treading trodden trails for a long long time, time, time, time, time, time, time
I find sometimes it's easy to be myself
Sometimes I find it's better to be somebody else

So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say
So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say
So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say
So much to say, so much to say, so much to say, so much to say

Open up my head and let me out
Little baby4Embed
