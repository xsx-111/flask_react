Flushings LyricsPick a side, dig
Nice and soft
Think of someone
To help you along, Ike
Amused me once
Manchild son
Getting to be
Anyone
Serves me well
Flush your head
Who can ever tell
Wanna be made
It's time to laugh now
If you're supposed to
If being brain dead
Is what you want to do
You plant your face again
Into the screen, right
Let it grow
Skin snot tight
Serves me well
Flush your head
Who can ever tell
Wanna be made, rightEmbed
