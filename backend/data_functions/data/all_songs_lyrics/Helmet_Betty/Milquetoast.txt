Milquetoast LyricsTell me if you think it's all right
I'll give in to what you know
I don't see the habits that become me
I've saved up my useless thoughts
Well means, it works, I'm on your side
I said that? Well, so, I lied
Remember, I tried not to be wary
This failed me once too much
Unrecognized
Well preserved
Don't forget what you heardEmbed
