Sam Hell LyricsSam invents the you you want to see
Don't believe in predestiny
Bacon you never need to bring home
Sam Hell gets you redeemed
By grace alone
Sam's the mayor of First Avenue
Nothing goes on he doesn't want to
A wife that wears his 'in' stocking hat
She's known for making good
Gravy and cat
Heart attack
Time to eat and pay
Cellulite won't wash away
You never knew if you'd been dead or just old
Sam Hell never gets that coldEmbed
