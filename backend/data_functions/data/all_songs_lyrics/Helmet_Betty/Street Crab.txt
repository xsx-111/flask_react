Street Crab LyricsFirst I'll panic quick and listen to advice
Agree to anything and try to be too nice
Then my skin flakes, another allergy
I'm not making sense, just ignore me
Thirst I had at last, run the water
Shut my mouth and run past
What's the matter?
Street crabs buy in fast, infect the water
Safe and sound like the perfect food
Ice the beer, it's easy to feel good
What was that you said? I thought I heard my name
But every street crab will push the vowels the same
Thirst I had at last, run the water
Shut my mouth and run past
What's the matter?
Street crabs buy in fast, infect the water
I shut my mouth and run past
So what's the matter?Embed
