Beautiful Love LyricsBeautiful love, you're all a mystery
Beautiful love, what have you done to me?
I was contented 'till you came along
Thrilling, my soul with your song
Beautiful love, you're all a mystery
Beautiful love, what have you done to me?
I was contented 'till you came along
Will my dreams come true
Beautiful love,I've roamed your paradise
Searching for love, my dreams to realise
Reaching for heaven,depending on you
Beautiful love,will my dreams come trueEmbed
