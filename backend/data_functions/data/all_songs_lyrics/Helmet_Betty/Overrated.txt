Overrated LyricsToday's another day
You won't deny that
It came so slow
You don't remember when you got so fat
Up above the bathroom mirror
The light'll make you weak
But it's that pacifying lie
That grows now every week
With every week
And still you hate it
It's overrated
I'll never forget things like who did what
Cover old ground and drag what's useless up
I won't feel guilty about being late again
There's no one to answer to and no one to hateEmbed
