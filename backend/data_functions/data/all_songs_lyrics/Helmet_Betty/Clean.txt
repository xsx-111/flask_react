Clean LyricsSpread you mind the fish feed
Don't ignore my speech my heart bleeds
Make yourself the perfect butt
Some passing thought, I don't know what
Don't remind me
I'll fake what I need to
Get back in case the door swings and
Don't forget to hide your mood rings
Fit to tie, I thought I knew
Good company, I'd like to be you
You're right behind me
A mouth all I read
Don't remind me
I'll fake what I need to
You're right behind me
A mouth all I readEmbed
