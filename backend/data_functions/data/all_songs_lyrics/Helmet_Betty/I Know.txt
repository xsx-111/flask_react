I Know LyricsWafer thin, the waif is in
She's chlorine, clean and portion fed
Feed the dog, slop the hog
Shine the baptist and debark the log

It's all right
I know
You're the only one
Who can show us at all
Get it done, circulate
What I hear, fear motivates
So intense, so sensitive
In your head where fashion lives

It's all right
I know
You're the only one
Who can show us at all
It's OK
I know
You're mean and hard
And bored
It's always, always, always
It's always something1Embed
