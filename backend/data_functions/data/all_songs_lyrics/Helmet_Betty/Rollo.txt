Rollo LyricsSorry for myself
I've lost my karmic wealth
But I can take from you
With antiseptic stealth
I'll dig my own grave
Get my front yard paved
There's always a penny earned
Another dollar saved
I always make my point
Soak bread in dirty oil
"Right"'s too strong a word
The neighborhood's been spoiled
But I know what I know
So fuck that inner glow
I don't have time to learn
I said I know what I know
I'm wrong, I won't admit it
I won't get itEmbed
