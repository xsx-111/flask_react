Vaccination LyricsPetty news, it's only your bad ear
It might be worth it
To watch what you hear
Feeling great now you expand your view
You can't forget, somebody hates you
Justify my worst behavior
Search in blood-lines
Exchange a favor
Humble goals
Bad nutrition
Rely on me
There's one condition
Humble goals
Bad nutrition
Rely on me
There's one condition
Imitated
So adored
The wind picks up
My suit gets tornEmbed
