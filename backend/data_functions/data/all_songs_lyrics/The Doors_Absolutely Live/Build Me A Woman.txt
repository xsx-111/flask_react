Build Me A Woman LyricsGive me a witness, darling, I need a witness, babe
I got the poontang blues, yeah
I got the poontang blues, yeah
Top of my head down to the bottom of my cowboy shoes, alright
Build me a woman, make her ten feet tall
You got to build me a woman, make her ten feet tall
Don't make her worthless
Don't make her small, right, oh, come on
You got to build me a woman, make her ten feet tall
Build me a woman, make her ten feet tall
Don't make her worthless, don't make her small
Build me someone I can ball all night longEmbed
