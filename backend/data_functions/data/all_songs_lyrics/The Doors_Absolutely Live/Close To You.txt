Close To You LyricsAh, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know if you realize it but tonight you're in for a special treat
(Grunting noises)
No, no, no, not that, not that... You only get that treat on full moons
Besides, I, I knew there are a lot of young people out there and I would want anybody to faint or wash anything out
Last time it happened, grown men where weeping. Policemen where turning in their badges
Oh, I get it, I get it, everyone was intimidated tonight by all the security precautions and everything, oh!
Well, just remember their motto is, "Protect and served."
I wanna get close to you baby like black on white
Close to you baby like the coldest of ice
Close to you baby like a Siamese twin
Close to you baby like I'm feeling all right
I wanna get close to you baby
Well, close to you baby
Close to you baby
I don't know what to say or do
I wanna get close to you baby like the sight of your eye
Close to you baby like the heat is to fire
Close to you baby, close as I can get
Close to you baby like water is wet
I wanna get close to you baby
I said, "Close to you baby"
Close to you baby
I don't know what to say or do
I wanna get close to you baby till I'm feeling all right
Close to you baby, gonna love you all night
Close to you baby in new York city
I love you so much woman, you know it's a pity
I wanna get close to you baby
I said, "Close to you baby"
Close to you baby
I don't know what to say or do
I wanna get closer and closer babe
Closer and closer babe
Closer and closer babe
Closer and closer babe
I wanna close to you babe
You don't know what to say or do
Well, closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby
I wanna close to you baby
Oh baby, we love you
And you make me feel all right
Make me feel all right
Make Robbie feel all right
And you make John feel all right
And make Jim feel all right
And we wanna love you so much to you
I don't know what to say or do
All rightEmbed
