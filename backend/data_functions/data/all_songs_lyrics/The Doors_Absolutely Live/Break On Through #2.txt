Break On Through #2 LyricsWhen I was back there in seminary school
There was a person there who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the lord with prayer
Petition the lord with prayer!
Petition the lord with prayer!
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!
Dead cats, dead rats
Did you see what they were at, alright
Dead cat in a top hat, woo!
Suckin on a young man's blood
Wishing he could come, yeah
Suckin on a soldier's brain wishing it would be the same
Dead cat, dead rat
Did you see what they were at
Fat cat in a top hat
Thinks he's an aristocrat
Thinks he can kill and slaughter
Thinks he can shoot my daughter
Oh yeah, alright, hey
Dead cats, dead rats, think you're an aristocrat
Crap, that's crap
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide
Break on through to the other side
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
Still recall the time we cried
Break on through to the other side
Woo!
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She gets! She gets! (x2)
She gets high, she gets high
My woman gets high, my woman gets high
My baby gets high, my baby gets high (etc)
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain
Eyes that lie
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through, yeah, alright
Made the scene
Week to week
Day to day
Hour to hour
The gate is straight
Deep and wide
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
