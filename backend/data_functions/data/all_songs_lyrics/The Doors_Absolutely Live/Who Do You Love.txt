Who Do You Love LyricsI walked 47 miles on barbed wire
Cobra snake for a necktie
Built a house by the roadside
Made of rattlesnake hide
Brand new chimney made on top
Made out of human skulls
Come on, baby, take a walk with me
Tell me who do you love?
Who do you love now?
Who do you love now?
Who do you love, babe?
I say, "Who now, who do you love?"
Tombstone head, a graveyard mind
Just 22, I don't mind dying
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip
Come on, baby, don't give me no lip
Who do you love now?
Who do you love?
Who do you love, child?
I said, "Who, baby, who do you love?"
Night is dark, the sky was blue
Down the alley the ice wagon flew
Hit a bump, somebody screamed
Should'a heard just what I seen
Do you love him, babe?
Do you love her, yeah
Do you love me, babe?
Do you love it, yeah, yeah
Well, who, baby, who you love?
What do you love now, babe?
Love, love, love me, babe
Love, love, love me, darling1Embed
