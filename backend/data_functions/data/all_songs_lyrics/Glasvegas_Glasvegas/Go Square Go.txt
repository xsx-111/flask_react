Go Square Go Lyrics
If he wants to fight you
At the school gates
Half past four grab your bag
Don't you be late
If he wants to hit you
Hit you in the face
If he wants to hurt you
In front of your mates
If he wants you to run away
Run away, run away
Don't you fucking run away!

Go square go!

Don't you wait for the bell
To ring ding a-ling-a-ling
One step forward then a
Bada-bada-bing
Don't you make
Go down to the pub
With all my mates knowing
Some individual smahed you up
It's just something
That you'll have to face
Face to face
Man to man
Here and now
Biff bang pow


I don't really feel too good
My heart is beating faster
My dad told me
Not to come home
If I don't kill this bastard
My dad is right, my dad is right
My dad is right, my dad is right
Win, lose or draw the fight
This bullying has got to stop tonight

Here we, here we
Here we fucking goEmbed
