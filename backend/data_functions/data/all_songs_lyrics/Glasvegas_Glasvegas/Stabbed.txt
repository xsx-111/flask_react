Stabbed Lyrics
I'm going to get stabbed
The Baltic Fleeto are up my arse
No cavalry could ever save me
I'm going to get stabbed

You don't want to stab me
You don't want to stab me
Because you don't know my family
And our capabilities
You don't want to stab me

I had my choice, I took my choice
That was to stand and fight the Fleeto Boys
But now I find myself running for my life
I seen their swords and their knives
And I changed my mind

Its time to go
Its time to run
Run rabbit run
Run rabbit runEmbed
