Geraldine Lyrics
When your sparkle evades your soul
I'll be at your side to console
When you're standing on the window ledge
I'll talk you back, back from the edge
I will turn, I will turn your tide
Be your shepherd, I swear, be your guide
When you're lost in your deep and darkest place around
May my words walk with you home safe and sound

When you say that I'm no good you feel like walking
I need to make sure you know it's just the prescription talking
When your feet decide to walk you on the wayward side
Climbing up upon the stairs and down the downward slide

I will turn, I will turn your tide
Do all that I can to heal you inside
I will be the angel on your shoulder
My name is Geraldine, I'm your social worker

I see you
Need me
I know you do
I see you
Need me
I know you do
I know you do

I will turn, I will turn your tide
Do all that I can to heal you inside
I will be the angel on your shoulder
My name is Geraldine, I'm your social workerEmbed
