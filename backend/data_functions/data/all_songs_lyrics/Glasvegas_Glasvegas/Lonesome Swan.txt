Lonesome Swan Lyrics
Lonesome swan
Tell me what is wrong?
So you feel that we've all moved on
And you're feeling so alone?

Kids can be cruel
You know that's fair to say
But remember when the kids once said
You were queen of the waves upon the ocean bed

You were the dream boat pedalo
But now that's all in the past
But let me tell you that this loneliness will pass
And be a part of the past also

So for now dust down your weary sails
For tomorrow is a bright new day
With someone waiting in the wings
To pedal with you upon the ocean wavesEmbed
