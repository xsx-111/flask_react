The Prettiest Thing on Saltcoats Beach LyricsGo write a message in the sand
Of what you want to say to me
Ice-cream won't be long
Now that I'm here with you
The glistening sea runs through your hands
As you float upon the sparkling sands
The setting sun shines on your hair
I'm walking on the salty air
You are...the prettiest thing
On saltcoats beach
Hand in hand
We stare across the oceans waves
Promise me
We'll do this again some day
The glistening sea runs through your hands
As you float upon the sparkling sands
The setting sun shines on your hair
I'm walking on the salty air
You are...the prettiest thing
On saltcoats beachEmbed
