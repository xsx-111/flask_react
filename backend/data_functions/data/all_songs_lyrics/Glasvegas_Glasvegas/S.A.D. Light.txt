S.A.D. Light Lyrics
Winter blues no love for you
Seasons change in a gothic way
10,000 lux to light us up
In these winter nights if I'm wandering all alone

I'll turn on my S.A.D. light

As I'm staring at Alpha Centauri
All I can see is low its glow seems so far
How did I get to this point of things playing
So heavy on my heart
Twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
