Flowers & Football Tops Lyrics
Baby, why you not home yet
Baby, it's getting late
I wish you would be home by now
Door bell rings
Just who could it be at this time?
Police on my left and right
My son's not coming home tonight

Baby, they don't need to show
It's over, I know
Baby, they don't need to show
Flowers and football tops, I know

Baby, baby, why you? (x2)

No sweeping exits
No Hollywood endings
Flowers and football tops don't mean a thing
My baby is six feet under
Just another number
My daughter without her brother



Baby, baby, baby, my baby
My baby, baby, baby... is gone


You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy, when skies are grey
I hope you noticed, how much I loved you
How could they take my sunshine awayEmbed
