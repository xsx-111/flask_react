Wonderous Stories Lyrics
I awoke this morning
Love laid me down by the river
Drifting I turned on up stream
Bound for my forgiver

In the giving of my eyes to see your face
Sound did silence me, leaving no trace

I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Beg to hear your wonderous stories, la-la-la

He spoke of lands not far
Nor lands they were in his mind
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time

In no time at all he took me to the gate
In haste I quickly checked the time, if I was late

I had to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Had to hear your wonderous stories, la-la-la, la-la-la
Hearing
Hearing, hearing your wonderous stories
Hearing your wonderous stories

It is no lie, I see deeply into the future
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there

To stand so cautiously at first, and then so high
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky

I bid it to return, to hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la

Hearing
Hearing
Hearing
