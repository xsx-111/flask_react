Only When I Lose Myself Lyrics
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotised, I feel paralysed
I have found heaven

There's a thousand reasons why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here I can think of two
To keep me hanging on feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself

I can feel the emptiness inside me fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment now that you are here
I feel satisfied, I belong inside
Your velvet heaven
Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this?
Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss?
Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand
Before I could even start to understand?

It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself
It's only when I lose myself with someone else
That I find myself, I find myself1Embed
