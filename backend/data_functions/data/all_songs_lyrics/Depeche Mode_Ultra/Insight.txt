Insight Lyrics
This is an insight
Into my life
This is a strange flight
I'm taking
My true will
Carries me along

This is a soul dance
Embracing me
This is the first chance
To put things right
Moving on
Guided by the light

And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns

Wisdom of ages
Rush over me
Heighten my senses
Enlighten me
Lead me on
Eternally
And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns


And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns

I'm talking to you now
The fire still burns
Whatever you do now
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
The world still turns
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
I'm talking to you now
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
The fire still burns
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
Whatever you do now
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
The world still turns
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
I'm talking to you now
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)
(Give love, you've got to give love)
(You've got to give love, you've got to give love)2Embed
