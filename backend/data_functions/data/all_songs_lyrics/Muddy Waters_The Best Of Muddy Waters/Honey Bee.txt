Honey Bee Lyrics
Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

You going to keep on sailing till you lose your happy home


I don't mind you sailing, but please don't sail so long
All right little honey bee
I hear a lot of buzzing, sound like my little honey bee
She been all around the world making honey
But now she is coming back home to meEmbed
