Waitress Song Lyrics
I could move to a small town
And become a waitress
Say my name was Stacey
And I was figuring things out
See, my baby, he left me
And I don't feel like it tonight

I remember sleepless nights
I remember Chicago
I remember the music
From the downstairs bar
Girls, they just want to have fun
And the rest of us hardly know who we are

It's a dark, twisted road we are on
And we all have to walk it alone

I could join the circus
When they come to town
Me and the freaks, the tamers
And that old sad clown
I'd walk across that tightrope
Head held high
So close to death
I've never more alive
But you know, It's a dark, twisted road we are on
And we all have to walk it alone

I could drive out to the ocean
And just stare in awe
I could walk 'cross the beaches
And sleep under the stars

Our love would seem trivial and obscure
Now we'll never feel lost anymore2Embed
