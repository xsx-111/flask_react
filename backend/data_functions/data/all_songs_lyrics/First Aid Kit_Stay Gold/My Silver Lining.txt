My Silver Lining Lyrics
I don't want to wait anymore
I'm tired of looking for answers
Take me some place where there's music and there's laughter
I don't know if I'm scared of dying
But I'm scared of living too fast, too slow
Regret, remorse, hold on, oh no I've got to go
Thereâ€™s no starting over
No new beginnings time races on
And you've just gotta keep on keeping on
Gotta keep on going
Looking straight out on the road
Can't worry 'bout what's behind you
Or what's coming for you further up the road
I try not to hold on to what is gone
I try to do right what is wrong
I try to keep on keeping on
Yeah, I just keep on keeping on

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Oh-oh
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Oh-oh
I've woken up in a hotel room
My worries as big as the moon
Having no idea who or what or where I am
Something good comes with the bad
A song's never just sad
There's hope, there's a silver lining
Show me my silver lining
Show me my silver lining

I hear a voice calling
Calling out for me
These shackles I've made in an attempt to be free
Be it for reason, be it for love
I won't take the easy road
I won't take the easy road
The easy road, the easy road, oh-oh!
I won't take the easy road
The easy road, the easy road, oh-oh!
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Oh-oh
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Oh-oh

Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on
Show me my silver lining, I try to keep on keeping on28Embed
