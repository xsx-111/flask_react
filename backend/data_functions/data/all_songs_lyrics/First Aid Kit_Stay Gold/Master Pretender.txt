Master Pretender Lyrics
Never thought that I was weak
Always thought I could get hurt pretty bad
Still get up on my own two feet
I always believed that I was free
That I had some sense of integrity
That would rise above whatever tried to change me

But honey, now I won't wait
For something to bring me round and smile
â€˜Cause that only sticks for a while
Then I'm back again

Oh, I'm a master pretender

I always knew that I was young
But with (a head held high and a sharp tongue)
(I could fool most anyone)
I never expected to be struck
By the (fatal hands of fortune)
(Or by sheer bad luck)

Honey, now we won't change
And memories just rearrange
And fall into place
So I'm back again
Oh, I'm a master pretender

All the streets of New York City
Sure look pretty from way up here
And I was headed home
Just felt more alone
The further I'd go

I always thought that you'd be here
But shit gets fucked up and people just disappear

So honey, now, don't be mad
Time has told me it can't be that bad
And if it is, well, I'll be goddamned
But I'll stick around

I'll be your master defender
Yeah, I'll stick around
I'll be your master defender

Yeah!3Embed
