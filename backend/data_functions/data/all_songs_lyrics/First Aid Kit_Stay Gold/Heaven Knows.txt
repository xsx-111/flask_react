Heaven Knows Lyrics
You've spent a year staring into a mirror
Another one trying to figure out what you saw
Paid so much attention to what you're not
You have no idea who you are

But heaven knows, knows
That you're lying
As far as heaven goes, heaven goes
I just stopped trying

Now I can hear every word you're saying
I'm just not sure I want to know
You can play the fool and still follow the rules
If you seem like you care you're good

But heaven knows, knows
That you're lying
As far as heaven goes, heaven goes
I just stopped trying

You've lost yourself in others'
Expectations of you
Now you prefer this caricature before being true
But you're better than that
You're so much better than that
I know you better than that
Now baby, tell me, what's your story?
Do you think it'll ever sell?
And what'll you do if it comes down to it?
If it all goes straight to hell?

But heaven knows, knows
That you're lying
As far as heaven goes, heaven goes
I just stopped trying
Heaven knows (heaven knows)
Heaven knows
Heaven knows (heaven knows)
Heaven knows
That you're lying1Embed
