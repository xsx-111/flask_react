Stay Gold Lyrics
The sun shone high those few summer days
Left us in a soft, wide-eyed haze
It shone like gold
It shone like gold
But just as the moon it shall stray
So dawn goes down today
No gold can stay
No gold can stay

What if our hard work ends in despair?
What if the road won't take me there?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
What if to love and be loved's not enough?
What if I fall and can't bear to get up?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
We could stay gold

We're on our way through rugged land
Top of that mountain we wanted to stand
With hearts of gold
With hearts of gold
But there is only forward, no other way
Tomorrow's your hope at the end of the day
And gold turns grey
And gold turns grey
What if our hard work ends in despair?
What if the road won't take me there?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
What if to love and be loved's not enough?
What if I fall and can't bear to get up?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
We could stay gold

All of my dreams, they fall and form a bridge
Of memories where I can get back
All of my dreams, they fall and form a bridge
Of memories where I can get back
To you, you

What if our hard work ends in despair?
What if the road won't take me there?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
What if to love and be loved's not enough?
What if I fall and can't bear to get up?
Oh, I wish, for once
We could stay gold
We could stay gold
Could stay gold
