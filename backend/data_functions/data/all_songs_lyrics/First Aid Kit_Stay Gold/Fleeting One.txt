Fleeting One Lyrics
Now, I see winter's dawn
The wind turns traitor cold
Seems long since summer time
And the stories that were told
We spoke of dreams that came to us
When we were young
But as the morning rose
We spoke with forked tongues

My love is a fleeting one
My man could be anyone
And our love is a setting sun

As we took those evening walks
Down through the graveyard
Those names engraved always
Put a new shade to my thoughts
But he and I, we both knew
The bread that we'd break
Would never take their place
What's cold, you mustn't awake

My life is a fleeting one
My work is just a web I've spun
Oh, my life is a setting sun
I don't know where I'm going
But no one is coming with me
I won't give up, chasing the sun
Here I go, look at me run
Here I go
Look at me run
Here I go
Look at me run

My love is a fleeting one
My man could be anyone
And our love is a setting sun
My life is a fleeting one
My work is just a web I've spun
Oh, my life is a setting sun

Baffled by the lives we'd been lent
We met the end too soon
I was honest when I told you
We're as cryptic as the moon2Embed
