Shattered & Hollow Lyrics
I am in love, and I am lost
But I'd rather be
Broken than empty
Oh, I'd rather be
Shattered than hollow
Oh, I'd rather be
By your side

Now I can't believe that it's been five years
Since we both stood here
Looking out at this city
With minds so bold and hearts so clear
We said, we are going to get out of here
We said, we are going to get out of here

We are going to get out of here
Run from all the fears
Follow what we once held dear
When will we get out of here?

Now I am tired but resolute
That I'd rather be
Striving than settled
Oh, I'd rather be
Moving than static
Oh, I'd rather be
By your side
Now I can't believe that it will be so long
Till we both are here
Looking out at this city
Knowing all we ever wanted is gone

We are going to get out of here
Run from all the fears
Follow what we once held dear
When will we get out of here?

Time, time is a fickle thing
Let's see what it can bring
I cannot leave you behind
Time, time's running out
My hands, oh give me your hands
I cannot leave you behind

We are going to get out of here
Run from all the fears
Follow what we once held dear
When will we get out of here?
We said, we are going to get out of here
We said, we are going to get out of here2Embed
