A Long Time Ago Lyrics
I fell in love with you
Long before I knew
What it meant to give everything up
I was a rolling stone
Rolling my way along
Till you came
And made sense out of everything

But you couldn't wait
I couldn't promise you anything
If it was all a mistake
Then I guess we're both to blame

I could've been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you
I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know
I lost you a long time ago

City of strangers
Out of danger
In your arms I was half awake, half asleep
Grab a hold to what I've got
Regretting all that I'm not
I couldn't be the one who'd stand by your side
If it was all a mistake
Then I guess we're both to blame

I could've been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you
I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know
I lost you a long time ago

I hold no grudges
I come bearing forgiveness
Only love
Only love
Even if it's not enough
Only love
Only love
Even if it's not enough
Now I know
I lost you a long time ago
I could've been
So many things
But it would never be enough for you
I was the one
You counted on
But I was never the one for you
Now I know
I lost you a long time agoEmbed
