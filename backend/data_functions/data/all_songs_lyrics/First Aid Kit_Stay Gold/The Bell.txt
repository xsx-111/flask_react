The Bell Lyrics
Don't place your bets on me
I'm tired and I'm lonely
With nothing to offer you
Nothing to offer you
The pavement stares grey and cold
Our lives are a story told
Coming to an ending
It's coming to an ending

How could I turn around?
Face the sound of the bell that chimes?
Ring it out, trill and loud
To drag me back down
But I'm not coming home

Been out here for so long
The road just stretches on
Till I stop pretending
Till I stop pretending
But the world is an empty frame
And now you are just a name
I'll keep it that way
It's staying that way
How could I turn around?
Face the sound of the bell that chimes?
Ring it out, trill and loud
To drag me back down
But I'm not coming home

I tried hard to be brave
I tried hard not to be afraid
But trying wasn't enough
I tried hard to be brave
I tried hard not to be afraid
But trying wasn't enough

I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Can you hear the bell?
Can you hear the bell?
The bell, the bell
Can you hear the bell?
Can you hear the bell?
The bell, the bell

From the rust that lies deep in its throat
I hear solemn tones
The danger, the absent floors
In the silence of night he lets me know
That I'm not coming home5Embed
