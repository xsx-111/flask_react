Brother Lyrics
Brother, you are my guiding star
Forever, you roam, I won't be far
I have so many things to learn from you
I was so lost until you came through
And led me through the dark

Brother, come close don't stray away
For I know
You'll turn and run from us some day
Like you must
We all do
I've been there too
If it all gets too real
I know how you feel
And I'll be your guiding light

Världen är så stor min bror
Den är så skrämmande stor
När det blir för tungt, min bror
Lägger du tyngden på mig då?

Brother, I haven't always been near
There's so much I've been through the last couple of years
You did grow
Leaps and bounds
With or without me
Here I am
Understand it's where I want to be
I'll follow you
My guiding starEmbed
