Stranger Things LyricsCold toes, new sheets
Welcomed all the same
We know if we go
It's only temporary
Went away, holiday
Wish they'd linger on
They'll think what they will
We'll stay where we have gone
The glaring lamp's on
Her job is well done
Half asleep, I'm only half won
Old sheets, warm toes
Look away as i leave
New light lays bare
Holds my guilt up to me
I'll toast three cheers
And for work we'll sing
Back to what we do
I've heard stranger things
So turn the lamp off
My wandering eyes stop
Endure the thoughts of
And start where you love
We'll start from where we last left off
The lines that we'll draw
Begin and don't stop
The corners approach
We'll take the best turns
The bends have brought talk
Of what we have learned
Enjoy the chance of
Frozen new grounds
Everything's odd
With beautiful sounds
I've learned to smile
Without a bearing
At least I know I've heard stranger thingsEmbed
