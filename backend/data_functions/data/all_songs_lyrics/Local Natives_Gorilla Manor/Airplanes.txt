Airplanes Lyrics
The desk where you sit inside of a frame
Made of, made of, of wood
I keep those chopsticks you had from when you
Taught abroad, taught abroad in Japan

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back

I did not know you
As well as my father, father knew you
Every question you took the time to sit and
Look it up, look it up in the encyclopedia

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back
I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back
It sounds like we would have had a great deal
To say, to say to each other
I bet when I leave my body for the sky
The wait, the wait will be worth it

I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back
I love it all
So much I call
I want you back, back, back
You back6Embed
