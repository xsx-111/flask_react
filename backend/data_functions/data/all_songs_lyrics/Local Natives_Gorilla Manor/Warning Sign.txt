Warning Sign Lyrics(Aaaah aaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaaah aaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaaah aaaah aaaaah aaaah aaaah aaaah aaaah aaaah aaaah)
Warning sign
Warning sign
I hear it, but I pay no mind
Hear my voice
Hear my voice
It's saying something
It's not very nice
Pay attention
Pay attention
I'm talking to you
And I hope you're concentrating
I've got money now
I've got money now
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
Warning sign of things to come
Happened before, it'll happen again
Hear my voice
Move my hair
Move it around a lot
I don't care what I remember
(Aaaah aaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaaah)
Warning sign
Warning sign
Look at my hair
I like the design
It's the truth
It's the truth
Your glassy eyes
And your open mouth
Take it easy, baby
Take it easy
It's a natural thing
So relax
I've got money now
I've got money now
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
Warning sign of things to come
Love is here, but I guess it's gone now
Warning sign of things to come
Love is here, but I guess it's gone now
Hear my voice
Move my hair
Move it around a lot
I don't care what I remember
(Aaaah aaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaaaah aaaaah aaaaah)
