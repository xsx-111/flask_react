Wide Eyes Lyrics
Oh, some evil spirit, oh, some evil this way comes
They told me how they fear it, now they're placing it on their tongues

Oh, to see it with my own eyes
Oh, to see it with my own eyes

No food or water for the better part of ten months
Quietly he sat between the folds of a tree trunk

Oh, to see it with my own eyes
Oh, to see it with my own eyes


All the men of faith and men of science had their questions
Could it ever be on earth as it is in heaven?

Oh, to see it with my own eyes
Oh, to see it with my own eyes11Embed
