Sticky Thread LyricsWhy didn't I say anything until now?
So much is said without a sound
Water so calm, and once so pure
Undisturbed
Standing for so long the color turns
Their work is so hard (Oooooh, oooh)
Their work is so hard (Oooooh, oooh)
We never felt the sticky thread
The spider webs
Their balance in the garden
Their work is so hard (Oooooh, oooh)
Their work is so hard (Oooooh, oooh)Embed
