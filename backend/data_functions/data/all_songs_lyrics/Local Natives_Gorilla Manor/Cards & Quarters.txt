Cards & Quarters LyricsCards and quarters
Means to ends
Surgeon General warns against
Safe in the knowledge
A short walk back
Punch-line I ruin
But we both laugh
Leaves steeping longer
Knowing glance
Make our appearance
Our minds have gone back home
Brave in her movements
Scared to dance alone
There's a cave made of sheets
And I, I, I know we want to be inside
Take off all of your clothes and climb
Into a cave of sheets tonight
Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets (Even if she knows, I know)
(Even if I know, she knows) Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
(Even if she knows, I know) Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets
(Even if I know, she knows) Steal away, you and me, to a cave made of sheets1Embed
