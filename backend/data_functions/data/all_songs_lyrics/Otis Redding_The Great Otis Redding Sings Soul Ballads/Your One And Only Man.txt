Your One And Only Man Lyrics
If I can only, make you see
That you were only, meant for me, now
Our love will be free
And I’ll be your destiny
Destiny, destiny, right, now, now, now, babe

If I can make you only understand
Treat me right and love me
Then I will be your man
Your one and only man

These are the words that I have to say
Live by them each and every day
And as the time pass, I know our love will last
Our love will last, our love will last

Now, now, now, babe
Take these blues, understand them
Live by them and love me
Then I will be your man
Your one and only man
These are the words that I have to say
Just live by them each and every day, now
And as the time pass, I know our love will last
Our love will last, our love will last

Now, take these blues, understand them
Live by them and love me
Honey, I will be your man
I said your one and only man

Yes, your truly lovin' man
Yes, your lovin' lovin' man
You don’t need nobody to do nothing for you, baby
I said I could just love and be just the one guy that you need
I could say I could be just the one guy that you love
I could just everything that you want me to be, now, now
I said I could be everything that you want me to be
Darling, baby, my, my, my, my baby
Na, na, wow…Embed
