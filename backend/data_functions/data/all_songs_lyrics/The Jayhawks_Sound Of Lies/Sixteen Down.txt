Sixteen Down Lyrics
Sunshine
Stealing stage time
From the moon and stars above
She said, "Leave me alone"
I said, "Take me home"
Sixteen down, living in the hallowed ground
Chorus:
(Ahh)
Now the blue has turned to red
(Madeline, breathe)
All but given up for dead
(Madeline, breathe)
Ooh, Madeline
(Madeline, breathe)
Madeline, breathe!

Skiff rocked
Like a cradle
And the poor girl fell overboard
Rope wrapped around her neck
Tangled in her hair soaked wet
They dragged the stream
The body never to be found
(Ahh)
Now the blue has turned to red
(Madeline, breathe)
All but given up for dead
(Madeline, breathe)
Ooh, Madeline
(Madeline, breathe)
Madeline, breathe!

The dirt in the stream
The body never to be found
Accepting for the footprints caked
In the muddy ground beside where she laid

My life
Made the headlines
Beneath the waterlily sky
She said, "Leave me alone"
I said, "Take me home"
Sixteen down living in the hallowed ground

(Ahh)
Now the blue has turned to red
(Madeline, breathe)
All but given up for dead
(Madeline, breathe)
Ooh, Madeline
(Madeline, breathe)
Now the blue has turned to red
(Madeline, breathe)
All but given up for dead
(Madeline, breathe)
Ooh, Madeline
(Madeline, breathe)
Madeline Reid can't breatheEmbed
