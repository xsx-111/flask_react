Trouble Lyrics
Trouble
That's what we had
And everything that goes around
Comes around in a bittersweet lament
Well, my heart's already broken down
Looking for a sweeter sound
Looking for a brighter day, I'm face down
On the pavement
Step aside, see the light
Close your eyes, and let us live our lives
As they rally â€˜round the sinking ship
Looking for a better way
It was just the blind leading the blind

Ooh, yeah
I got my feet back on the ground
It's better than being alone
It's better than being alone

Funny
We tried it all
Standing on the brink
Looking down, down, down
There's a little bit of truth in every lie
You were so above us all
It was just the blind leading the blind
Ooh, yeah
I got my feet back on the ground
It's better than being alone
It's better than being
Alone

We were stranded on the vine
Destitute and shaken
Looking for a sign
Left hung out to dry
Our backs against the wall
Stoned out of our minds


Ooh, yeah
I got my feet back on the ground
It's better than being alone
It's better than being alone

Ooh, ooh, ooh
MmmhmmhmmEmbed
