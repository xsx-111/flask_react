The Man Who Loved Life Lyrics
Won't you take my hand?
Won't you be my friend?
Take my advice
Go away
When the days get short
And the chips are down
Will you be there?
Will you stick around?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And if thou shalt give
Thou shalt be deceived
This traveling band
Was not well received
No open arms
Or reception lines
Just handlebars
Wearing five point stars

Am I living in your dream?
We got the guns, we got the guns
A thousand to one, a thousand to one
He's the man, he's the man
He's the man who loved life
(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
Served by different stories
(Ahh)
Am I living in your dream?
(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
Pretty metal green
(Ahh)
Can I ride upon your wings?
So free

In the canyon walls, there's a trusty lot
The stakes were high
And the sun was hot
You can rest assured as casinos rise
Buzz around my ears
Like the dragonflies

Am I living in your dream?
We got the guns, we got the guns
A thousand to one, a thousand to one
He's the man, he's the man
He's the man who loved life
(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
Served from different shores
(Ahh)
Am I living in your dream? Yeah
(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
Pretty metal green
(Ahh)
Am I living in your dream?
So real


Heard a million stories
Am I living in your dream? Yeah
Pretty metal green
Am I living in your dream? Yeah

(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
(Ahh)
(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
(Ahh)
(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
(Ahh)
(Ooh, la, la, la, ooh, la, la, la)
(Ahh)Embed
