Big Star Lyrics
Yeah, I'm flat busted
Wild-eyed and free
I couldn't get arrested if I tried
A has-been at a mere 35

Straight, honest
Forthright and true
Great expectations for someone
Doesn't anybody know how to have fun?

But I'm gonna be a big star
I'm gonna be a big star someday
I'm gonna be a big star someday

The grape's bitter
I'm no quitter
Revolutions come, one by one
Seems it's high noon, and I ain't got no gun

It's so hard
So hard
So hard getting by
Gonna be a big star
I'm gonna be a big star someday
I'm gonna be a big star someday

Fine bourbon
Cuban cigars
Rude remarks observed in the C.C. Bar
I'm perfecting the finest art of wasting hours

But I'm gonna be a big star
I'm gonna be a big star someday

I'm gonna be a big star
I'm gonna be a big star somedayEmbed
