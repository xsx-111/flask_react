Poor Little Fish Lyrics
Poor little fish
Swimming in the water
Hide behind the coattails of your father

I've been alone so long, I thought I'd never last
Stuck up on a shelf like an old dusty hat, yeah
But then you came along
You put me on that throne
Up into the sky, yeah

Thought I saw Nick Cave down at the Laundromat
You put your hand in my hand, and that was that, yeah
Your perfume on my sleeve
You lit my life like a Christmas tree
Up into the sky, yeah

Poor little fish
Swimming in the water
Hide behind the coattails of your father

Y'know, a cold, cold heart sleeps awful well
While the maids vacuum the hall outside my cheap hotel room
The whole damn shit came down
Exploded to the ground
Pssssssh!
Up into the sky, yeah

Poor little fish
Swimming in the water
Hide behind the coattails of your father

Where you are is who you are
When you're sleeping
Where you are is who you are
When you're sleeping

Poor little fish
Poor little fish
Poor, poor little fish
Poor, poor little fishEmbed
