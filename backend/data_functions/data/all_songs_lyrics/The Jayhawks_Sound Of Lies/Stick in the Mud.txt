Stick in the Mud Lyrics
I've been getting by
I got no cross to bare
But I'm still getting there

You've got me down on my knees
I'm begging you, please don't leave

Let me be nice to you
And you're still my best friend
Who says this is the end?

Why do good things divide?
Why did they all choose sides?

Slow, steady wins the race
Slow, steady wins the race


You've got the sweetest eyes
You just couldn't be mean
See you down on Skyline Drive
You've got me down on my knees
I'm begging you, please don't leave
You've got me down on my knees
I'm begging you, please don't leave
You've got me down on my knees
I'm begging you, please don't leave
You've got me down on my kneesEmbed
