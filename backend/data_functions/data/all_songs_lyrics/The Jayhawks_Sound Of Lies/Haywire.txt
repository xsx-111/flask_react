Haywire Lyrics
Yeah, Billy was a vampire
Carving out an empire
Strolling Pirates' Alley in the middle of the night
Buy a round of cocktails
Spinning sordid fables in the twilight
That's all right
Scattered words that matter
It's a disaster in the making
Take the time to smell the leaves beneath the trees
( Smile, smile, smile)
That's all right

My whole life has gone haywire
I'm just a blade bending in your shade
For your love I'm a vampire
Strolling the ways of Esplanade

I headed up to Pittsburgh
Heard you could get a pretty good sandwich
For fifteen and a dime
Oh, I miss that old stretch of road down to the bayou
In the middle of the night
Guilt by association
The mere smell of speculation conjures up hell
That's all right
Feel the touch of oil from the tankers upon the breeze
( Smile, smile, smile)
Yeah, that's all right
My whole life has gone haywire
I'm just a blade bending in your shade
For your love I'm a vampire
Strolling the ways of Esplanade


That's my whole life in a nutshell
Take it as you will
I can hear that old brass band playing our song down the hill
That's all right
Won't you smile, smile, smile?
Mmm, that's all right
Won't you smile, smile, smile?
Mmm, that's all right
Won't you smile the smile that fills the room with an independent light?
That's all right
Won't you smile for me, honey?
(Smile the smile that fills the room with an independent light)
Mmm, that's all right
(Won't you smile the smile that fills the room with an independent light?)
Mmm, yeah
That's all right
(Won't you smile the smile that fills the room with an independent light?)
(That's all right)Embed
