Dying on the Vine Lyrics
Dear one
I had enough
Killjoy
Hold up up above
I been sick and tired
Playing out my day
In a dream
Hurry up
Hurry up, it's late
I'm dying in the shadow
I'm just a little baby boy
In your arms

So you
You know who you are
Thought I saw you in the rearview mirror
Looking down
Took the dive Friday night
Had a pretty good alibi
Gasoline, it hit the deed
Not taking it for granted
Hurry up
Hurry up, it's late
I'm tongue-tied and getting something
Babe
Scared of you
Scared of you
Babe
Scared of you
Scared of you


Headed down to Kingfield
With the key in my hand
Took a swim down at Hidden Beach
You and me in the sand
Hurry up
Hurry up it's late
I'm dying in the shadow
I'm just a little baby boy
But now I'm getting something

Babe
Scared of you
Scared of you
Babe
Scared of you
Scared of you

Dear one
I've had enough
Raise the flag
I'm giving up
I'm just sick and tired
Living out my day
In a dream
I want to be the first to say it
Black or white but never gray
I don't feel like me today
I'm dying in the shadow
Hurry up
Hurry up it's late
But now I'm getting somewhere

Babe
Scared of you
Scared of you
Babe
(Scared of you)
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
Scared of you
