Sound of Lies Lyrics
It's a matter of time
Till I fall
In the middle of town
There stands a tall brick wall
In the middle of a dream
Where time plays in between
The sound of lies rings funny
Against the truth

When I was young, outspoken
Mama said it'll work out right
The sixteen brought a moody star
Mama said it'll work out right
Mama said it'll work out right
Boulevards and green leaves billowing

It's a matter of time
Till I fall
In the middle of town
There stands a tall brick wall
In the middle of a dream
Where time plays in between
The sound of lies rings funny
Against the truth
It's a matter of time
Till I fall
In the middle of town
There stands a tall brick wall
In the middle of a dream
Where time plays in between
The sound of lies rings funny
Against the truthEmbed
