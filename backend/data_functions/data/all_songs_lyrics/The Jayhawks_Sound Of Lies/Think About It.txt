Think About It Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Took her pills and her magazines
Left her lying in her misery
He was locked up in his room
Colored pinwheels as the sirens whine down the avenue

Think about it once
Take your time, don't fuss
What you got to lose?
Everybody choose
Think about it once
Take your time, don't fuss

All the dog-eared pages on your shelf
You never talk except about yourself
All the red eyes in the room
Tried to rearrange your world for you

Think about it once
Take your time, don't fuss
What you got to lose
Everybody choose
Think about it once
What you got to lose?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah, ah, ah

As he pulled his pad and scribbled "suicide"
The county coroner, he shook his head
From side to side
He was a little less than pleased
Very pale and very tired, the toil of love
Had brought them to their knees

Think about it once
Take your time, don't fuss
What you got to lose?
Everybody choose
Think about it once
Take your time, don't fuss
What you got to lose?
Everybody choose

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Think about it once
Take your time, don't fuss
What you got to lose?
Everybody choose
Think about it once
Take your time, no fuss
What you got to lose?
Everybody choose
Think about it once
What you got to lose?

Ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
