African lullaby LyricsAfrican Lullaby

Lullaby For Myself
Self-contained and self-content
No promises to keep
I've got things so together
That i just can't fall asleep
Walked the night and drank the moon
Got home at half-past four
And i knew that no-one marked my time
As i unlocked my door
It's really lovely to discover
That you like to be alone
Not to owe your man an answer
When he gets you on the phone
Not to share a pair of porkchops
When you crave champagne and cheese
And your aim becomes to please yourself
And not to aim to please
Oh they sold me when they told me
Two can live as cheap as one
But i'm learning twice you're earning
Doesn't mean it's twice the fun
If you spend your each dime and all your time
On someone else's schemes
I'm not needy but i'm greedy
And i live my deepest dreams
Take an hour in the shower
Use the water while it's hot
In the tub a hand to scrub my back
Is all i haven't got
Self-aware with self-esteem
Is selfishness a crime?
I take the day for quite a ride
And i take my own sweet time
Time to spare and time to share
And grateful i would be
If just one damn man would share the need
To be alone with meEmbed
