Smoke Gets In Your Eyes LyricsThey asked me, how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied, something here inside
Can not be denied
They said, some day you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire, you must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has blown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has blown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say, when a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyesEmbed
