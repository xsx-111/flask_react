Silly Kids Games LyricsI just want my fortune now
I don't care where or when or how
I don't want the dustbin or a cuddly toy
I'm going for the jackpot
Boy oh boy oh boy
Chorus :
See me on the box
See me winning lots of loot oh yeah
Silly kids games grabbing cash
Off that old coot oh yeah
Now i've got the replys to all the questions
There's just on thing that i should mention
When i win all the loot don't you have no fear
I'm gonna take my hols in kampuchea,yeah
Repeat chorus
And it's,it's been a pleasure
Thanks a million
I hope you liked the show
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la laaaaa laaaaaEmbed
