Therapy LyricsTherapy
Plug me in straight again
Who needs this voltage food
Who needs therapy
Who needs this filthy room at night
Who says give up without a fight
Who gets their answers out of books
Dirty men with their dirty looks
Therapy
For clones with their barclaycards
Pension books and mortgage minds
Pay for this therapy who needs this filthy room at night
Who says give up without a fight
Who gets their answers out of books
Dirty men with their dirty looks
What d'you need in your room at night ?
Therapy?
Thats right
What d' you get when you kill that light ?
Therapy
Thats right
What d'you get when it all goes wrong ?
Therapy?
Thats right
Who needs therapy all night long ?
I do !!!
I dream of pavements
Of pavements cold and grey
Cheerful,laughter on a lovely day
I dream of pavements
They won't go away
I dream of pavementsEmbed
