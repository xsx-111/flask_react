13th Floor Vendetta LyricsThe organ plays 'till midnight on Maldine Square tonight
The dancer's dance with a fever and delight
His brow is tense but his hands never shake
Revenge has come sweetly and death is his mate
The organ plays 'till midnight note perfect like clockwork
Perfect precise and a slave to the master's demands
Two souls locked together for all eternity
Soon to be one our work is nearly over
But who is the victim?
And who is the innocent?
The organ plays 'till midnight note perfect like clockwork
Perfect precise and a slave to the master's demandsEmbed
