History Of The World Part 1 LyricsI just hit the ground, boy have I arrived
Tell the dinosaurs, they just won't survive
So I fell, and you just laughed
You think that I can't stand
To see me trip this way
You think I'm second hand
I have seen it all, she's the only one
She belongs to me, I'm the lonely one
Counting sheep and swatting flies
You think there's no more left
Talk is cheap, how many lies
Sustain a single breath?
Adam chance and zorro
Take them with a pinch of salt
Sad about tomorrow
Sorry, but it's not my fault
While they were shooting at the moon
Somebody croaked and no-one heard
What's a sin or two in the history of the world
Some one said to me "Why d'you play so loud?"
What do you want from me?
You corrupt the crowd
Miles of print you'd think we'd thought of
Nothing else
There's more important things than ink and
Decibels
Leave it to tomorrow
Corporal Clott and stalingrad
They're the ones to follow
They're the ones, that make me glad
No-one alive and no-one left
Nobody cares or ain't you heard
Looks like I'll take my dying breath
In the history of the world1Embed
