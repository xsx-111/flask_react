Curtain Call LyricsCan you taste the grit between your teeth
The heat of the lights
The crack of the whip
The snapping sound of someones nerves
If you pay you get
What you deserve
We're coming up from the deep
The lizard sheds it's skin
Night obliterates the day
And all the fun begins
Shadow boxing with yourself
Just seems to get you nowhere
You dont want to cheat
When playing solitaire
The faces come alive
Try and focus and be one
Never let it be said that
The jester comes undone
A reckless gambling pace
With time enough to borrow
Time enough to measure
All of our tomorrows
Curtain call and lights grow dim
Tragedy, love all lie within
Each player takes his chance to play
Lives to fight another day
We're coming up from the deep
The lizard sheds its skin
Night obliterates the day
And all the fun begins
Shadow boxing with yourself
Just seems to get you nowhere
You dont want to cheat
When playing solitaire
Curtain call and lights grow dim
Tragedy ,love all lie within
Each player takes his chance to play
And lives to fight another day
What boundaries to cross
What chances for the taking
Stepping in the angels way
Not to be forsaken
Curtain call and lights go dim
Tragedy,love all lie within
Each player takes his chance to play
And lives to fight
Lives to fight
Another day
Another day
Another day
No more will i roam
My childish dreams i'll soon outgrow
But here we stand
In our own theatreland
Curtain call
About to fall
We're coming up from the deep
The lizard sheds its skin
Night obliterates the day
And all the fun begins
Shadow boxing with yourself just
Seems to get you nowhere
You dont want to cheat
When playing solitaire
Curtain call and lights grow dim
Tragedy , love all lie within
Each player takes his chance
To play and lives to fight
Another day
We're coming up from the deep
The lizard sheds its skin
The night obliterates the day
And all the fun begins
Shadow boxing with yourself
Just seems to get you nowhere
You dont want to cheat
When playing solitaire
Curtain call and lights grow dim
Tragedy,love all lie within
Each player takes his chance to play
And lives to fight,lives to fight ,another day
Another day
Another dayEmbed
