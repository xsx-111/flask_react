Hit or Miss LyricsMet on the dance floor of the palais de danse
Feelin kinda lonley thought i'd take a chance
I never thought it would turn out like this
Another case of hit or miss
I gave you everything that money could buy
Things for your wardrobe things to get you high
I never wanted you to bring it back
I didn't see you stab me in the back
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Another chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And i was looking for a kiss
When you were fallen i put up with a lot
I took your cheating i took all you got
The sun was setting for what he had got
You took my money spent the whole damn lot
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Another chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And i was looking for a kiss
Why does it always end like this ?
Why does it always end like this
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Another chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And i was looking for a kiss
Dont be beaten dont you feel so down
About the rumours that you put around
I think i'll call this girl who lives nearby
Take her down and have another try
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
Anothr chance of hit or miss
Another hit or miss another hit or miss
And i was looking for a kiss
