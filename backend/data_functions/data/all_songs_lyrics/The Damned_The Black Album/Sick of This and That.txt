Sick of This and That LyricsI say you're messing me around
And you say its gettin' outa hand
I'm sick of the country
Sick of the town
I'm sick of the future
It's gettin' me down
I say the future's gonna last
You say there's nothin in the past
I'm sick of the government
Sick of the police
Sick of the boredom
I want release
I can recall a strange event
I gave you nothing with my compliments
A discontent that efferents an emptiness
And nothingness that's heaven sent
(solo)
I say ,and you say
I say, and you say
I say
It's getting me downEmbed
