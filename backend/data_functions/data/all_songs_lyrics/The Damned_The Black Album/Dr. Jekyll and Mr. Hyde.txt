Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde LyricsI'm normal outside,
He's evil inside,
I'm Dr Jekyll and he's Mr Hyde.
I try to be true,
He tries to be cruel,
I'll hold you gently but he'll smother you
My clothes will impress you,
And my claws will undress you.
I'm normal outside
He's evil inside
I'm Dr Jekyll and he's Mr Hyde.
I want what's right,
He walks in the night,
Searching for sin in his decadent life
My charms will beguile you
And my arms will defile you
Me, I'm on the side of the angels
But the devil is my best friend
Sin is a way of life
Saints are for suckers
Welcome to the underworld
I start where nightmares end
Two for the price of one
Two for the price of one
I'm normal outside
He's evil inside
I'm Dr Jekyll and he's Mr Hyde
I try to be true
He tries to be cruel
I'll hold you gently but he'll smother you
My clothes will impress you
And my claws will undress youEmbed
