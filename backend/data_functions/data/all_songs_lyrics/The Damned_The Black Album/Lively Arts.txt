Lively Arts LyricsI'm gonna stay in bed all day
I'm not gonna hear a word you say
It's gonna be a life of style for me
Electric blankets,pillows,fire,and tv
Chorus :
Take a look outside
Those lively arts are on the slide
And culture's just a bore
When you're angry ,young and poor
But if i got my way
Those idle rich would pay
When the discussion starts
On the lively arts
I'm gonna be a lazy slob
Stuff the folks and sod the job
And tell the foreman that i'm ill
And in a week i'll be here still
Yes i will
Repeat chorusEmbed
