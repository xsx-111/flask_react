Drinking About My Baby LyricsI was yours and you were mine
We were together all the time
We had sun and happy days
Living together in our lazy ways
Chorus :
Drinking about my baby
Drinking about her all the time
Drinking about my baby
Drinking about her all the time
I was so happy to see you
You're so clever to find
I don't want to leave you
You're my special someone
Repeat chorus
(solo)
I can see just where i am
Sitting in a lonely bar
One armed bandits,friends of yours
Keep asking where you are
Drinking and thinking and drinking woh oh
Repeat to fadeEmbed
