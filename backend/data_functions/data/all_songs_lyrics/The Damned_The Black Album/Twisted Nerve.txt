Twisted Nerve LyricsI hear cries and whispers in the night
But I know that I was in the right
Hear footsteps echo behind me as I walk
People listening when I talk
No room for error, no room for mistakes
No time for friends it's for your own sake
It's for your own sake
Go to the window and what do I see?
Killer's face looking at me
Go to the window and what do I see?
No room for feelings
Careless talk costs lives
Cold as the cold war front
The red star life
I see faces when there's no-one there
Memories that I don't need to share
No room for error, no room for mistakes
No time for friends it's for your own sake
It's for your own sake
Go to the window and what do I see?
Killer's face looking at me
Go to the window and what do I see?
Go to the window
What do I see?
Go to the window
The killer is me
It's me
It's me
Twist and turn, twist and turn, twist and turn, twist and turn, twist and turnEmbed
