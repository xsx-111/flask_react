Cumberland Gap Lyrics
There's an answer here, if I look hard enough
There's a reason why I always reach for the harder stuff
It wasn't my daddy's way
He was down in the mines all day
I know he wanted more than mouths to feed and bills to pay

Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole

I ain't cut out for war, unless I know what I'm fighting for
And there's nothing here but churches, bars, and grocery stores
Ain't much money in the old-time mandolin
So I cash my check and I drink 'til I'm on my ass again

Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole

Remember when we could see the mountain's peak?
The sparkle off the amphibole?
Like a giant golden eagle's beak
Now they say no one wants the coal
I thought about moving away
But what would my mama say?
I'm all that she has left and I'm with her every day
As soon as the sun goes down
I find my way to the Mustang Lounge
And if you don't sit facing the window
You could be in any town

Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole1Embed
