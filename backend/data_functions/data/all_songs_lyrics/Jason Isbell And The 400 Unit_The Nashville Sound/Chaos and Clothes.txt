Chaos and Clothes LyricsThe ground was wet and the sky was dark
You took her bet, she took your heart
Wrapped it 'round an oak tree
Like you did that '67 GTO
Oh no
Lovers leave chaos and clothes
In quiet corners where you rarely ever go
One day you find proof she was real
Despite your struggle to forget
Oh yes
You're in a fight to the death my friend
Black metal t-shirts your shield
You've got your past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killed
The man she chose to take your place
Turns his collar up to better frame his face
How you'd love to hate her
But you just can't hate somebody you don't know
Oh no
Did she leave a trail of crumbs
So you could find her when you're what you could become
Or did she know you well enough
To realize that garden just won't grow?
Oh no
You're in a fight to the death my friend
Airwaves a grand battlefield
You've got your past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killed
In my sleep I build machines
But nobody ever wants to hear about my dreams
Last night I saw a burning Ferris Wheel
The meaning's anybody's guess
Oh yes
Lovers leave chaos and clothes
More debris that you can sort through in one go
You say love is hell
But it's the ghost of love that's made you such a mess
Oh yes
You're in a fight to the death my friend
Fight like you're chained to the wheel
You've got your past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killedEmbed
