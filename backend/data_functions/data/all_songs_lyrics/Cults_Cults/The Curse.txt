The Curse Lyrics
I left first
Because I knew that this was cursed
Knew I never want to see you again
Left you hopeless, high and dry, and
I moved on
Because I thought that I was strong
I was thinking about myself
And since that day
I just don't have too much to say
But the Lord has made me pay
All I think about is you and when I do I

Cry every night
Cry every night
Cry every night
Cry every night
It makes me wonder what I do

I left first
But then went back to make it work
But he gave his heart to someone new
And now I'm left to cry and cry and...Embed
