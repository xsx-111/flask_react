Never Saw the Point Lyrics
I never saw the point in trying
'Cause I would only let you down
And I just couldn't take you down there with me
I just can't stand to see you drown
I never saw the point in crying
'Cause I can't be the way you want
And I don't want lay around here waiting
Waiting for you to change your mind

I
Just keep on telling myself
That I
I don't need anyone else
Yeah, I'd
Be just fine on my own
That I
Can make it out
I should
I know

I never saw the point in trying
'Cause I would only let you down
And I just couldn't take you down there with me
I just can't stand to see you drown
I never saw the point in crying
'Cause I can't be the way you want
And I don't want lay around here waiting
Waiting for you to change your mind
I
I don't know what else I can do
Now I'm
Done trying 'cause you
Yeah, I
Could never stop loving you
But there's
Nothing else for me to do

I never saw the point in trying
'Cause I would only let you down
And I just couldn't take you down there with me
I just can't stand to see you drown
I never saw the point in crying
'Cause I can't be the way you want
And I don't want lay around here waiting
Waiting for you to change your mind

What I wouldn't give for the chance to see you smile
I did what I could to be yours just for a while
What I wouldn't give for the chance to see you smile
'Cause I wouldEmbed
