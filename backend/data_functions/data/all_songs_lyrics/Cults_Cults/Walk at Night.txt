Walk at Night LyricsWhen I walk at night I can't help but I know its right
When I walk alone I'm hoping for things unknown
When I'm on my own I try to get as far from home
When I wanna be, there's no bright light surrounding me
When I walk at night I can't help but I know its right
When I walk alone I'm hoping for things unknown
When I clear your side, I'm searching for some surprise
When I'm by your side I can't forget all our ties
When I'm on my own I try to get as far from home
When I wanna be, there's no bright light surrounding me
You keep on tryin to make make believe
That no one knows of your lies and your deceit
There's no use in me tryin to be the things
I wanted and that's right for me
There's no point playing hard to get
I figured I'll just sit on your swing
It's easy singing everyday until I walk at nightEmbed
