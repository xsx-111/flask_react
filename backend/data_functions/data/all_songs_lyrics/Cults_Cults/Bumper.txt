Bumper Lyrics
He had been untrue
I had learned of all his lies
I took a look in her eyes
And she caught me by surprise
I threw his shit on the floor
She rushed me out of the door
He tried to explain
I didn't do anything
Knew that he was bad
Never knew just what he had
I still don't have a line
But I'll find one soon in time
Started crying my eyes out
I drive my car and boost out
I wish we never met
I never had a regret
I've had it up to here
I can't take this any more
If she's this crazy now
There's no telling what's in store

Maybe I should start a life with someone new
And give up all my hopes for
I went down the drive
And he caught me by surprise
I took a look in her eyes
Said "I need you in my life"
I'm in love with him
I'm in love with her

We gotta give it a chance
La, la, la, laEmbed
