You Know What I Mean Lyrics
I, I can't take things slowly
Come let away, that's what they all do
Help me 'cause I'm feeling shaky
Tell me what's wrong with my brain
'Cause I seem to have lost it

'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
And I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean

Lonely, that's not quite my problem
I have all that I need, haven't quite lost it
I try so hard to be happy
'Cause something goes on once again

Please, please come and save me
Tell me what's wrong with my brain
'Cause I seem to have lost it

'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
And I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean
'Cause I am afraid of the light
Yeah, you know what I mean
'Cause I can't sleep alone at night
Yeah, you know what I mean3Embed
