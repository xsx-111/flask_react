Never Heal Myself LyricsTell me all the things that you thought weren't right about me
And my life
Tell me there's a way that I can shake this cloud and stand near
To your light
I never wanted anyone to say that I had hidden myself
In disguise
Please don't leave me lonely tell me all the ways to make myself right
In your eyes
But I can never heal myself enough for
Never heal myself enough for you
Tell me all the things that you thought weren't right about me
And my life
Tell me there's a way that I can shake this frown and see clear
Through your sight
I never wanted anyone to say that I have led myself wrong
By your side
Please don't leave me lonely tell me all the ways to make myself right
In your eyes
But I can never heal myself enough for
Never heal myself enough for, no
Never heal myself enough for you
I tried to heal myself
And turn around to someone else
But I can never be myself, so fuck you1Embed
