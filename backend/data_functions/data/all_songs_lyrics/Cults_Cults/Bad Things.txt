Bad Things Lyrics
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me

I'm gonna run run away, run run away
Run away, runaway and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me

It would take some time just to see me shine
For the whole world to see me here with all of my light
But honestly, I've given up on all those fights
So that one day I'll have you all wrapped up in my light

I'm gonna run run away, run run away
Run away, runaway and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black
I'm gonna run run away, run run away
Run away and never come back
Run run away, run run away, run away
Show 'em that your color is black
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
Bad things happen to the people you love
And you'll find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause the next time they'll probably be coming for me2Embed
