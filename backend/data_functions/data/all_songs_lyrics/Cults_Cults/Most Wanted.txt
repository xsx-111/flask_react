Most Wanted Lyrics
Up late at night all alone
Can't you see I'm trying?
Trying so hard to hold on
To the things I know

But in the evening I will have to go
What I most want is bad for me I know

Out in the dark, shaking hands
In the street, I'm drifting
Drifting away from my family
Towards my foes

My mother told me "you'll reap what you sow"
"What you want most is bad for you, you know"

Back in my home late at night
All alone, I'm flying
Flying above all my troubles
My mind's a gull
When I am happy my heart starts to slow
What I most want is bad for me I know

Late in the morning I wake
All alone, I'm crying
Crying for all of the people
Who love me so

But when we get sad we know where to go
What we most want is bad for us we know

"Fornication, drug use and adultery"3Embed
