Rave On Lyrics
On a boat, on my sailing ship
On my own, far away from it
Give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok

To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

In a class where you got an A
Feel your lover's lips on your favorite day
In your mother's arms when you blast away
I'll pass if that's ok
On a stage where you love to play
On your knees, look for words to say
Thank God every single day
I'll pass if that's ok

To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on

On a boat, on my sailing ship
On my own, far away from it
Give me death, but don't give me this
I'll pass if that's ok
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave on
To rave on, rave on
So rave on, rave onEmbed
