Noticeable One LyricsMy image is hard, my attitude heavy
I take you out with the things that I say
I draw the crowds and whenever I'm ready
I've got what it takes to blow them all away
I am your social and your cultural leader
I create the fads and make all the scenes
You know about me from your weekly reader
I'm on the cover of your magazines
'Cause I am one of the noticeable ones - notice me
I am one of the noticeable ones - notice me
I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me
Notice me - noticeable one
I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me
Notice me - noticeable one
My private life is scandalized by the public
But that's the price I have to pay for my fame
And all the liggers in my way with their cute tricks
Are getting over just by dropping my name
'Cause I am one of the noticeable ones - notice me
I am one of the noticeable ones - notice me
I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me
Notice me - noticeable one
I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me
Notice me - noticeable one
I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me
Notice me - noticeable one
I am one of the noticeable ones, notice me - notice me
Notice me - noticeable one
Noticeable one - notice me
