Bad Streets LyricsI'll tell you right now I'm committed to myself
I'll use you
I'll put it to you
Noone will ever play chess with my life
I'm for certain- A free person
T's only real when it's real for me
I'm tryin'... not cryin'
Seven chances means seven times changed
No waiting.. no debating
I'm kicking down bad streets
Just look at what i'm becoming
I'm dancing to my beat
Just look at the game i'm running
I'm kicking down bad streets
I'm dancing to my beat ..
Noone ever gets too close to me
I'm selfish - stand-offish
You'll never guess what i'm gonna do next
I'm impulsive ... compulsive
I'll get over if it's the last thing i do
I'll make it.. i won't fake it
You can tag along if you've got nothing better to do
I'll show you... i won't slow you
I'm kicking down bad streets
Just look at what i'm becoming
I'm dancing to my beat
Just look at the game i'm running
I'm just kicking down bad streets
I'm having fun just looking out for number one
I'm just dancing to my beat
Look at me go i know a lot of things that you don't know
I'm kicking down bad streets
Just look at what i'm becoming
I'm kickin down bad streets..
Bad streets bad streets...
I'm kickin down bad streets
I'm kickin down bad streetsEmbed
