Rock And Roll Suspension LyricsSo she says that you need too much attention
What is the answer to the rock n roll suspension?
Will you remain alone to spend your old age pension?
To reconcile with the hours of school you spent in detention?
When she is gone where will you regain this adoration?
Now what will you declare to be your destination?
Can you depend on your reflection
To disguise your love contamination?
(shadoop!) do do-do do-do ooh!
(shadoop!) do do-do do-do!
So she says that you need too much attention
What is the answer to this rock n roll suspension?
Do you examine your projections
Based on the impulses of your impressions?
Just know only you will live your reputation
Will the culmination be perfection?
Can you depend on your reflection
To disguise your love contamination?
(shadoop!) do do-do do-do ooh!
(shadoop!) do do-do do-do!
Too much attention - too much attention
This rock n roll suspension - so she says
Too much attention - this rock n roll
This rock n roll suspension - suh-suh-suh-suspension
Too much attention - what is the answer?
This rock n roll suspension - this rock n roll suspension
Too much attention - this rock n roll
This rock n roll suspension - it's all misfunction
