No Way Out LyricsNo Way - no way out
No way - no way out
I'm watching all my friends
Searching so desperately
They think they know but they don't really see
They can't find peace of mind
They're wasting all their time
Looking for something
That they'll never find
I face the music n dance
Be what I have to be
There's no escapin from it now for me
Who cares what it all means?
'Cause there can be no doubts
You won't find me searching
For an easy way... out
No way - no way out
No way - no way out
Everyone's so afraid
In this atomic age
Can't seem to handle livin' day to day
Becomin so confused
They don't know what's in view
They seek escape in everything they do
I've had my fill of kicks
I'm tired of drugs and sex
And I don't worry 'bout what's happening next
Who cares what it all means
'Cause there can be no doubts
You won't find me searchin'
For an easy way
I'm not searchin for a way out
I'm not searchin for a way out
I'm not searchin for a way out
You won't find me searchin for an easy way out
I'm not searchin for a way out
All you wanna do is seek escape escape escape
No way out
No way out
I know - no way out
There's no way out for me
I know - no way out
Just what i have to be
No way - no way out
No way - no way out
Days go by - no way out
It's getting late
Don't you know - no way out
You're tempting fate
No way - no way out
No way - no way outEmbed
