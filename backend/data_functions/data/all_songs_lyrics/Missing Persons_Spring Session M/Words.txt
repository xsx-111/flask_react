Words LyricsDo you hear me
Do you care
Do you hear me
Do you care
My lips are moving and the sound's coming out
The words are audible but I have my doubts
That you realize what has been said
You look at me as if you're in a daze
It's like the feeling at the end of the page
When you realize you don't know what you just read
What are words for when no one listens anymore
What are words for when no one listens
What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin' at all
I might as well go up and talk to a wall
'cause all the words are having no effect at all
It's a funny thing, am I all alone
Something has to happen to change the direction
What little filters through is giving you the wrong impression
It's a sorry state, I say to myself
What are words for when no one listens anymore
What are words for when no one listens
What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin at all
Do you hear me
Do you care
Do you hear me
Do you care
Let me get by
Over your dead body
Hope to see you soon
When will I know
Doors three feet wide with no locks open
Walking always backwards in the faces of strangers
Time could be my friend
But it's less than nowhere now
Less than nowhere now
Less than nowhere now
Now
Ow ow ow...
Pursue it further and another thing you'll find
Not only are they deaf and dumb they could be going blind and no one notices
I think I'll dye my hair blue
Media overload bombarding you with action
It's getting near impossible to cause distraction
Someone answer me before I pull out the plug
What are words for when no one listens anymore
What are words for when no one listens
What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin at all
What are words for when no one listens anymore
What are words for when no one listens
What are words for when no one listens it's no use talkin at all
Do you hear me
Do you care
Do you hear me
Do you care
Tell me what are words for
Do you hear me
Tell me what are words for
Do you care
Tell me what are words for
Do you hear me
So tell me what are words for
Do you care
So tell me what are words for
Do you hear me
Tell me what are words for
So tell me what are words for
Do you care
So tell me what are words for
Do you hear me
Tell me what are words for
So tell me what are words for
Do you care
So tell me what are words forEmbed
