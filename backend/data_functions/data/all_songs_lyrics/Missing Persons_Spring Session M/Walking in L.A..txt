Walking in L.A. Lyrics
Look ahead as we pass, try and focus on it
I won't be fooled by a cheap cinema trick
It must have been just a cardboard cut out of a man
Top forty cast off from a record stand

Walkin' in L.A
Nobody walks in L.A

I don't know could've been a lame jogger maybe
Or someone just about to do the freeway strangler baby
Shopping cart pusher or maybe someone groovy
One thing's for sure, he isn't starring in the movies
Cause he's—


(Walkin' walkin' walkin' walkin'...)
You won't see a cop walkin' on the beat
You only see 'em drivin' cars out on the street
You won't see a kid walkin' home from school
Their mothers pick 'em up in a car pool

Could it be that the smog's playing tricks on my eyes?
Or is it a roller skater in some kind of headphone disguise?
Maybe somebody who just ran out of gas
Making his way back to the pumps the best way he can
