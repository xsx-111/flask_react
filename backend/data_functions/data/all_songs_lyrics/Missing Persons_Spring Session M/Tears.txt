Tears LyricsI can't bear the thought of leaving you
But I don't dare to stay
My heart and soul are at a tug of war
But my choice is made
Left with emptiness, no second thoughts
There's nothing left to say
There was time enough to tell you that
You were the only one
I held thoughts inside me when I was the lonely one
You so thoughtlessly took all from me
And drained my life away
All I have left to give are my tears
All I have left to give are my tears
All the time spent through all of the years
All I have left to give are my tears
All, all my tears
All my tears
All my tears
All my tears
They say time will heal everything
Reason and common sense
But with time and reason surely comes
The loss of innocence
Well I've outgrown this kind of silly game
I just don't want to play
Who'd have thought from such a simple start
This would get so involved?
Who'd have thought that this would ever end being unresolved
And for now i think i've had enough so lets call it a day..
All I have left to give are my tears
All I have left to give are my tears
All the time spent through all of the years
All I have left to give are my tears
All
If there were someone i could turn to
It would be easier for me
It's not a easy thing to go through
Without a reason to believe
They say time will heal everything
Reason and common sense
But with time and reason surely comes
The loss of innocence
Well I've outgrown this kind of silly game
I just don't want to play
Who'd have thought from such a simple start
This would get so involved?
Who'd have thought that this would ever end being unresolved
And for now i think i've had enough so lets call it a day..
All I have left to give are my tears
All I have left to give are my tears
All the time spent through all of the years
All I have left to give are my tears
All, all my tears
All my tears
All my tears
All my tears
All my tears
All my tears
All my tears
All my tearsEmbed
