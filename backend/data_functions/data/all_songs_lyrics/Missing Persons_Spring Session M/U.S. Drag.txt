U.S. Drag LyricsYou can feel it closing in on you but there's not much you can do
It's not a thing you can put your finger on, but you know when it's gone
Endless stream of highways neon roadsigns and telephone lines
A little town somewhere in the mid-west gonna put your patience to the test
It's the U.S. Drag
U.S. Drag
It's the U.S. Drag
Their ain't no drag like the U.S. Drag
Music down a windy street, half a glance from strangers you don't wanna meet
Juke box blaring, stale beat, mixes with gamblers, gangsters boredom &
Fear in the pale blue T.V. light
It's the U.S. Drag
U.S. Drag
It's the U.S. Drag
Their ain't no drag like the U.S. Drag
An it's closin' in on you
It's the U.S. Drag
It's the U.S. Drag
And there's nothing you can do
U.S. Drag
U.S. Drag
It's the U.S. Drag
It's the U.S. DragEmbed
