Caught by the Fuzz Lyrics
Caught by the fuzz
While I was still on the buzz
In the back of the van
With my head in my hands
Just like a bad dream
I was only fifteen

If only my brother could be here now
He'd get me out he'd sort me out alright
I knew I should have stayed at home tonight

Locked in the cell
Feeling unwell
I talked to a man
He said "It's better to tell
Who sold you the blow"
Well, it was no one I know

If only you'd tell us we'd let you go
We'll make it hard for you my son, so tell us what you know
We'll make you wish you'd stayed at home tonight
Here comes my mum
Well she, she knows what I've done
Just tell them the truth
You know where it's from
You've blackened our name
Well you, you should be ashamed

If only your father could see you now
He'd breakdown and he'd throw you out for sure
I never should have let you out tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight), tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight), tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight), tonight (Tonight)
Tonight (Tonight)1Embed
