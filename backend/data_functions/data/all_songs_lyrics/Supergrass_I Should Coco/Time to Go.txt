Time to Go LyricsThanks to everyone for everything you've done
But now it's time to go
You know it's hard, we've had some fun
But now we've almost done, it's time to go
Who could ask for more?
Who could ask for more?
Thanks to everyone for everything you've done
But now it's time to go
You know it's hard, we've had some fun
But now the moment's come, it's time to go
Who could ask for more?Embed
