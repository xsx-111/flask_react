Time LyricsThe time's on the way
My love
I know I'm going away
My love
Yeah I know what I, I see
Have it all you
Yeah I know what I, I see
Have it all
A light feeling inside
My love
I know I'm going away
My love
Yeah I know what I, I see
Have it all you
Yeah I know what I, I see
Have it all
Yeah I know what I, I see
Have it all you
And I know what I, I see
Have it all
Yeah I know what I
Have it all youEmbed
