Lose It Lyrics
Don't lose it, don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand
And don't lose it, no don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Won't you say my name?

So don't lose it, no don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand
And don't lose it, no don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Did you call my name?

I don't want anybody
Anyway, I know too much to say
All over again
So don't lose it, no don't lose it
I won't come home
'Cause you never hold my hand

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Did you call my name?Embed
