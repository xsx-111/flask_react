Strange Ones Lyrics
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At eveyone down below

Well I would cry for you
I would die for you
Everybody needs a home
Well are you strange enough?
Are you deranged enough?
Every fucker needs a home

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At eveyone down below
Well I would feel for you
I would steal for you
Everybody needs a home
Well are you strange enough?
Are you deranged enough?
Every fucker needs a home

There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At eveyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the clouds and smile
At everyone down below
There's a place where the strange ones go
Where nobody here could know
They look down from the underground
At eveyone down belowEmbed
