The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton LyricsThe best ever death metal band out of Denton
Were a couple of guys who'd been friends since grade school
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff
And they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Never settled on a name
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate
Were "Satan's Fingers," and "The Killers," and "The Hospital Bombers"
Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
For stage lights and Lear jets, and fortune and fame
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram
They stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names
This was how Cyrus got sent to the school
Where they told him he'd never be famous
And this was why Jeff
In the letters he'd write to his friend
Helped develop a plan to get even
When you punish a person for dreaming his dream
Don't expect him to thank or forgive you
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
Will in time both outpace and outlive you
Hail Satan!
Hail Satan tonight!
Hail Satan!
Hail hail!3Embed
