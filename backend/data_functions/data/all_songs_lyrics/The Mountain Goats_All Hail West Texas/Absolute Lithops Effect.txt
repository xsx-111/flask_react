Absolute Lithops Effect Lyrics
After one long season of waiting
After one long season of wanting
I am breaking open
My insides are pink and raw
And it hurts me when I move my jaw
But I am taking tiny steps forward

And I feel sure that my wounds will heal
And I will bloom here in my room

With a little water and a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy, tender mercy


The big trucks come up the highway
And the big wheels rattle my windows
And night, night comes to Texas
After one blind season alone in here
After one long, sweltering summer
I, I'm going to find the exit
And I will go to the house of a friend I know
And I will let myself forget

With a little water and a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy, tender mercy
