Color in Your Cheeks Lyrics
She came in on the red-eye to Dallas-Fort Worth
All the way from sunny Taipei
Skin the color of a walnut shell
And a baseball cap holding down her black hair
And she came here after midnight
The hot weather made her feel right at home

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
It'll put color in your cheeks

He drove in from Mexicali
No worse for wear
Money to burn, time to kill
But five minutes looking in his eyes
And we all knew he was broken pretty bad
So we gave him what we had
We cleared a space for him to sleep in
And we let the silence that's our trademark make its presence felt

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
It'll put color in your cheeks
They came in by the dozens
Walking or crawling
Some were bright-eyed, some were dead on their feet
And they came from Zimbabwe, or from Soviet Georgia
East Saint Louis, or from Paris, or they lived across the street
But they came, and when they finally made it here
It was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear

Come on in
We haven't slept for weeks
Drink some of this
This'll put color in your cheeksEmbed
