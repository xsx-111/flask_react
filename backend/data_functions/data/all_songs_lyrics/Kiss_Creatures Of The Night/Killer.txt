Killer Lyrics
Her love is a gun, her love is a blade
She's a killer
Bitch is insane, she deals in pain
She's a killer
Ooh, she'll cut you clean
Then she'll watch you bleed
So obscene, she's what I need
She loves to hear me scream, yeah
Black lace, stiletto heels
She's a killer
Crack the whip, submission trip
She's a killer
Ooh, cat in heat
Mistress of deceit
Nerves of steel, her next meal
She's searching for the meat

She's a killer
Stone cold killer
Killer
Stone cold killer
Watch out for your jugular vein
She's a killer
Animal with a twisted brain
She's a killer
Ooh, she guarantees
You'll suffer with desire
Wicked queen, night machine
She'll make you walk through fire
Killer, run for your life
Killer, will she bite
Killer, run for your life
Killer, will she bite
Suck your blood tonight

Killer
Stone cold killer
She's a killer
Stone cold killer
Killer
Stone cold killer
She's a killer
Stone cold killer
She's a killer
She's a killer
Stone cold killer
She's a killer
Stone cold killer
She's a killerEmbed
