Saint And Sinner Lyrics
Getting off this carousel, you can do as you please
You go to hell, you put my back against the wall
Well, I'm not going to fall on my knees, no, not at all

So you're a saint, I'm a sinner but deuces are wild
Better wake up, it's break up, I haven't got the time
So you can kiss my heart, bye bye

Next to you I feel I'm all alone, love's turned to stone
Oh, yeah, cross my heart and hope to cry
Well, I'm not going to die without you it's aces high


Kiss my heart bye bye
You missed my heart this time around
Kiss my heart bye bye
And I don't need no one at all, no

There's no right and there's no wrong and I'm moving on
I'll go it alone because love's turned to stone

No, I'm not going to die cross my heart and hope to cry
No, no, no, no, I'm not going to die, so bye, bye, bye, babe
Well, I'm not going to die without you, babe
No, I'm not going to dieEmbed
