Rock And Roll Hell Lyrics
Been under fire sixteen years
Just waiting for his time to come
He fought the lies, fought back the tears
Can't wait to hear that starting gun
There isn't anybody going to step on his dreams
So he held his hands high and screamed

Get me out of this rock and roll hell, take me far away
Get me out of this rock and roll hell
Get me out of this rock and roll hell, I need to get away
Get me out of this rock and roll hell

He's on the edge, he can feel it in his heart
This time the pressure's really on
He's gonna fight it, might even steal a guitar
This time tomorrow he'll be gone
There isn't anybody going to tell him what to do
Think he's a little like me and you


He's on the run, won't stand for second place
But his turn may never come
He's not a victim, you can see it in his face
But he can't see what he's become
Well, he wants it bad, but he wants no charity
He seems to think it's his destiny
I need to get away
