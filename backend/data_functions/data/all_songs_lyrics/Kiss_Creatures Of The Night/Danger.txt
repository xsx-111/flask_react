Danger Lyrics
In the night I will be waiting
Ready to go, soon as the daylight is fading
In the night my heart is beating
Out of control, can't stop the way that I'm feeling
I want to know how far to go, taking my life in my hands
Out on my own, fighting alone, call me the desperate man

Danger, danger, give me danger, danger
Give me measures of pleasure and pain
Boiling the blood in my veins
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger
Give me nothing to stand in my way
I'll make the best of my days

In the night, oh, I can feel it
Time slips away, if I can't pay I will steal it
In the night I will be screaming
Hour by hour living the life that I'm dreaming
Under the gun, I'll be the one
Walking the edge of the knife
Taking the best, leaving the rest
I'm going to run for my life

I want to know how far to go, taking my life in my hands
Out on my own, fighting alone, call me the desperate man
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger
Give me fires that endlessly burn
I've passed the point of return
Danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, dangerEmbed
