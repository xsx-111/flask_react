Dirty Mind Lyrics
I just called to hear you breathe
Whisper in my ear
Tell me everything I need to hear
It seems like the love we make
Is just as good when you're away
Things you say, I can feel

I don't need to have you here
To feel you crashing into me
I'm better off this way, yeah
Not hearing me complain
And I don't need to taste your lips
I've satisfied my appetite
Me and my dirty mind
Been working overtime

I hear your voice on the phone
Imagine what you're wearing
To do something right, gotta do it myself
You left me here all alone
To take matters into my own hands
And I just might burn in hell
I don't need to have you here
To feel you crashing into me
I'm better off this way, yeah
Not hearing me complain
And I don't need to taste your lips
I've satisfied my appetite
Me and my dirty mind
Been working overtime

Can you keep up?
Is that all you got?
You're wasting all my precious time
Don't need your permission
To turn the ignition and I'll race you to
To the finish line

I don't need to have you here
To feel you crashing into me
I'm better off this way, yeah
Not hearing me complain
And I don't need to taste your lips
I've satisfied my appetite
Me and my dirty mind
Been working overtime
Been working overtimeEmbed
