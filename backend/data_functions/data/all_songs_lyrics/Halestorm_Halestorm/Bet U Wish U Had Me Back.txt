Bet U Wish U Had Me Back Lyrics
It was you and me and one hot summer
Beading up with sweat all over each other
Soaking wet
We didn't have a lot of time
So we didn't waste much
Found in all the right places
You wanted me to touch
And all those memories
Make it so hard to forget about me

I bet you wish you had me back
Another chance to gain it just like that
The best you ever had
And do you close your eyes with her
And pretend I'm doing you again
Like only I can
I bet you wish you had me back
I bet you wish you had me back

It was you and me it seemed to last forever
The way you taste and I still remember
The sounds we made
One day in June I stayed all night
And made love to you like
The fourth of July
And all those memories
Make it so hard to forget about me
I bet you wish you had me back
Another chance to gain it just like that
The best you ever had
And do you close your eyes with her
And pretend I'm doing you again
Like only I can
I bet you wish you had me back

Every night, every time
You see me when you close your eyes

I bet you wish you had me back
Another chance to gain it just like that
Like only I can
You wish you had me back
I bet you wish you had me back
I bet you wish you had me back1Embed
