I Get Off Lyrics
You don't know that I know
You watch me every night
And I just can't resist the urge
Just to stand here in the light
Your greedy eyes upon me
And then I come undone
And I could close the curtain
But this is too much fun

I get off on you
Getting off on me
Give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kind of love we make
When the line is crossed
I get off
I get off

There's so much left unspoken
Between the two of us
It's so much more exciting
To look when you can't touch
You could say I'm different
And maybe I'm a freak
But I know how to twist you
To bring you to your knees
I get off on you
Getting off on me
Give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kind of love we make
When the line is crossed
I get off
I get off

What you don't know
What you can't see
Is what I do for you
I do for me
I get off on you
Getting off on me
I give you what you want, yeah

I get off on you
Getting off on me
Give you what you want
But nothing is for free
It's a give and take
Kind of love we make
When the line is crossed
I get off
I get off
Yeah, I get off
Yeah, I get off2Embed
