Familiar Taste of Poison Lyrics
Drink the wine, my darling, you said
Take your time, and consume all of it
But the roses were only to drain my inspiration
The promises were spoiled before they left your lips, and

I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

I tell myself that you're no good for me
I wish you well, but desire never leaves
I could fight this till the end
But maybe I don't want to win

I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

I don't wanna be saved, I don't wanna be sober
I want you on my mind
In my dreams, behind these eyes
And I won't wake up, no, not this time
I breathe you in again, just to feel you
Underneath my skin, holding on to
The sweet escape is always laced with a familiar taste of poison

A familiar taste of poison
A familiar taste of poison3Embed
