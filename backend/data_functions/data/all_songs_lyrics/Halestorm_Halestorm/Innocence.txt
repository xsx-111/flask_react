Innocence Lyrics
You see it from the outside
You're running toward the wall
Swinging from your blind side
But you don't know me at all
I've been here too many times before
And your tears don't mean a thing
I only come when you scream, I told you

Child, don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay, you'll throw it all away
And I just want to take your innocence

Is this what you wanted
Did I make your dreams come true?
You're sitting in a corner
Wondering what you got into
And you ache for things you don't understand
That your tears don't mean a thing
And I only come when you scream, I told you

Child, don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay, you'll throw it all away
And I just want to take your innocence
There's no such thing as fate
Only yourself to blame you never walked away
I told you

Child, don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay, you'll throw it all away
And I just want to take your innocence
Child, don't follow me home
You're just too perfect for my hands to hold
If you choose to stay, you'll throw it all away
And I just want to take your innocence

I just want to take your innocence
I just want to take2Embed
