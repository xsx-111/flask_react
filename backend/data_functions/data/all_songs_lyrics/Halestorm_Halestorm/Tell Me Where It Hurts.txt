Tell Me Where It Hurts Lyrics
Hey did you know you're making eyes with a murderer?
Hey did you know you're swapping lies with a dirty girl?
In order for me to play your nurse
You're gonna have to tell me where it hurts
Hey did you know you're locking lips with a libertine?
Hey did you know you're knocking hips with a killer queen?
Another victim of my method of seduction
I made you look, but ya never saw me coming

Come on and give it to me
Dare you to give it to me
Give it your best shot
My love is black and blue
Come on and give it to me
Dare you to give it to me
Give it your best shot
Give it your best shot

Tell me where it hurts
(Tell me when you hurt)
Cry baby cry
(Cry baby for me)
Tell me where it hurts
(Tell me when you hurt)
Cry baby cry
(Cry baby for me)
Hey did you know I'm the spider and you're the fly?
Hey did you know you've got your eyes on a suicide prize?
With a flick of my wrist, I'll twist your words around
You think you're the ace but who's got the upper hand now?

Come on and give it to me
Dare you to give it to me
Give it your best shot
My love is black and blue
Come on and give it to me
Dare you to give it to me
Give it your best shot
Give it your best shot

Tell me where it hurts
(Tell me when you hurt)
Cry baby cry
(Cry baby for me)
Tell me where it hurts
(Tell me when you hurt)
Cry baby cry
(Cry baby for me)
Come on and give it to me
Dare you to give it to me
Give it your best shot
My love is black and blue
Come on and give it to me
Dare you to give it to me
Give it your best shot
Give it your best shot

Tell me where it hurts
(Tell me when you hurt)
Cry baby cry
(Cry baby for me)
Tell me where it hurts
(Tell me when you hurt)
Cry baby cry
Cry baby for me, yeah
Cry baby for meEmbed
