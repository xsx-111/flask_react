Nothing to Do with Love Lyrics
You had your heart set on an angel's kiss
Maybe a taste of bliss
Maybe a long white dress and a fistful of flowers
You wrapped your arms around a murderer
Pretending it didn't hurt
Every time I cut you deeper and deeper
Hey, I'm not the one
I'm not the one
I'm not the one you wanna give your heart to

You came, you fell
You thought this was something else
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
You beg, you plead
You wanted more than you could keep
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
This has got nothing to do with love

I gave you just enough to paralyze
Thought maybe you could satisfy
Sometimes I get so bored with you boy
Hey, I'm not the one
I'm not the one
I'm not the one you wanna give your heart to
You came, you fell
You thought this was something else
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
You beg, you plead
You wanted more than you could keep
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
This has got nothing to do with love

I'm not the one
I'm not the one
Oh

You came, you fell
You thought this was something else
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
You beg, you plead
You wanted more than you could keep
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
This has got nothing to do with love
This has got nothing to do with
This has got nothing to do with loveEmbed
