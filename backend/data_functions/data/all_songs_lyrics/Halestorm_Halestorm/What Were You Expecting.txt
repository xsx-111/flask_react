What Were You Expecting Lyrics
I know what you must be thinking
You're not right
You should know I'm not your baby
Not tonight (I never was)
The kinda girl to trip and fall in love (I never was)
The kind to say enough is not enough (I never was)
The touchy-feely co-dependent kind
I like the feeling but I'm not on cloud nine

You love it
You hate it
You think it
You say it
You want it
You need it
I tell ya but you don't believe it

What were you expecting?
Another lullaby
Are you kidding?
You must be high
You must be high
'Cause it was just one kiss
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
I don't need your flowers
They'll just go to waste
I don't want your candy
'Cause I don't
Like the taste (I never was)
The possibility that I'd stick around (I never was)
My intention just to let you down (I never was)
The kinda girl that's good at playing house

You want it
You need it
I tell ya but you don't believe it

What were you expecting?
Another lullaby
Are you kidding?
You must be high
You must be high
'Cause it was just one kiss
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

Everything about you
Makes me scream
Be a man
And get up off your knees
Tryin' to say this in the nicest way
What were you expecting?
Another lullaby
Are you kidding?
You must be high

What were you expecting?
Another lullaby
Are you kidding?
You must be high
You must be high
'Cause it was just one kiss
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)Embed
