Better Sorry Than Safe Lyrics
I can't even think of one good reason
Why I'm always thinking 'bout leaving
It's not like everything's so horrible
Been together for a few years now
And you know all my ins and outs
But everything's way too comfortable

From the moment I wake
I plan my escape

I'm not scared
'Cause I know there's something out there waiting for me
And I swear, that I'll find it someday
Just wait and see
I don't care
That you call me crazy
I can't stay cause I need room to breathe
There's nothing left to say
Better sorry than safe

Sometimes I wish you cheated on me
Then leaving here would be so easy
It's time to take a chance and give you up
In the morning I wake
And make my escape

I'm not scared
'Cause I know there's something out there waiting for me
And I swear, that I'll find it someday
Just wait and see
I don't care
That you call me crazy
I can't stay cause I need room to breathe
There's nothing left to say
Better sorry than safe

I'm not scared
'Cause I know there's something out there waiting for me
And I swear, that I'll find it someday
Just wait and see
I don't care
That you call me crazy
I can't stay cause I need room to breathe
There's nothing left to say
Better sorry than safe
Yeah
There's nothing left to say1Embed
