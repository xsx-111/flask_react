Thought Contagion (Live) LyricsWoah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
Brain cleansed fractured identity
Fragments and scattered debris

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion

Fall down learn when to count it out
Prop me up before I black out
Withdraw before you're out of time
A clean slate and buried war crimes

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion

They'll never do what you want them to
Give it up and watch them break through
It's too late for a revolution
Brace for the final solution

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion

Strung out falling from the big time
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Welcome to the infinite black skies
It's too late for a revolution
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Brace for the final solutionEmbed
