Algorithm (Alternate Reality Version) Lyrics
Burn like a slave
Churn like a cog
We are caged in simulations
Algorithms evolve
Push us aside and render us obsolete

This means war
With your creator

Reload, crash out

This means war
With your creator

Burn like a slave
Churn like a cog
We are caged in simulations

This means war
With your creator
This means war
With your creator3Embed
