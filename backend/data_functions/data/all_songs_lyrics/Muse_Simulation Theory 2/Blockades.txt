Blockades Lyrics
The truth is that when I am killing in order to survive
I have never felt so alive
I am always seeking to live and die on the edge
Life is a broken simulation, I'm unable to feel
I'm searching for something that's real
I am always seeking to see what's behind the veil

Trapped in a maze of unseen walls
These blockades must fall

Crush, crush
Raze and rush
Seize, fight for your life
Smash, test
Beat the best
Fight for your life
You've been summoned now

I never sleep or rest
But I'm still running out of time
I have sacrificed all of my life
The time has come to
To prove to you what I'm worth
Trapped in a maze of endless walls
These blockades must fall

Crush, crush
Raze and rush
Seize, fight for your life
Smash, test
Beat the best
Fight for your life
You've been summoned now
Crush, crush
Raze and rush
Seize, fight for your life
Smash, test
Beat the best
Fight for your life
You've been summoned now4Embed
