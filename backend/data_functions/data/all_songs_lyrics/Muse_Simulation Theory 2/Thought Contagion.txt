Thought Contagion Lyrics
Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
Brain cleansed fractured identity
Fragments and scattered debris

Thought contagion
Thought contagion

Fall down learn when to count it out
Prop me up before I black out
Withdraw before you're out of time
A clean slate and buried war crimes

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs
Thought contagion
Thought contagion

They'll never do what you want them to
Give it up and watch them break through
It's too late for a revolution
Brace for the final solution
Thought contagion
Thought contagion

You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone who's hungrier than you
You've been bitten by a true believer
You've been bitten by someone's false beliefs
Oh-woah-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion
Oh-woah-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh
Thought contagion
Oh-woah-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh

Strung out falling from the big time
Welcome to the infinite black skies
Oh-woah-oh-woah-oh-oh-oh
It's too late for a revolution
Brace for the final solution18Embed
