Inheritance Lyrics
April song
Lilac glistening foal
Ten as one
On the breeze they flow

When it gets my heart out
When it gets my heart out

Nature's son
Don't you know where life has gone
Burying progress in the clouds
How we learn to linger on
Head in sand
Expecting the dour
To redress with open arms
Ascension in
Incentive end

When it gets my heart out
When it gets my heart out

Nature's son
Don't you know how life goes on
Desperately befriending the crowd
To incessantly drive on
Dress in gold's
Surrendering gown
Heaven bless you in your calm
My gentle friend
Heaven bless youEmbed
