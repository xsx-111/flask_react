Eden Lyrics
Summer bled of Eden
Easter's heir uncrowns
Another destiny lies leeched
Upon the ground

Everybody needs someone to live by
Everybody will need someone
Everybody will need someone to live by
Rage on omnipotent

A gilded wreath on reason
The flower crushed conceives
A child of fragrance so much clearer
In legacy

Everybody needs someone to live by
Everybody will need someone
Everybody will need someone to live by
Rage on omnipotentEmbed
