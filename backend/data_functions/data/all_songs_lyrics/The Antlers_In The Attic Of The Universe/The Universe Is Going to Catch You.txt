The Universe Is Going to Catch You Lyrics
It's been a long time coming, it's not up for debate
You've been a hollowed-out apple though you're standing up straight
It's later than you think and we're not going to wait
If you continue to tell us, if you continue to tell us

"The universe is going to catch you
The universe is going to catch you
The u-"

It was fine until you fell off of the face of the Earth
Because we would call you at home and no one picked up the phone
We were worried that you'd fallen in the river, or worse
But then you sent us back a letter, it said in capital letters

"THE UNIVERSE IS GOING TO CATCH YOU
THE UNIVERSE IS GOING TO CATCH YOU
THE U-"

Come back inside, to this house, to your home
Made of steel-structured styrofoam, nobody's out there
But someone is singing you back to your birthplace
That voice is the same voice you heard on the same night that
Everything glowed, took you into the air
And the arms of the universe kept you from falling
But after that happened those arms did not come back
So when you leapt up and nobody caught you your neck broke3Embed
