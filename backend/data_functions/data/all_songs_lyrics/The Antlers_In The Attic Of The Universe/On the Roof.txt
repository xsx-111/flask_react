On the Roof Lyrics
Stuck to a growing black balloon
My neighbors are slowly glowing maroon
Don't throw away my broken telescopes
Who has dragged you away? Who's that carrying the rope?

Stuck to a growing black balloon
My neighbors are slowly glowing maroon
Don't throw away my broken telescopes
Who has dragged you away? Who's that carrying the rope?Embed
