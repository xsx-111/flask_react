In the Snow Lyrics
It got cold in the snow
And I just want to go home
I thought the stars were inside
I kept them hidden, I tried

But they kept screaming for release
They picked me up off of my feet
And brought me up through solid peace
And told me "You can't stay for long"

I woke up without arms
I stood up without arms
I couldn't walk in direction
With all this static reflection

I was lost inside a map
That I had written in a nap
When I heard a voice where branches snap
I followed it homeEmbed
