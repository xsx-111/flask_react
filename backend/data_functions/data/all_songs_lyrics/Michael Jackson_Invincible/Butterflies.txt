Da de-de-da de-de-da
(Oh I, oh I)
Da de-de de-da, lda de-da-dum
Da de -de -de -da, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Butterflies, inside

All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile, when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call when I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
'Cause you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I

All I gotta say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near to me, yeah
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I

If you will take my hand, baby, I will show you
Guide you to the light, then
If you will be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you, 'til the end of time

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I (I just wanna touch you)
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Talk to me, baby) (Inside)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna touch you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Butterflies)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Wanna be with you) (You give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies, inside, inside and I22Embed
