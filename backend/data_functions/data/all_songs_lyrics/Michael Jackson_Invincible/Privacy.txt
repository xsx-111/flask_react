Privacy Lyrics
Ain't the pictures enough, why do you go through so much
To get the stories you need, so you can bury me?
You've got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose the man I really am
You keep on stalkin' me, invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be?
'Cause your cameras can't control, the minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get your story sold

I need my privacy, yeah yeah
I need my privacy, yeah yeah
So paparazzi, yeah yeah, get away from me
Just get away from me (Yeah yeah)

Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
She get no second chance, she's ridiculed and harassed
Please tell me why? (Hold on) (Mercy)
Now there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity
I need my privacy, yeah yeah (Hold on)
I need my privacy, yeah yeah (Hold on)
So paparazzi, yeah yeah, (Mercy) just get away from me
Just get away from me (Yeah yeah) (Slash!)


Now there's a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity (Oh, oh, hoo-hoo!)

I need my privacy, yeah yeah (Hold on, hold on now)
I need my privacy, yeah yeah (Hold on, hold on)
So paparazzi, yeah yeah, (Oh my, don't, don't, don't you do it) get away from me, yeah yeah (Hold on, oh my)
I need my privacy, yeah yeah
(Please don't do it, please, please don't do it)
I need my privacy, yeah yeah (Get away from me, get away)
So paparazzi, yeah yeah
(I'm tired of you stalkin', walkin', talkin', stalkin')
Get away from me, yeah yeah
(You're just sartin' with me, brighter than me, stalkin' me, hold on, aah!)
Privacy, I need my privacy, yeah yeah (You just, you just stop it, oh my)
Privacy, paparazzi, yeah yeah (Privacy no, hee-hee-hee!)
Privacy, I need my privacy, yeah yeah (My privacy, my privacy, privacy)
Privacy, get away from me, yeah yeah (Privacy, no)
Privacy, yeah, why'd you do it? (Yeah yeah)
Please don't do it
Why'd you do it? (Yeah yeah)
Can you just let it?
Hah, please don't do it (Yeah yeah)
Why do you do it?
Can you just let it? (Yeah yeah)
Hah, do it6Embed
