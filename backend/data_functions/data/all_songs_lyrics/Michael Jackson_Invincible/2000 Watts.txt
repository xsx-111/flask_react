2000 Watts Lyrics
You may now apply (You may now apply)
Your 3D glasses (Your 3D glasses)
As we proceed, prepare for proceed
2000 watts, 2000 watts
2000 watts, 2000 watts
2000 watts, 2000 watts
2000 watts, 2000, 2000

Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go
Give you just enough to make your juices flow
Press play, don’t stop, rotate, too hot
You feel I’m real
I’m everything you need, so tell me what’s the deal

2000 watts (2000), 8 ohms (What?), 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload
2000 watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload

3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
Release two or three, when I reach I can go ‘til I hit my peak
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
Shorty really wanna be there for me
2000 watts (Come on now), 8 ohms, 200 volts (Yeah), real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload (Yeah)
2000 watts, 8 ohms (yeah), 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload

We now prepare to take you to the next level (Yeah)
2000 watts (2000) 8 ohms (Alright now)
200 volts (Are you ready?)
Voltage high
2000 watts, (What?) 2000 watts
2000 watts, 2000 watts, (Dolby)
2000 watts, (What?) 2000 watts
2000 watts, 2000 watts (Three Dimensional)
3D, high speed, (High speed) feed
20ack, Dolby (Baby)
Relea00 watte two or three (3D), when I reach I can go ‘til I hit my peak (3D, 3D, 3D now)
Compact (Come on) steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
Shorty really wanna be there for me, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload
2000 watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload
Dance
Don't you overload, baby14Embed
