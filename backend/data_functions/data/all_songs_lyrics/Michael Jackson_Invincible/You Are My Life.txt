You Are My Life Lyrics
Once, all alone
I was lost, in a world of strangers
No, one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You, suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now it's all clear
You, took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are my life

Now, I wake up, every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
‘Cause you love me
You, help me understand
That love is the answer, to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world

You gave me strength
When I wasn’t as strong
You gave me hope, when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes, when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting, for me

You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my night time
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime, my nighttime
My world
You are my life4Embed
