Invincible Lyrics
Well, well, uh
Well, well, uh

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, and he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

So why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible
Well, well, see
Well, well
Come on now, oh

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

And if there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you, my baby

Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, y'all have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Oh)
Can you feel me?
She's invincible (Oh, yeah)
She's invincible
She's invincible (Yeah, now you tell me, baby)
Are you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Yeah)
You see the girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Yeah, yeah, hey)
She's invincible (Hey)
Hee-hee
She's invincible (Hey)
She's invincible (Ooh)
She's in-, she's invincible
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)8Embed
