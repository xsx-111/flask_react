The Kennedy Curse Lyrics
Take this blood from my veins
And paint me a masterpiece of
A parade, a parade of the dead sun
Bang, bang
(Writing this letter to you) Writing this letter to you
(I slice my wrists by way) Kill their leader
(Of paper scars and pictures frames) And watch his family die
(Of all you left behind) Family die
Last man, last man standing is a joke
In spite of the
(When white bleeds into red) Glorious head shots
Glorious head shots and 8-by-10s
(When white bleeds into red) In exchange for your conspiracy
(When white bleeds into red) We'll give thanks
Just stop and you'll decide
(When white bleeds into red) Decide if you can
Then the name won't exist, set him on death row
Go on, let this happen
That's, that's all that you get
That's all you get, that's all you get, fuck
(In, in the the ground, in the ground
In the ground, in the ground, the ground)
Put the dead Kennedy in the ground
In the ground, in the ground
The name does not live on
Not live onEmbed
