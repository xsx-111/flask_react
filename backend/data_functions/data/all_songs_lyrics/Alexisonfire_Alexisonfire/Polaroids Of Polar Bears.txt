Polaroids Of Polar Bears LyricsRaped by my childhood
What the hell do I know about rape anyway?
Well, I guess it's fun to pretend, sorry
Just a thought that occurred when I wasn't quite awake enough
To dismiss it, it's easy
(You always used to stay within arms reach)
To cheapen an event
(But now it seems, I'm all by myself)
By pretending it happened
Only by pretending it happened
Save my life
My life was taken tonight
(My life)
My life was taken tonight
(My life)
Boring, cliched self-destruction
I think, I should start doing aerobics
And the rest
Boxes of cats, people with Taz tattoos
Explosive personalities, self-centeredness
Protractor from your new geometry set
Inability to do math, geography
Polaroids of polar bears
(Tonight)
Polaroids of polar bears
(Tonight, my life)
