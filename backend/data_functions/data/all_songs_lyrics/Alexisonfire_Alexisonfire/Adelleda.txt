Adelleda Lyrics
This is really only all we have (Bury all of me)
Daytime, twilight, pitch black, night light (Before I have a chance)
Coldest eyes, and the softest touch (To open my eyes)
Daytime, twilight, pitch black, night light (And see you laughing)
These typed letters
Beneath me (Is this all we have?)
Fuck with these (Or is this all just)
These buttons and knobs long enough and maybe
(Twilight beyond the skyline blinding me?)
Maybe things will turn out fine
Hide behind your crystal screen
And blow kisses at me
Remember what we said wouldn't happen?
Go write your name on my chest in kerosene
Spark a match, and you won't be cold again
This is really only all we have
Daytime, twilight, pitch black, night light
Coldest eyes, you had the coldest eyes, and the softest touch
Daytime, twilight, pitch black, light
Gag and destroy me
Gag and destroy me
I have a (Sorry I didn't hear you)
Collection of thunder that I stole (I was busy dying in the corner)
I stole, that I stole from your windowsill
(Those three words destroyed
Every inch of me yet you keep speaking)
Stole right through your windowsillEmbed
