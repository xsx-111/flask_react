.44 Caliber Love Letter Lyrics
Sifting through weathered photo albums
(Does it make a difference? This is the way it is)
Looking for gloriously aged polaroids
(You think it really would make a difference?
Would I hang on the beach in perfect black and hide?)
Of places you've never been
(I broke through this hollow shell that once held me so tight
I couldn't breathe)
A place to accept you don't exist
()
"Smile for the camera, sweetheart
I really wanna immortalize this moment
Just remember the first step in forgetting
Is destroying all the evidence"
With friends
Like you
Who needs
Subtext?
Subtext
Subtext
This is a .44 caliber love letter straight from my heart
With a gun, make your shot;
Let's hope for better shit
(Straight, straight, from, from, my, my, heart, heart)
That reason for separation
(Straight, straight, from, from, my, my, heart, heart)

Christened by your bullet
I'm losing patience
Well, I guess it's my own fault
Don't remember
Don't remember
Don't remember
