Counterparts And Number Them Lyrics
Jennifer, they lied to you when they
Said you couldn't breathe underwater
So here it is, the end is near
(I lied too)
Never would've thought that I'd be something
(When I said that I was hard)
You'd so easily discard
(I'm, I'm soft)
Now I see it all so clear
(Softer than a)
So it seems that when you turned away
(A thrift store, a thrift store, a thrift store)
You left a scar
(Sweater)
Twice as worn in
Twice as worn thin
I was cast away once
But I will be found again
This I promise you
Promise youEmbed
