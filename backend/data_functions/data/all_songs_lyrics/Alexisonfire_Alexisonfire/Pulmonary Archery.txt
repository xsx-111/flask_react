Pulmonary Archery Lyrics
Let's go!
It's never too late to be early
Or try and maintain
Some scrap of integrity and certainty
I guess
(My fingers are blistered and bleeding)
Won't apologize and 1977 was a long time ago
(There's no longer discomfort that you brought)
Was a long time ago... I don't care
I don't care how things
Were and I won't
Apologize, I won't apologize
Fuck you
The Alamo has been penetrated
And there is little hope
For the white man so hop on your rainbow
Ride it...
(My fingers are blistered and bleeding)
So hop on your rainbow and ride into oblivion
(There's no longer discomfort that you brought)
For all I care, you could be early, or late, whateverEmbed
