Little Girls Pointing And Laughing Lyrics(We can't)
I still can
(stop now.)
Remember what you did
Your eyes filled
(We've got)
Discomfort
(to slow down.)
Bare foot in a public washroom
Spill on me your nostalgia
And cataracts
That fell
Behind self-conscious eyes
Warm water made
(Please just give me back my heart.)
This hurt so good
(Well it's been too long)
Through ivory rain
(and I will burn no more.)
And cutthroat soap box derby racers
(Oh God. Hurt so fucking good
I just want you to fucking wreck me
I want you to wreck me
I want you to ruin me.)
I want you to ruin me
(Please just give me back my heart.)
Ruin me
(Well it's been too long)
I. Want. You. To. Ruin me
(and I will burn no more.)
(Tired of all these lies)
I. Want you. To ruin me
(and elsewhere eyes of yours.)
Ruin me
(So I will scream)
I want you to...
(and dream of what's to come.)
Ruin meEmbed
