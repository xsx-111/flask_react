Where No One Knows Lyrics
Side-stepped land mines, and
Working-class attitudes, let's go
This is a love song, deal with it
Deal with it, deal with it
(And I will beat my fist against my chest)
I will... Against, against my chest
(If only to prevent my heart from beating for you)
Beating... For you, for you
(This new season brings with it songs of hope)
Songs of hope!
(You can't leave me waist-high wading all alone)
Things
(I know there is somewhere I can go)
I don't understand are the most interesting
(Where no one knows my name)
Like zero, and Eraserhead
(And I still remember the sound of your voice)
And I still... Sound of, of your voice
(Do you think I would call just to hear you breathe?)
Hear you breathe
Just to hear you breathe
Sometimes it's just about
Feeling good
John Cusack
