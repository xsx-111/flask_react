Water Wings (And Other Pool Side Fashion Faux Pas) Lyrics
You always had the blondest hair
Chlorine stripped your skin pigment
The cash was worth
The fucking change
At the pool from open to close
Rake the bottom for loose change
A job that paid for the luxury
(The image still hurts my eyes)
But it probably lead to his divorce
(White chlorine burns so bright)
It's probably
(Sometimes, I fear the night)
The reason why his son hates him
(When the addiction became surprise)
Now your blood is so toxic
So toxic with chlorine
That you only have
Three months left to live
(Red stained eyes)
(Red stained eyes)
Was the change worth it?
(Red stained eyes)
Was the divorce worth it?
(Red stained eyes)
Now you will never see your son again
(Red)
