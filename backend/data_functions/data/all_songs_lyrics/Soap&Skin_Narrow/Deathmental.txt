Deathmental LyricsCede to wash the knife
And thy lust wants my hash life
Hell won’t tolerate hymns
You once seemed to love
The tumbling of infarction
The oddments of destruction
The effort to stay
A blackmail decay
Life lays in your heart like in a coffin
Stop faking suffering like a child
Bonds of silk and vows of lead weight
In rotten milk, this was your feast plate
??? what time to come
Now all your veins burst
All fears and wrongs
Hell won’t tolerate hymns
You once seemed to love
The tumbling of infarction
The oddments of destruction
The effort to stay
A blackmail decay
Life lays in your heart like in a coffin
Stop faking suffering like a child
Bonds of silk and vows of lead weight
In rotten milk, this was your feast plateEmbed
