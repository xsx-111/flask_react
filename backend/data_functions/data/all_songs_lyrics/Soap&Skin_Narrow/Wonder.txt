Wonder LyricsWhy we can't be
Or see
Who cuts us asunder
Like a boor falling a tree
You're the thunder
Going under
Over me
Don't forget to pray
To keep it away
Away from every day
Where you wonder
Why we can't be
Why we can't be
Or see
Who cuts us asunder
Like a boor falling a tree
You're the thunder
Going under
Over me
Don't forget to pray
To keep it away
Away from every day
Where you wonder
Why we can't be
Or see
Who cuts us asunder
Like a boor falling a tree
You're the thunder
Going under
Over me
Don't forget to pray
To keep it away
Away from every day
Where you wonder1Embed
