Lost LyricsSitting, staring
Watching all you leave
Behind this
There is nothing
Which has so much more to give
I lost
I lost you
You’re putting down the memories
As if a nothing
Has something more to give
I lost
I lost you
Who beats the clock for us
Who was pretending us
Don’t scoff at us
Still sitting, staring, watching
How love had to live
And no more things to give
I lost
I really lost youEmbed
