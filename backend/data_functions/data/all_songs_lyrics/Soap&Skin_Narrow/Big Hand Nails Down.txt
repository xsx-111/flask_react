Big Hand Nails Down LyricsVacuum of god
Gobbets of me
Wrapped in tissue through the side blow
That had somehow slipped from you
Vacuum of god
And there you go
I nursed you like a crown
Hanging upside down
Half of a bit, shit drown
My life weeping to your feet
On gallows of love
Tear a kiss
Into a lie of bliss
Shouts with a voice you can't hear
For what you can't bear
From world's void juice
Emptied by words
Vacuum of god
And there you go
From world's void juice
Emptied by words
Emptied by words
Emptied by wordsEmbed
