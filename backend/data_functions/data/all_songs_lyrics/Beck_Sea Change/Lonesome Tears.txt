Lonesome Tears Lyrics
Lonesome tears
I can't cry them anymore
I can't think of what they're for
Oh, they ruin me every time
But I'll try
To leave behind some days
These tears just can't erase
I don't need them anymore

How could this love
Ever turning
Never turn its eye on me
How could this love
Ever changing
Never change the way I feel

Lazy sun
Your eyes catch the light
With promises that might
Come true for awhile
Oh, I'll ride
Farther than I should
Harder than I could
Just to meet you there
How could this love
Ever turning
Never turn its eye on me
How could this love
Ever changing
Never change the way I feel7Embed
