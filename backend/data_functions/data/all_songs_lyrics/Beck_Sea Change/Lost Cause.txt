Lost Cause Lyrics
Your sorry eyes cut through the bone
They make it hard to leave you alone
Leave you here wearing your wounds
Waving your guns at somebody new

Baby you're a lost
Baby you're a lost
Baby you're a lost cause
There's too many people you used to know
They see you coming they see you go
They know your secrets and you know theirs
This town is crazy; nobody cares

Baby you're a lost
Baby you're a lost
Baby you're a lost cause

I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause
There's a place where you are going
You ain't never been before
No one laughin' at your back now
No one standing at your door
That's what you thought love was for

Baby you're a lost
Baby you're a lost
Baby you're a lost cause

I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting
Fighting for a lost cause8Embed
