Ship In A Bottle Lyrics
When I called you in the morning
You were struggling for sense
You were journeying through memories so vicious
You made all your dying wishes
Come true

But I know you're gonna try
To live without love by and by
But that's not living
That's just time going by
Going by, my love

Another ship in a bottle
Has got no place to sail
To see the waves getting darker every hour
The stars have lost their power
In the sky

But I know you're gonna try
To live without love by and by
But that's not living
That's just time going by
Going by, my loveEmbed
