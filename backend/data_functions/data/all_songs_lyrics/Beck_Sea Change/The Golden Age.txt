The Golden Age Lyrics
Put your hands on the wheel
Let the golden age begin
The window down
Feel the moonlight on your skin
The desert wind
Cool your aching head
The weight of the world
Drift away instead

Ohh, these days I barely get by
I don't even try

It's a treacherous road
With a desolated view
There's distant lights
But here they're far and few
And the sun don't shine
Even when it's day
You gotta drive all night
Just to feel like you're ok

Ohh, these days I barely get by
I don't even try
I don't even try9Embed
