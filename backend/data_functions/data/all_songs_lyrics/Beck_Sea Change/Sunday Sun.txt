Sunday Sun Lyrics
Haven't got a lot to learn
And my eyes they stray again
Looking for a satellite
In the rays of heaven again

There's no other ending
Sunday sun
Yesterdays are ending
Sunday sun

Jealous minds walk in a line
And their faces jade the strain
Stranded in infinity rooms
And they're safe from any harm

There's no other ending
Sunday sun
Yesterdays are ending
Sunday sun

There's no other ending
Sunday sun
Yesterdays are ending
Sunday sun
There's no other ending
Sunday sun
Yesterdays are ending
