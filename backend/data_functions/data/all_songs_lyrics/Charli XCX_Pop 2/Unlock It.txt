Unlock It Lyrics
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Lock it, lock it, unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
(Beautiful)

Rollercoaster ride in the fast lane
Got the roof down, kiss me hard in the rain
You got the candy-colored eyes, pink and gold chain
Million dollar babe, whip it out like I'm propane

You're on my mind
I'm feelin' kinda nervous but I like it
Take my T-shirt off and do it right
You're on my mind
The feelin', like an astronaut
Watchin' the world all alone, just you and I (you and I)
(Beautiful)

Rollercoaster ride in the fast lane
Got the roof down, kiss me hard in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes, know you feel the same
Million dollar babe, trippin' on it like propane
(Beautiful)
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Lock it, lock it, unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Got the key, can you unlock it?
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Lock it, lock it, unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Got the key, can you unlock it?

Caught in a lip lock, when we pit stop
Cosmic kiss, tastes like cherry maraschino
Ride, passenger seat, tropical heat
Eyes so red, you could be my Valentino, yeah (Woo-ah!)
If you want my heart, then don't you drop it
(Want my heart, then don't you drop it)
I'm right here, right in your pocket
(I'm right here, right in your pocket)
Pull it, cock it, never stop it
(Never stop it)
If you want my love (my love!), try to unlock it

Rollercoaster ride in the fast lane
Got the roof down, kiss me hard in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it in your eyes, know you feel the same
Million dollar babe, trippin' on it like propane
(Beautiful)
Unlock the swag, Rae Sremmurd
Make you hit them high notes, like you a tenor
Tell the big appetite, girl, you my dinner
I know they could do you, but I could do it better
Bring me out to London, yeah (U.K.)
I can show you somethin', yeah (somethin')
Unlock your clothes off your body
Give you lovin', yeah (let's get it)
'Cause that's how we do (that's how we do)
You wantin' me too (wantin' me too)
Your top be see-through, ooh (top be see-through)
I like the preview (like the preview)
We not there yet, girl, but we on the way (way, way)
We on the surfboard, yeah, we ridin' waves (waves, waves)
Let's get it going, girl, let's 치ndale (치ndale)
Let's 치ndale (치ndale), sip this champagne (ah)

Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Lock it, lock it, unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Got the key, can you unlock it?
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Lock it, lock it, unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Got the key, can you unlock it?
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (Unlock it)
Lock it, lock it, unlock it (Unlock it)
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (Unlock it)
Got the key, can you unlock it? (Unlock it)
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (Unlock it)
Lock it, lock it, unlock it (Unlock it)
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (Unlock it)
Got the key, can you unlock it? (Unlock it)
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (If you want my heart, then don't you drop it)
Lock it, lock it, unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (I'm right here, right in your pocket)
Got the key, can you unlock it?
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (If you want my heart, then don't you drop it)
Lock it, lock it, unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it (I'm right here, right in your pocket)
Got the key, can you unlock it?
Woo-ah!
(Beautiful)
