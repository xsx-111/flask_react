Porsche Lyrics
I've been fantasizin' 'bout a Porsche
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore
'Til it grow-oh-oh-oh
(X-C-X)
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long
Yeah, it seems that
Every day and everywhere I go
Yeah, I see ya
Baby, I just gotta let you know
I made dough-oh-oh-oh

Take back all your love 'cause
Fake words ain't enough, no
I gave it all, so emotional
But you only care how your money talks
One rose layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away but
My mausoleum, pretty like Versailles
Man, I played it out 'bout a thousand times, yeah

You won't hear my teardrops when they're fallin'
Engine drownin' out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong
Yeah, you spent my love, didn't spend my money
'Cause I've been fantasizin' 'bout a Porsche
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore
'Til it grow-oh-oh-oh
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long
Yeah, it seems that
Every day and everywhere I go
Yeah, I see ya
Baby, I just gotta let you know
I made dough-oh-oh-oh

Take back all your love 'cause
Fake words, they don't count, no
Yeah, I know your game
And you played it right
Wish you knew before but my love is blind
One rose layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away, oh
Tell your new lover to enjoy the ride
Pop the Chardonnay, kiss her lips goodbye, yeah

You won't hear my teardrops when they're fallin'
Engine drownin' out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong
Yeah, you spent my love, oh
Didn't spend my money, babe
'Cause I've been fantasizin' 'bout a Porsche (I've been fantasizin')
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh (Oh-whoa-whoa, dough)
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore ('Til I'm sore)
'Til it grow-oh-oh-oh ('Til it grow)
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long
Yeah, it seems like
Every day and everywhere I go
Yeah, I see ya (Oh)
Baby, I just gotta let you know (Let you know)
I made dough-oh-oh-oh

Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah, I let you know it's like
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah, I've been fantasizin' 'bout it
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah, I let you know it's like
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah
(E-e-X-C-X)
