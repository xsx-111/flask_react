I Got It Lyrics
Brooke Candy, fag mob
Charli XCX
Pabllo Vittar
Miss CupcakKe, uh

Big tits, double D's
No silicone and no saline
Jealous of me
Envious hoes in their all-green
Hater disease
Bitches, so sick of 'em, Dramamine
Bad Brooke Candy
If you ain't mad, well, you 'bout to be

I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, (Got it) yeah (Got it)
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, (Got it) yeah (Got it)
Ten stacks, ten keys
Swimmin' pools, goin' real deep
L.A., A. G. (A. G.!)
Studio with the real beats
So raw, sushi
Crashed your daddy's Lamborghini
Charli, baby
Pull up, pull up to the party

I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, yeah
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, yeah
(Miss CupcakKe is on this track
Have you heard her? Have you seen her?)

Got a couple of bitches that want my attention
They actin' real vicious, but I'm not offended
They lurkin' like witnesses, money I'm gettin'
Could drop an ice tray and I still won't be slippin'
(Got) Another check comin' in
(Got) A couple checks I ain't spend
(Got) Fat pockets, need a gym
(I) Made it possible like Kim
Today, I got great times
Square it out like FaceTime
Yellow tape around the body
But not measurin' waistlines (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)
Zero fucks, the amount (What?)
Zero bucks in your account (You broke!)
So many offers on the table (What?)
A bitch gotta eat on the couch
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
(Ch-Ch-Ch-Charli...)
I got it, I got it, I got it, yeah
(Xis Cê Xis...)
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
(Brooke Candy...)
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
(CupcakKe...)
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
(Pabllo Vittar...)
I got it, I got it, I got it, yeah
Controlo qualquer um com a minha bruxaria
Minha bunda é mais forte que feitiçaria
Encanta, magia, atiça, vicia
Consigo o que eu quero se rebolo assim
Não existe ninguém aqui igual a mim, não, não
Todos querem sim (Todos querem sim)
Me chamam de queen (Me chamam de queen)
Todos querem sim (Todos querem sim, eu sei)
Me chamam de queen
Todos querem sim, me chamam de queen
Todos querem sim, me chamam de queen
(Todos querem sim)
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got- yeah
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it, I got-32Embed
