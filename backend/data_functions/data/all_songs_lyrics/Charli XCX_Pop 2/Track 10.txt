Track 10 Lyrics
(X-C-X, Charli)
(I just wanna spend the night)
I just wanna drink you up
Love, I do
Love, I do
Ooh
I blame it on your love
Love

Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginnin', really wish that I could change
I do, I do (I do)
Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginnin', really wish that I could change
I do, I do, I do

I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
Sorry, I'm a little scared
But no one ever really cared
I took you for granted
Just a big misunderstandin'
I just wanna spend the night
Fuckin' in your bed tonight
Watch a little TV
I love it when you need me


I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can't stop
I blame it on your love, I do
Sorry, I blame it on your love, yeah
Sorry, I blame it on your love, yeah
I know to blame it on your love, yeah
Sorry, I blame it on your love, yeah, I do


Eh-eh-X-C-X, Charli

I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can’t help it, I can’t stop
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up
I blame it on your love, I do
I blame it on your love, I can’t help it, I can’t stop
I blame it on your love, I do

I blame it on your love every time I fuck it up (Eh-eh-X-C-X, Charli)
I blame it on your love, I do (Eh-eh-X-C-eh-X-C-X)
I blame it on your love, I can't help it, I can’t stop
I blame it on your love, I do
Love, I do, love, I do
Love, I do, love, I do
It’s Charli
