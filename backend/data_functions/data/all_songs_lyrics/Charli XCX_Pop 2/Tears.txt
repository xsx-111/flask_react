Tears Lyrics
See through my eyes
Right down to where I fall apart
Wish me luck, wish me luck
Drive through the night
Head on your shoulder
But I miss you so much
So, so much

Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Try to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

Used to be 5 star, yeah
Golden, golden
When I had nothing, you gave me silhouette dreams and
We made them real, somethin' like freedom
I killed the lights, went crazy
Throwin' all the china all around the kitchen
I kicked the ladder under you
Playin' dumb, shut tight, that ain't love, no
That ain't love
Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
I tried to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go (now we're in a different place)
Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out (kiss, fade out)
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Try to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love (no love)
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face (face)
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

Say my name and
Fade out
Down my face
Go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Lies when
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go13Embed
