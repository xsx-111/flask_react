Backseat Lyrics
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up
I go to parties with strangers, so I can figure it out
Run through a city at midnight to feel like a star
I want it all, even if it's fake

Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (Told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
I know I'm wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up

In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
I'm wide awake, lyin' next to him, and feel it all
I got a thirst for distraction that I can't take back
My fingers run through his hair
I'm grippin' at regrets
I put my mouth on his lips to taste

Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (Told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
All that went wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so I turn it up

In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
'Wake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
Take back, I gotta take back
I gotta take back, I gotta take back, I gotta
(In the)
My fingers run through his hair
My fingers run through his hair
(You're so)
My fingers run through his hair
My fingers run through his hair
(Drivin') In the (in the)
I gotta take back
All alone, all alone, all alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone

It's Charli, baby
