Delicious Lyrics
E-e-e-e-X-C-X
Это очень вкусно!
Charli, Cash
Cash, cash, cash, cash, cash

I always think about you when I'm high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
I touch myself, and then I'm not alone no more
I always think about you when I'm high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
Do somethin' special to me

Wanna take your picture
You're so delicious
Gimme icy vision
The head so clever
Can you keep me with ya?
Gotta touch your treasure
Icy like November
That vicious kingdom
Wanna take your picture
You're so delicious
Like the architecture
I won't forget you
Got me in the bathroom
Got me in the mirror
Puttin' on the pressure
(E-e-X-C-X)
I always think about you when I'm high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
I touch myself, and then I'm not alone no more
I always think about you when I'm high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
Do somethin' special to me

Oh!
There's no Wi-Fi in forest
I found a better connection (connect)
No mirrors nearby, but I see a better reflection
I was fucked by the nature, we didn't use protection
Made a lot of trees, they are now in a book section
No cameras, no lights, but a lot of action (flash)
Yeah, summer turnin' winter
C'mon, little mama Jackson (wooh, woooooh)
Flow like water (swim, swim)
No Beats by Dre, but beats by your father
(Delicious, you're delicious, man)

I always think about you when I'm high, yeah, yeah
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah, yeah
You call me up, then I'm satisfied, yeah, yeah
I touch myself then I'm not alone, yeah
I always think about you when I'm high, high, high, high
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up, then I'm satis-satisfied, yeah, ye-
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
Алё?
Tell it to me, do it straightforward
Wind it up and then we fast-forward
Tinted windows in the Range Rover
Drive it in like you're the best chauffeur
Switch it up, bipolar
Colorado, how you take over
Got an angel, got me real closer
Running it just like a halo, yeah
Never let me go, never let me go, no
Want a little more
When it rains, it pours, yeah
I'ma care for you
Wind it up and then we fast-forward
Leave a message, hit record on ya
Yeah

I always think about you when I'm high (When I'm high)
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah (Tele-tele)
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
I touch myself and then I'm not alone no more (No more)
I always think about you when I'm high (When I'm high)
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
Сука, почему ты мне не звонишь, нахуй? Почему ты мне не звонишь, а?
I touch myself and then I'm not alone no more
I always think about you when I'm high (When I'm high)
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
I touch myself and then I'm not alone no more
I always think about you when I'm high
(Touch, touch, touch, touch)
I wanna hear you whisper on the telephone, yeah
(Touch, touch, touch myself, touch)
You call me up, and then I'm satisfied
(Touch, touch, touch, touch)
Do somethin' special to me
