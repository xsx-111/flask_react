Secret Corners LyricsLying alone, isn't that you
Drifting away
Is the only thing left to do
Such a sad place, such a lost world
But nothing is sadder
Than the tears of a make-believe girl
Who is this child, who is this man
Only two people
Who are doing all they can
Frost on the ground, the cruel winds of fate
Blow us forever
And I know there's just no escape
Run to the secret corners of your room
I'll still be waiting
I'll still be waitingEmbed
