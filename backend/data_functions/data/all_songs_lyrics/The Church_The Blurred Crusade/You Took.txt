You Took LyricsYou took a piece of my heart
You took a piece of my heart
And I don't know why
No I don't know why
It was clear in coming here
I must have put the horse before the cart
Before the cart
You took the lead from the start
You took the lead from the start
And I don't know why
No I don't know why
It was clear in coming here
I must have put the skin before the heart
Before the heart
You took the rest of the day
You took the rest of the day
And I don't know why
No I don't know why
Now that it's all over
Now there's just some coldness in my way
It's in my way
You took the clubs and the spades
You took the clubs and the spades
And I don't know why
No I don't know why
It's a shame it's not a game
We're playing in it's just the blurred crusade
The blurred crusadeEmbed
