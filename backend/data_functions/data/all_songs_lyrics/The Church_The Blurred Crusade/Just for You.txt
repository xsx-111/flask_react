Just for You LyricsSometimes when the darkness loses its hold
I tread politely in the cold
Racking my brains
Pumping my veins
And taking the evening train from view
But you know I never wanted to
Ah, you know I did it just for you
And it's so easy to hurt me now
And you've forgotten anyhow
That certain ideas
Have changed through the years
I purchased some tears just to see me through
But you know I never wanted to
Ah, you know I did it just for you
One day I noticed the world at my feet
Next day comes and it rolls into the street
Gathering speed
Paying no heed
That made me bleed until I was blue
But you know I never wanted to
Ah, you know I did it just for youEmbed
