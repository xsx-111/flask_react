The Last Song Lyrics
Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally
On the road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby, we'll hear it when I'm gone

It's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh

What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again
But then again, maybe we gave our all
A song we'll never forget
Baby let 'em play it, maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearing it when it's gone

But it's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh
What if we left every moment that we could spare?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful
That's why I started singing it
But this song is our song, so it's playing until the end
Even if it's the last song

The last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
