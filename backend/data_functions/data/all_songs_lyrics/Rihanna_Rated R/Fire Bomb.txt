Fire Bomb Lyrics
Yeah, whoa

Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where we're going, we don't need no brakes (Brakes)
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
Baby, we were killin' 'em
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you is to go out blazing

The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
