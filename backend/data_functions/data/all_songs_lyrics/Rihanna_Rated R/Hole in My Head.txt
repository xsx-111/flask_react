Hole in My Head Lyrics
Let go!
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl

No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
You're gonna drown

All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body
Imma run to let these ladies know
Watch your tone around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
G-G-get wild
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
Baby might drown
Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wine
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right with me
Now push my buttons
You see me go wild
Go, go wild

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy
(Oh, oh)
Watch me, watch me
(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy
(Oh, oh)
(Uh, uh, break it down) Oooh
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh" (Oh)
Uh, now go "Oooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Oooh" (Oh)
Now go...

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl (Oh)1Embed
