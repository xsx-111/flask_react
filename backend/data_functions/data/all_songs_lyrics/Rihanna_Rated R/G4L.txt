G4L Lyrics
I lick the gun when I'm done
'Cause I know that revenge is sweet
So sweet
This is a gang, ladies thang
Baby bang, tell me what you need, oh
Any motherfucker wanna disrespect
Playing with fire finna get you wet
How it feel down there on your knees

I got this
Girls like a soldier
Trip and it's goin' down, down, down

I'm ready to roll
Girl, I'm with you
If they get you, they get me
So come on, let's go
Bitch, I'm with you
If you with it, you with me
You know I'm down
Down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangsta for life
'Til the day that I die
Yeah, I promise I'm standing high
'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangsta for life
We drivin' by with them headlights off
We know where you stay
Know what you did, we don't play that shit
Nigga we don't play, no
Everybody cried when you did your dirt
Acting like a bitch finna get you hurt
Breaking lives down to their knees, oh

I got this
Girls like a soldier
Trip and it's goin' down, down, down

I'm ready to roll
Girl, I'm with you
If they get you, they get me
So come on, let's go
Bitch, I'm with you
If you with it, you with me
You know I'm down
Down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangsta for life
'Til the day that I die
Yeah, I promise I'm standing high
'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangsta for life
Guns (Check), Girls (Check)
Come on, we ain't done yet
Got a lot to handle
We ain't takin' over the world yet
We're an army
Better yet, a navy
Better yet, crazy
Guns in the air
Guns in the air
Guns in the air
Can't hurt us again when you come around here
We got our guns, got our guns
We got our guns, got our guns
We got our guns in the motherfuckin' air, oh

I'm down for life
Gangsta for life
I'm down for life
Gangsta for life
You know I'm down
Down for life
Load it, reload it and let's go
Gangsta for life
'Til the day that I die
Yeah, I promise I'll stand and fight
'Cause you know that I'm down
You know I'm down
Gangsta for life
I lick the gun when I'm done
'Cause I know that revenge is sweet17Embed
