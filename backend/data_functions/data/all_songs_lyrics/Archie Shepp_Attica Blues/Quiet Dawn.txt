Quiet Dawn Lyrics
It’s quiet dawn
And life moves on
The time has passed
And I’ve been left
I sing a prayer
This love we share
Oh come, let’s love
Before dawn is gone

Think that we both met, not long ago
My darling
Now you say our love is growing old
Let’s talk about the fun that we had
Spinnin' 'round our brain
Like a huckanee frame
Come dawn, don’t flee
Come back to me
Let’s try one more night
Before dawn is gone

Think that we both met, not long ago
My darling
Now you say our love is growing old
Let’s talk about the fun that we had
It’s been around my brain
Like a humming airplane
Come dawn, don’t flee
Come back to me
Let’s try one more night
Before dawn is gone
Quiet dawn
Quiet dawn
Quiet dawnEmbed
