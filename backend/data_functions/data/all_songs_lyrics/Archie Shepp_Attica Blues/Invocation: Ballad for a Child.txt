Invocation: Ballad for a Child Lyrics
I would rather be a plant
Than a man in this land
I would rather be a plant on this land
You can transplant a plant
Where it can grow free
But a man that's been transplanted can't
So you can see where I would rather be a tree
With branches and leaves I can grow free
If man had a choice before he's exploited
Then his offspring would do more than dream
Isn't that a shameEmbed
