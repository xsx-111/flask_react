Ballad for a Child LyricsI'd rather be a plant than a child on this land
Not a child, not a man
Ooo branches can grow free, whoa yeah
Again and again and again
I don’t know why I can't
A tree is a work of God
That only lasts a little while
But what the whole world really needs
Is a baby's smileEmbed
