Attica Blues Lyrics:
I got the feeling that's something's goin' wrong
And I'm worried bout the human soul
I've got a feeling
If I could have had the chance to make the decision
Every man could walk this earth on equal condition
Every child could do more than just dream of a star
Mothers, sons, and dads would see that I put an end to war
:
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
:
If I had the chance to make the decision
Every man could walk this earth on equal condition
Every child could do more than just dream of a star
Moms and sons and dads would see that I put—put an end to war
:
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
:
Oh, if I would have had the chance to make the decision
Every man could walk this earth on equal condition
Every child would do more than dream of a star
Mothers, sons, and dads would see that I put—put an end to war, yeah
:
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
:
If I would have had the chance to make the decision
Every man could walk this earth on equal condition
Every child would do more than just dream of a star
Mothers, dads, and child would see that I put—put an end to war, yeah
:
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
:
If I had the chance to make one decision
Woman and man could walk this earth on equal condition
Every child could do more than dream of a star
Mama, dad, and child would see that I would put an end to war, yeah
:
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeah
Only with the natural forces and a world that's getting old
Do I worry, yes, I worry, can you dig, about the human soul, yeahEmbed
