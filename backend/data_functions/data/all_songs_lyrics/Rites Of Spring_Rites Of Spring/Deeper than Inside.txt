Deeper than Inside Lyrics
I'm going down, going down
Deeper than inside
The world is my fuse
And once inside, I'm gonna tear
'Til there's nothing left to find

And you wonder just how close
Close-up can be
Can't you see? Can't you see?

I had a dream, all my thoughts
They turned to real lips
And the world is my fuse
And just a dream, just a dream
Can bring me to my knees

And you wonder just how tight
Skin-deep can be
Can't you see? Can't you see?

I'm going down, going down
Deeper than inside
The world is my fuse
And from inside, outside
Just can fall apart
And you wonder just how lost
Inside can be
Try me, try me
