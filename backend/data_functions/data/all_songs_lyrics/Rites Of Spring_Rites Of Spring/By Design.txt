By Design LyricsTime heals all wounds they say
But the self-inflicted won't just fade away
And in these tides of shifting blame
Why are you suprised to see your name?
It's such a drag
Time got the best of you
Things you gave you say were taken
Explaination piled over excuse
And so the story goes
But by your own design
And if you look to me to find you
Then my eyes will pass right through
And so the story goes
But by your own design
And if you look to me to find you
Then my eyes will pass right through
Believe me I had wished
We could have avoided this
Please dont ask me to explain
All the things that caused your pain
I only want you to realize
Passivity equals compliance
Let it slip right through your hands
Become the victims of other's demands
And so the story goes
But by your own design
And if you look to me to find you
Then my eyes will pass right through
And so the story goes
But by your own design
And if you look to me to find you
Then my eyes will pass right through
Pass right through
Time heals all wounds they say
But the self-inflicted won't just fade away
And in these tides of shifting blame
Why are you suprised to see your name?
It's such a drag
Time got the best of you
Things you gave you say were taken
Explaination piled over excuseEmbed
