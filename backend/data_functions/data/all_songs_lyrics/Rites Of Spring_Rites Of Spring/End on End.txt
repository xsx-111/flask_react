End on End Lyrics(Wide-eyed, innocent, boy! Wide-eyed innocent boy)
I’ve had days, of end on end
Where nothing changed cause nothing ever began
Restless movement in an empty room
Gathering shadows of a darkened blue
And oh
It feels so strange
Oh
It feels so strange
When it comes again
Cycles of end on end
Edges begin to blend
Time following time
A pattern becomes defined
(Go!)
I had a feeling from end to end
Tried to catch it before it started again
Pushed it away to force a laugh
But inside I didn't have the breath
And oh
It feels so strange
Oh
It feels so strange
When it comes again
But I’ve got it now
Yeah I’ve got the rhythm down
Cycles of end on end
And if one wave stops
Another begins
End
On end
Go!

Well I think I’ve got it now
Yeah I think I’ve got it down
Yeah I think I’ve got it down
Yeah this end on end
Cycles begin
Cycles begin
It’s end on end
It’s end on end
Cycles begin
Yeah!
It’s end on end, it’s end on end
Cycles begin
Watch them begin
But you can’t stop, you can’t stop, end on end
Can’t watch them end
Try to watch it end
It’s end on end, it’s end on end, it’s end on end
End on end
Watch them begin
It’s end on end, it’s end on end, it’s end on end
It seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Found!
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
It seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
(Woah! Go!)
(Get it! Go!)
(Woah! Woah!)
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Seems I can’t remember
Sssss...
Sssss...
Sssss...
