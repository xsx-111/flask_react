Nudes LyricsI want to talk
Like I'm talking to myself
I want to reach
I could be someone else
And when a touch
When a touch becomes too much
You know, I could be someone else
And I, I know enough not to hope to know
But it's so hard
'Cause the night can fill my eyes
And you give me some distance
I can get so hard to find
And when a word
When a word cuts in too close
I can always get so hard to find
And I, I know enough
Not to hope to know
It was so clear
To have not been clear at all
I got so far to have come against a wall
The first, the final, no middle
Well it seems so real to me
To each is own illusions
If I could only, I only believeEmbed
