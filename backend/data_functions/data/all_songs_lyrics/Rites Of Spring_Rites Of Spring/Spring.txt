Spring LyricsCaught in time so far away
From where our hearts really wanted to be
Reaching out to find a way
To get back to where we'd been
And if summer left you dry
With nothing left to try
This time...
Caught at a distance from myself
And there was no one there to know
What could I do?
What could I do?
I have learned sometimes a need can run too deep
And we throw away the things
We most wanted to keep
And inside we lie over and over again
This time...
Caught at a distance from myself
And there was no one there to know
And there was no one there to know
What could I do?
If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me
When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town
Around these hearts and hands
If you don't know you'd better learn to believe me
When I say I'm going to build a wall around this town
Around these hearts and hands

Caught at a distance from myself
And there was no one there to know
What could I do?
What could I do?1Embed
