Theme LyricsCruelty is the better part of your honesty
And when you're so direct
It's just for yourself to protect
And if I started crying
Would you start crying?
And if I started crying
Would you start crying?
And sometimes when I see a world inside
Sometimes when I...
You know I try
And hope is just another rope
To hang myself with
To tie me down
Something real comes around
And if I started crying
Would you start crying?
Now I started crying
Why are you not crying?
Sometimes when I got a world inside
And sometimes when I...
I try, I really try
When I, when I, when I
When I, when I, when I, when I...
When I started crying
Would you start crying?
And when I started crying
Why are you not crying?
And sometimes when I see a world inside
Sometimes when I...
You know I try, I really tryEmbed
