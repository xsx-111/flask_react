Drink Deep LyricsDrink deep
It's just a taste
And it might not come this way again
I believe in moments
Transparent moments
Moments in grace
When you've got to stake your faith
Why do I confine
When all I want is release?
It moves outside you
It stays inside you
And it's not something that I could prove
Or could choose to be moved
Yes, it's a promise and it's a threat
And it's not something that I'll let you forget
Not just yet, not just yet
Why do I chase when all I want is near?
If it's not the rule then it's always the case
Good intentions get fractured
Good intentions get replaced
So close to reach but so hard to hold
The only chance you get is past your control
It's so hard, it's so hard
Drink deep
It's just a taste
And it might not come this way again
Time to surrender
Sweet surrender of all things in time
All things one place, one placeEmbed
