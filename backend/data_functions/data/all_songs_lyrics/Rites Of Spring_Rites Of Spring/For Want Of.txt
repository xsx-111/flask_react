For Want Of LyricsI, I believed memory might
Mirror no reflections on me
I, I believed that in forgetting
I might set myself free
But I woke up this morning
With a piece of past caught in my throat
And then I choked
I, I bled
Iried to hide the heart from the head
And I, I said I bled
In the arms of a girl I'd barely met
And I woke up this morning
With the present in splinters on the ground
And then I drowned
And if I can't see
It's for want of you
You said "I see"
If there's nothing here then its probably mine
Well, my, my turn to see
If there's nothing here it will always be mine, mine
But I woke up this morning
With a piece of past caught in my throat
And then I choked
I, I guess I've learned
The taste of days that will always burn
I, I guess I've learned
If its in the corner of my eye I can't always turn
'Cause I woke up this morning
With the present in splinters on the ground
And then I drowned
And if I don't see
It's for want of you, youEmbed
