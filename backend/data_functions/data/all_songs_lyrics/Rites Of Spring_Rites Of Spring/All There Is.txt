All There Is LyricsIt's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I gave to you
It's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I gave to you
You
All there is is the knowing
That this never had to end, no
All there is to know
If I could take
Heart in hand
What I'd give to you
If I could take
Heart in hand
What I'd give to you
You
All there is is in the knowing
That this never has to end
All there is to know
That this never had to end
It's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I gave to you
It's more than love
And it's less than love
It's what I gave to you
You
All there is is the knowing
That this never had to end
All there is to knowEmbed
