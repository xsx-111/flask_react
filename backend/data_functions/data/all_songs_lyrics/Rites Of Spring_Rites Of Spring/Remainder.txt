Remainder LyricsWe are all trapped in prisons of the mind
It's a hard sensibility
But we'll see it through in time
But when words come between us
Noiseless in the air
Believe me
I know it's so easy to despair
But don't
Tonight I'm talking to myself
There's no one that I know as well
Thoughts collide without a sound
Frantic, fighting to be found
And I've found (I, found)
Things in this life that still are real
A remainder refusing to be concealed
(I, found)
The answer lies in a real emotion
Not the self-indulgence of a self-devotion
Too many situations
Left with too little to say
So we try, we try to feel our way
And if decisions cause divisions
Tell me who's to blame?
Pick a target for convenience
When there are other ways
So don't
Tonight I'm talking to myself
There's no one that I know as well
Thoughts collide without a sound
Frantic, fighting to be found
And I've found
(I, Found)
Things in this life that still are real
A remainder refusing to be concealed
(I, Found)
I've found the answer lies in a real emotion
Not the self-indulgence of a self-devotionEmbed
