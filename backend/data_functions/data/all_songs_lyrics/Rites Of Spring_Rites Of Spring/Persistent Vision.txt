Persistent Vision LyricsI was the champion of forgive forget
But I haven't found a way
To forgive you yet
And though I know you and I are through
All my thoughts are lines converging in on you
I wish sometimes
The mind were blind
(To see) what must be seen
(To feel) what can't be real
(To know) what's done is done
It goes on and on
I am the victim of a persistent vision
It tracks me down with it's precision
And though I know you're not in my eyes
I can't seem to clear you from my mind
I wish sometimes
The mind were blind
(To see) what must be seen
(To feel) what can't be real
(To know) what's done is done
It goes on and on
Help me
I can't see at all
I was the champion of forgive forget
But I haven't found a way to forgive you yet
And though I know you're not in my eyes
I can't clear persistent visionEmbed
