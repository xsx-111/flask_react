Ride On/Right On LyricsLet’s go for a ride, hej you turn me right on
Let’s get on the bike, hej you turn me right on
Ain’t nothing to hide and hej you turn me right on
The city at night, hej she turn me right on
The kids in the park, hej they turn me right on
The city at dark, hej it turn me right on
Rose on the back, hej she turn me right on
Ain’t nothing will last but hej she tell me, “Ride on”
Take your greedy hands, lay em on me
Take your greedy hands, honey, lay em on me
It’s not in the heart, but hej you turn me right on
We sit at the bar and hej you turn me right on
We lay in the dark, honey, hej you turn me right on
We wait for the part and hej you turn me right on
Take your greedy hands, lay em on me
Take your greedy hands, honey, lay em on me
Moving too fast, hej it turn me right on
Shifting to pass, hej it turn me right on
I know nothing can last, but hej you turn me right on
And Rose on the back, hej she tell me, “Ride on”1Embed
