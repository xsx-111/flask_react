Down to Go LyricsLeave another, how can you go?
How can't you know, I mean by now?
We're kids forever, ain't we tho?
Ain't we so high and wild?
You say, "Oh, you'll spin your heartache into gold"
And I suppose but it rips my heart out don't you know
But if I'm waking each morning babe
All aching and ornery babe
All vacant and thorny, hej I'm down to go
The kids of summer, don't we glow?
Oh ain't we bold, just wilding out
Hey can this kill me? Hey, I don't know
But I been sho finding out
You say, "Oh, you'll spin this heartache into gold"
And I suppose but it rips my heart out don't you know
But if I'm waking each morning babe
All aching and ornery babe
All vacant and thorny, no, it's time to go
Leave the city. Can't we go?
Can't we tho? I mean, right now
I know it's a pity. Hej, but it's getting cold
And it's getting old, this whoring around
You say, "Oh, you'll spin this heartache into gold"
And I suppose, I ain't got much choice now do I tho?
See I can't wake every morning babe
All aching and ornery babe
All jaded and thorny, no, I'm down to goEmbed
