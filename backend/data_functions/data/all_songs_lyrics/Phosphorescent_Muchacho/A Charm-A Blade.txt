A Charm/A Blade LyricsGive me ten long limbs, I'll hold
Lazy rolling things of gold
Dress me down in a New York crowd
Lay me down an bawl me out
Tell me everything's been sold
Tell me everything. I'll go
Pressed apart those skins still hold
This can't be what you want, hej
This can't be what you want
There's a charm, there's a blade
There's a lot in the way
There's a child, there's a grave
There's a lot in the way
There's a colt, there's a cane
There's a lot in the way
There's a heart, there's a chain
There's a lot in the way
Hej cut my heart but do it fast
We don't want that hurt to last
Take that violence from your brow
Shake it down and hold it out
Tell me anything's my home
Tell me anything. I'll go
Pressed apart those skins still hold
This can't be what you want
Hej, it can't be what you want
There's a charm, there's a blade
There's a lot in the way
There's a heart, there's a grave
There's a lot in the way
There's a colt, there's a cane
There's a lot in the way
There's a child, there's a chain
There's a lot in the way
There's a mark, there's a stain
There's a lot in the way
There's a phone, there's a flame
There's a lot in the way
There's a fawn, there's a fang
There's a child in the rain
There's a charm, there's a blade
There's a lot in the wayEmbed
