The Quotidian Beasts LyricsWell it woke me up early I went and I drew me a bath
Yeah I knew she'd been coming and she had got here at last
Well I started to scold her aw she just started to laugh
Yeah the beast came upon me, I guess it wasn't so bad
I said "It's you took your claws you slipped em under my skin
There's parts that got outside, honey I want to put em back in
We've been playing like children, honey, now we'll play it like men
Those parts that got outside, I'm gonna put them back in
She took the beak of a raven ah she laid it out just for show
She spun it round on the table, honey. Hej, I thought you should know
I saw the streets were of lightning all out the window below
And the beast was upon me, honey. I thought you should know
Her ancient eyes were upon me. They were familiar and black
She laid her claws all up on me. She had found me at last
Ah it woke me up early. I went and I drew me a bath
Ah, the beast was upon me, honey. I guess it wasn't so badEmbed
