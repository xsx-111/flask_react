Terror in the Canyons (The Wounded Master) LyricsI could be the tiger, I could be the snake
I could be the fire, I could be the lake
I could be the sky-bird waiting on the wind
I could be the devil waiting to begin
See, I was the wounded master, oh then I was the slave
My hands and my mouth, aw honey, they would not behave
See, I was the holy writer then I was the page
I was the bleeding actor then I was the stage
But now you're telling me my heart's sick
And I'm telling you I know
And you're telling me you're leaving
And I'm telling you to go
And I'm not so sorry for the heart-wreck
But for each season left unblessed
The new terror in the canyons
The new terror in our chests
I could be the tether, I could be the place
I could be forever or just a couple days
I could be the morning that breaks upon your skin
I could be the devil and do it all again
See, I was the wounded master then I was the slave
My hands and my mouth, aw honey, they was caught in a rage
See, I was the holy lion then I was the cage
I was the bleeding actor then I was the stage
O but now you're telling me my heart's sick
And I'm telling you I know
And you're telling me you're leaving
And I'm telling you to go
And I'm not so sorry for the heart-wreck
But for each season left unblessed
The new terror in the canyons
The new terror in our chestsEmbed
