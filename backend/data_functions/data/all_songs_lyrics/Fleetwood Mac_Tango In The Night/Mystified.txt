Mystified Lyrics
Oh
Pretty baby
This feeling I just can't hide
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)

Oh
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)

The light that shines around you
It blinds my eyes
There's a magic surrounds you
Tell me where your secret lies

Oh
Pretty darling
This feeling is deep inside
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)
(You got me mystified)
Oh
Pretty baby
This feeling I just can't hide
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified)
You got me mystified (mystified, mystified, mystified)

Mystified
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
Mystified
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
(Mystified)
Mystified
