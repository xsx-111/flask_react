Procreation (Of the Wicked) Lyrics
You are blind
Deny the sun and light
Whose are the objections
From where come the doubts

Procreation of the wicked
Procreation of the wicked

Serenades of opposition
Absurdity, humans fate and hope
True reflections of community
Procreation of the gods and lords

Procreation of the wicked
Procreation of the wicked

Cain and Abel's love and death
Love and hate is what we are
Dagger and grail are
Fallen off the altar
Procreation of the wicked
Procreation of the wicked

Of the wicked

If god raised the abyss
You'd procreate your own
Abolism of death is
Abolism of life

I've killed this old man, because he limped
I've done it because he shouldn't have to do it

Procreation of the wicked
Procreation of the wicked
