Visions of Mortality LyricsMy life turns into sand
Immortality is my dream
Man shall follow my command
Sorcery shall conquer my fear
Astral magic and runic wand
I feel that wisdom is near
Across the mountain's ice
Scarlet at the equinox' dawn
I sacrificed an innocent lamb
And drunk the wine of paradise
But, still I run the sands of time
Just one thing yet to be done
As spell surround me
At a lightmass' night
He raised the abyss
Covered by the sword
I sold my soul in vein
I feel it as he returns
The sands of time will never run
For an immortal dead man
