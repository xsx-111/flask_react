Morbid Tales LyricsBy burial this night
Nitocrys weaves the spell
Down the vault's misty light
The lurking Sphinx dwells
Agony and nightmares
To Yog-Sothoth they moan
Nightfall, morbid affairs
Bear the faceless one
In the nuclear domain
Arcades lost in eternal scries
Written by the insane
Nitocrys orders must
Agony and nightmares
To Yog-Sothoth they moan
Nightfall, morbid affair
Bear the faceless one
Are you morbid?
Mummy's rebirth by wrath
Below the temple of Nile
Vanished in Osiris' path
Above us reigns the necrophile
Agony and nightmares
To Yog-Sothoth they're none
Nightfall, morbid affairs
Beard the faceless one
Morbid Tales
