Nocturnal Fear LyricsObscurity hides the plateau
Stars darkened at their place
Nanna's glowing above
Illuminates the silent scenery
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevail
From the mountains of dawn they cry
The call of the frantic god
From the womb of mother earth they scream
The wage of creation and sin
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevail
"The sleeping lord awakes
Tiamat pulls on her chains
The blind phantom rages
Azag-Thoth Howls
Vibrations at the black ethers edge
As nocturnal fear penetrates the land
Ecstatical celebrations at their zenith
The seven sharpen their claws"
Winds emerge from the east
Deep dark water moves
Even the cold moon eclipses
When they adore the dog-faced-beast
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevail
As they admit the infernal tide
The eye on the throne derides
The old gods and their tribes
In chaos Tiamat laughs pride
Seven they are-Yeziti's Call
Aeon of night-Eager to prevailEmbed
