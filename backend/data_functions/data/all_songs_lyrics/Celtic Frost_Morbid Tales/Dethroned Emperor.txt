Dethroned Emperor LyricsSee the portal, gate to madness
Locked forever in a veil of shame
Deny extraction - Thirst for disgrace
Watch his break - The emperor is killed
Light of the day - Shadows from beyond
Scaffold of steel - The throne has gone
Gone!
Dethroned emperor
Dethroned emperor
The foot of the stairs, dimension in might
The king sits, his eyes are glass
Growing of the small - The laughter's fall
Can you deny - Remaining cries?
Descent of the lords - Into the trap
Existence and hate - Unseen gate
Dethroned emperor
