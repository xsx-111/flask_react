Into the Crypts of Rays LyricsYears of plead behind the walls
Chambers and vaults, scenes of fright
Unspoken words in pain and dread
140 lives passed his hands
Gilles de Rays, the perverted son
Holy man
Into the crypt of Rays
Into the crypt of Rays
Into the crypt of Rays
Alluring children for his masses
Robbing and buying young souls
Sacrifice to morbid demons
Satisfy his sexual lust
Gilles de Rays, the perverted son
Holy man
Into the crypt of Rays
Into the crypt of Rays
Into the crypt of Rays
"So this is for the morbid one
The braveless and sick
Shivering laughter shrilled through the tombs
Sexual offense and perverted rites
Watching them limp and die
Wizards and darkness, Gilles' dreams
Halfway came true"
As a late medieval's French marshal
Unrestrained with endless ambitions
Personal guard for Jeanne D'Arc
The rising of his soul to God
Gilles de Rais, the perverted son
Holy man
Into the crypt of Rays
Into the crypt of Rays
Into the crypt of Rays
Overdone mysticism
Desperate satanism
Are just one small step apart
There's no human scheme beyond
Gilles de Rais, the perverted son
Holy man
Into the crypt of Rays
Into the crypt of Rays
