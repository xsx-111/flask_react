Suggestion Diabolique Lyrics
This angel
Always the brightest
Oh surely will
Fall out of the nest
Conscious of the falsification
And the harnessing
Of our reality

There'll be no return
No rapprochement
No conciliation
Wisdom will never come

Constantly evolving, curious
Somber, obscure, dark and luminous
Vitriolic, stringent, prophetic

He penetrated
The wheels of modern
Society that
He hated so so much
Hated with all his strength
The angel
Would never submit
For his eyes were
Wide open and lit
We brought oil
Where there was a fire
In this way for good
Were bound to the devil

There'll be no return
No rapprochement
No conciliation
Wisdom will never come

The tumbler stayed standing up
All of his life he flinched not

Surpassing of the art
Surpassing cinema
Surpassing life itself
Ding dong ding dong...Embed
