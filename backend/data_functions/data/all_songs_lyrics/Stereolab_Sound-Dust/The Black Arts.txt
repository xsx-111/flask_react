The Black Arts LyricsI need somebody
I feel so lonely
Somebody to share
My scarcity
All cut from the world
(I need somebody)
Unrelated
(I need somebody)
(I need somebody)
This time I need somebody
(I need somebody)
To be family
(I need somebody)
(I need somebody)
Some to inspire
(I need somebody)
The dying fire
(I need my body)
Surrounded
The world
On top
Disconnected
Digging my soul
Holding my breath
To repossess
I need somebody
(I need somebody)
I feel so lonely
(I need somebody)
This time I need somebody
(I need somebody)
To be family
(I need somebody)
Some to inspire
(I need somebody)
The dying fire
(I need my body)
My heart
My heat
My sweat
My feet
I bleed
My bones
And my blood too
Need somebody
Is my bodyEmbed
