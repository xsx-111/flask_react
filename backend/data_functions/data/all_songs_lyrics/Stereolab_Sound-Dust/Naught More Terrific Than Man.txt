Naught More Terrific Than Man LyricsHis wisdom, his art surpassed all expectancies, and yet
Reality is dual, walking with good and evil
Two poles guiding his step
Two poles guiding his step
Good is the one that can weave all together
Our passions, impulsions, into city laws
Evil sets in when man thinks he is sole judge
Only him can think right, no one else be just
His wisdom, his art surpassed all expectancies, and yet
Reality is dual, walking with good and evil
Two poles guiding his step
Two poles guiding his step
Good is the one that can weave all together
Our passions, impulsions, into city laws
Evil sets in when man thinks he is sole judge
Only him can think right, no one else be justEmbed
