Nothing To Do With Me LyricsAbsurd and sensible
Quite unacceptable
Let go, pull your leg off
Control, out of control
It's the bed wetting thing
That brought us here doctor
It's the bed wetting thing
You tripped, dog on a leash
You had never noticed
Nothing to do with me
Says he weeing his feet
Well it won't go away overnight
But it will go away in the end
You did such a great job
With the boiler last time
Please can you mend my baby
He hasn't moved for three weeks
Don't they use coffins when they are that small
I don't want lizards poured in my house
Sir my chin has been getting rather hot lately
So lick your chin stand on a tall building in the stiff breeze
Don't know what to do, It's saturday night
I seek good advice from who knows what's right
Why don't you ring friends and go for a few drinks
And then go see a movie
Did you prescribe my daughter a pound of heroin
I'm sorry, I can't see, I think I've blinded myself
Did you prescribe my daughter a pound of heroin
I'm sorry, I can't see, I think I've blinded myself
It isn't a spot, it is a baby
You're not a doctor, you're a wanker1Embed
