Gus The Mynah Bird LyricsA military regime in democratic disguise
That lies in all impunity
That takes apart what it took
People years to build
Public institutions
That promised a decent life
Self-determination should be a fact
Not essentially a right
There are the lobbies
Insurance companies
Who want to change the whole country
Into a vast commercial counter
For the pure consumer
The promise to give the generals a better place
Self-determination should be fact
In the face of corruptionEmbed
