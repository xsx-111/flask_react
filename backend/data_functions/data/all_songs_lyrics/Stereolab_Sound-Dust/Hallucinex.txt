Hallucinex LyricsI look foreward to
That day when
The show will stop
Will stop
Stop renewing itself
When the most mundane
The most pedestrian show
Will cause and instill such boredom
BOOM
The time when all forms
Of expressions of life
Will be so
Destitute of substance
BANG
Then life will become
So intolerable that perhaps
Our senses will wake up
WOOAY!Embed
