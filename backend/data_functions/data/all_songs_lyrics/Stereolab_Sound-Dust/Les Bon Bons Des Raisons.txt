Les Bon Bons Des Raisons LyricsCurled upon a contracted and drowsy exterior
Humming to Auntie Sheila my torment, my bother
She gives me chocolat lalalala lalalala
Humming to Auntie Sheila my torment, my horror
She gives me chocolat, it's far better than reasoning
Through a dance let go the grip
Link with the empty space
Enough there to create heat, replenish this place
Bon-bons bon-bons bon-bons
Better than reason
Sweeter than reasonEmbed
