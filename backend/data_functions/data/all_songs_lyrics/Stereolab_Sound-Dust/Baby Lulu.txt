Baby Lulu LyricsDive in, the heart of extremes
All assembled in a style
Extremes reconciled
Improvisation
Rational and poetical, summing up contradictions
Lyrical departure
Formal unity
All in one
Intimate sensuality
Big and cold non places of concrete
Art and social action
Freedom and control
All in one
A knowing type of beauty
(A knowing type of beauty)
That inspires freedom
(That inspires freedom)
The beam is bright and shining
(The beam is bright and shining)
Not the fall of love
Reality clipped its nose, hiding personally
Utopia and reality
Hand in hand all this way
Dedicate to change that it can't bring about
It failed but succeeded
It failed but succeededEmbed
