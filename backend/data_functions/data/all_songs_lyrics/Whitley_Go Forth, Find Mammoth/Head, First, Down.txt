Head, First, Down Lyrics
We are here, it seems we always must've seen a dark black fear
And nothing ever seems so clear
The sun will not be here and I know my life has an end
The sun will not be here and questions remain in my head

So I fall head first, down
Head first, down

You heard my voice, you heard me howling in the wind
I saw your soul, I knew you'd never let me go
You're someone who'll be there and never let go of my hand
I'm someone who'll be there and protect you from oncoming winds

When you fall head first, down
When you fall head first, down
When you fall head first, down
Head first, down

And this is real and wonder it is all around
You hit the ground and know that truth is always found
Reject superstition and listen to silences sound
Reject their false prophets and know that there's something around
And they'll fall head first, down
And they'll fall head first, down
And they'll fall head first, down
'Cause we all fall head first, down1Embed
