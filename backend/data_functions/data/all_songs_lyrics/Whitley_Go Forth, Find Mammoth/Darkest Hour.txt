Darkest Hour Lyrics
At least I had you once we walked along
I didn't see you cut my chest and arm
At least I have fantasy
At least there you are mine
At least I lied

I heard the voices of a thousand men
Whisper your name to the skies
I went down to the factories and smoke
I cried down in the dirty ground
When you said goodbye

Your light is brightest at the darkest hour
And words are useless at the funeral pyre
We're sinking down just to feel the fire
Where your light is brightest at the darkest hourEmbed
