Killer Lyrics
At night, in streetlight, do not fight, I want you
I am sitting, waiting and wishing

That I could hunt you like a killer
With open arms like holy healers
I would hunt you like a killer

A call in a fall from a morning bird
It's the same in your sleep as a firing squad
So in streetlight, in the night, I ask, "Who?"

So in streetlight do not fight, I want you
I am sitting, waiting and wishing

That I could hunt you like a killer
With open arms like holy healers
I would hunt you like a killer

But I know you know I'm broken
Holy healer be unspoken
Hands are bloody, I am always on your side
A call in a fall from a morning bird
It's the same in your sleep as a firing squad
So in streetlight, do not fight, I want you

And I could hunt you like a killer
With open arms like holy healers
I would hunt you like a killerEmbed
