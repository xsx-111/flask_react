Bright White Lights Lyrics
I was walking down a dark black road
I was chasing a bright white light
I'm sinking in a deep blue ocean
I'm flying in a clear blue sky
I'm screaming at a large, deaf monster
As I'm falling from the fifteenth floor

I will make it through this
I will make it through this
I will make it through this
I will make it through this

We're dreaming of a bright white Christmas
We're sailing towards a big black storm
I'm crying like a newborn baby
'Cause you're falling like an injured dove
I'm walking down a dark black road
I'm chasing a bright white light

I will make it through this
I will make it through this
I will make it through this
I will make it through this
I will make it through thisEmbed
