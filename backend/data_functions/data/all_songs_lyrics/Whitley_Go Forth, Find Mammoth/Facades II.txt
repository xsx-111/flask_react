Facades II Lyrics
We never meant to be this bad
We never meant to be this sad
We never meant to be a lot of things
That were lurking in the dark

I applaud the façade of every broken heart
Where dreams are just screams from a deep, undying dark
Or where sweet birds are the words of a world
That hurled you down to the ground where you found
Where you are now, where you found solid ground

Buy me a new set of shoes
I'll write out a new set of rules
I'll feed you my heart and we will see
If we can cure your disease

I applaud the façade of every broken heart
Where dreams are just screams from a deep, undying dark
Or where sweet birds are the words of a world
That hurled you down to the ground where you found
Where you are now, where you found solid ground
I'm an altruist with a selfish hand
But I know and I choose, am I something higher?
I need something harder in my veins
My blood won't help me from privileged painsEmbed
