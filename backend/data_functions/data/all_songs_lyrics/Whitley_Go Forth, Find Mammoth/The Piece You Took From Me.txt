The Piece You Took From Me Lyrics
I'll howl your name at the starry sky
Beat my wings until I die
The fiery ground won't set me free
'Til I have the piece you took from me

I, I can see there's a hole in me
From where birds flew wild with a rush of wind
I'll howl your name, I'll howl your name

I'll howl your name at the starry sky
Beat my wings until I die
The fiery ground won't set me free
'Til I have the piece you took from me

Where is the love I gave for free?
Did you cast it off in the darkest sea?
I'll howl your name, I'll howl your name

I'll howl your name at the starry sky
Beat my wings until I die
The fiery ground won't set me free
'Til I have the piece you took from meEmbed
