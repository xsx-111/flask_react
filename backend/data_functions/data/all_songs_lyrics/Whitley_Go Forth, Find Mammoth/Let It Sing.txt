Let It Sing LyricsWhen I was born in my mother's bed
A tear fell down to the breath that I drew
We had our family, we had our home
Foundations trembled, now it's dead and gone
I was a young man, my gun was clean
I hadn't killed yet, I was unseen
Something comes creeping, creeping in
I killed my first love, blood on my hands
Then I fell like I knew that I was all alone
And I looked for the road towards my home
I'm a thread from a coat, I was poorly sewn
I'm a king but I stand on an empty throne
And we're all running from where we've been
Our innocence was never seen
Something comes creeping, creeping in
This could be true love or just another sin
'Cause you make me feel like I'm not alone
And you make me feel like I'm coming home
I'm a king, you're a queen, let it sing, let it sing
I'm a king, you're a queen, let it sing, let it singEmbed
