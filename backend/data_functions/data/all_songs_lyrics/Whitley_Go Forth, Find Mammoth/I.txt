I Lyrics
I want to be on a far-off star
I want to know where I got this scar
I'll leave alone to where I once flew
Out of my heart where the wild things grew

But I want to live to see all my days
And I want to give and right my wrong ways
It's scary I know, the places we go
But I want to live 'til I'm on the floor
And I've bled out for you

I want to see all the killers drown
In the blood that they drew from the book that they found
And as they sink through war's morning dew
I hope they can breathe and are found anew

But I want to live to see all my days
And I want to give and right my wrong ways
It's scary I know, the places we go
But I want to give 'til I'm on the floor
Clear blue sky, I will make you cry
'Til I've bled out for youEmbed
