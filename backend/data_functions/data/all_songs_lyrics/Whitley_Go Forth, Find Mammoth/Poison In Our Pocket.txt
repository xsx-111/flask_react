Poison In Our Pocket Lyrics
We have poison in our pocket
We have hatred in our heart
And as the bombs fly overhead
We dance 'til we see red

And we're becoming shadows
And we're becoming silhouettes

We have a knife in our back
We have a friend in black
And as the words fly overhead
We smile

And we're becoming shadows
And we're becoming silhouettes
And we're becoming shadows
And we're becoming silhouettes

I have a secret in the dark
I have you on my mind
We have poison in our pockets
But we have love in our hearts
And we're becoming shadows
And we're becoming silhouettes
And we're becoming shadows
We're becoming silhouettes
We're becoming shadows
We're becoming silhouettes
We're becoming shadows
We're becoming silhouettes
We're becoming silhouettesEmbed
