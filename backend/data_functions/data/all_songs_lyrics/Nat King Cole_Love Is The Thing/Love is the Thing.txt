Love is the Thing Lyrics
What does it matter if we're rich or we're poor?
Fortune and fame, they never endure
Oh, love is the thing, love is the thing
What good is money if your heart isn't right?
Here in your arms, I'm wealthy tonight
For youth has its flame
Love is the thing

While others fight for power
We can walk among the flowers
Knowing that the best thing in life
Is a thing that's free
Love for you and me

And even though our castles crumble and fall
We have the right to laugh at them all
For love is still king
Love is the thing


And even though our castles crumble and fall
We have the right to laugh at them all
For love is still king
Love is the thingEmbed
