Stay as Sweet as You Are Lyrics(M. Gordon, H. Revel)
Stay as sweet as you are
Don't let a thing
Ever change you
Stay as sweet as you are
Don't let a soul
Rearrange you
Don't ever lose
All the charm you possess
Your loveliness, darling
The way you say "yes"
Stay as sweet as you are
Discreet as you are
You're divine, dear
Stay as grand as you are
And as you are
Tell me that you're mine, dear
Young and gay or old and gray
Near to me or afar
Night and day I pray
That you'll always stay
As sweet as you are
(Interlude)
Young and gay or old and gray
Near to me or afar
Night and day I pray
That you'll always stay
As sweet as you areEmbed
