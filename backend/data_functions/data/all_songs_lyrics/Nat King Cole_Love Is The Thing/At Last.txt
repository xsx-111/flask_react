At Last Lyrics

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream
That I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last


You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at lastEmbed
