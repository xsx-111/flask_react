Someone to Tell It To Lyrics(Van Heusen, Cahn, Fuller)
What good is a dream
A plan or a scheme
The rainbow that you pursue?
It's everything... and it's nothing
Without someone to tell it to
How eager you are
To get to that star
But after the journey's through
You're only a lonely dreamer
Without someone to tell it to
There'll be blue days
Hard to get through days
Days when you'll just want to die
Soon you're older
And the world's colder
When there's no shoulder to cry on
Castles in air
Are empty and bare
With no one to share the view
The moonlight is merely moonlight
There's no magic in "I love you"
Without someone
Someone to tell it to
~interlude~
The moonlight is merely moonlight
There's no magic in "I love you"
Without someone
Someone to tell it toEmbed
