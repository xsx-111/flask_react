Where Can I Go Without You LyricsI went to Londontown
To clear up my mind
Then on to Paris
For the fun I couldn't find
I found I couldn't leave my memories behind
Where can I go without you?
Tried seeing Singapore
But that wouldn't do
Went to Vienna
But I found you there, too
Even in Switzerland, your memory came through
Where can I go without you?
I wanted travel, I wanted romance
I chased that rainbow across the sea
I'm tired of faces, and quaint old places
If you can't be there with me
Back on the boat again
And farewell to France
Farewell to Londontown
They haven't a chance
I'll trade the sights I've seen
For just one loving glance
Where can I go without you?
Interlude
I'm tired of faces, and quaint old places
If you can't be there with me
Back on the boat again
And farewell to France
Farewell to Londontown
They haven't a chance
I'll trade the sights I've seen
For just one loving glance
Where can I go without you?Embed
