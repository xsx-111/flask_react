Right Lyrics
Taking it all the right way
Keeping it in the back
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back
Never need, no, never no turning back

Flying in just a sweet place
Coming inside and safe
Flying in just a sweet place
Never been known to fail, never been, no
Never been known to fail

(Wishing) wishing you
(Wishing) wishing that sometimes (sometimes)
Doing it, doing it right
Till (doing it) one time (one time)
Gets you when you're down
(nobody, nobody, do it again, get off)
Ah, sometimes, doing
Wishing sometimes (give it back)
Up there, up there (giving it)
Oh, my darling
(No) Ah, my darling, (giving it) ah (up there) why?
(Gimme, gimme) up there! (yeah) gimme, doing
Taking with me (sometimes)
Loving it, doing it (right) until (take it) one time
Gimme (doing it)
Giving it (giving it back)
(Taking it all the right way) taking it
(Keeping it in the back) hey, hey
(Taking it all the right way)
(Never no turning back, never need, no)
(Never no turning back)

Taking it all the right way
Keeping it in the back
Taking it all the right way
Never no turning back, never need, no
Never no turning back

Taking it (Taking it all the right way)
(Keeping it in the back)
Taking it (Taking it all the right way)
(Never no turning back, never need, no)
(Never no turning back)

Flying in just a sweet place
Coming inside and safe
Flying in just a sweet place
Never been known to fail, never been, no
Never been known to fail
(Taking it all the right way) Taking it all the right way
(Keeping it in the back) Keeping it in the back
(Taking it all the right way) Taking it all the right way
(Never no turning back, never need, no) Never
(Never no turning back, never need, no)
(Never no turning back, never need, no)

(Never need, no)
(Never no turning back, never need, no)
(Never no turning back, never need, no)
(Never, never, never)
(Never, never, never)
(Never, never, never, never, never need, no)
(Never, never)
(Never, never, never)
(Never no turning back, never, never, no)
(Never no turning back, no, no, no)
(Never no turning back, never, never, never)
(Never no turning back, no, no)
(A-never, a-never, a-never, a-never)
(A-never, a-never, a-never, a-never)
(A-never no turning back, never need, no)
(Never need, no)
(Never no turning back, never, never, never, never)
(Never no turning back, never need, no)3Embed
