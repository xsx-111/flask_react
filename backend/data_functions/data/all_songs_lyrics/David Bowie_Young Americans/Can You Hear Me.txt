Can You Hear Me Lyrics
Once we were lovers
Can they understand?
Closer than others I was your
I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches
Ooh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day
To see if I'm faking it all

Can you hear me?
Can you feel me inside?
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

There's been many others
(Oo-oo-oo-ooh) so many times
Sixty new cities, and what do I
What do I find?
I want love so badly
I want you most of all
You know, it's harder to take it from anyone
It's harder to fall
Can you hear me call ya?
Well, can you (hear me?)
Can you (feel me inside?)
Show your (love, love)
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

Well, can you hear me? (yeah)
Can you feel me inside? (I do)
Show your love (love, love)
Show me your sweet, sweet love, show me your love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right
To your love life, baby

Take it in right to your love life
Take it in right, take it in right
Right to your love life
Take it in right, ah
(Why don't you take it?) take it in, take it in right
(Why don't you take it?) Right down, right down
(Why don't you take it?) mmm, why don't you take it?
(Right to your heart) can you hear me?
(Why don't you take it?) can you feel me?
(Why don't you take it?) can you take it in right?
(Why don't you take it?) ooh, right down, right down
(Right to your heart) can you take it? Feel me?
(Why don't you take it?) down, to right down
(Why don't you take it?) to your heart
(Why don't you take it?) to your heart
(Right to your heart) take it down, take it down
(Why don't you take it?)
(Why don't you take it?) take it in right
(Right to your heart)1Embed
