Fascination Lyrics
I've got to use her

Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what she put me through, dear
Fascination moves, sweeping near me
Still, I take ya

(Fascination) fascination
(Sho'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(Can a heartbeat) can a heartbeat
(Live in the fever) live in the fever
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh, yeah
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) I've got to use her
(Every time) fascination comes around
Ooh
(Fascination)
Your soul is calling like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think that I'm a little crazy
Ooh, but pleasure seeks this thing, I think I like fascination
Still, I take ya

(Fascination) fascination
(Sho'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) come on, come on, come on, come on
(Can a heartbeat) can my heartbeat
(Live in the fever) live in the fever
(Raging inside of me?) raging inside of me?
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh, yeah
(Takes a part of me) come on, come on, come on, come on
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) I've got to
(Every time) every time
Fascination comes around

(Fascination) sure enough
(Sho'nuff) takes a part of me
(Takes a part of me) can a heartbeat
(Can a heartbeat) live in the fever
(Live in the fever) raging
(Raging inside of me?) fascination
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) fascination
(Takes a part of me) fascinate, ah, oh babe
(I can't help it) fascination
(I've got to use her) I've got to use her
(Every time) Every time
Fascination comes around
(Fascination)
(Fascination) fascination
(Sho'nuff)
(Fascination) takes a part of me
(Yeah, yeah) can a heartbeat
(Fascination) live in the fever
(Yeah, yeah) raging inside of me?
(Fascination) fascination
(Yeah, yeah) oh, yeah
(Fascination) fascination
(Yeah, yeah) oh, yeah
(Fascination) oh, yeah
(Yeah, yeah) oh, yeah
(Fascination) takes a part of me
(Yeah, yeah) I cannot help it
(Fascination) I can't help it
(Yeah, yeah) I've got to use her
(Fascination) every time
(Yeah, yeah) fascination
(Fascination)
(Yeah, yeah) fascination
(Fascination)
Fascination
Takes a part of me
Can a heartbeat live in the fever raging inside of me?
Fascination takes a part of me
I can't help it, got to use her
Every time, every time
Every time fascination comes around3Embed
