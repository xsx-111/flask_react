Across the Universe Lyrics
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on across the universe
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

Nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing's going to
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing's going to
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Hey, nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change it
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing going to change it
Nothing going to change it
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
Nothing's going to change my worldEmbed
