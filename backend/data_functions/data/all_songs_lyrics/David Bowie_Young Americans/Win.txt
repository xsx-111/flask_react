Win Lyrics
(Hey, it ain't over)

Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ooh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired

Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh, it ain't over)

Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh) It ain't over

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to grin
All you've got to do is win
(Ooh, that's all you've got to do)
(Ooh) All you got to do is win (it ain't over, no)

And your smile is spreading thin (Ooh, seek and believe in you)
It seems you're trying not to lose (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin (Ooh, that's all you got to do)
All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no)
(Ooh, seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win (Ooh, it ain't over, no, no)
Woo-hoo! (Ooh) All you've got (that's all you've got to do)
Is all you've got (Ooh, it ain't over)
It ain't over2Embed
