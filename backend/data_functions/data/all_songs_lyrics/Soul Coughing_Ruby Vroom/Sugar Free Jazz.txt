Sugar Free Jazz LyricsNormalize the signal and you're banging on freon...
Paleolithic eon.. put the fake goatee on...
And it booms as cool as sugar-free jazz...
Schools he bombs, he bombs...
Stack wax; lie like a placemat...
Won't lap or help you at the automat...
And it's clear and clean as sugar-free jazz...
Schools he bombs, he bombs...
Fossilize apostle and I comb it with a rake...
You can't escape, you pull out the brake...
And it booms as cool as sugar-free jazz...
Schools he bombs, he bombs...Embed
