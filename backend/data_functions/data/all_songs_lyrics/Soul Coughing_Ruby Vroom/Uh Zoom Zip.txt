Uh Zoom Zip Lyrics
Uh Zoom zip and I wake up, uh zoom zip
My eye like a noisegate the number 8 frustrate and I roll to the floor fruit
To the fruit to the core of a spheroid embedded in my skull the round the
Zero the symbol of null and void and well I toyed with the concept of
Vitamin B-12 the synapse the synapse it feeds itself on a nutrient
Contained in sunlight the blink the lid the fight to snap open

Moving up to the double M 2000 I eat up a decade like a flan your turn of
The century you turn it up turn it up clock seconds to the hour go and cash the
Millenium
Um Um and it hums like a migraine to the brain in the time yet
Remaining but uh ah melancholy nonsense and I crack nouns brother fuck the verb tense
