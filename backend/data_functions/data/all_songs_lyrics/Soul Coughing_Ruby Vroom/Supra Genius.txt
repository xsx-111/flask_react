Supra Genius LyricsSomething I can't comprehend
Something so complex and couched in its equation
So dense that light cannot escape from...
In the dark, your brain glows, and it goes
Way-um-way, way-um-way, um...
I know you're a supra genius...
I know you're a supra genius...
Will you shoot the blue earth down?
In the space station, polishing the raygun...
You say correllation is not causation
In the dark, your brain glows, and it goes
Way-um-way, way-um-way, um...
I know you're a supra genius...
I know you're a supra genius...Embed
