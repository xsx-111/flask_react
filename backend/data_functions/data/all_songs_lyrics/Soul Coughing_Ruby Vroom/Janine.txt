Janine LyricsJanine, I drink you up...
Janine, I drink you up...
Janine, Janine, I sing...
If you were the Baltic Sea and I were a cup, uh-huh
Varick Street and I drove south
With my hands on the wheel and your taste in my mouth
Jesus to my left, the Holland Tunnel on my right
Angels shine down from the traffic light...
Janine, I drink you up...
Janine, I drink you up...
Janine, Janine, I sing...
If you were the Baltic Sea and I were a cup, uh-huh
I fell asleep by the blue light of "Live at Five"
And as I drifted off, I heard Al Roker say to me:
Dial 1-900-4-J-A-N-I-N-E
Janine, I drink you up...
Janine, I drink you up...
Janine, Janine, I sing...
If you were the Baltic Sea and I were a cup, uh-huh
Slap myself to waking, but now it's too late
Cause I spelled your name out on my license plate
Janine...Embed
