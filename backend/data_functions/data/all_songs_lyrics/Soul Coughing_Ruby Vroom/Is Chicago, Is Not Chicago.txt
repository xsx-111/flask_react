Is Chicago, Is Not Chicago LyricsA man
Drives a plane
Into the
Chrysler building
A man
Drives a plane
Into the
Chrysler building
Saskatoon is in the room
Poulsbo is in the room
Bennetsville is in the room
Palmyra is in the room

Is Chicago!
Is not Chicago!
Is Chicago!
Is not Chicago!
A man
Cuts in half
Just like he
Snaps a pencil
A man
Cuts in half
Just like he
Snaps a pencil
Khartoum is in the room
Phnom Penh is in the room
Pyongyang is in the room
Cairo is in the room

A man
Drives a plane
Into the
Chrysler building
A man
Drives a plane
Into the
Chrysler building
Into the
Into the
Into the
