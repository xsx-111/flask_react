Screenwriters Blues LyricsExits to freeways twisted like knots on the fingers
Jewels cleaving skin between breasts
Your Cadillac breathes four hundred horses over blue lines
You are going to Reseda to make love to a model from Ohio
Whose real name you donâ€™t know
You spin like the Cadillac was overturning down a cliff on television
And the radio is on and the radioman is speaking
And the radioman says "Women were a curse."
So men built Paramount Studios
And men built Columbia Studios
And men built...Los Angeles
It is 5 A.M. and you are listening to Los Angeles
It is 5 A.M. and you are listening to Los Angeles
And the radioman says "It is a beautiful night out there!"
And the radioman says "Rock and roll lives!"
And the radioman says "It is a beautiful night out there in Los Angeles."
You live in Los Angeles and you are going to Reseda
We are all in some way or another going to Reseda someday to die
And the radioman laughs because the radioman fucks a model too
Gone savage for teenagers with automatic weapons and boundless love
Gone savage for teenagers who are aesthetically pleasing in other words "FLY"
Los Angeles beckons the teenagers to come to her on buses
Los Angeles loves love
It is 5 am and you are listening to Los Angeles
It is 5 am and you are listening to Los Angeles
I am going to Los Angeles to build a screenplay about lovers who murder each other
I am going to Los Angeles to see my own name on a screen, five feet long and luminous
As the radioman says it is 5 A.M. and the sun has charred the other side of the world and come back to us
And painted the smoke over our heads an imperial violet
It is 5 am and you are listening to Los Angeles
It is 5 am and you are listening to Los Angeles
You are listening
You are listening
You are listening
You are listening to Los AngelesEmbed
