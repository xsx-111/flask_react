Blueeyed Devil LyricsBlue eyed devil
Blue eyed devil
Born to be a God among Salesmen
Working the skinny tie
Slugging down fruit juice
Extra tall extra wide
33 degrees
Six hundred and sixty six
Dig digging it, come on
Moving door to door to door
Stone motel room
Nice cool on the bathroom floor
King of Siam
Get the trouble frying
Spoon to the lighter to the lighter to the gun
Devil lapsed out in a pool of sunEmbed
