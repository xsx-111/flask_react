Mr. Bitterness LyricsOne
There is a bar they call "The Bitter Sea"
And she sits and drinks a Velvet Crush
And that's Kool-Aid and gin
Casing the clientele like a relentless cameraman
She is elsewhere
She says, "You keep a-knockin', but you can't come in"
And I say, "Little sister, don't you do what your big sister does"
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Well, desire looks just like you with an Uzi 9
Gun down fifteen bystanders in a roadside drive-by, yeah
Desire is the grass fire, drinking gasoline
She says, "Open up your mouth, man, let me come inside"
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
She cracked now
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
She snapped now
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
She gone, gone, gone
Leaning up against the wall
I will lash out dancing like a madman when you're gone
I will spit the blue flame and hurl my glass against the wall
And I will hear your name called out from a boom box
I will hear your name called out from passing cars
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
She cracked now
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
She snapped now
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
She gone, gone, gone
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Spiral down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
Now they call me Mr. Bitterness
Mister
Now they call me Mister
Now they call me Mister
Now they call me Mister
Now they call me Mister
Spiral down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, downEmbed
