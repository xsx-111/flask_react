City of Motors LyricsThree times dark, first in the mind
Second on Java Street, the dead car there
The hood blown out with a BB gun
Manuela said she saw the brakes fail...
Manuela said she saw the brakes fail...
An empty body, but it still bled
Oil from the axle, and it left a trail...
Ran down Java Street, and formed a pool
Manuela saw the moon in there...
Manuela saw the moon in there...
And I hear it rumbling, I hear transmission grind
I bear witness. I have the clutch now
Three times darker on the rooftops
Man jumps between and grabs the rail
Man tries the door but the door is locked
Man gouge the hinge and goes down the stairs...
Man gouge the hinge and goes down the stairs...
Dull bright morning and the tools are gone
Detectives with flashlights in the elevator shaft
Manuela tells detectives she saw him there
Stuck in the hinge is a sliver of a fingernail...
Stuck in the hinge is a sliver of a fingernail...
And I hear it rumbling, I hear transmission grind
I bear witness. I have the clutch now
Three times dark on the turnpike
From the Motor City to the City of Dis
They traced his travel by his credit card
No sleep, smokes, and he's nauseous...
No sleep, smokes, and he's nauseous...
Flips an ash like a wild, loose comma
Ash hits the oil around the pump
Travels to the pump and the pump explodes
Witness says he saw the car jump...
Witness says he saw the car jump...
And I hear it rumbling, I hear transmission grind
I bear witness. I have the clutch nowEmbed
