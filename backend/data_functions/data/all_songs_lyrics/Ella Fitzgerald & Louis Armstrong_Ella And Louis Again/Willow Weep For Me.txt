Willow Weep For Me Lyrics
Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me
Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love is sin
To leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone

Oh, weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend old willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love is sin
To leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone

Oh, weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend old willow and weep for me
Weep, weep, willow, weepEmbed
