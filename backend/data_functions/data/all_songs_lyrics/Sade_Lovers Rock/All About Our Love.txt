All About Our Love Lyrics
It's all about our love
So shall it be forever, never ending

After all this time
After all is said and done

We have seen some suffering, baby
It has not always been perfect

After all this time
After all is said and done

Darling we know it
Whatever may come
We can get through it
As if it's just begun, oh, it's just begun

It's all about our love
So shall it be forever, never ending
Darling we know it
After all this time
After all is said and done

After all this time
After all is said and doneEmbed
