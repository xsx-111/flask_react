Every Word Lyrics
(Love is what the world want)

I saw a picture
How could you be so careless?
How could you have done that to us?
And I write this letter
I send it all back to you
And every word you said

In there every word, oh oh oh oh
How could you have done that to us?

You treated me like a stranger
And all the time I was loving you
All your slick moves
They were once innocent moves
I wanted to look up to you
I really trusted you
And every word you said

In there every word, oh oh oh oh
How could you have done that to us?
(Love is what the world want)
I was loving you like a child
All the time you were smiling the same smile
(Love is what the world want)
(Love is what the world want)
I was loving you like a child
I really trusted you

Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the world want)
Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the world want)
(Love is what the world want)
Every word you said
Every word you said

I was loving you like a child
All the time you were smiling the same smile
I was loving you like a child
I really trusted you
Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the world want)
I send it back to you, yeah
(Love is what the world want)
Every word you said
Every word you said
(Love is what the world want)
I send it all back to you, yeah
(Love is what the world want)1Embed
