Somebody Already Broke My Heart Lyrics
You came along when I needed a Savior
Someone to pull me through somehow

I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

Somebody already broke my heart
Somebody already broke my heart

Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
On the end of a line
Hanging on the edge of a lie

I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and be kind

Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again
You came along when I needed a Savior
Someone to pull me through somehow

I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again1Embed
