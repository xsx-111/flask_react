Flow Lyrics
Ooh baby mm
When you hold me
Oh Oh
When you hold me the sound

Is it possible I could feel this good
I could really love you the way I do
Is it possible I would feel this good
I could really love you the way I do

See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)
And the waves rush over me

I feel a love light rush over me
I feel the love turn to me
And then your love just creeps over me
Over me
See me (within the light)
Flowing (take me to you)
Like the river to the sea
You come down (I'm in the light)
You cover (pull me to you)
The waves rush over me

Ooh baby mm
When you hold me
Oh oh
When you hold me closer

And I won't let you go
I won't let you go
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go

Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
To cold it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me
I won't let it go
Take up your love
Take up your love
Take up your love
And come to me
This love's not a liar
To cold it's a fire
I'm on the run
And it's a comfort to me
And I won't let you go
I won't let you go
And I won't let you go
I won't let you goEmbed
