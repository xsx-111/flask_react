Immigrant Lyrics
Coming from where he did
He was turned away from every door like Joseph

To even the toughest among us that would be too much

He didn't know what it was to be black
'Til they gave him his change
But didn't want to touch his hand

To even the toughest among us don't you know that would be too much

Isn't it just enough
How hard it is to live
Isn't it hard enough
Just to make it through a day

The secret of their fear and their suspicion
Standing there looking like an angel
In his brown shoes
His short suit
His white shirt
And his cuffs a little frayed
Coming from where he did
He was such a dignified child
To even the toughest among us don't you know that would be too much

Isn't it just enough
How hard it is to live
Isn't it hard enough
Just to make it through a day

Coming from where he did
He was turned away from every door like Joseph

To even the toughest among us don't you know that would be too much

He didn't know what it was to be black
'Til they gave him his change
But didn't want to touch his hand

To even the toughest among us that would be too much1Embed
