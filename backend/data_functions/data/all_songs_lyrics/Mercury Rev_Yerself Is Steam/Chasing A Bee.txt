Chasing A Bee Lyrics
Those seducers, those seducers
Those seducers, those seducers

Bombed out lovers, gallant red flocks
Of mellow seducers find eager seekers
Deep deef down, beautiful lines
From above and we're all a-glow
Raise her head and things get warm
Hold on to it's leg before it flies away
Sunlit walks, I feel no harm
My primitive words match my primitive heart
It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam

And of course it don't mind chasing a bee inside a jar
And of course it don't mind chasing a bee inside a jar

Then like sheep led to sacrifial slaughter
They don't mind but they oughta all the time (they oughta)
Their pretty shells are so inviting, well protected
Their eyes are rivers, they give me shivers
And of course it don't mind chasing a bee inside a jar
And of course it don't mind chasing a bee inside a jar
In a jar, in a jar, in a jar

It's not time for the real life sign, it's not time for these fears of mine
It's not time for the real life sign, it's not time for these fears of mine

I'm feeling troubled, I'm feeling trapped
Can't shake that bubble off my back
It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam
It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam
It's not time for the real life sign
It's not time for these fears of mine
I'm feeling troubled, I'm feeling trapped
Can't shake that bubble off my back
I feel no harm, I feel no harm, feel no harm

And of course it don't mind chasing a bee inside a jar
And of course it don't mind chasing a bee inside a jar
In a jar, in a jar, in a jar

It's not as easy as it may seem
Remember that yourself is steam
What once was lost will never be found
Keep spinning in circles till you break the groundEmbed
