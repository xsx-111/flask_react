Very Sleepy Rivers LyricsI sensed a new scent, so innocent and bent
I sense a new scent that's innocent and spent
I feel good, not so good
Very sleepy rivers - a very sleepy place
Very sleepy rivers - a very sleepy place
Milk silver and sulk, fish in warm clear liquid
I feel so wet, I feel kinda misguided
Very sleepy river - a very sleepy place
Very sleepy river - a very sleepy place (kinda thing)
Very sleepy river, very sleepy river (it's just a thing)
Very sleepy river (just a thing) - a very sleepy thing, thing, thing
A very sleepy place - very sleepy (a very sleepy river)
A very sleepy river - a place, a place
A verbal trashing, a verbal trashing
A verbal trashing, a verbal trashing
A verbal trashing, milk silver and sulk
Nothing quivers, a very sleepy river, a river
Burn, burn, burn, (?) space
Words tumble from me, a very sleepy river
Words tumble from me, a very sleepy river
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy place
Stop all that twitching, I'm alright
A twisted thing, a laughing, disregard, disregard
Very sleepy rivers remind me of falling down
Very (?), the water's wet and I want my daddy
(?)
(?)
Very rusty, very rusty, very, very lusty
Very sleepy lusty (lusty, lusty, lusty)
I wish everything was lusty, lusty
I believe in color, I believe in color
I believe in coming unglued
I believe (?) when you're far away
Your father waiting in a very sleepy place
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy place
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy place
(?)
Very sleepy cushy wave, a very sleepy place
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy river
A very sleepy, a very sleepy river
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy place
A very sleepy place (?)
Innocent, my scent, innocent, repent
Innocent, my scent, innocent, I feel spent
(?)
Submerged in a very sleepy place
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy river
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy river
(?), very sleepy space
(?), cushy, (?)
Innocent, my scent, innocent, repent
Innocent, my scent, innocent, repent
(?), I believe in love
A very sleepy river, a very sleepy river
A very sleepy space (?)
In a very crazy place
(?) kick the brain writhing like a whore
Very sleepy river, very sleepy place
A very sleepy river (?), very sleepyEmbed
