Blue And Black LyricsI see blue, I see black
I see you in a crack
I see snow, I see cold
I see someone getting old
Ooh, and it's cold outside
Ooh, so cold outside
I need pink, I need green
I need someone who sews up seams
I need everything, everything
Ooh, but it's cold outside
Ooh, it's so cold outside
I see all the colors of spring
I see you wearing my ring
Ooh, and it's warmer outside
Ooh, it's so much warmer outside
Ooh, it's warmer
Still, you're there
I see you in a crack
Crack, crack
I will crackEmbed
