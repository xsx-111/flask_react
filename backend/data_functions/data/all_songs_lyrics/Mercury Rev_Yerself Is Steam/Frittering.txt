Frittering Lyrics
I've seen you eaten away
Slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine
I've seen you chiseled away
Slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine

And you wonder why I leave so soon
I get so high I sink to the bottom of your room

I've seen you fritter away
Slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine
I've seen you whittle away
Slow as a glacier makes its way down to the spine

And you wonder why I leave so soon
I get so high I sink to the bottom of your room

I wonder why I stay
Slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine
I've seen you eaten away
Slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine
I wonder what to do
Slow as a glacier takes to move on through the world
And you wonder why I leave so soon
I get so high I sink to the bottom of your room
And you wonder why I leave so soon
I get so high I sink to the bottom of your room

I've seen you chiseled away
Hammer in place always in time
I've seen you chisel away
Slow as a glacier makes its way down to the Rhine

And you wonder why I leave so soon
I get so high I sink to the bottom of your room
