Everything I Am Is Yours Lyrics
I am just a man
Tipping on the wire
Tight rope walking fool
Balanced on desire
I can not control
These ever changing ways
So how can I be sure
The feeling will remain
It'll always change

But everything I am
Is yours
Everything I am
Is yours

Find it hard to say
What's going on inside
Got these little walls
Couldn't break them if I tried
But I promise I'll be true
And I promise I'll be right
Sickness and in health
In the darkness and the light
I give you every sigh
Cause everything I am
Is yours
Everything I am
Is yours

Left my demons at the door
So whatchu opening it for?
I guess they'll help you understand
Everything I am, Everything I am

Left my demons at the door
So whatchu opening it for?
I guess they'll help you understand1Embed
