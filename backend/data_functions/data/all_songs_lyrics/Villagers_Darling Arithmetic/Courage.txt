Courage Lyrics
One, two
One, two
It took a little time, to get where I wanted
It took a little time, to get free
It took a little time, to be honest
It took a little time, to be me

I took a little lover, but then we parted
I took a little time, to get over this
From time to time, I get heavy hearted
Thinking of how you used to kiss

Courage, it's a feeling like no other, let me tell you, yeah
Courage, in harmony with something other than your ego
Courage, the sweet belief of knowing nothing comes for free

Do you really wanna know
About these lines on my face
Well, each and every one is testament to
All the mistakes I've had to make, to find

Courage, it's a feeling like no other, let me tell you, yeah
Courage, in harmony with something other than your ego
Courage, the sweet belief of knowing nothing comes for free
(for Free)
Courage, it's a feeling like no other, let me tell you, yeah
Courage, in harmony with something other than your ego
Courage, the sweet belief of knowing nothing comes for free
For freeEmbed
