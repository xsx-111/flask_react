Dawning On Me Lyrics
I've been awake for so long now
Just can't get to sleep
You've been tugging at my eyelids
You've been dawning on me
And there's a light, coming through the window
But all I can see
Is the light of your love
You've been dawning on me

Dawning on me

I've been awake for so long now
Just can't get to sleep
You've been, calling on the sunlight
You've been dawning on me
From your lips, to your belly
To your knees, and your feet
And the spirit that moves them
You've been dawning on me

You've been dawning on me
I've been awake for so long now
Just can't get to sleep
You've been delivering the daydream
You've been dawning on me
There's a light coming through the window
But all I can see
Is the light of your love
You've been dawning on me1Embed
