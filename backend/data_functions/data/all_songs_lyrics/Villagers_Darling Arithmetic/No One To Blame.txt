No One To Blame Lyrics
'Scuse me while I die
A million times before I meet
Your eyes, with mine
Find all the promises you make
Before you leave me on the shelf

Then I'll have no one to blame
Yes I've got no one to blame

'Scuse me while I try, to be somebody
That you might, decide you like
Enough to come ove to my place
And as my heart begins to swell
I'll forget to wear, that face
That you got to know so well
And you'll see me as I am
Just an empty broken shell

Then I'll have no one to blame
Yes I've got no one to blame
But myself
See there's a mystery in your eyes
A kind of swimming pool, swimming fools
Like me

'Scuse me while I fly
High up above this broken town, as I look down
On all the people as they say
That they're always here to help
In my heart I know that they
Couldn't catch me if I fell
Only you could take the weight
Of this ancient wicked spell

Then you'll have no one to blame
Yes you've got no one to blame
Then you'll have no one to blame
But yourself

See there's a mystery in your eyes
A kind of swimming pool, swimming fools
Like me
Oh, mister mysteryEmbed
