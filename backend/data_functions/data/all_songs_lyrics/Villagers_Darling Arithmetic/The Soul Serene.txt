The Soul Serene Lyrics
So I go walking on the shore
And wonder what I am walking for
Rain falling in the stream
As I try to figure
I tried to figure out what it all means
And I find, chameleon dreams, in my mind

Took a little ride on the carousel
When will it end I can never tell
Keep spinning until the soul serene
Until I got no reason
I've got no reason to figure out what it means
And I find, chameleon dreams, in my mind

Step into the soul serene
The soul serene
Step into the soul serene
The soul serene
Step into the soul serene
The soul serene
(Step into the soul serene)
Where have you been
All my life
So I go walking on the shore
And wonder what I am walking for
All steady sunlight seen
But something tells me
Something tells me, all is not as it seems
And I find, chameleon dreams, in my mind

Step into the soul serene
The soul serene
Step into the soul serene
The soul serene
Step into the soul serene
The soul serene
(Step into the soul serene)
Where have you been
(The soul serene)
All my life
(Step into the soul serene)
Where have you been
(The soul serene)
All my life
(Step into the soul serene)
Where have you been
(The soul serene)
All my life
(Step into the soul serene)
Where have you been
(The soul serene)
All my life
(Step into the soul serene)
Where have you been
(The soul serene)
All my life
(The soul serene)
(Step into the soul serene)
(The soul serene)
(Step into the soul serene)
(The soul serene)
(Step into the soul serene)1Embed
