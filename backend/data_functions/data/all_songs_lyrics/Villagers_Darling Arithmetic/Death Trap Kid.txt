Death Trap Kid Lyrics
Hey death trap kid you're not alone (x2)
Sometimes you think you're not gonna make it
When you're on your own
I know you're feeling so isolated
But let me tell you
You're not alone

Hey death trap kid you're not alone
Hey death trap kid you're doing fine
And your courage always astounds me like a sun inside
But there's a jealous moon on the horizon
So hold on kid for dear life

Hey death trap kid you're not alone
Hey death trap kid you're doing well
But they make you lock up your feelings
It's a prison cell
And you start to think you're a monster
It's a particular kind of hell

Hey death trap kid you're not alone
Hey death trap kid you're not alone
It's a death trap kid, it's a feeling low
It's the odd one out in the schoolyard
It's a death trap kid when you want to show
Who you really are but it's too hard
You're not alone
You're not alone, no
You're not alone, noEmbed
