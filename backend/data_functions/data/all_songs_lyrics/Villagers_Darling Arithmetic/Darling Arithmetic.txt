Darling Arithmetic Lyrics
Bring down the vale
For all to see
Shake off the rain
And return to me

If ours was a dream
A phantom, a sacred scheme
Then how did it end, so quick
My darling, arithmetic

Boxed up your clothes
Cleaned out your room
Laid in your bed
Flew to the moon

Are you hiding up here?
Did they force you to disappear?
Is it all just a dirty drink
My darling, arithmetic

And the merchants say
What they always said
And the lenders say
What they always said
They only said a soft reminder, that
You are dead
