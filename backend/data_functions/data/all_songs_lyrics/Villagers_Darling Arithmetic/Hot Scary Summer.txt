Hot Scary Summer Lyrics
Ohh Lord

So you thank me for my hard work
But you've had it up to there
'Cos this shouldn't be hard work
But I'll fight to care if you'd care to fight

Thank you for your hard work
But I've had it up to here
'Cos this shouldn't be hard work
Least not the kind that makes us
Half a person, half a monster
Stuck together in this hot scary summer

Ohh Lord
Hot scary Summer
Ohh

Remember kissing on the cobblestones
In the heat of the night
And all the pretty young homophobes
Looking out for a fight
We got good at pretending
Then pretending got us good
We've always been up against it
But now it's sad to see
We're up against each other in this hot scary summer

Ohh Lord
Hot scary Summer
Ohh

I live inside you
And you live in me
And I live inside you
And you live in me
And nothing's gonna change that, dear
Nothing's gonna change that, dear
Not even being apart
We travel right to the heart
Of this hot scary Summer

Ohh Lord
Hot scary Summer
Ohh
So you thank me for my hard work
But we've had it up here
'Cos this shouldn't be hard work
Least not the kind that make us
Half a person, half a monster
Stuck together in this hot scary summer3Embed
