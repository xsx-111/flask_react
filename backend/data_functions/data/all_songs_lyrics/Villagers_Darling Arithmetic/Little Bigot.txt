Little Bigot Lyrics
Love is old
Love is real
Love is true

Love is old
Love is me
Love is you

We're taking aim
And you're about
To expire
So take the blame
Throw that hatred, on the fire
Throw it on the fire
Throw it on the fire



We're taking aim
(Love is old, little bigot)
And you're about, to expire
(Love is real, love is true)
So take the blame
Throw that hatred, on the fire
Throw it on the fire
(Love is old)
Throw it on the fire
(Love is me, love is you)
Throw it on the fire
(We're taking aim, little bigot)
Throw it on the fire
Love is old
Love is old
Love is new

Love is old
Love is me
Love is you

We're the same
And it's okay, to be tired
So take the blame, little bigot
And throw that hatred on the fire
Throw it on the fire
