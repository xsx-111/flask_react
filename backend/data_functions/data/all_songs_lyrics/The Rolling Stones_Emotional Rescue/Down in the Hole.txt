Down in the Hole LyricsWill all your money
Buy you forgiveness
Keep you from sickness
Or keep you from cold?
Will all your money
Keep you from madness
Keep you from sadness
When you're down in the hole?
Because you'll be down in the gutter
You'll be bumming for cigarettes
Bumming for nylons
In the American Zone
You'll be down in the hole
Yeah, down in the hole
No escape from trouble
Nowhere to go
Down in the gutter
Begging for cigarettes
Begging forgiveness
All that you know
Down in the hole
After digging the trenches
Looking for cover and finding out there is nowhere to go
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere to go
None of your money
Will buy you forgiveness
None of your jewelry
None of your gold
Your black market cigarettes
Your American nightclubs
Ah, they've got nowhere left
Something for nothing
All of your friends gone
Something for nothing
That's all that you know
There's something down in the hole
Down, down, down in the hole
Something down, down, down, down in the holeEmbed
