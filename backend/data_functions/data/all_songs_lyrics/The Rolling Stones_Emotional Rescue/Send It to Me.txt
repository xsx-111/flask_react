Send It to Me Lyrics
Oh, I think I had enough
You know religion is tough
It's a state of mind, I don't need it!

Sending a letter to my mother
I need some loving, send it to me
I lost my lover, unfaithful lover
I need some money, send it to me
I need consoling, your boy's feeling lonely
Describe her for me, send it to me

Send it to me, send it to me
Send it to me, send it to me

If she can't travel, I can take the mule train
I can take the aeroplane, send it to me

Today I'm begging you, begging you, begging you
Down on my knees
Baby please, please please
You, you got to send it, send it, send it
Send it to me, send it, oh send it to me (You got to send it)
Send it to me, send it to me, send it to me

Yeah, I'm sending in a letter to my sister in Australia
Sister it reads
Ain't you got no daughter, no second cousin, that needs my loving?
Send it to me

Send it to me, send it to me
Send it to me, send it to me

She won't have to wash or scrape
She won't have to relocate
I guarantee her personal security
She don't have to be five foot ten or a blonde or brunette
She doesn't have to be no social hostess, send her
She may work in a factory right next door to me in my fantasy

Send it to me, send it to me
Send it to me, send it to me
She could be Romanian, she could be Bulgarian
She could be Albanian, she could be Hungarian
She might be Ukrainian, she could be Australian
She could be the Alien, send it to me

Send it to me (You've got to send it)
Send it to me (You've got to send it)
Send it to me (You've got to send it)
Send it to meEmbed
