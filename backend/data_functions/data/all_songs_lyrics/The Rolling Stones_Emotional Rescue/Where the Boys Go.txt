Where the Boys Go Lyrics
Hey girls, you better listen to me
I'm getting starved with your company
All day Monday and all day Tuesday
I'm playing football, there's nothing on the telly

Ever since I was just 13 years old
And I always felt shy but I acted so bold
I never had the money and I never had the class
But I always seemed to get myself a Saturday night piece of ass

(Where the boys go) Saturday night
(Where the boys all go) Hold me tight
(Where the boys go) Saturday night
(Where the boys all go)

Saturday morning and you see me down the pub
And I'm pissing away me money and I can't stand up
Cab fare, pop? You look silly in the road
Get in everybody, where the boys all go

Hey! Never keep a secret from me
Never keep a secret from you
Never keep a secret from me
(Where the boys go) Saturday night
(Where the boys all go) Hold me tight
(Where the boys go) Stand around and pose
(Where the boys all go) Showing off their clothes
(Where the boys go) Down the disco
(Where the boys all go) Where the boys all go

Hey girls, what you doing tonight?
Now do you want to dance or do you want to bite?
Look here, darling, I know the score
Paint your face, dye your hair, I'll see you 'round the back

Hey, never keep a secret from you
Never keep a secret from me
Never keep a secret from you
Everybody knows

(Where the boys go) On Saturday night
(Where the boys all go) To hold you tight
(Where the boys go) Saturday night
(Where the boys all go) Where they go, where they go

(Where the boys go) Saturday night
(Where the boys all go) To hold you tight
(Where the boys go) For a giggle and a laugh
(Where the boys go) And a little bit of ass
(Where the boys all go) For a little piece of this
(Where the boys all go) And a little bit of that
(Where the boys all go) For a little piece of stick
(Where the boys all go) For a little piece of cunt

Where the boys roll, where the girls are now
Where the girls are now
Where the boys all go, where the girls are now
Where the boys all go, where the girls are now
Where the boys all go, where the girls are now
Where the boys all go, where the boys all go
Where the boys all go, where the girls are now
Where the boys all go, where the boys all go
Where the boys all go, where the girls are nowEmbed
