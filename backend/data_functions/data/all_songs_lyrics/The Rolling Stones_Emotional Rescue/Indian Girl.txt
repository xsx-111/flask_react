Indian Girl Lyrics
Little Indian girl, where is your mama?
Little Indian girl, where is your papa?
He's fighting in the war in the streets of Masaya
All the children were dead except for one girl who said
Please Mister Gringo, please find my father

Lesson number one, better learn while it's young
Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder
Little Indian girls from Nueva, Granada

Ma says there's no food, there's nothing left in the larder
Last piece of meat was eaten by the soldiers that raped her

Lesson number one that you learn when you're young
Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder
Life just goes on and on getting harder and harder
Little Indian girl, from Nueva, Granada
Little Indian girls, from Nueva, Granada

Yes, I saw them today. It's a sight I would say
They're shooting down planes with their M-16s and their laughter
Mr. Gringo, my father he ain't no Che Guevara
And he's fighting the war on the streets of Masaya
Little Indian girl where is your father?
Indian girl where is your momma?
They're fighting for Mr. Castro in the streets of AngolaEmbed
