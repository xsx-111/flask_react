Summer Romance Lyrics
Just a few days and you'll be back in your school
I'll be sitting around by the swimming pool
You'll be studying history and you'll be down the gym
And I'll be down the pub, probably playing pool and drinking

It's over now, it's a summer romance, and it's through
It's over now, it's a summer romance, and it's through

Just a few days and you'll be back in your class
Sucking up the teacher and trying to get an 'A' pass
Trying to hide your makeup and you're trying to flash your legs
Yeah, no sympathy from your spotty friends

It's over now, it's a summer romance, and it's through
It's over now, it's a summer romance, and it's through
I can't help myself, help it if I'm older than you
Over, over, summer romance
I can't help myself, help it if I'm older than you
Over, over, summer romance

I need money so much, I need money so bad
And I can't be your mum, I don't want to be your dad
I'm a serious man, I got serious lusts
Going to have to do away with this greasy kid stuff

It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through
I can't help myself, I can't help it if I'm older than you
(Over, over, summer romance)
It's just a summer romance, a summer romance, and it's through
(Over, over, summer romance)
It's over now, it's a summer romance and it's through
(Over, over, summer romance)

(Over, over, summer romance)
(Over, over)
(Over, over)
(Over, over)
(Over, over) A summer romance
(Over, over) A summer romance
(Over, over) A summer romance
(Over, over)
(Over, over)
(Over, over)Embed
