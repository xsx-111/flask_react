Dance (Pt. 1) Lyrics
Hey, what am I doing standing here on the corner of West 8th Street and the 6th Avenue?
And, ah, skip it
Nothing. Keith! What you, what you doing? 
Oh, I think the time has come to get out, get out

Get up, get out, get into something new
Get up, get out, into something new

Ooh and it's got me moving (Got me moving honey!)
Ooh and it's got me moving
Ooh and it's got me moving
Ooh and it's got me moving

My my my, my my my, my my my, my my my, my
Poor man eyes a rich man, denigrates his property
A rich man eyes a poor man and envies his simplicity
Get up, get out, to something new
Get up, get out, out into something new

Ooh and it's got me moving
Ooh and it's got me moving
Ooh and it's got me moving
Ooh and it's got me moving
Yeah, get up, get up, get out
Into something new
Yeah, all, won't you all, won't you all, won't you all
Don't stand accusedEmbed
