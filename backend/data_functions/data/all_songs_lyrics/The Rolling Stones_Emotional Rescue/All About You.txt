All About You Lyrics
Well if you call this a life
Why must I spend mine with you?
If the show must go on
Let it go on without you
So sick and tired hanging around with jerks like you

Who'll tell me those lies?
And let me think they're true, yeah
What am I to do?
You want it, I got it too

Though the laughs may be cheap
That's just 'cause the joke's about you
I'm so sick and tired hanging around with dogs like you
You're the first to get blamed
Always the last bitch to get paid

Who'll tell me those lies?
Let me think they're true, yeah
I heard one or two
They weren't about me
They weren't about her
They were all about you
I may miss you
But missing me just isn't you
I'm so sick and tired hanging around with dogs

Who'll tell me those lies?
Let me think they're true
I heard one or two
And they weren't about me
They weren't about her
They're all about you, all about you

I'm so sick and tired, sick and sick and tired
What should I do?
You want it, want it, want it, want it
You get it, get it, get it, get it
So how come I'm still in love with you?1Embed
