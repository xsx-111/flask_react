Apartment Song LyricsIlluminate the obvious
It's standing right here in front of us
What our apartment does
When we're not around does not concern us
Simulate the obvious
It's standing, standing right here in front of us
Just what our apartment does
When we're not around does not concern us
She's the horrible aesthete
And she hates her ugly feet
At a place where her friends all meet
She takes her shoes off and invites everyone to see
Eliminate the obvious
It's standing right here, right here in front of us
Just what our apartment does
When we're not around does not concern us
She's the horrible aesthete
At a place where her friends all meet
While her clock enforces its conceit
And her mirror checks out other things
And her walls stand a little more at ease
And her books they chat so expertly
And her cups and saucers get some sleep
And things get all together neat
At the clicking of the key
Returns the horrible aestheteEmbed
