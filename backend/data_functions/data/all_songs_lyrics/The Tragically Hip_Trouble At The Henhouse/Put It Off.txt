Put It Off LyricsI wrote unfriendly things, truly cruel
On the day that you were born
To prove that words cannot touch beauty
But I was torn
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I made degenerate art for the religious right
On the day that you were born
I had a passion to experiment
But I was torn
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I played Love Tara by Eric's Trip
On the day that you were born
I had to find the cuteness
In the unadorned
I put it off, I put it off, I put it off again
I put it on, I put it on, I put it on again
I put it on, I put it on, I put it on again
I put it on, I put it on, I put it on againEmbed
