700 Ft Ceiling LyricsLet's go to the park, let's go watch them flooding
Out there after dark, don't have to think of nothing
And i love that for, for the way i'm feeling
Seven hundred foot, seven hundred foot ceiling
Let's take it to the top of the tobacco nation
We can aim the dish for hardcore invitations
And i hate that for, for the things i'm thinking
When the clouds are low, seven hundred and sinking
It's part hard, hard to remember, it's part hard to say
Parts unknown, unknown forever and those parts fade away
But leanings toward, toward a full stop's all i hear you say
One foot on the stump, the other's on the pulpit
Seven hundred foot, seven hundred foot pulpit
And i love that for, for the way i'm feeling
Seven hundred foot, seven hundred foot ceiling
It's part hard, hard to remember, it's part hard to say
In our own backyard, we can do some flooding
Parts unknown, unknown forever, and those parts fade away
When it's cold and dark, don't have to think or nothing, don't have to think or nothingEmbed
