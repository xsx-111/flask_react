Springtime In Vienna Lyrics
Instructions from the manual
Could not have been much more plain
The blues are still required
The blues are still required again
Past territorial piss-posts
Past whispers in the closets

Past screamin' from the rooftops
We live to survive our paradoxes
We live to survive our paradoxes
We live to survive our paradoxes

Men hear of the secret
They pass in upholstered silence
They only exist in crisis
They only exist in silence
Past territorial piss-posts
Past whispers in the closets

Past screamin' from the rooftops
We live to survive our paradoxes
We live to survive our paradoxes
We live to survive our paradoxes
We'll live to survive our paradoxes
We'll live to survive our paradoxes
We'll live to survive our paradoxesEmbed
