Flamenco LyricsDoes it diminish your super-capacity to love?
Does it diminish your super-capacity to love?
Walk like a matador
Don't be chicken-shit
And turn breezes into rivulets
Flamenco-sweep the air
And weave the sun
And stamp your feet for everyone
Does it exhibit your natural tendency to hate?
Does it exhibit your natural tendency for hate?
Maybe a prostitute
Could teach you
How to take a compliment
Maybe I'll go to New York
I'll drag you there
You said, "no one drags me anywhere"
Does it diminish your super-capacity to love?
Does it diminish your super-capacity to love?Embed
