Coconut Cream LyricsThere's a cannon shooting coconut cream
Forty gallons in a steady stream
There's a cannon shooting coconut cream
Forty gallons in a steady stream
Dream, stream, dream
It's wing music to a happy cat
He likes his butterflies slow and fat
And wing music to a happy cat
He likes his butterflies slow and fat
Cat, fat, cat
Us little Christians in a circle jerk
Until our daddy gets home from work
All us good Christians in a circle jerk
Until our daddy gets home from work
Jerk, work, jerk
There's a cannon shooting coconut cream
Forty gallons in a steady stream
There's a cannon shooting coconut cream
Forty gallons in a steady stream
Dream, cream, streamEmbed
