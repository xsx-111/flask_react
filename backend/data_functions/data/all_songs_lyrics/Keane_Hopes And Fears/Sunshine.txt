Sunshine Lyrics
I hold you in my hands
A little animal
And only some dumb idiot would let you go

But if I'm one thing
Then that's the one thing
I should know

Can anybody find their home?
Out of everyone
Can anybody find their home?

I hold you in cupped hands
And shield you from a storm
Where only some dumb idiot would let you go

But if I'm one thing
Then that's the one thing I should know

Can anybody find their home?
Out of everyone
Can anybody find their home?
Lost in the sun
Can anybody find their home?
Come on, come on, come on
Can anybody find their home?

Oh, can anybody find their home?
Out of everyone
Can anybody find their home?
Lost in the sun
Can anybody find their home?
Come on, come on, come on
Can anybody find their home?

Oh (Can anybody find their home?)
Oh (Can anybody find their home?)
Oh (Can anybody find their home?)2Embed
