Sunshine (5.1 mix) LyricsI hold you in my hands
A little animal
And only some dumb idiot would let you go
But if I'm one thing then that's the one thing
I should know...
Can anybody find their home?
Out of everyone can anybody find their home?
I hold you in cupped hands
And shield you from a storm
Where only some dumb idiot would let you go
But if I'm one thing then that's the one thing
I should know...
Can anybody find their home?
Out of everyone can anybody find their home?
Lost in the sun can anybody find their home?
Come on, come on, come on
Can anybody find their home?
Oh
Can anybody find their home?
Out of everyone can anybody find their home?
Lost in the sun can anybody find their home?
Come on, come on, come on
Can anybody find their home?
Oh can anybody find their home?
Oh can anybody find their home?
Oh can anybody find their home?Embed
