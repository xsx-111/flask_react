On a Day Like Today Lyrics
On a day like today
I looked at you and I
Saw something in the way
You stared into the sky

I saw you were sick and tired
Of my wrong turns
If you only knew the way I feel
I'd really love to tell you

But I could never seem to say
The things I needed to
On a day like today
No other words would do

I saw you were sick and tired
Of my wrong turns
If you only knew the way I feel
I'd really love to tell you
But I can never find the words to say
And I don't know why
I can't find the words to say
And I don't know why
I saw you were sick and tired
Of my wrong turns
If you only knew the way I feel
I'd really love to tell you
But I can never find the words to say
And I don't know why
I can't find the words to say
And I don't know why1Embed
