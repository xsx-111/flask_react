Into the light - demo LyricsLonely, why so lonely?
Why are you hiding all the time?
Don't you realize time is passing?
Down through the river and into the tide to be washed aside
Tired now, why so tired now?
Have you forgotten how we used to play?
Can't you lie here just a little longer?
Let's stay together and not fade away into the night
Come out into the light
Come out into the light
Come out into the light
Come out into the light
Tired now, why so tired now?
Have you forgotten how we used to play?
Can't you lie here just a little longer?
Let's stay together and not fade away into the night
Come out into the light
Come out into the light
Come out into the light
Come out into the lightEmbed
