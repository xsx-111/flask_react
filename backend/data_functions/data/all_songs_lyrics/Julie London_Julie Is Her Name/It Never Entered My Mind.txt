It Never Entered My Mind LyricsOnce I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
Once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again
And wish that you where there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mindEmbed
