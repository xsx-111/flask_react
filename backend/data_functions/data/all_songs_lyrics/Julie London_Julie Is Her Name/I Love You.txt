I Love You Lyrics"I love you," calls the April breeze
"I love you," echo the hills
"I love you," the golden dawn agrees
As once more she sees daffodils
It's spring again and birds on the wing again
Start to sing again that old melody
"I love you," that's the song of songs
And it all belongs to you and me
It's spring again and birds on the wing again
Start to sing again that old melody
"I love you," that's the song of songs
And it all belongs to you and me
(fading)
You, Me
You, MeEmbed
