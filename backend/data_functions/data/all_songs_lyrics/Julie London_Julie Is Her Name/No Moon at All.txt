No Moon at All LyricsNo moon at all, what a night
Even lightnin' bugs have dimmed their light
Stars have disappeared from sight
And there's no moon at all
Don't make a sound, it's so dark
Even Fido is afraid to bark
What a perfect chance to park
And there's no moon at all
If you need atmosphere for inspiration, dear
One kiss will make it clear
That tonight is right and bright moonlight might interfere
No moon at all up above
This is nothing like they told us of
Just to think we fell in love
And there's no moon at all
If you need atmosphere for inspiration, dear
One kiss will make it clear
That tonight is right and bright moonlight might interfere
No moon at all up above
This is nothin' like they told us of
Just to think we fell in love
And there's no moon at all
No moon at all
No moon at allEmbed
