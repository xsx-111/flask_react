Gone with the Wind LyricsGone with the wind
Gone like a leaf that has blown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away
Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips
Iâ€™ve had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips
But now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that thrilled my heart
Gone with the wind
Gone is the gladness that filled my heart
Just like a flame, love burned brightly
Then became an empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind
Gone with the windEmbed
