Easy Street LyricsEasy street, I'd love to live on easy street
Nobody works on easy street
Just lie around all day, just sit and play the horses
Life is sweet for folks who live on easy street
No weekly payments you must meet
That makes your hair turn gray
When opportunity comes knockin'
You just keep on with your rockin'
'Cause you know your fortune's made
And if the sun makes you perspire
There's a man that you can hire
To plant trees so you can have shade
On easy street, I'm telling everyone I meet
If I could live on easy street I'd want no job today
So please, go 'wayEmbed
