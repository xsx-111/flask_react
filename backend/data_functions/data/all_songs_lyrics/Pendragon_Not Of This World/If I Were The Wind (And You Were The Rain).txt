If I Were The Wind (And You Were The Rain) LyricsIf I were the wind and you were the rain
That blows from east to west that melts away this pain
If I were the sea and you were the sky
I could wash away those tears
And our hearts again would fly
And the pirates and the thieves might bring you to your knees
But they'll never board your ship
You may have to sail through troubled seas
But the stars will always lead you
To the sun on the horizon
And you will feel life again
As the storm shows mercy on your sails
People my people
Captain my captain
Sail this empty vessel away from here to calmer shores
People my people
Captain my captain
Sail this empty vessel away from here to calmer shores
And the pirates and the buccaneers
Who fought you through the years
Now kneel and bow to you
They see a strength in you
And you will be their king
And the rest of the world will see
And want to follow right behind you
Because you fought them off with that weapon
The sword of mercy and truth
It's all so fearless now
Now the dust ha settled down
It's time to say goodbye
To the lives I touched and left behind
Through this melody and rhyme
I'll find some comfort here
On waters new we set sail
Our eyes set on a new world
It's time to wave goodbye
Wiped from your memory
But so fair of face and a heart of gold
My son my sonEmbed
