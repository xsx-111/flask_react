Not of This World LyricsLooking for God – Looking for life
Looking for all the right words and answers
Looking for something not of this world
Here within the time we spent upon this mortal coil
Not knowing what it meant
Beyond the china wall
Are those still standing tall now fit to fall
I need to save me from myself
Looking for hope – Looking for home
Looking away from all the despair
Looking for something that just isn’t there
Here within the time we spent upon this mortal coil
Not knowing what it meant
Beyond the china wall
Are those still standing tall
Beyond our wildest dreams and human means
And me I must save me from myself
And be far away from me
And my soul must be free
I’m flesh and blood
I’m a human being
Here within this human shell
Lies a heart that beats – A soul that weeps
The landscape of my life has changed
My soul will never be the same
So what love can I now give?
That will not be betrayed
It was never meant to be to one
But to those who can hear these words and stayed
