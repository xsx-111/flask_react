Not of This World (Give It To Me) LyricsOne man fills his pockets with gold
From the rising cost of dying
Consumed by consumerism
Telephone lines keep lying
Give it to me
(getting bigger better quicker)
Oh oh oh oh give it to me
(getting faster for the brave new world)
Just give it to me
(bigger better quicker)
Oh oh oh oh give it to me
(getting faster for the brave new...)
Eating money wanting more
Give to the rich and rob from the poor
One day man will eat the world
Fill his pockets and sell his soul
Give it to me
(getting bigger better quicker)
Oh oh oh oh give it to me
(getting faster for the brave new world)
Just give it to me
(bigger better quicker)
Oh oh oh oh give it to me
(getting faster for the brave new...)
'Cause they're flesh and blood
They're just human beings
They're flesh and blood
They're just human beings
You should have buried me at childbirth
You should have never let me free
Now I won't go away from here
You cannot put back the fruit on the treeEmbed
