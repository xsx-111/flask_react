Not of This World (Green Eyed Angel) LyricsAll those friends I've known and lost they tell me it'll be alright
Not with empty words or hearts they tell me I will be alright
And with her wings she shelters me and tells me it'll be alright
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to leave me
I sense those friends I know but can't see, they tell me it'll be alright
When they lay their hands on me I feel them near and I will be alright
And though my heart still has this dark place
Day by day it'll fell more light
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven
I never thought the one who loved me more than any
Would be the one to lead me to the gallows
Green eyed angel coming down from heaven
That summer day of '94 was such a happy day
When they lay their hands down on me and I feel them near I know it will be alright
Hearts so young against a heart of stone not to love that child
And although my heart still has this dark place
Day by day I know it'll feel more light
Hearts so young against a heart of stoneEmbed
