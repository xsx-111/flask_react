Dance of the Seven Veils (Faithless) LyricsAn old man came here telling tales
Of days gone by and seven veils
A sanctuary for all the pedlars of the lie
But one by one the veils fall
Through the subtlety of time recall
The words they longed to kill
Would not be silent be still
You were faithless in a twist of fate
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate
It's just my view but you know what I say is true
It was the month of the strawberry moon
The smell of apples and summer's bloom
Ten thousand horses could not drag you centre stage
To weary sailors the sirens sing
You hinding in the stage's wings
Forever clawing at your chains and your white feathers
You were faithless in a twist of fate
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate
And to the stars our words will rise
Forever bound and sealed
You were faithless in a twist of fate
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate
Each act and motion locked away
Will be known in the end
You were faithless in a twist of fate
You jumped the queue at Traitors Gate
At last the veils have fallen down
They squirm like vipers on the ground
In time the power of passion's lust
Slips through your fingers and turns to dust
Naked now you too were deceived
And now you must stare into the eyes of the Gorgon
Here within the time we spent upon the mortal coil
Not knowing what it all meant
Our lives of pain and toil
Are those still standing tall beyond the china wallEmbed
