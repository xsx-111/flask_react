Dance of the Seven Veils (All Over Now) LyricsFrom the first drop of blood spit
To the last breath of man
Betrayal by the hand that leads the innocent hand
A friend the thought was a friend to fight
From William Wallace to Jesus Christ
It hurts when you say
You never knew me anyway
But it's all over now
It's so hard when you say
You never knew me anyway
But it's all over now
You drank from the poison cup
Not knowing it was a trap
It's strange but so true
The ones who love you will run you through
With swords and knives then run for their lives
Like the rose as petals fall
As the dance of the veils calls
But it's all over now
But it's all over now
Like a gypsy it seeks
To serenade you while you sleep
But is cutting out your heart
Leaving scars that run so deep
Like a moth to the flame
That just keeps burning through your life
But the lure of those sweet
Words of love keep calling
It hurts when you say
I never knew you anyway
But it's all over now
And it hurts when you say
I never knew you anyway
But it's all over now
And it hurts when you say
I never loved you anyway
But it's all over now
And it hurts when you say
I never knew you anyway
But it's all over now
We set sail on waters new
Our eyes set on a new world
It's time to wave goodbye
To the lives I touched and left behind
But through this melody and rhyme
I'll find some comfort hereEmbed
