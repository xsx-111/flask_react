Simple Things LyricsIf you want me I’ll be there
A boy to deal with all your problems
But part of the deal
Is for you to feel something
If you want me look me up
I don’t exist in usual places
Subtle as the wind is grey
If you want me you know where I am
I saw your arms in a dream
And there were blue veins blue
Blue veins
If you want me all you have to do
Is ask a thousand questions
Triplicate and file under
“Simple things you ask to make a young boy sigh”
A young boy sigh
A young boy sigh
A young boy sigh3Embed
