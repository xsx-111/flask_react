A Summer Wasting LyricsSummer in winter
Winter in springtime
You heard the birds sing
Everything will be fine
I spent the summer wasting
The time was passed so easily
But if the summer's wasted
How come that I could feel so free
I spent the summer wasting
The sky was blue beyond compare
A photograph of myself
Is all I have to show for
Seven years of river walkways
Seven weeks of staying up all night
I spent the summer wasting
The time was passed so pleasantly
Say cheerio to books now
The only things I'll read are faces
I spent the summer wasting
Under a canopy of
Seven weeks of river walkways
Seven weeks of reading papers
Seven weeks of feeling guilty
Seven weeks of staying up all night
Summer in winter
Winter is springtime
You heard the bird say
Everything will be fineEmbed
