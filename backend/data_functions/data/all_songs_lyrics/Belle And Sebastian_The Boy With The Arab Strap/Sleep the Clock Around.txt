Sleep the Clock Around LyricsAnd the moment will come when composure returns
Put a face on the world, turn your back to the wall
And you walk twenty yards with your head in the air
Down the Liberty Hill where the fashion brigade
Look with curious eyes on your raggedy way
And for once in your life you've got nothing to say
And could this be the time when somebody will come
To say "Look at yourself, you're not much use to anyone"
Take a walk in the park, take a Valium pill
Take the letter you got from the memory girl
But it takes more than this to make sense of the day
Yeah, it takes more than milk to get rid of the taste
And you trusted to this and you trusted to that
When you saw it all come, it was waving the flag
Of the United States of Calamity, hey!
After all that you've done boy, I know you're going to pay
In the morning you come to the ladies' salon
To get all fitted out for the Paperback Throne
But the people are living far away from the place
Where you wanted to help, you're a bit of a waste
And the puzzle will last until somebody will say
"There's a lot to be done while your head is still young"
If you put down your pen, leave the worries behind
Then the moment will come and the memory will shine
Now the trouble is over, everybody got paid
Everybody is happy, they are glad that they came
Then you go to the place where you've finally found
You can look at yourself, sleep the clock around
Sleep the clock around
