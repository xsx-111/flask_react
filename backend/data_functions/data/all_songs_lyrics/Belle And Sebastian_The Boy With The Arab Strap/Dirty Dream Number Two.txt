Dirty Dream Number Two LyricsI’m lucky, I can open the door and I can walk down the street
Unlucky, I've got no place to go so I follow my feet
A choice is facing you, a healthy dose of pain
A choice is facing you as you stare through the rain
A choice is facing you but I choose to refrain for today
Tomorrow we’ll be back in trouble again
Dream one, you had a whole lot of fun with a comedian
Stop short of going all the way, you’ll have to make it someday
Why is this happening to you, you’re not a child?
Why is this happening? You’ve too much on your mind
Things creep up on you when you are fast asleep
You are dreaming, you are sleepy
You are stuck to the sheets
In a town so small there’s no escaping you
In a town so small there’s no escape from view
In a town so small there’s nothing left to do
Dream two you couldn’t see her face but you saw everything else
Dream two was pretty special, easily beats loving yourself
Could you put a name to someone else's sigh?
Could you put a face to someone else's eyes?
Is it someone that you’d maybe recognize?
But it all fades into morning when you open your eyes1Embed
