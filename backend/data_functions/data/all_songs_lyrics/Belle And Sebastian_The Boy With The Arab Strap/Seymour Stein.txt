Seymour Stein LyricsSeymour Stein, I've been lonely
Caught a glimpse of someone's face
It were mine and I'd been crying
Half a world away, ticket for a plane
Record company man
I won't be coming to dinner
My thoughts are far away
I'm working on that day
North country girl
I think she's going to stay
Promises of fame, promises of fortune
L.A. to New York
San Francisco back to Boston
Has he ever seen Dundee?
Won't he hire a limousine?
Seymour send her back to me
I heard dinner went well
You liked Chris's jacket
He reminded you of Johnny
Before he went electronic
Seymour Stein, sorry I missed you
Have a nice flight home
It's a good day for flying
