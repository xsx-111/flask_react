The Roller Coaster Ride LyricsHey people, looking out the window at the city below
Hey people, looking out the window, full of fun and sorrow
Hey people, looking out the window at the city below
Hey people, looking out the window, you’ll be gone tomorrow
The roller coaster ride
The roller coaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Take Judy, with her bow and arrow, she’s a mastermind
Too frumpy for the teenage population of her kind
Car coat, she has a quilted jacket with a hood if it rains
Big pockets for the pharmaceuticals it takes to fix her brain
The roller coaster ride
The roller coaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside
The roller coaster ride
The roller coaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside
A puzzle for the moment settle down to do it with him
You’re happy cause your cosy and the rain comes rattling in
It tickles and it’s something that is very good for the skin
You’re waiting for a baby, baby watch the idiot running
The roller coaster ride
The roller coaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside
The roller coaster ride
The roller coaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
You’re hanging from the balcony upon the riverboat glass
You’re watching with your mouth wide open for the top of the class
She came on with the boys while you were stuck in various poses
If you were to remove your clothes d’you think the singer would notice?
The roller coaster ride
The roller coaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside
The roller coaster ride
The roller coaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her insideEmbed
