The Magic Bullet Theory Lyrics
It's all about a secret I have
Or kept or stole from you
It's all about not knowing
If I missed out on something new

You only know what I know
I never meant to keep you in the dark
It doesn't mean much coming from me
You want to laugh like they laugh?
Well, go ahead and laugh your face off, faker
Just make sure to leave me home

It's all about a secret I have
Or kept or stole from you
It's all about not knowing
If I missed out on something new

You only know what I know
I never meant to keep you in the dark
It doesn't mean much coming from me
You want to laugh like they laugh?
Go ahead and laugh your face off, faker
Just make sure to leave me home
This is all about a secret I haveEmbed
