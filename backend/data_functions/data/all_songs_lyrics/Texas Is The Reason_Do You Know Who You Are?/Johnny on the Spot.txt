Johnny on the Spot Lyrics
You're allowed to stay for a while
I´m going to need your time to slow down and
Waste some time again

I would have thought by now you would be
So sick of being sick of trying all the time
Well I guess I'm sick of hearing it
So sick of listening to it

You're allowed to stay for a while
I´m going to need your time to slow down and
Waste some time again

I would have thought by now you would be
So sick of being sick of trying all the time
Well I guess I'm sick of hearing it
So sick of listening to it

Everybody tells me something
Something different every time
I´ll make up my own mind
Just let me sit here for a whileEmbed
