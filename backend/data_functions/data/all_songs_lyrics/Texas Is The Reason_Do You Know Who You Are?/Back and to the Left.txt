Back and to the Left Lyrics
This town was built on miles of hope
And I dare you to give me one reason to stay
And maybe I won't go away
So far you've only dared me once
And I think we know that's not even close enough
Not enough for me to stay

It costs so much I know
But I guess I need to know
What it would have felt like to be right

But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up
And get here because I'm still waiting
Just like I've always been

Well I'm getting tired of standing around
Just sitting here and waiting to be found
Same old shit just a different day
Well I'll wait around for one more day
But I know that's what I will always say
Will this ever be O.K.?
It costs so much I know
But I guess I need to know
What it would have felt like to be right

But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up
And get here because I'm still waiting
Just like I've always been

It costs so much I know
But I guess I need to know
What it would have felt like to be right

But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up
And get here because I'm still waiting
Just like I've always been

Hey now, we'll be around for one more day
Hey now, we'll be around for one more day
I will always worry about you
I will always stick up for you
I will always worry about you
I will always stick up for youEmbed
