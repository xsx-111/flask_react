Something to Forget (Version II) LyricsI have to learn to never ever be late
And how to almost always be on time
I have to understand this time
It's too bad that this side of you
Can't be seen by everyone
(You finally found something you can do)
So now you've got something to forget
I have to learn how to remember to forget
And how to build this all again
I have to build this all again
This is only fun for meEmbed
