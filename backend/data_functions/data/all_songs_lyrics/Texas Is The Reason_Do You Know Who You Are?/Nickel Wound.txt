Nickel Wound LyricsIt's getting cold all over again
So I'll be inside way too much again
You´ll have to believe me
You have to hear me when I say
And I´ll make up something that
Just so that you´ll believe in me

It's getting cold all over again
And I'll be inside way too much again
This is becoming too routine for me
For me

There will be time for this tomorrow
But it´s days like this that keep me alive
Is there anything left for me?
Is there anything left for me?
Daylight´s almost over now

Can't think of anymore to say (Is there anything left for me?)
Even if I try to understand
It won't ever be the same (Is there anything left for me?)



Until it's almost over now
