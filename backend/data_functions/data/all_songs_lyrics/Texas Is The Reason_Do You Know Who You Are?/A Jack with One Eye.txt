A Jack with One Eye Lyrics
You're not telling me nothing that I haven't
You're not telling me nothing that I haven't
Heard before
Nothing that I haven't

You'll have to try harder than that
You'll have to dig deeper than that
Reminds me of myself
You'll have to try harder than that
You'll have to dig deeper than that
Reminds me of yourself

You can't hold your breath when you talk
Try not to let sound slip by
I come from inside you
Raise it up so I can see
Just what you're doing to me
Do you even know why?

You can't hold your breath when you
You can't hold your breath when you talk
Your place is still at the heart of my everythingEmbed
