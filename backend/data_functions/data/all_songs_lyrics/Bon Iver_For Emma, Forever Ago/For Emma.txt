For Emma Lyrics
(So apropos:
Saw death on a sunny snow)

"For every life..."

"Forgo the parable."

"Seek the light."

"...My knees are cold."
(Running home, running home, running home, running home...)
"Go find another lover;
To bring a... to string along!"
"With all your lies
You're still very lovable."
"I toured the light; so many foreign roads for Emma, forever ago."37Embed
