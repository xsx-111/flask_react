Blindsided Lyrics
Bike down
Down to the downtown
Down to the lock down
Boards, nails lie around

I crouch like a crow
Contrasting the snow
For the agony, I'd rather know
'Cause blinded
I am blindsided

Peek in
Into the peer in
I'm not really like this
I'm probably plight-less

I cup the window
I'm crippled and slow
For the agony, I'd rather know
'Cause blinded
I am blindsided
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Would you really rush out? (For me now)
Ooh, ooh (For me now)
Ooh, ooh (For me now)

Taut line
Down to the shoreline
The end of a blood line
The moon is a cold light

There's a pull to the flow
My feet melt the snow
For the irony, I'd rather know
'Cause blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided11Embed
