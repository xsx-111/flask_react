Tears Lyrics
All of the seasons and all of the days
All of the reasons why I've felt this way
So long, so long
Then lost in that feeling I looked in your eyes
I noticed emotion and that you had cried
For me, I can see

What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes that only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes that know why?

A lifetime of questions, tears on your cheek
I tasted the answers and my body was weak
For you, the truth

What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes that only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes that know why?1Embed
