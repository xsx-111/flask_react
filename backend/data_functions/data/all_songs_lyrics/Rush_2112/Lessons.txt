Lessons Lyrics
Sweet memories flashing very quickly by
Reminding me and giving me a reason why
I know that my goal is more than a thought
I'll be there when I teach what I've been taught
And I've been taught

You know we've told you before
But you didn't hear us then
So you still question why
No, you didn't listen again!
You didn't listen again!

Sweet memories, I never thought it would be like this
Reminding me just how close I came to missing
I know that this is the way for me to go
You'll be there when you know what I know, and I know

You know we've told you before
But you didn't hear us then
So you still question why
No, you didn't listen again!
Woah!
Oh!
You didn't listen again!Embed
