Something for Nothing Lyrics
Waiting for the winds of change to sweep the clouds away
Waiting for the rainbow's end to cast its gold your way
Countless ways you pass the days

Waiting for someone to call and turn your world around
Looking for an answer to the question you have found
Looking for an open door

You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free
You won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes
No matter what your dreams might be


You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free
You won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes
No matter what your dreams might be

What you own is your own kingdom
What you do is your own glory
What you love is your own power
What you live is your own story
In your head is the answer
Let it guide you along
Let your heart be the anchor
And the beat of your own song

You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for free, no!
You don't get something for nothing
You can't have freedom for freeEmbed
