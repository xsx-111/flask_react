The Boy With the Perpetual Nervousness LyricsThere's a kid I know but not too well
He doesn't have a lot to say
Well, this boy lives right next door and he
Has nothing to say
It doesn't seem like he does anything
He never helps out in the yard
He lets his mother carry in groceries
'Cause he doesn't plan to work too hard
The boy next door is into better things
As far as I can see
The boy next door is into bigger things
The boy next door is me, all right
Well, he's not like the boys we used to have
Not like them at all - oh no
Those ones made their parents proud
This one beats 'em all
The boy next door is into better things
As far as I can see
The boy next door is into bigger things
The boy next door is me, yeah1Embed
