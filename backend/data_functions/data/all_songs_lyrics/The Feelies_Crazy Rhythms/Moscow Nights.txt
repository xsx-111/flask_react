Moscow Nights LyricsAll you really wanted
Was to be alone at least a little while
How was I to know that
Well it seemed like an eternity
When you smile and say
"I thought about it, it's the right time"
And I expect that
You're never returning to the USA
All the way the lights are
I can see your face is getting clearer
It's like you never even left here
It's like you never had the reason
To want to go
Well I don't know
I think it's time for you to face it
You never felt right in our world
You never felt right about yourself
And I think about what it might be like
If I could go alone, if I could go at night
Would it be just like you know you said it would
Would it start the life of O (?)5Embed
