Crazy Rhythms LyricsSaid it's time to go, well alright
I don't wanna go, I say alright
You never listen to me anyway
You're always talking, never much to say
You remind me of a TV show
That's alright, I watch it anyway
I don't talk much cause it gets in the way
Don't let it get in the way
We'll do our job, we'll get things done
Work real hard and get things done
It's time to sail but not now
Can't relax when there's things to do
Big plans stay while the little ones fade
It's nice to know when it's part of your life
I don't want much and I need even less
It's time to sacrifice

Said it's time to go, well alright
I don't wanna go, I say alright
You never listen to me anyway
You're always talking, never much to say
You remind me of a TV show
That's alright, I watch it anyway
I don't talk much cause it gets in the way
Don't let it get in the way
