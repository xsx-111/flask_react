Black Panther Lyrics
I close my eyes, all that I see
Is a thousand spawn chewing at me
Turn to me and say it can't be true
There's no way I came out of you

Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands
Too old to be my daughter
Too young to be my friend

It's so wrong, I've seen it all before
There's two wounded cats waiting at the door
I'll give you your lobotomy
There's no way you came out of me

Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands
Too old to be my daughter
Too young to be my friend
You're covered in the lotion
That was inside of me
I'll throw you in the ocean
I'll pass you to the sea
You're covered in the lotion
That was inside of me
I'll throw you in the ocean
I'll pass you to the sea

Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands
Straight from my bones
Back in my hands
Straight from my blood
Back in my hands4Embed
