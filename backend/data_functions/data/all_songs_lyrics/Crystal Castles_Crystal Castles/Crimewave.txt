Crimewave Lyrics
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands

Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands
Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands

Eyes lit on sharp threats from dark lips
The lights press the soft skin to rough hands36Embed
