Through the Hosiery Lyrics
You want it out, so just take my spawn
Feel complete after it's gone
Don't sleep by my side, sleep on the lawn
It's not too late, you wanted it gone

Through the hosiery
To the armory
To the nothing
How does it feel when you can't feel nothing?

Give that guilt, you shed a newborn
To your feet, it falls to the floor
Itching inside, you still want more
Stillborn fawn, throw it to the door

Through the hosiery
To the armory
To the nothing
How does it feel when you can't feel nothing?

Fifteen years you've waited for me
Through preteen years of deficiency
Cuts on my hands, but you can't feel nothing
Blood on my hands, you can wipe up something
Through the hosiery
To the armory
To the nothing
How does it feel when you can't feel nothing?

Drink sulfur, spill it in my lap
My onus is the time that you lack
Borrowed your womb, you can't have it back
Drink sulfur, spit it all right back

Fifteen years you've waited for me
Through preteen years of deficiency
Cuts on my hands, but you can't feel nothing
Blood on my hands, you can wipeâ€”3Embed
