Air War Lyrics
Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons
Steelyringing imperthnthn thnthnthn
Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips. Horrid!
And gold flushed more
A husky fifenote blew, blew
Blue bloom is on the gold pinnacled hair
A jumping rose on satiny breasts of satin, rose of Castille
Trilling, trilling: I Dolores
Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?
Tink cried to bronze in pity
And a call, pure, long and throbbing. Longindying call
Decoy. Soft word. But look! The bright stars fade. O rose! Notes chirruping
Answer. Castille. The morn is breaking
Jingle jingle jaunted jingling
Coin rang. Clock clacked
Avowal. Sonnez. I could. Rebound of garter. Not leave thee
Sweetheart, goodbye!
Avowal. Warm

When love absorbs
War! War! The tympanum
A sail! A veil awave upon the waves
Horn. Hawhorn
When first he saw. Alas!
Full tup. Full throb
Warbling. Ah, lure! Alluring
Martha! Come!
Clapclop. Clipclap. Clappyclap
Goodgod henev erheard inall
Deaf bald Pat brought pad knife took up
A moonlight nightcall: far: far
I feel so sad. P. S. So lonely blooming
Listen!
The spiked and winding cold seahorn
Have you the?
Each, and for other, plash and silent roar
Pearls: when she. Liszt's rhapsodies. Hissss5Embed
