Good Time Lyrics
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now

Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now
Good times keep rolling
But they've got to escape now2Embed
