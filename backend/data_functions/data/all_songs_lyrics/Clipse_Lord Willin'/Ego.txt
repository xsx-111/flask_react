Ego Lyrics
Yessir

Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
Yes, this semi-automatic tech is know to jam
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
Yes, this semi-automatic tech is know to jam
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

I got guns cause they got guns
I get cash, they get none
So I'm sure you see where that leaves me
In the streets with two heats, both one within my reach
I speak slow, let 'em understand my speech
When I say, "Get low, these hold ten shots each
Please, don't move too fast
I scared of y'all niggas and my nerves is bad"
So sad but I won't think twice
We rich, we get the best judicial advice
Threaten my life with them words that they utterin'
Adrenaline pump, my heart start a-flutterin'
Continuous dump, that tech gets to stutterin'
Left in the slump, mother and sister cuddlein'
And for what? Cause you ego-trippin'
If that thing jam, it's divine intervention
Click!
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
Yes, this semi-automatic tech is know to jam
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
Yes, this semi-automatic tech is know to jam
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

Even if it's talk cheap (Say what?) You know I can't sleep
On his word, had to show him that I heard (Let's go)
All that duct tape tie up talk put in reverse
Now it's him who's in a bind on the account of his words (Yeah, you know it)
Yeah, they talk 'bout this and that (That)
Got it fucked up, like I'm all 'bout rap (Rap)
Word is I'm loaded, they want a piece of that
I respond with four words, "Rat-tat-tat-tat" (In yo ass)
Now, rap about that
I carry a human heat box, to make ya heartbeat stop (Stop)
Some say Pusha's the coldest
Money is my morals, other than that, I'm soulless
Refuse to wake up zeroless and O-less
Carry that shit that blow your arm out your shoulders (Blaow!)
Techs don't come with holsters
I'm a menace boy (Don't forget, motherfucker)
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
Yes, this semi-automatic tech is know to jam
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man
Don't let 'cha ego trick yo ass
Cause this motherfuckin' tech will get yo ass
Yes, this semi-automatic tech is know to jam
But if it don't, that's yo ass my man

Yo, you niggas ain't fuckin' with us
This is the real
You niggas ain't fuckin' with us
This is the real
You niggas ain't fuckin' with us
This is the real
You niggas ain't fuckin' with us
This is the real, bitch2Embed
