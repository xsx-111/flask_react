Virginia Lyrics
You ready to do this, nigga?
You ready to come down here?
It's Virginia, nigga
We do this in broad daylight
It's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga
You ready?

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks (talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (talkin' 'bout what?)

In my home sweet home, I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin', since I love the feel
I guess I'm passionately pimpin', it 'tis what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seam of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
But my faith and my money helped me rise above
See I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through the streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny, out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme
Got semis waitin', heat like Caribbean summers
I been there, each year, a different bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal', Gonz or Grimes
With me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at that Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild, but what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like OJ
Beat murder like the shit is okay, that's what our dough say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental
I miss you Shampoo, we miss you Shampoo
And your grams too...
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks (talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (talkin' 'bout what?)
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks (talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (talkin' 'bout what?)

Seem like they all got a comment to make
In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate
Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
"Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit"
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fare
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly
Now face down, layin' on your tummy or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus what I look like spendin' my nights in jail?
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks (talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (talkin' 'bout what?)
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks (talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (talkin' 'bout what?)

Young'n (talkin' 'bout what?)
This is real, young'n (talkin' 'bout what?)
You lookin' into a whole different world, young'n (talkin' 'bout what?)
This is real, live11Embed
