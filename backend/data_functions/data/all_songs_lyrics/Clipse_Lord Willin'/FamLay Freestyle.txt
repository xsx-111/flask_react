FamLay Freestyle Lyrics
It ain't nothin' y'all can teach me
I been locked up more times than Sweet Pea
See I'm from Norfolk, here's a coffin if ya sleepy
Turn ya children into orphans tryna sneak me
Or tryna creep me, the realest shit I ever spoke
So I'ma spit it when I finish, I'ma slit my throat
This shit is like 211 mixed wit coke
Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga
Dark secrets, man I won't lie
They came to the light, a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and Fam-Lay's gon' fry
'Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what? War against an army with a handgun
I'm Fam-Lay, and when my fucking chance come
I'm running with it, on e'ry song, I'm coming with it
See some you think you can take from me, then come and get it
See I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try to diss us
See you in the streets, it ain't nothin' to discuss
Maaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground
Few weeks, couple bodies wit no head'll be found (nigga)
Cut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangstas)
Now I'm in the 6 (Gangsta) with the heat, no tints, you see me boy
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
Niggas, bang, bang; bitches, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
In Virginia, them guns go, bang, bang
Niggas, bang, bang; bitches, bang, bang1Embed
