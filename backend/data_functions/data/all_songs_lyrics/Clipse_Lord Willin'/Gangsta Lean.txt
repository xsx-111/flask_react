Gangsta Lean Lyrics
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Hey, hey, Star Trak, Star Trak
Now let's smoke and ride

Oh girl ya taste is
Sweet like mornin' dew
I would go crazy girl
If I couldn't have none of you
I said ya from Jamaica
Straight outta my Mercedes trunk
You make me wanna roll ya up
And then you make my body slump

Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
I only love her on occasions
Keep my heart racin', love to take her on vacations
Where the time zone changes and money exchanges
The speed is in kilometers on the dials of the ranges
Far away
With my Jamaican sexy, every day is like a holiday
The cheeba got me in a slum sleeper
But when I try to leave her, I just find out that it's cheaper to keep her
Plus she keep my thoughts deeper, really zonin'
Like my Cali homies 6-4 rollin'
Or them Detroit 'Lacs trimmed and golden
Or my Texas family 150 wires strollin'
Damn, I was caught up in the Matrix
But not Keanu Reeves, as she rolls in bamboo leaves
I think of ways to ship off these piano keys
Since the trappin' is gangsta lean

Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Look, you put me where I need to be, twist you anytime I feel the need
Love ya touch and how you set my mind at ease
In Virginia where you kept me motionless
From that point on, I knew I could never get over this
Now they wanna see us broke up
Cause I'm lovesick, got me all choked up
Look, you keep my head in the clouds mami 'til I can't breathe
And next to that heat seeker you my main squeeze
Plus I get twistin' didn't even spend my money on
Now either I'm a fool or you really must got me gone
You got me open these days I must admit
Body numbed up and in a slump like I've been hit
But luckily it's just the green got me leavin' smoke streams
And blowin' smoke rings as I flee from the scene
Gangsta leanin' in a 850 beamin'
I'm like K-Ci and Jo-Jo, love you got me fiendin'

Oh girl ya taste is
Sweet like mornin' dew
I would go crazy girl
If I couldn't have none of you
I said ya from Jamaica
Straight outta my Mercedes trunk
You make me wanna roll ya up
And then you make my body slump
Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

Her sex so sticky, I'm talkin' real icky
Have me gone and twisty, make my other women miss me
Just by the way she kiss me
Hold her with the index and thumb tippys, ma, I'm so trippy
Hard to hold back, scent so sweet
Got to Cognac and honey wrap her this ain't no drink
From Taiwanese to Amsterdam greeny green
To hydroponic that make her weak stomach vomit

Listen, at times you hinder my vision
Blinded by ya love and you got the room spinnin'
It's not jealousy the reason why I keep you hidden
Hell, I hit you then I pass you to my man like I do my women
I know just what I'm investin' in
I done traded currency with the Mexicans
In Texas just so we could get affectionate
Your complexion lime green with red specks in it
I love you

Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Hey, hey, Star Trak, Star Trak
Now let's smoke and ride5Embed
