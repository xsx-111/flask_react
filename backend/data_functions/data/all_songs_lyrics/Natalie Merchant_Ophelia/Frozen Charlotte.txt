Frozen Charlotte Lyrics
Blue like the winter snow in a full moon
Black like the silhouettes of the trees
Late blooming flowers lie frozen underneath the stars
I want you to remember me that way

Far away, I'll be gone
Will you wait for me here?
How long? I don't know
But wait for me here

Still as the river grows in December
Silent and perfect blinding ice
Spring keeps her promises
And no cold can keep her back
I want you to remember me that way

Far away, I'll be gone
Will you wait for me here?
How long? I don't know
But wait for me here
Follow, don't follow me to where
To where I'll go

Far away, I'll be gone
Will you wait for me here?
How long? I don't know
But wait for me here
Follow, don't follow me to where, to where I've gone
Follow, don't follow me to where, to where I've gone
Someday you'll take my place
And I'll wait for you hereEmbed
