Life Is Sweet Lyrics
It's a pity, it's a crying shame
Who pulled you down again?
How painful it must be
To bruise so easily inside
It's a pity, it's a downright crime
It happens all the time
You wanna stay little daddy's girl
You wanna hide from the vicious world outside

But don't cry
You know the tears'll do no good, so dry your eyes

Oh, your daddy, he's the iron man
A battleship wrecked on dry land
Your mama, she's a bitter bride
She'll never be satisfied
You know that that's not right

But don't cry
Know the tears'll do no good, so dry your eyes

Oh, they told you life is hard, misery from the start
It's dull, it's slow, it's painful
But I tell you life is sweet, in spite of the misery
There's so much more, be grateful
Well, who do you believe?
Who will you listen to, who will it be?
'Cause it's high time that you decide in your own mind
I've tried to comfort you
I've tried to tell you to be patient
They are blind and they can't see
Fortune gonna come one day and all gonna fade away
Your daddy, the war machine
And your mama, the long and suffering
Prisoner of what she cannot see

For they told you life is hard, misery from the start
It's dull, it's slow, it's painful
But I tell you life is sweet, in spite of the misery
There's so much more, be grateful
So who will you believe?
Who will you listen to, who will it be?
'Cause it's high time that you decide
It's time to make up your own, your own sweet little mind

Oh, they told you life is long, be thankful when it's done
Don't ask for more, be grateful
But I tell you life is short
Be thankful because before you know it, it will be over
'Cause life is sweet
Life is also very short
Life is sweet
And life is also fairly short
Life is sweet
And life is sweetEmbed
