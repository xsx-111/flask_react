Kind & Generous Lyrics

You've been so kind and generous
I don't know how you keep on giving
For your kindness, I'm in debt to you
For your selflessness, my admiration
For everything you've done
You know I'm bound
I'm bound to thank you for it


You've been so kind and generous
I don't know how you keep on giving
For your kindness, I'm in debt to you
And I never could have come this far without you
For everything you've done
You know I'm bound
I'm bound to thank you for it


Oh, I want to thank you
For so many gifts
You gave with love and tenderness
I want to thank you
I want to thank you
For your generosity
The love and the honesty
That you gave me
I want to thank you
Show my gratitude
My love and my respect for you
I want to thank you
Oh, I want to
