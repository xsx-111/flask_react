My Skin Lyrics
Take a look at my body
Look at my hands
There's so much here
That i don't understand
Your face saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them
Cause I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable
Well Contempt loves the silence
It thrives in the dark
With fine winding tendrils
That strangle the heart
They say that promises
Sweeten the blow
But I don't need them
No, I don't need them
I've been treated so wrong
I've been treated so long
As if I'm becoming untouchable
I'm a slow dying flower
I'm the frost killing hour
Sweet turning sour
And untouchable
Oh, I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
Oh I need this

I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
Angel sweet
Love of my life
Oh, I need this
I'm a slow dying flower
Frost killing hour
The sweet turning sour
And untouchable

Do you remember the way
That you touched me before
All the trembling sweetness
I loved and adored?
Your face saving promises
Whispered like prayers
I don't need them
Oh, I need
The darkness
The sweetness
The sadness
The weakness
Oh, I need this

I need
A lullaby
A kiss goodnight
Angel sweet
Love of my life
Oh, I need this
I'm a slow dying flower
Frost killing hour
The sweet turning sour
And untouchable

Is it dark enough?
Can you see me?
Do you want me?
Can you reach me?
Or I'm leaving
You better shut your mouth
Hold your breath
Kiss me now you'll catch my death
O, I mean it2Embed
