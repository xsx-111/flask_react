The Living Lyrics
What's it like there outside
With the living?
From this broken down place
Where i hide
From the living

Cause i don't care to stay
With the living

Oh, the bottle has been to me
My closest friend and
My worst enemy
Afraid that i've walked a fine line
Squandered it all
And wasted my time
And i don't stand a chance
Among the living
All the lovers i've gambled and lost
Count my mistakes
Whatever the cost
I'll go off, i'll make myself scarce
Come tomorrow
You won't find me here

No, i don't think i'll remainEmbed
