King Of May Lyrics
Farewell today
Travel on now
Be on your way
Go safely there
Never worry
Never care
Beyond this day
Farewell tonight
To all joy and to all delight
Go well and go peacefully
We can't keep your majesty
Be on your way

Make ready for the last king of may
Make a cardboard crown for him
Make your voices one
Praise a crazy mother's son
Who loved his life

Farewell today
Travel on now
Be on your way
Can't bear the very thought
That we could keep your majesty
Be on your way
Make ready for the last king of may
Make a hole in the crowd for him
Raise your voices up
Lift your loving cups
To his long lifeEmbed
