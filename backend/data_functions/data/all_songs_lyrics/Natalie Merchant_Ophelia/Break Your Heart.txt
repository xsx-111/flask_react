Break Your Heart Lyrics
People downcast, in despair
See the disillusion everywhere
Hoping their bad luck will change
Gets a little harder every day
People struggle, people fight
For the simple pleasures in their lives
But trouble comes from everywhere
It's a little more than you can bear

I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
And the way they've been
And the way they've always been

People shallow, self-absorbed
See the push and shove for their rewards
I, me, my is on their minds
You can read about it in their eyes
People ruthless, people cruel
The damage that some people do
Full of hatred, full of pride
It's enough to make you lose your mind
I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
And the way they've been
And the way they've always been
Yeah I know that it will hurt
I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
And the way they've been

Don't spread the discontent
Don't spread the lies
Don't make the same mistakes
With your own life
You never will let love survive

Yeah I know that it will hurt
I know that it will hurt
I know that it will break your heart
The way things are
And the way they've been
Don't spread the discontent
Don't spread the lies
Don't make the same mistakes
With your own life
Don't disrespect yourself
Don't lose your pride
And don't think that
Everybody's gonna choose your side
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, oh noEmbed
