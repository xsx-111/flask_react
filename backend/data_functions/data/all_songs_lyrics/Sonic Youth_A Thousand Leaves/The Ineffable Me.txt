The Ineffable Me LyricsCan't catch me, I'm syntax free
I'm preconceived preternaturally
I don't invest in what is best
Your once and for all means shit to me
Hate translator
Hate translator
Hate translator
You can't catch me
Don't mistake her, don't misshape her
You don't mutate her, you can't get me
The radical beacon, preverbal season
The abstract poetics, immediate treason
Do you remember reductionist lie
Fundamentalist alibi
Hate castrater
Hate castrater
Hate castrater
Don't fuck with me
Don't you break her, don't deflate her
Don't outdate her or you'll fuck with me
Its a cushy job, a pussy's job
A cum junkie's job, makes my dick throb
Feel...ineffable
Don't be alarmed
Don't be alarmed
Don't be alarmed
Its only me
Come back in my arms
Back in my arms
Back in my arms
The ineffable meEmbed
