Female Mechanic Now on Duty Lyrics
I want to shut you down
Love your sight and sound
I want to spin you round, 'till you're underground
I want to strip you down
'Till you feel the round
I want to feel your shine
I want to waste some time
I want to paint my face
Like a model out of place
Cause I'm supposed to dare
The machine will tear
I'll throw up sometime
Then you'll be mine
I want to swerve you down
While my mind is on the ground
I want to move your switch
Make you go squish
My desiring machine
Yeah it's made pretty clean
Now I'll turn the dial
And I'll put you in a pile

Modern women cry
Modern women don't cry
Cry don't cry
You hut me with your lie
Touch the fire in the rain and
See the children
Stop their play and
Look for shelter
In the garden of their
Make believe and I
I believe
Perfection is a
I can see what you're going through but
I can't melt my head to what you're
Whisked away to light the bomb a
Thousand leaves are left to stay and...Embed
