Heather Angel Lyrics
Never going to ya do it
A world below
Heather Angel you are somewhere
On the show
Don't you think you would find
Where to go
I want to go dancing on the other side
I want to buy a phonograph
But the money's gone
He bought books and records
I don't care about that
I just want to be alive
And go to the other
I don't want money or books
Have to decide

Passive

And you were shot in the name of it
And then you'd see yeh, yeh
Then you'd see
The relationship
And walking I see you in the clouds
And I fall for
I would fall for you
I would
Forever
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye
And that is all
STOP! STOP! STOP!
Here we go
Here we go
Here we go!
Here we go!
Here we go!
Go, go, go!Embed
