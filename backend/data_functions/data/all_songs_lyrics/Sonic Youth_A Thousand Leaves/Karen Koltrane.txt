Karen Koltrane LyricsKaren's moving out
Out into the sky
Karen trips on a cloud
Sets down stars in her eyes
She's alone in a room
She's deep inside of her mind
Karen's leaving for the snow
Somewhere to somewhere blind
She cut the silver lining in my soul
I was tethered to her for a time
Will she stay forever?
Are we still together?
(Will she stay?)
Will she stay forever?
(Flashlight)
Are we still together?
(Karen stay)
Will she stay forever?
(Flashlight)
Are we still together?
(Karen stay)
A Love Supreme
Karen, you're hanging on the line
Wraps your coat tight around
Karen, your eyes are on the prize
I'll catch you on my way down1Embed
