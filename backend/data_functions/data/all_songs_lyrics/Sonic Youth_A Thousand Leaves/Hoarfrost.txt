Hoarfrost LyricsI put my feet deep in the tracks that you made
Walked behind you off into the wood
"We'll know where when we get there" you said
And we both knew we would
High above like a spider
The colors turning brown
Freeways passing by us
I took your hand and we knelt down
Wheels paddle wheels paddle movement as we go
Trees passing trees passing signs along the road
A view through the trees to a couple in the snow
A view through the trees to a couple standing in the snow
Suddenly the trees were flashing by us
Clouds reflecting fast across your eyes
We turned into a frozen meadow
The wind the only sound
"We'll know where when we get there" you said
"We'll know where when we get there" you said2Embed
