Contre Le Sexisme Lyrics
Describe the touch, no it's the thought
It's warm and yellow and has a ruffle
It's warm and yellow and
He's so quiet I forgot he's there
And I think here I am
"Oh Alice, come back he's just a kitten
He's just a kitten"
A thousand leaves for your disguise fall on
The sky and looking up from down is a sea to
Realize the leaves are falling up and down
Up and round
And this is from my heart to you
A crazy wind will stir me too and contre de la
Sexisme
I am with youEmbed
