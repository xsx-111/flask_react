Wildflower Soul Lyrics
Sing your children
Your children song
Sing yr love child
Love is on
See thru child eyes
Eyes are old
And old is magic growing
See the child lights
Spinning gold
Everyday girl
They blow away
Leaves falling to the water
Wildflowers
For you today
Sing your birthday
Your birthday blues
Sing your wild light
Wildflowers bloom
They will not forget you
And down/they go
To sleep/so slow
Away/they grow
They go
I wait/i wait all day
Sing your love child
Love is on
Sing your child lights
Sing your child lights
Lights are gold
Sing your child life
