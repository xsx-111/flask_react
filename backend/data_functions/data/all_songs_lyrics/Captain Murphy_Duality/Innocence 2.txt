Innocence 2 Lyrics

Knowing what he know about a life less ordinary
Villain on the contrary, never had a second guess
Kinda scary how he set his self apart from the rest
Thug proud daddy left a mad sum, claimed to be the best
Tell the truth it's fucking strange as it ever was
A nigga never learned to bleed through his heart like father does
Figured I could spend my days with no regrets like father does
Figured I could fuck a couple hoes like a father does
Barely believing in myself, start pushing under 20 reps
My troubled mind fly high, I find my niggas high and blessed
Landed at the Mayan's steps, hungry like a lion get
Figured I'd do anything to keep my youthful innocence

I figured I'd do anything to keep my youthful innocence (x3)

Uh well fuck it
I'mma just come off the top of the dome
Niggas didn't think I would
This is just the shit I could
Nigga I'm the best man
What the fuck I'm best man
Who the fuck gon' test me yeah?
Ya'll niggas better rest man
Off the top my brain it's the motherfucking sensei
Can't see me, here I go, back to spittin' written
Suspicious how we got these bitches wishing they was kissing dick
Listen, this babble rap, packaged on omnipotence
Deal with it, I do it all
I think my shit's ridic too
This is how I pimp to fat booty roody poos
Easy on the gossip it is just a bunch of hooty hoos
Psychic chick love my shit
Good for her to run to
Says I'm in her mind
Had to tell her I'm a pimp tooEmbed
