Drive Thru Lyrics
Um
So guess who's coming to dinner, a nigga
I'm thinking my liver is filled up with liquor
So best to be next to that blonde
Who came with her mom blood bath and beyond my nigga
That's period talk, your mensi-flow
I sold that ho that donkey show
A eenie meenie miney
Bitch I'm high so please oblige me
Wine and dine, a waste of time
Unless it's all on my parent's dime
Nothing like eating for free my friend
Fucking right, have it with cheese my friend
No beans included, peas into it
Codeine-influenced, guess she's into it
Still a half a pill of daffodil
Relax in fact a natural healer
Lands surreal but feel so real
Our minds combine sublime in here
Now here we are inside a place, a space of matter
Matter fact a pattern rap can't change the fact
I feel so trapped, now how was that
Now who is this I'm thinking of and who is this
I'm making raw sex, I'm vegan leaving
Semen gleaming down this bitch's back
I'm colorful manilla bone chillers
Slum villain kill kill em
My pen will kill upon dollar die
Witness I kill a guy
Eating fries, getting high
Ghost of machine don't let a nigga wifi
High five a white guy, drinking on a Mai Tai
Bye bye nigga so bye bye nigga

Practice prolonged hours of meditation, in these trance states they are more receptive and suggestible, encourage separation of their family

Your friends and family probably won't understand
Your friends and family probably won't understand
It doesn't sound like your family and friends really love you if they can't support your new decision
Maybe you should stay away from them, it's unhealthy for you to be around unenlightened people anyway
If you can't recruit your friends, cut off from them
Stop wasting time with nonbelievers
Stop wasting time with nonbelievers6Embed
