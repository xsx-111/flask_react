Hovercrafts and Cows Lyrics
Yaaaaaaa!
Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Ca- Captain Murphy
Ha ha ha ha!

History's man of mystery (Ha ha ha ha)
Rooted by an insane lust to dominate and destroy
His mystic powers and physical strength made him the most dangerous man of his time
No one knew him, they only feared him
Now at last, the real shocking story can be told

Oh, Captain!
For so long I have quivered at the thought of your lips on my crudely drawn mouth

Hey! Don't talk like that you- you slut!

Here is the amazing true story of the man, whose evil genius still fascinates the entire world

Hey! You know, someone had told me that you're famous

Yeah
The ladies adore him

Captain Murphy

Uh-

Hi
Now sir; why do you think I should choose you, to father my baby?

Huh?

His hypnotic powers mesmerize the entire world

Well, I mean, I-

He makes it no secret, he can do whatever he wishes
Do you understand what that means?
He must be destroyed before he destroys us all!
But can they kill this man possessed by superhuman powers of evil

Captain Murphy
