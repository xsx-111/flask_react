Mighty Morphin Foreskin Lyrics

I am Gojira in the mirror on some nonstop chop
Some gon' leave it in the beaver pond the floor drop bars
Stomping round Mars cause that damn dart gun shot 'em
So I'mma fee-fo-fum until the cop cars come for 'em
It's been marvelous, starving artist at heart
I went harder than The Art of War between Martin, Marvin and Pauly Shore
(Pauly shore? What the fuck?)
What you think I wore the sweater for, villain ain't a metaphor
I got paid and made a slave of my favorite whore
And who could ask for more
I'm chuffed off this paper guy
Roll around town, top down, puffing stanky Thai
And we're aight, I got the swag of seven sailors
All named Jerry, the flow is so scary
How we change the game and put it on our back and put a little rap
And get a little back and lib blib blib blib, hahahahahahaaa

I'm like periwinkle Blue Manzee like who the fuck is you, man
I'm like Ken - I punch you Shoryuken or Hadoken
Fahrvergn√ºgen, far from human, take your pick of pickled sticks
I'll send your chick these naked pics to make her dream of niggerr dicks
Toss and turn these bitches burn, cast into the fire
Lesson learned from Mr Burns, then you're fired
Yes, I concur
Driven to manipulate, fueled by egomania, charismatic
"And sometimes he exuded all this love on his face"
But beneath the allure can lurk danger
"And he looked at me with shark eyes
Just devoid of life"
How do cult leaders control the minds of others
And which of them is most evil?
Disciples we're going to talk to you about the most
Urgent thing that is on our mind
And what we suspect is the most urgent
Thing on the minds of those who will connect with us
Planet Earth is about to be recycled
Your only chance to evacuate is to leave with us
Planet Earth, about to be recycled
Your only chance to, survive, or evacuate is to leave WITH US21Embed
