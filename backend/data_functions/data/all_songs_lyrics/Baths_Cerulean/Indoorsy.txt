Indoorsy Lyrics
It's a breezy, beautiful day
The birds and girls and their weightless ways
The air is cool and there are plenty of things to do

So I pull my curtains closed
And in absence of the world compose
And sleep and stir in bed until it ends

It's a breezy, beautiful day
The birds and girls and their weightless ways
The air is cool and there are plenty of things to do

So I pull my curtains closed
And in absence of the world compose
And sleep and stir in bed until it ends

It's a breezy, beautiful day
The birds and girls and their weightless ways
The air is cool and there are plenty of things to do

So I pull my curtains closed
And in absence of the world compose
And sleep and stir in bed until it ends
It's a breezy, beautiful day
The birds and girls and their weightless ways
The air is cool and there are plenty of things to do

So I pull my curtains closed
And in absence of the world compose
And sleep and stir in bed until it endsEmbed
