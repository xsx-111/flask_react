Plea Lyrics
Love, this is a dark world
And I've lost focus
Please tell me you need me, oh
Boy, you are every color
How am I visible?
Please tell me you need me, oh
You can taste your future
But I've lost focus
Please tell me you need me, oh
Love, you know I've given up
Because we're still not valid
Please tell me you need me, oh
Please tell me you need me, oh

Love, this is a dark world
And I've lost focus
Please tell me you need me, oh
Boy, you are every color
How am I visible?
Please tell me you need me, oh
You can taste your future
But I've lost focus
Please tell me you need me, oh
Love, you know I've given up
Because we're still not valid
Please tell me you need me, oh
Please tell me you need me, oh1Embed
