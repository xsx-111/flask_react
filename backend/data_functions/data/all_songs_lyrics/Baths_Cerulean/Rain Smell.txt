Rain Smell LyricsI still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
Oh, the water that had kept me alive
I will miss you, distance aside
I still smell you, distance aside
Still smell the rain, distance aside
