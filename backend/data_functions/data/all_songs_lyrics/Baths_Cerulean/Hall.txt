Hall LyricsLeaving out all sound
Feeling that tall now
And I call all around
The sound filling hall
Leaving out all sound
Feeling that tall now
And I call all around
The sound filling hall
Leaving out all sound
Feeling that tall now
And I call all around
The sound filling hall
Leaving out all sound
Feeling that tall now
And I call all around
The sound filling hall
Leaving out all sound
Feeling that tall now
And I call all around
The sound filling hallEmbed
