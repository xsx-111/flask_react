God puts us all in the swimming pool LyricsWill the clock stop
when I stop saying your name?
And your ghost gets
out of my mirror.
Are you lonely, with only
me to blame.
Sad and boring,
take my soul away.
Away.
Away.
Am I abstract?
Am I concrete?
You were right,
you don't want me.
In any world
we could meet.2Embed
