There is only you in the light & nothing else LyricsI can hear you moving around downstairs
Dragging your feet as you walk back and forth through the house
Running your hand over the piano keys absentmindedly as you pass by
I want to join you
I sulk slowly in my bed
It's dark outside but there’s a light glowing in the yard and it's coming through the windows
I can hear the wind blowing the leaves around
I hear your voice downstairs and I want to join you
Shining a light , I walk down the hallway to the stairs where I sit and wait
The noises have all stopped and I see you standing by the window with your back to me
The light from the yard wrapping around your hair
I want to say something but I can't speak
The room starts to fade and there’s only you in the light and nothing elseEmbed
