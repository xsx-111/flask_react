Turnaround - BBC John Peel Session 1990 LyricsTake a step out of yourself
Then you turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary
So silly
Well, it's revolting
You're not much
If you're anything
Take a step outside the city
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
Well, it's revolting
You're really nowhere
So wasteful
So foolish
Poppycock
Who said "Don't look back"?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant
'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let 'em do it
You know what I'm talkin' about?
You hear me talkin'?
You hear me talkin'?
It's pretty scary totally
Oh it's so revolting
It's pretty scary totally
Oh it's so revolting
It's pretty scary totally
Oh it's so revolting
It's pretty scary totally
Oh it's so revolting
Take a step out of the country
Then you turn around
Take a look at what you are
Well, it's amazing
Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's a laugh
Take a step outside the planet
Turn around and round
Take a look at what you are
It's pretty scaryEmbed
