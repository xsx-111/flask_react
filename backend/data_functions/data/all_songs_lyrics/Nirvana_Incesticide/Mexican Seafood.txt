Mexican Seafood Lyrics
Ah, the itchy flakes, it is inflaming
To the gels and creams, it is pertaining
To a fungus mold is my injection
Hope it's only a, a yeast infection

Only hurts when I
Hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I
Hurts when I sing

Now I vomit cum and diarrhea
On the tile floor like oatmeal pizza
With a toilet bowl full of a cloudy pus
I feel my blood becoming chowder rust

Only hurts when I
Hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I
Hurts when I sing

Roll into my bed, which does consist of
Lice, bugs, and fleas, and yellow mucus
Stained dirt vaseline, toe jam and booger
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge7Embed
