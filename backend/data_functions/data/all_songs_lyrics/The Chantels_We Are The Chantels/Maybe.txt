Maybe LyricsMaybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe, if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
Maybe, if I hold your hand
You will understand
And maybe, if I kissed your lips
I'll be at your command
Oh, maybe
I've cried and prayed to the Lord
To send you back my love
But instead you came to me
But only in my dreams
Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)1Embed
