Hollywood Cantata (Studio Outtake) LyricsOne, two, three, four
Hollywood is everywhere, you know
You don'tâ€”ah...one more time, one more time
One, two, three, ha
Hollywood is everywhere, now don't you know
You don't have to learn the line to see the show
Just catch it when it's dark or flying low
Get along down Sunset, yes indeed
Hollywood is what you let it be
What you want is often what you need
Swing low, swing low
For none of us will ever get back home
Swing right, sleep tight
No one here ever goes home at night
Hollywood is everywhere
Graceful children walk on air
Still line up in single file
We'll go down and stare awhile
Hold on honey, tell me does she move
In her knock me down and love me shoes
All the oil she's got is for the blues
Have you ever climbed those cut glass stairs?
Trick or treat got nothing to compare
Million dollar daydreams end up there
Hollywood is everywhere, you know
Don't have to be in love to see the show
Just catch it when it's dark or flying low
Get along down Sunset, yes indeed
Hollywood is what you let it be
What you want is often what you need
Swing low, swing low
None of us will get back home
Swing right, sleep tight
No one here ever goes home at night
Hollywood is everywhere
Graceful children walk on air
Still line up in single file
We'll go down and stare awhile
Hold on honey, tell me does she move
In her knock me down and fuck me shoes
All the oil she's got is for the grooves
Have you ever climbed those cut glass stairs
Trick or treat got nothing to compare
Million dollar daydreams end up there
Stay here
I don't like them wordsEmbed
