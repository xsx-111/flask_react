The Music Never Stopped Lyrics
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!

There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped2Embed
