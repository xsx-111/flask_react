Blues for Allah Lyrics
Arabian wind
The needle's eye is thin
The Ships of State sail on mirage
And drown in sand
Out in No-man's Land
Where Allah does command
What good is spilling
Blood?It will not
Grow a thing
Taste eternity
The swords sings Blues for Allah

In'sh Allah

They lie where they fall
There's nothing more to say
The desert stars are bright tonight
Let's meet as friends
The Flower of Islam
The Fruit of Abraham
The thousand stories have
Come 'round to one again
Arabian night
Our gods pursue their fight
What fatal flowers of
Darkness spring from
Seeds of light
Bird of paradise - Fly
In white sky
Blues for Allah
In'sh'Allah

Let's see with our heart
These things our eyes have seen
And know the truth must still lie
Somewhere in between
Under eternity
Under eternity
Under eternity
Blue
Bird of paradise
Fly
In white sky
Under eternity
Blues
For Allah
In'sh'AllahEmbed
