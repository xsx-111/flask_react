Hospital for Souls Lyrics
And then I found out how hard it is to really change
Even hell can get comfy once you've settled in
I just wanted the numb inside me to leave
No matter how fucked you get
Sorrow is there when you come back down
Funny thing is, all I ever wanted I already had
There's glimpses of heaven in every day
In the friends I have, the music I make, with the love I feel
I just had to start again

The days are a deathwish
A witch hunt for an exit
I am powerless
The fragile, the broken
Sit in circles and stay unspoken
We are powerless
Because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
Silent halls and nameless faces
I am powerless
Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but nobody wants to die
I can't fear death, no longer, I've died a thousand times
Why explore the universe when we don't know ourselves?
There's an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell
Throw me to the flames!
Watch me burn
Set my world ablaze!
Watch me burn
How are we on a scale of one to ten?
Could you tell me what you see?
Do you wanna talk about it?
How does that make you feel?
Have you ever took a blade to your wrists?
Have you been skipping meals?
We're gonna try something new today
How does that make you feel?
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
In this hospital for souls
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
Hold me close, don't let go, watch me burn
