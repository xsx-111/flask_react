Crooked Young Lyrics
Believe in no one!

Hallelujah, well, I'm saved
Just a dozen steps and 28 days
It's a miracle, I'll be born again
With the Lord as my shepherd, I will find a way

Fuck your faith, no one's gonna save you
Fuck your faith!

There's no hope for us, we speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun, no death can't touch
The crooked young
There's no hope for us, we speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun, no death can't touch
The crooked young, the crooked young!

We don't sleep, we don't eat
We speak in tongues
We can't die, we're dead inside
No death can't touch the crooked young
Believe in no one but yourself
The faceless won't save you
The clouds won't hear your fucking prayers
There's no hope for us, we speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun, no death can't touch
There's no hope for us, we speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun, no death can't touch
There's no hope for us, we speak in tongues
Blacker than the sun, no death can't touch

Hallelujah, I'm saved
It's a miracle, thank you, Jesus
Hallelujah, I'm saved
Fuck your faith, fuck your faith!15Embed
