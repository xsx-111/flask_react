Start With Me LyricsWith all the stuff they sell you night and day
With all the trash they try to trick you with you lie to me
Well I don't need it but I get it anyway
With all the sadness and lunacy
With all the dispossessed hopeless, you're leaving me
Well I don't want it but it's how it's going to be
Yeah, you can try to save the world
And baby, that's fine
But is it such a hateful crime to start with me?
With all the bad debts and misery
With all the dirty tricks and hypocrites you cheat on me
Well I don't want it but it's all that I can see
With all the discrete obscenities
With all the money freaks and doublespeak you turn away
Well I don't need it, but I guess it's gonna stay
Yeah, you can try to save the world
Well baby, that's fine
But is it such a hateful crime to start with me?Embed
