It Might As Well Be You LyricsThere is nobody here tonight, who doesn't dance to the same tune as I
Looking for that special someone new, and hey babe it might as well be you
And as I fumble through my change, the dance floor illuminates
And there you are again
I'm looking for someone to hold on to
And hey, babe, it might as well be you
It might as well be you that I wake up to tomorrow
And it might as well be you that tonight whispers my name
And it might as well be you that I cling to, that I laugh with and sing to
That I kiss good-bye to never see again
And through the fog that love creates the night is filled with all the usual mistakes
They say you're looking lonely babe, and they've been looking too
And hey, they might well be for you
And by the light of cigarettes, we introduce ourselves in a way you don't forget
I'm looking for something and anything will do
So, hey babe, it might as well be you
And if we go home tonight, you might find the very thing
That come the morning light, might well have washed your mind of him
So let me in tonight so we two losers might start to win
It might as well be you that I wake up to tomorrow
And it might as well be you that tonight will call my name
And it might as well be you that I cling to, that I laugh with and sing to
Yeah babe, it might as well be you that reminds me
It was once her here beside me
That I kissed good-bye, to never see againEmbed
