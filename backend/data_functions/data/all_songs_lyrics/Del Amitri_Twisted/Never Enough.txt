Never Enough LyricsWith two hundred people in suits all the same
You walk off that last lonely train
On the half finished buildings only seagulls remain
As you try to think back to the root of this pain
And life ain't worth living without a little love
But a little love is never enough
So some folks are fighting for freedom, but you're just fighting the flab
And therein lies the reason that life is a drag
So you gaze at the television
As some publicity goons cut loose those useless balloons
Down in the darkness of your lying little heart
There's a space for you to change
So you can take this world apart
And these days the morning mirror seems to say to you now
That you used to be pretty but you're alright now
And sometimes you find you're dreaming as you're late for work again
Thinking there's not many trees you can see from this train
Life ain't worth living
Without a little love
But a little love is never enoughEmbed
