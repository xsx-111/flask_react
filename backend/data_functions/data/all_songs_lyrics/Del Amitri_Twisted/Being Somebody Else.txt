Being Somebody Else LyricsHow are you going to pass the time of day
In your beautiful empty shell
When you've shaken the hand of so many sinceroes
You feel like a fake yourself
How do you choose between you and me
When we both feed on being somebody else
So you suck on the juice of youth and use any chemical you can get
You get deeper in debt every step you take on your ladder of lifelessness
Bye bye to the boring times
Hello to my friend, how you been being somebody else?
Now the troops in you head won't obey what you say
And the mutiny seems to spread
And all you can hear is a voice in your ear and it's telling you that
You're dead
The sun sets in a coffee cup, the moon throws up
The flood flows over the house
The books start jumping from the shelf
And the clothes horse races itself
Now we're all so busy being somebody else
Roll to meEmbed
