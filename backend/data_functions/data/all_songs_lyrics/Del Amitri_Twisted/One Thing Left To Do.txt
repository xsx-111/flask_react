One Thing Left To Do LyricsSo long, hope you dreams come true
Now I've gone i know you're gonna bloom
And did you want me to say I'd die for you
What you wanted I couldn't give
I guess I needed it to live
And did you want me to say I'd die for you
And did you want me to give my heart to you
Well I wanted to but I wasn't sure who I belonged to
And so long to everything
Now there's only one thing left to do
I guess I want to prove that I'd die for you
I don't think of you, like I used to do
I can't figure who, I'm writing this to
And it's OK if you want to say I died for youEmbed
