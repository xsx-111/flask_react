Berkertex Bribe LyricsBerkertex bride, oh, Berkertex bride...
Berkertex bride, oh, Berkertex bride...
Berkertex bride, oh, Berkertex bride...
Berkertex bride, oh, Berkertex bride...
The object, unsoiled, is packed, ready and waiting
For the moment of truth in this spiritual mating
The object, unsoiled, is packed, ready and waiting
To be owned, cherished, to be fucked for the naming
The public are shocked by the state of society
But as for you, you're a breath of purity
Well, don't give me your morals! They're filth in my eyes!
You can pack them away with the rest of your lies
Your painted mask of ugly perfection
The ring on your finger, the sign of protection
Is the rape on page 3, is the soldier's obsession
How well you've been caught to support your oppression:
One God!
One church!
One husband...
One wife!
Sordid sequences in brilliant life!
Supports, and props, and punctuation
To our flowing realities and realisations
We're talking with words that have been used before
To describe us as goddesses, mothers and whores
Describe us as women, to describe us as men
Set out the rules of this ludicrous game
And then it's played very carefully, a delicate balance;
A masculine/feminine perfect alliance
Does the winner take all? What love in your grasping?
What vision is left, and is anyone asking?
What vision is left, and is anyone asking?
Oh, Berkertex Bribe! Berkertex Bribe, Berkertex Bribe!
Berkertex Bribe, oh, Berkertex Bribe! Ber-ber-ber, Berkertex Bribe!
Berkertex Bribe, oh, Berkertex Bribe! Ber-ber-ber-ber, Berkertex Bribe!
Berkertex Bribe, Berkertex Bribe! Ber-ber-ber-ber, Berkertex Bribe!
Berkertex Bribe, oh, Berkertex Bribe! Ber-ber-ber-ber, Berkertex Bribe!
Berkertex Bribe, oh, Berkertex Bribe. Bri-bri-bri-bri-bribe
Bri-bri-bri-bri-bribe
Bribe, bribe, bribe...
Bribe...
Bribe!
Bribe!
BRIBE!Embed
