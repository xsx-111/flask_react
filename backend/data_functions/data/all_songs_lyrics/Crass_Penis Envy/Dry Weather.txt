Dry Weather LyricsIs there anyone prepared to tell me why?
Tell me why I'm being sucked dry?
Oh yes, that is yours and this is mine
As long as the balance is out
That's fine
I don't define the terms of the oppression
Do you awake to that dull and grey depression?
You ride on me
Suck my energy
You take what you want when you want it
You reject any change that I make
You ask me for more when I've spent it
When I've given it all, you still take
Is there anyone prepared to tell me why?
Tell me why I'm being sucked dry?
Oh yes! I know the lines you drawn for protection
The number given for a name is simply for detection
I know I'm only paper in a file
But couldn't you treat me as a human for a while?
You ride on me
Suck my energy
You take what you want when you want it
You reject any change that I make
You ask me for more when I've spent it
When I've given it all, you still take
Is there anyone prepared to tell me why?
Tell me why I'm being sucked dry?
You offer your protection, but insist when I decline
You offer independence, but demand I toe the line
You say you give me freedom, but you hang on to the key
Well don't you think, perhaps, the decision's up to me?
You ride on me
Suck my energy
You take what you want when you want it
You reject any change that I make
You ask me for more when I've spent it
When I've given it all, you still take
Is there anyone prepared to tell me why?
Tell me why I'm being sucked dry?
So tell me I'm dreaming if I want to live
And I'll tell you you're just scheming to make me give
More than I want to, more than I can
You don't want person, you just want a woman
You hide behind logic, secure with your facts
You've a history of time to back up your claims
Protecting the future by filling up the cracks
That might expose the real nature of your games
You want woman 'cause she's children for your system
Well, people wither in that living death
You hide behind your prejudice, afraid of my wisdom
Afraid I might question your unquestioned worth
You ride on me
Suck my energy
You take what you want when you want it
You reject any change that I make
You ask me for more when I've spent it
When I've given it all, you still take
Is there anyone prepared to tell me why?
Tell me why I'm being sucked dry?
Used as a tool?
Treated like a fool?
Spat on?
Shat on?
Totally confused?
Fucked up?
Mucked up?
Totally abused?
Pulled about?
Fooled about?
Treated like a toy?
Joked about?
Poked about?
Something to destroy?
Tricked?
Kicked?
I don't want these gamesEmbed
