Juke Box Hero (Nearly unplugged) LyricsStanding in the rain with his head hung low
Couldn't get a ticket, it was a sold out show
Heard the roar of the crowd, he could picture the scene
Put his ear to the wall, then like a distant scream
He heard one guitar, just blew him away
Saw stars in his eyes and the very next day
Bought a beat up six string in a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it but he knew for sure
That one guitar felt good in his hands
Didn't take long to understand
Just one guitar, slung way down low
Was a one way ticket, only one way to go
So he started rockin', ain't never gonna stop
Gotta keep on rockin'
Someday gonna make it to the top
And be a jukebox hero (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a jukebox hero
He took one guitar, jukebox hero (Stars in his eyes)
Jukebox hero (Stars in his eyes)
He'll come alive tonight
In a town without a name in a heavy downpour
Thought he passed his own shadow by the backstage door
Like a trip through the past to that day in the rain
And that one guitar made his whole life change
Now he needs to keep a-rockin', he just can't stop
Gotta keep on rockin', that boy has got to stay on top
And be a jukebox hero (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a jukebox hero (Got stars in his eyes)
Yeah, jukebox hero (Stars in his eyes)
With that one guitar (Stars in his eyes), he'll come alive
Come alive tonight
Yeah, he's gotta keep a-rockin'
He just can't stop
Gotta keep on rockin'
That boy has got to stay on top
And be a jukebox hero (Got stars in his eyes)
He's a jukebox hero (Got stars in his eyes)
With just one guitar, jukebox hero
With stars in his eyes
Oh, he's just a jukebox hero
Jukebox hero
Jukebox hero, he's got stars in his eyes
Stars in his eyes1Embed
