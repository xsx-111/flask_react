Night Life LyricsWake up in time to see the sun going down
Turn on the six o' clock news
See what's happening in this town
I take a walk down to the corner
I meet those bad girls hanging around
Never doing what they oughta
Oooh, yeah
I get caught up in the action
Gotta find the main attraction now
Gotta get some satisfaction
You better take me to heart of that night life
Looking for some night life
Need a little night life
Living in the daylight just don't agree with me
Oooh, night life
Stealing through the night like a wolf on the prowl
Not a bird, not a plane
I'm just a mean old night owl
Watch me hit, run, gotta move on
Going wild in the night, 'cause I'm hooked on the neon
Oooh, yeah
I'm looking for some action
I gotta find my main attraction now
'Cause I need some satisfaction
Won't you take me to the heart of that night life
A little bit of night life
Oooh, I need some night life full of bright lights and noise
It's time to separate the men from the boys
(Guitar solo)
(Night life) I ain't talking about no high-life cabaret
(Night life) I need something, just something to pull me away
(Night life) Yeah, holding me and the noise
It's time to separate the men from the boys
(Night life) It can get kinda rough
(Night life) We'll see who's standing when the sun comes up
(Night life) Yeah, the skyscrapers
But the night life is a formal attraction
(Night life) Yeah, c'mon, c'mon.  Night life
Whoo!  Oooh, oooh
Night life.  Anything goes
Night life.  Having the time of my life
(Night life) All in a day
(Night life) We're all crazy, baby
(Night life) Ha.  Whoo, oooh, oooh, oooh!Embed
