Luanne Lyrics
Luanne, Luanne
Why do you run and hide?
Luanne, Luanne
Don't keep your love inside

I wait around for you after school
You slip away and I don't see you
Don't know what I'm going to do
If you can't see how much I need you
We met, one day, and then, you ran away
I've searched the whole town looking for you
I know you're there somewhere


I write letters that I never send
I keep the words to whisper to you someday
I don't know where and I don't know when
Luanne I'm going to get to you someway
I want to feel your love so close to me
Give me just half a chance
To prove myself, I need to

These days true love is so hard to find
Someday I know you're going to be mine
Luanne, Luanne, Luanne, ooh


Luanne, Luanne
Don't need to run and hide
Luanne, Luanne
Don't keep your love inside

Luanne, Luanne, Luanne, Luanne
I want to be beside you, can't you understand?
Luanne, Luanne, Luanne, Luanne
Give me a little love, I know you can
Luanne, Luanne
Can't you hear me calling?
