Save Me from Myself Lyrics
Unlit streets and alleys, I don't care
I will stroll as if I'm on the Cote d'Azur
Muggers, pimps, and bangers everywhere
I don't feel the danger though I'm told it's there
Back in my apartment, all alone
I feel a chill, who can I phone?
Back in my apartment all alone
It's only me, I'm not alone

Save me, save me, save me from myself
Save me, save me, save me from myself
Who is that confronting me?
Who is that in front of me?
Save me, save me, save me from myself

Foreign objects hurtling through the night
Crashing through our atmosphere
Towards God knows where
Viruses and pestilence and blight
Biblical in their destruction, should I care?
Back to what should be my comfort zone
No comfort there, my cover's blown
I would not have come here if I'd known
If I had known, if I had known
Save me, save me, save me from myself
Save me, save me, save me from myself
Who is that confronting me?
Who is that in front of me?
Save me, save me, save me from myself

Ooh ooh ooh, save me, ooh ooh ooh, save me
Save me, save me, save me from myself

Sewer-living creatures striking fear
Tramping this way steadily, they'll soon be here
Who tonight's undoing her brassiere
Answer, no, it isn't you, that much is clear
Double bolted residence at last
Better think fast, better think fast
If you're here alone, you'll never last
You'll never last, you'll never last

Save me, save me, save me from myself
Save me, save me, save me from myself
Who is that confronting me?
Who is that in front of me?
Save me, save me, save me from myself
Save me, save me, save me from myself2Embed
