The Power Couple Lyrics

We need to relax (It's not a big deal)
We cannot relax (It's such a big deal)
The power couple's coming around
A friend of a friend (Of a friend of a friend)
Is friends with their cook (And so, in the end)
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around

The glasses are clean (The wine has been chilled)
I'm starting to feel (a little bit ill)
The power couple's coming around
Intelligent talk (But naturally so)
And if we should gawk (they'll say, "gotta go")
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around

Segovia (Seems a very safe choice)
We'll cue it all up (When we hear the Rolls-Royce)
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around
We've closed the garage (and hidden our Kia)
And wait for the chance (to raise our idea)
The power couple's coming around
Our future depends (On how they respond)
I hope that we're both (extremely on)
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around

And should they respond (We'll go to step two)
We planned it all out (We know what to do)
The power couple's coming around
This could be the day (That changes our lives)
The day that good fortune (Finally arrives)
The power couple's coming around
This could be the day (That changes our lives)
The day that good fortune (Finally arrives)
The power couple's coming around
This could be the day (That changes our lives)
The day that good fortune (Finally arrives)
The power couple's coming around
The power couple's coming around
We must make a good impression
We must make a great impressionEmbed
