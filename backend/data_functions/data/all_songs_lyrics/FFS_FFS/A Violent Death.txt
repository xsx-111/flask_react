A Violent Death Lyrics
A violent death
What a surprise
A violent death
No space to cry out
A violent death
No time for goodbyes
A violent death
I didn't think it would be like this
With wet warmth draining across the seat
I didn't think it would be like this
To see what I'm made of in color HD

A violent death
Oh, what a surprise
A violent death
No space to cry out
A violent death
No time for goodbyes
A violent death

I didn't think it could feel like this
The shock of not living distracting the pain
I didn't think it could be like this
To know I'm going with nothing to say
Strangers lean over
Passengers on the same train
On the same train
I didn't think
It would be like this

A violent death
What a surprise
A violent death
No space to cry out
A violent death
No time for goodbyes
A violent death

Strangers lean over
Passengers on the same train
On the same train
I didn't think it would be like this
I never thought of how it would come
I didn't think it could feel like this
I didn't think it would be like this 
Oh I didn't think it would be like this
With wet warmth draining down the seat
I didn't think it would be like this
To see what I'm made of in color HD
A violent death 
No space to cry out
A violent death 
I never thought of how it would come
But now it's upon me, it's all that I am
I never thought of how it would come
All that I'm made of is how it would come

Strangers lean over
Passengers on the same train
On the same train

Strangers lean over
Passengers on the same train
On the same train
A violent death
Oh what a surprise
A violent death
No space to cry out
A violent death
No time for goodbyes
A violent death1Embed
