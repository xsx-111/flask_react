King of the Song Lyrics
He would lean into my cradle
Rest an revolver on an infant cheek

Speeding' and singing
Singing and speeding
Speeding, singing
My infancy to sleep
Well I can hear his voice again
And I can hear his song
The singing is gone

Nobody sings like my daddy sang
He was the King of the Song
Nobody sings like my daddy sang
I know that had to sing
The way that my daddy sang

Do you know what it's like to be born to a legend
To be born to a freak
To face expectation from your first crowing peak at the world
An umbilical peak at this hideous
Fame-ridden world
Where I hear his song
Singing he's gone

Nobody sings like my daddy sang
He was the King of the Song
Nobody sings like my daddy sang
I know that I'll never to sing
The way that my daddy sang
The way that my daddy sang

I am the King of the song
I am the King of the song
I am the King, the King of the song
I am the King of the song
I am the King of the song
I am the King, the King of the song
I am the King of the song
I am the King of the song
I am the King, the King of the song
I am the King of the song
I am the King of the song
I am the King of the song
What do you mean you don't know my singer
What do you mean that you don't know his song
He was speeding and singing
Singing and speeding
Speeding, singing
Come on let's sing along

You can beat his heart again
When you sing his song
Although he's goneEmbed
