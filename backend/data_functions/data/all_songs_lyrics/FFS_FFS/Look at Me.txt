Look at Me Lyrics
I'll admit that I'm in need
Not the cocaine, not the weed
Just look at me, look at me, look at me
You don't have to hold my hand
You don't have to like my band
Just look at me, look at me, look at me

Well I'm not asking for a lot
(Look at me, look at me)
Just one thing makes me hard
(Look at me, look at me)
Just one thing gets me high
(Look at me, look at me)
Well I'm not asking for the sky
(Look at me, look at me)

Screw the sunset, screw all art
Look at me or break my heart
Just look at me, look at me, look at me
Screw your iPad, screw your phone
Look at me and me alone
Just look at me, look at me, look at me
Just look at me, look at me, look at me
 x2
Well I am all you need to see
(Look at me, look at me)
Every eye fixed right on me
(Look at me, look at me)
This is all I need to be
(Look at me, look at me)
The center of the galaxy
(Look at me, look at me)

I don't want your subtle glance
I don't want you in my pants
Just look at me, look at me, look at me

Don't look at your mother
Don't look at your father
Don't look at your sister
Don't look at your brother
Don't look at your teacher
Don't look at your preacher
Just look at me
Don't look at no BBC
Dont look at ITV
Dont look at Channel 4
You might as well look at the floor
Life just ain't a minivan
Focus on the job at hand and look at me
Just look at me, look at me, look at me
Just look at me, look at me, look at me
