So desu ne Lyrics
She's a mountaineer of love
She's climbing Mount Fuji
Nothing but a Kenzo kimono on
Carrying a Hello Kitty Uzi 

So desu ne, that's all she'll say

So desu ne, so desu ne
So desu ne, ja ne

She's an ambulance sometimes
Her blue light blinking on a two beat
Paranoid, paratrooper, paramedics
Drive, arrive, and check your heartbeat
Check your blood pressure
Gonna eat your beans and eat your leisure
Gonna check your blood pressure
Gonna push your, push your blood pressure, well

So desu ne, that's all she'll say
 
So desu ne, so desu ne
So desu ne, ja ne

She's a pamphleteer of love
Filming a katakana movie
Nothing but a Kenzo kimono on
Carrying a Meiko Kaji Uzi

She's an ambulance sometimes
Her blue light blinking on a two beat
Paranoid, paratrooper, paramedics

Drive, arrive, and check your heartbeat
Check your blood pressure
Gonna eat your beans and eat your leisure
Gonna check your blood pressure
Gonna push your, push your
Push your pressure
Gonna eat your beans and eat your leisure
(So desu ne) Gonna eat your beans and eat your leisure
(So desu ne) Gonna push your, push your, push your pressure
(So desu ne) Gonna eat your beans and eat your leisure
(Ja ne) Gonna check your blood pressure
(So desu ne) Gonna push your, push your, push your pressure
(So desu ne) Gonna eat your beans and eat your leisure
(So desu ne) Gonna push your blood pressure
(Ja ne) Gonna push your beans and eat your leisure
Gonna check your beans and eat your leisure...1Embed
