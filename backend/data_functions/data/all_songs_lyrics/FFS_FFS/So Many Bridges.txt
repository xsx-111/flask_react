So Many Bridges Lyrics
The places, they all look the same
The places, they all look the same
The places, they all look the same

The places, they all look the same
I'll dive in, I'll save you again
But friendship has limits you know
So how long, how far will you go

So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of

The places, they all look the same
Same shop girls, same salary men
Capricious thats how you'd explain
Capricious or maybe insane

So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of

Right in the oklahoma
We'd rather go
Paris and san francisco
How can we go?

So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of

So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of

The places, they all look the same
Same buildings, same punctual trains
Resentment is building in me
But somehow I can not retreat
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off of
So many bridges in the world to jump off ofEmbed
