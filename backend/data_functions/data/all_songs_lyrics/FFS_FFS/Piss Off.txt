Piss Off Lyrics
You get the runaround from him
The runaround from her
The runaround, around, around
You get the put you down from him
The put you down from her
They always, always put you down
You get the shake you down from him
The shake you down from her
They always, always shake you down

Get to the point and point to the open door
Get right to the point and there's the door

Tell everybody to piss off tonight
Well, they should piss off and leave you alone in your world tonight
Most will listen and take the hint
Know that this ain't a compliment
And they should piss off and leave you alone in your world tonight

It's always inexplicable
It's inexplicable
But still they're eager to explain
It's always inapplicable
It's inapplicable
But they'll apply it all the same
It's always irrefutable
It's irrefutable
But still their arguments remain
Get to the point and point to the open door
Get right to the point and there's the door

Tell everybody to piss off tonight
Well, they should piss off and leave you alone in your world tonight
Most will listen and take the hint
Know that this ain't a compliment
And they should piss off and leave you alone in your world tonight

I gaze into my crystal ball
I see a future free for all
Where football and cheap alcohol
Has shook me to the core
I'll enjoy each moment, so
I'll add to my portfolio
Of epithets and cheerios
That never fail to store

I want to fantasize
I want to fantasize
But the essential parts are never there
I want to socialize
I want to socialize
But then I look around and just don't care
I want to harmonize
I want to harmonize
But all the voices sound beyond repair
Get to the point and point to the open door
Get right to the point and there's the door

Tell everybody to piss off tonight
Well, they should piss off and leave you alone in your world tonight
Tell everybody to piss off tonight
Well, they should piss off and leave you alone in your world
Piss off and leave you alone in your world
Piss off and leave you alone in your world tonight
Piss off!
Piss off!
Piss off!
Piss off!
Piss off!Embed
