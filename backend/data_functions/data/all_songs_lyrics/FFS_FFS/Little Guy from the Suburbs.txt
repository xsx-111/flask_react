Little Guy from the Suburbs Lyrics
I'm just a little guy from the suburbs
Who learned to kill before the others
Romantic activist, I'm the joker
I say, "Vive le Qu√©bec libre"

But if you hear this, no, when you hear this
You'll know I didn't, I didn't make it like I hoped we would
I didn't make it like I hoped we would
I didn't make it like I hoped we would
But you know, you know, yes, you know

No heroes
Just those who care more for their legend than their life
There are no heroes in this life

I tried, yes, I tried, with a shy girl
To live respectably, but decided
Fake existentialist, I'm the martyr
Steal from the bank of Jean-Paul Sartre

But if you hear this, no, when you hear this
You'll know I didn't, I didn't make it like I hoped we would
I didn't make it like I hoped we would
I didn't make it like I hoped we would
But you know, you know, yes, you know
No heroes
Just those who care more for their legend than their life
There are no heroes in this life


I am the little guy from the suburbs
But I learned to kill better than the others
What's that you said about execution?
Oh, bring on the beatification

But if you hear this, no, when you hear this
You'll know I didn't, I didn't make it like I hoped we would
I didn't make it like I hoped we would
I didn't make it like I hoped we would
But you know, you know, yes, you know

No heroes
And I don't care
For my legend or my life
There are no heroes in this lifeEmbed
