Love Me Or Leave Me LyricsLove me or leave me, and let me be lonely
You won't believe me, I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
You might find the night time right time for kissing
Night-time my time reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently so blue
I want your love, don't want to borrow
Have it today, give back tomorrow
My love, your love, no love, nobody else
Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
You might find the night-time the right time for kissing
Night-time is my time for reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently so blue
I want your love, don't want to borrow
Have it today, give it back tomorrow
My love, your love, no love, nobody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently so blue
I want your love, don't want to borrow
Have it today, give it back tomorrow
My love, your love, no love, nobody else
My love, your love, no love, nobody else
My love, your love, no love, nobody elseEmbed
