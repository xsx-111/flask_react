Them There Eyes LyricsI fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a funny lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, how they make me blue
Fallin' a great big way for you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
You'd better look out boy, if you're wise
Sparkle, bubble
They get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
Them there eyes
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyesEmbed
