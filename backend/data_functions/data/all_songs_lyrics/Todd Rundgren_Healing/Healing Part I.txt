Healing Part I Lyrics
Listen
Listen
Listen to the voice - the voice is an illusion
Listen to the voice - don't let the words confuse you
'Cause you need something to concentrate on, concentrate on me
You need something to meditate on, meditate on me

Listen
Listen
Listen to your heart, tune into the rhythm
Listen to your heart,  beating with precision
Like the waves upon the seaside it goes on and on
Like the spinning of the world it goes on and on

Listen, listen
Listen for the sound that is not in the music
Only you can hear it, only you can use it
It's the sound of someone breathing, it's the breath of life
It's the sound that you are weaving with the thread of life

Listen, listen
Listen to the sound, let nothing disturb you
You are in a place where nothing can hurt you
If you feel a strange sensation, it can do no harm
Like the spiral of creation it will soon move onEmbed
