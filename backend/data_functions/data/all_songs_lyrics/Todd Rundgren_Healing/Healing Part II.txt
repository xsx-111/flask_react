Healing Part II Lyrics
Where you are going
You cannot take your body
You are on a journey
The baggage is too heavy
You can leave your legs behind you
You will learn to fly
You can leave your arms behind you
You will touch the sky
You can leave your head behind you
You are thought itself
You can leave the rest behind you
You are breath itself

Now you are naked
There's no one here to judge you
See the clear light
Shining high above you
Then you're floating in the silence
You are not alone

For the power of your being
Keeps you flowing on
Look upon yourself
Only with compassion
Strip away the shell
Hiding your perfection
Though your past was full of darkness
Now the past is gone
And your life is starting over
When it's just begun
Now you are home
Don't you recognize it
Towering eternal
Behind the troubled thoughts that hide it
Though at times it seems so distant
It is always there
When you need its peace and power
You will know it's hereEmbed
