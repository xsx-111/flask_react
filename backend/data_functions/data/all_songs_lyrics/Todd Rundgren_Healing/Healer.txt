Healer Lyrics
My child

I had a visitation in my sleep last night
Something was calling to me from a blinding light
And told me not to fear it, hear it
It said, "It's time to make the world a little wiser
There are enough destroyers and criticizers
The world needs a healer, healer"

And I awoke, my heart was pounding
'Cause it was not like me to have such dreams
But I could not fall asleep for wondering
Why the messenger had come to me

My child, I am too old and I am set in my ways
(Rejoice, rejoice because the healer comes)
But now I realize just what the voice conveyed
You will be a healer, healer

(Rejoice, rejoice because the healer comes)
(Rejoice, rejoice because the healer comes)
(Rejoice, rejoice because the healer comes)
(Rejoice, rejoice because the healer comes)
(Rejoice, rejoice because the healer comes)
Your destiny I lay before you
But then the choice was never yours nor mine
When it's time to take this burden on you
Then I will take the one you leave behind

You will be a healer, healer
Healer
You'll be a healer
Healer, healer, healer
Healer, healer, healer, healer, healer
You'll be a healer, healerEmbed
