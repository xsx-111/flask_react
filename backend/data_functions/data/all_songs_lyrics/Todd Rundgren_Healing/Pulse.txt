Pulse Lyrics
Step by step by step by step
By steps grow longer
'Til it's just like stepping in another world
Feel that pulse that pulse that pulse
That pulse go stronger
Like a breath line coming from another world

Don't want to leave my old world but I can't deny
What it is that draws me on
Like a magnet pulling from another world
Don't know what I'll find in the new world
But I'm not afraid of the sound that calls me on
Like a siren singing in another world
Here comes a change and another change
And another change and another wave of change
Like a heartbeat pumping from another world

Step by step by step by step
By steps grow longer
'Til it's just like stepping in another world
Feel that pulse that pulse that pulse
That pulse go stronger
Like a breath line coming from another world

And it's just like stepping in another world
And it's just like stepping in another world
And it's just like stepping in another world
And it's just like stepping in another worldEmbed
