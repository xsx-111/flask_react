Flesh Lyrics
Oh the law is the law
For no man wrote the law
They who would change the law just abuse it
Oh the law is the law
There is no justice outside the law
But if you know the law, you can use it

If you will, then you will
For nothing can withstand your will
As your faith is so you are
Where your mind is there you are
Just as action follows thought
You can be whole again
Be healed again
And make your body follow
You are thy flesh and flesh will obey
You are thy flesh and flesh must obey

Whoa your life is your life
No one else can live your life
And the debts of your life, you must pay them
If a man knows the law
He gets help from the law
Only fools fear the law that can save them

If you will, then you will
For nothing can withstand your will
As your faith is so you are
Where your mind is there you are
Just as action follows thought
You can be whole again
Be healed again
And make your body follow
You are thy flesh and flesh will obey
You are thy flesh and flesh must obey
You are thy flesh and flesh will obeyEmbed
