Healing Part III Lyrics
Listen
Listen
Listen to the cry of a world that's calling to you
Listen to the cry of the helpless souls that need you
Though you may have trepidation, you can not refuse
You will find your own salvation in the path you choose

Listen
Listen
Listen to the voice that whispers in the silence
Listen as the voice solidifies your self reliance
Let the peace that you've discovered be a guiding light
Let the cry that you've uncovered set the world alright

You could not be closer to your maker
Never more or less alone
If you know thyself there's nothing else to know
You are whole, you are wholeEmbed
