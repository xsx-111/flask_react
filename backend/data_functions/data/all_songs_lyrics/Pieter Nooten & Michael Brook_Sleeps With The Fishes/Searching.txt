Searching LyricsSearching, you're searching
Words, words, sentences
See these hands are empty
Slowly moving in the air
Hear our thoughts, hear how they play
A long-forgotten tune
In a big green-coloured chair
Can no memory build roads?
Colours above me
Arise high above despair
Searching, you're searching
In images and memories
See these hands are empty
Slowly moving in the airEmbed
