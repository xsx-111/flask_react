After The Call LyricsActually, it's overpowering after your call
It took me beyond the truth
And pushed me further into a void
Actually, you're taking refuge in imagination
From here and now a rupture grows through each day
Unwillingly flows
Then in lustre of season
Flies away every reason
Here and now the rupture shows again
Through which the almond grows
There is unrest beside some sides
And uncertainly searching for a meaning
Clouds as they're floating past in the present
As much more thoughts part in the present days
Come, keep calling me
Oh, keep calling, ah
Come, keep calling my name
Oh, keep calling, ah
Come and see me falling
Foolishly following your mind
Come and see and fall in
Fall into your mindEmbed
