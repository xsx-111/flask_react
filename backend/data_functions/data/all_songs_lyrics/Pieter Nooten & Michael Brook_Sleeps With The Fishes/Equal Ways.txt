Equal Ways Lyrics
So the circle cannot fade
It turns in endless waves
It turns its endless days
Now this window offers views
Of endless random chance
Of endless moves and stance

We dance on motive's invisible causes
But won't stop wondering
Won't ever stop wonder

So the circle cannot fade
It turns in endless waves
It turns its endless days
Now this window offers views
Of endless random chance
Of endless moves and stance

We dance on motive's invisible causes
But won't stop wondering
Won't ever stop wonderEmbed
