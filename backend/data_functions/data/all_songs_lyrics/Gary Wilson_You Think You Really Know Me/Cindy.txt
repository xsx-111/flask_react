Cindy LyricsWoo!
C-I-N-D-Y
Spells Cindy
And she's a cool chick
Yeah, she's cool, ha!
Hey!
When you wanna walk her home late at night
'Bout 12
She'll say it's a real neat scene
Ha! Yeah! Because
Cindy, Cindy
Cindy makes out, ha
Just like-a me, yeah
Cindy makes out
She's the missing link
When you wanna kiss her lips
Ha, yeah!
She'll tell you it'd be real cool with her
Woo! Real cool
But when you wanna take her out on Friday night
She'll tell you, hey
"Just pick me up about 9:20", ha!
"But you better call first"
Because
Cindy, ha
Makes out like-a me
Yeah, yeah, Cindy
Woo! Ha!
Makes out like-a me, yeah
Cindy, she must be the missing link
Yeah, yeah
Cindy, Cindy, Cindy
She makes out like-a me
Ha, ha
'Cause she's gotta be the missing link
The missing link, ha!
The missing link
She's gotta be the missing link, ha!
She's gotta be the missing, ha!
She's gotta be the missing link
Ha! Yeah!
'Cause Cindy, she's a groovy, groovy chick
Ha! Real groovy
She's a real groovy chick...Embed
