Chromium Bitch LyricsI want, I said I wanna
Make you my chromium bitch
You're so, you're so electric!
Woo!
I want, I said I wanna
Make you my chromium bitch
My bitch!
Hey!
I'm gonna put you in my mirror tonight, now
Ha, woo!
I'm gonna put you in my mirror tomorrow
Ha, hey!
When I wanna be in your arms, you'll be there, now
Woo!
And when I wanna kiss you
I know I, I know I can count on you
I can count on you to be there
When I need you
I want, I said I wanna
Make you my chromium bitch
You're so cool when I kiss you
Hey!
I want, I said I wanna
Make you my chromium bitch
My bitch! My bitch!
Hey!
I'll be kissin' you tonight
Woo, ha!
I'll be kissin' you Saturday night
Ha!
And when you wanna call me, I'll be there
Woo!
And when you wanna go
When you wanna go to the dance
I'll be there too
I'll be smilin', I'll be smilin'
'Cause I love you
I said I love you
I love you
I love to kiss you at the dance, woo!
And I love you
I love to hold your hand at night
When no one's there
I'll be real cool when no one's there
I'll be so cool you won't even know my name
I'll be that cool
And when you wanna
When you wanna
When you wanna call me up
I'll be waitin', I'll be waitin'
I'll be waitin'
I'll wait, woo!
I'll wait, I'll wait for your phone callin'
And I'll never forget
I'll never forget your name
I said I'll never
I'll never, I'll never
'Cause I want you
I want you on my pedestal
And I won't, I won't
I said I won't release you...Embed
