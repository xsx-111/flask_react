You Keep on Looking LyricsHey!
Foolish heart
You’re keepin’ me away
Hey!
From all the things that I want, ha!
From day to day, from day to day
Hey!
You keep on lookin’, woo!
Through my prison door
Hey!
Your mind is so unbalanced, woo!
I don’t care if they call you a whore
It don’t matter
Hey!
Out of repulse, woo!
That’s what they try to say
I’ll just keep on lovin’ you, I’ll keep lovin’ you
From day to day, from day to day
You’ve got the grooviest lips, woo!
That I ever did see, hey!
But you don’t seem to see what I want
You don’t seem to see in me
Hey!
You keep on lookin’, woo!
Through my prison door, ha!
But you never unlock, you don’t unlock
Your mind is filled with unbalanced things
Hey!
I says you keep on lookin’, woo!
Through my prison door, hey!
Your mind is filled with unbalanced things
And you chase your cares from shore to shore
Hey! Ha!
I says that you keep on lookin’
In my prison
You don’t unlock the door
Your mind is filled, is filled...Embed
