And Then I Kissed Your Lips LyricsLast night
When I whispered some confessions in your ear
You smiled and said, "Gary"
You said, "Gary, don't live your life in fear
Not in fear"
And then I kissed your lips
And all the rainin' stopped, woo!
Chrome things never change, ha!
You still kiss at the hop
You turned your back and cried
And bit your red lips
Sayin', "Life can be so cruel
Things gotta change"
I said, "Why'd I have to fall
In love with someone like you?
I know things never work
They way that you want them to
The way you want them to"
Hey, then I kissed your lips, woo!
All the rainin' stopped, ha!
Chrome things never change
You still kiss at the hop
Woo!
Hey! I kissed your lips
And all the rainin' stopped
Chrome things never change
You still kiss at the hop
Kiss at the hop
Say it!
And then I kissed your lips, ha!
And all the rain stopped
Chrome things never change
You still kiss at the hop...Embed
