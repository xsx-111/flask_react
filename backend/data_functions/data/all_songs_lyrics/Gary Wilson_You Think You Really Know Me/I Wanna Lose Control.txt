I Wanna Lose Control LyricsFeel cool
Ha!
Ha, ha!
Hey!
Hey, I called you right up
About 10:32, ha!
Your brother said you'd run home
Hey, whatcha tryin' to take me for, a fool?
Ha! 'Cause
I wanna lose control for about 15 minutes, ha!
And then I'll be real cool for the rest of the night
Ha! Ha! Ha!
'Cause you're cool, ha!
In the early morning hours, ha!
You look cool, cool, cool
In the afternoon
When I take you
I take you by the pool, ha!
And I show you to your girlfriends, hey!
I'm gonna take you to the pool
And we're gonna go swimmin'
We're gonna be swimmin'
But let me tell ya!
I wanna lose control for about 15 minutes, ha!
And then I'll feel real cool for the rest of the night
Ha! Ha! (Night)
Hey!
I said I'm gonna lose control for the first 15 minutes, ha!
And then I'll feel real cool for the rest of the night
The night, the night's young
(Woo!)
I says I'm gonna lose control
Hey! Hey!
For the rest of the
For the rest of the
Rest, rest
The rest of the night
I'll feel cool
For the rest of the night
The night, the night's young
Hey, I'm gonna lose control, woo!
For the next 15 minutes, hey!
Don't stop me
And then I'll feel real cool...Embed
