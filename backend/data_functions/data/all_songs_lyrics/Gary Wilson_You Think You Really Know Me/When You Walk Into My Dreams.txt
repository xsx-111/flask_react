When You Walk Into My Dreams LyricsI feel cool
When I reflect you in my mirror
You still into my chrome?
Sick trips? Ha!
Take the place of someone else's blind date
It happens every Friday night
Woo!
17 and 23, hmm
She takes the place of Venus in my dreams
In my dreams
Don't look back, don't look back
A thousand kisses on the beach
A thousand kisses on the beach
Woo!
When in light
Somehow the silver never melts
It just doesn't
When you walk into my dreams, ha!
Sometimes I feel like God forgot me
Like God forgot me
Sodium pentothal
Your love goes on like a make-out party
Like a make-out party
But don't look back, ha!
A thousand kisses on the beach
With Karen
Hey!Embed
