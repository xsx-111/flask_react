6.4 = Make Out LyricsSix point four
Equals make-out
I wouldn’t kid you now
Six point four
Equals make-out
Why don’t you come a little closer?
Ha, six point four
Equals make-out
How old'd you say you were?
(Sixteen)
Six point four
Equals, equals make-out
Equals make-out
Hey, when I called you last night
You said you’d be at the party
But when I got there, you weren’t there
What’re you trying to do to me, put me on a sick trip or something?
You know something? I don’t kiss on my first date
And I know you’re aware of it
Hey baby, you’re everything to me
But did I ever tell you?
I got a real crush
On Karen
Six point four, now
Equals make-out
Equals make-out
Equals make-out
Hey! Six point four
Oh god, six point four
Equals make-out
Equals make-out
Hey babe, I might kiss you
I’ll keep kissin’ you
Six point four, six point four
Equals make-out
Equals make-out
How old'd you say you were?
(Sixteen)
Six point four, oh Jesus, six point four
Equals make-out
Equals make-out
Equals make-out
