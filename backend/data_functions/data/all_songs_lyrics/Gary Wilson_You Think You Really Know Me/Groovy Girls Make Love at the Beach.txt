Groovy Girls Make Love at the Beach LyricsGroovy girls make love at the beach
And Joanie says that Debbie's out of reach
I called the operator, she put me on hold
I keep cryin' out for Cathy
She's got me by the soul
She's got me by the soul
'Cause she's out of reach, woo!
Every single Friday night, ha!
I said that she's out of reach, she's out of reach
When I want to take her in my arms, she's never there
'Cause
Hey!
Groovy girls make love at the beach
And Joanie says that, that Debbie's out of reach
I called the operator, she put me on hold
I keep crying out for Cathy
She's got me by the soul
She's got me by the soul
Hey!
She's out of reach, whoo!
Every single Friday night
I'm not kiddin' now
She's out of reach, woo!
When I want to take her in my arms
She's not there
Sir!
(La, la la la, la la la, la la la, la)
(La, la la la la, la la)
(La, la la la, la la la, la la la, la)
(La, la la la, la la)
(La, la la la, la la la, la la, la)
(La, la la la la, la la)
(La, la la la, la la la, la la, la)
(La, la la la, la la)
She's out of reach, woo!
Every single Friday night
I'm not kiddin' now
I said that she's out of reach, woo!
When I want to hold her in my arms
Hey! Ha!
I took her to the dance last Friday night
I said, "Just wait there, I'll be right back"
She said, "Gary, that sounds fine"
When I came back, I told her that I fell in love with her
She said, "Gary, fallin' in love"
She said, "Fallin' in love ain't too cool"
I started to cry, ha!
I started to cry, ha!
I said I started screamin'
I started screamin'
I started screamin'
I started screamin'
I started screamin'!
Hey, she's out of reach, woo!
Every time I try to hold her, I try to hold her
And then she's so out of reach, she's so out of reach
When I kiss her, when I kiss her
Hey!Embed
