I Wanted So Badly to Be Brave Lyrics
Well I cut open my palm and held it out to you
You did the same with your old army surplus blade
My blood's never as warm as I expect it
You grabbed my hand adorned in wildflower warpaint
You made yellows out of marigolds
You made purple out of camellias

We charged headfirst into the woods with bows and arrows drawn
Crudely fashioned, sticks and rubber bands and spray paint
We swore ourselves protectors from all the evil in the world
You weren't born my brother, but you're gonna die that way

You ran alone (you ran alone)
In the falling snow
Barefoot down Whites Road
I watched your bruises grow (your bruises grow)
Strangely beautiful
Purple and yellow
You said "Don't
Don't take me home
Don't take me home
Don't take me home"
Your father came in angry like a thunderstorm
Tossed you room from room and I watched color draining from your face
Fault lines started forming underneath all of your floorboards
We sat terrified waiting on an earthquake
I watched you put on a brave face
I wanted so badly to be brave

But you ran alone (you ran alone)
In the falling snow
Bare foot down Whites Road
I watched your bruises grow (your bruises grow)
Strangely beautiful
Purple and yellow
You said "Don't
Don't take me home
Don't take me home
Don't take me home"

Kicked you out to teach you what a man is
But I don't think I'll ever know what that means
They'll put a gun into your hand and call you weak until you're violent
Don't believe it
They're hateful cause they're empty
We've got a chance to break the cycle
We could be the heroes that we always said we'd be
"Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me
Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me
Home, home
Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me
Home, home
Don't take me home, don't take me home, don't take me"3Embed
