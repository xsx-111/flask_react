Palm Reader LyricsI bought flowers from a drifter
Cut my hand on a thorn
Straight across the fate line
I'm no palm reader but
I doubt that's the sign I was looking for
A rainy night in California
Told me he fought in a war
And I'm so desperate to do the right thing
I'm not sure what that even is any more
He found a bus stop to weather the storm

I'm gonna stand up straight
I'm gonna clear my throat and speak out, unafraid
Mom, I want you to know
I'm letting everything you taught me guide me home
Faded light from the projector spitting summer out on the screen
The pool we swam in caved in years ago
We filled it up with furniture and concrete
I saw right and wrong then
The lines were simple and clean
And now the people I was taught would be heroes
Are acting like cowards, killers, and thieves
I'm losing track of who the good guys are supposed to be
I'm gonna stand up straight
I'm gonna clear my throat and speak out, unafraid
Dad, I want you to know
I'm letting everything you taught me guide me home
Coming undone at the seams
Stress fractures and muted dreams
Oh please
Undone at the seams
Stress fractures and muted dreams
Oh please
Undone at the seams
Stretched back shirts and muted dreams
Oh

I'm gonna stand up straight
I'm gonna clear my throat and speak out, unafraid
Mom, I want you to know
I'm letting everything you taught me guide me home

Stand up straight
I'm gonna clear my throat and speak out, unafraid
Dad, I want you to know
I'm letting everything you taught me guide me home1Embed
