Slow Dancing with San Andreas Lyrics
The heat coming off of the highway
Makes the mountains out in the distance
Look like they're shuddering;
Look like they lost themselves in a moment
They hate remembering
I know the feeling

I want you to know (I want you to know)
I don't feel so alone (I don't feel so alone)

I'm slow dancing with San Andreas
Scared to death I won't walk these streets again
If we fail are we collateral damage?
Did any of this make a difference?

These snow drifts haunt the Dakotas
Like they're ghosts crawling on the freeway
Looking for a resting place
Looking for roadside memorials, crosses and roses, a makeshift grave
A place they could fade away

I'm slow dancing with San Andreas
Scared to death I won't walk these streets again
If we fail are we collateral damage?
Did any of this make a difference?
I'm drowning in shallow water
I'm singing through the lump in my throat again
If I'm given a voice but I don't say a thing
Is that blood on my hands?
My grandfather drove a city bus
So maybe all this wandering in circles
Comes from somewhere in my blood
My grandfather drove a city bus
So maybe all this restlessness
This discontent, this constant search for progress is in my blood

I'm slow dancing with San Andreas
Scared to death I won't walk these streets again
If we fail are we collateral damage?
Did any of this make a difference?
I'm drowning in shallow water
I'm singing through the lump in my throat again
If I'm given a voice but I don't say a thing
Is that blood on my hands?11Embed
