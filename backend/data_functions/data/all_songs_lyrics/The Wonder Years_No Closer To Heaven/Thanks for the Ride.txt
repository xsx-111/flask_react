Thanks for the Ride Lyrics
I washed chain grease and blood off of my hands
In the ocean, I let salt water rinse the dirt away
I stood calm in a room I hadn't been in
In a decade, I felt dizzy, used to stand here every day

Wait out the storm in a harbor town
Pretend I'll see you in Fall
Wait out the storm in a harbor town

Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a beautiful home
I won't call
Know you're waiting right outside
Thanks for the ride

I watched lines of container ships drift in
Just off of Long Beach, I thought long about where you would be today
We'd lose touch after college came and went
I'd hear you got married to some boy from California
Have a baby on the way

Wait out the storm in a harbor town
Pretend I'll see you in Fall
Wait out the storm in a harbor town
Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a beautiful home
I won't call
Know you're waiting right outside
Thanks for the ride
Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a beautiful home
I won't call
No, you're waiting right outside

I'm letting balloons drift off
Tiny gifts to a lonely God
Darling please wake up
I'm letting balloons drift off
Tiny gifts to a lonely God
If you see her, tell her I'm not giving up
(See her, tell her I'm not giving up)

Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a beautiful home
I won't call
Know you're waiting right outside
Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a beautiful home
I won't call
Know you're waiting right outside
Thanks for the ride
Hey Hannah, don't go
We could've given you such a beautiful home
I won't call
Know you're waiting right outside
