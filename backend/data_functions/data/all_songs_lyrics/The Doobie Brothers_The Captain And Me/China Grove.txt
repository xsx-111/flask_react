China Grove LyricsWhen the sun comes up on a sleepy little town
Down around San Antone
And the folks are risin' for another day
Roundabout their homes
The people of the town are strange
And they're proud of where they came
Well, you're talkin bout China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh
Well, the preacher and the teacher
Lord, they're a caution
They are the talk of the town
When the gossip gets to flyin'
And they ain't lyin'
When the sun goes fallin' down
They say that the father's insane
And dear Mrs. Perkins a game
We're talkin' 'bout the China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh
But every day there's a new thing comin'
The ways of an Oriental view
The sheriff and his buddies
With their samurai swords
You can even hear the music at night
And though it's a part of the Lone Star State
People don't seem to care
They just keep on lookin to the East
Talkin bout the China Grove (China)
Oh-oh-oh, China Grove, oh-oh-oh1Embed
