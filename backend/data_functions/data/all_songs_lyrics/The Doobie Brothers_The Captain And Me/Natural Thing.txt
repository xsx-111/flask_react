Natural Thing LyricsPeople outside my window
Going everywhere
People that are happy
People without a care
We all got to be loved
It's a natural thing, don't you know
The sooner we find what we need
Gonna be feeling it, happy to show
I'm gonna change my method
Get me a big ham bone
Gonna make all the leaders of the country
Get it together and bring it on home
We all got to be loved
It's a natural thing, don't you know
The sooner we find what we need
Gonna be feeling it, happy to show
Those men in the circus
Those men on the wire
Their feet hanging fifty feet up
Know they're counting on their daily luck
To bring them through the fire
We all got to be loved
It's a natural thing, don't you know
The sooner we find what we need
Gonna be feeling it, happy to show
Those men in the circus
Those men on the wire
Their feet hanging fifty feet up
Know they're counting on their daily luck
To bring them through the fireEmbed
