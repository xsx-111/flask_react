South City Midnight Lady LyricsUp all night, I could not sleep
The whiskey that I drank was cheap
With shakin' hands I went and I lit up my last cigarette
Well the sun came, the night had fled
And sleepy-eyed I reached my bed
I saw you sleepy dreamin' there all covered and warm
South City midnight lady
I'm much obliged, indeed
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
I thought there was no reason
For all these things I do
But the smile that I sent out returned with you
When day has left the night behind
And shadows roll across my mind
I sometimes find myself alone, out walking the streets
Yes, and when I'm feeling down and blue
Then all I do is think of you
And all my foolish problems seem to fade away
South City midnight lady
I'm much obliged, indeed
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
I thought there was no reason
For all these things I do
But the smile that I sent out returned with you
South City midnight lady
I'm much obliged, indeed
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
I thought there was no reason
For all these things I do
Yeah, but the smile that I sent out returned with you1Embed
