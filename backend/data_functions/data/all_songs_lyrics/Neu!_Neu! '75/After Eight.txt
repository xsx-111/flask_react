After Eight LyricsHelp me through the night, help to see it all
Help me, help me, help ho-ho, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me see the sun, help me to get up
Help me see the sun, help me to get up
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me see the sun, help me to get up
Help me see the sun, help me to know how to get up
Help me through the night, help to see it all
Help me, help me, help ho-ho, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me see the sun, help me see the sun
Help me see the sun, help me to get up
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me to get up, help me see the sun
Help me see the sun, help me to get up
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me through the night, help me through the night
Help me see the sun, help me to get up
Help me see the sun, help me to get upEmbed
