Hero LyricsBack to Norway
Back to Norway
And you're just another hero riding through the night
Riding through the city
Honey went to Norway, to Norway
And you're just another hero riding through the night
Riding through the city, trying to lose your mind
Oh, another hero, another hero
And you're just another hero trying to lose your mind
Riding through the city, trying to lose your mind
Your Honey went to Norway, hero, hero
And your only friend is music
And you're just another hero riding through the night
Riding through the city, trying to lose your mind
Oh hero, hero, hero
Oh, riding through the night
Riding through the city, trying to lose your mind
And your Honey went to Norway, you're gonna stay
Oh yeah
And your friend is music, I tell you 
Your only friend is music, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hero
And you're just another hero riding through the night
Riding through the city, trying to lose your mind, oh yeah
Honey went to Norway, fuck the press
Fuck the program, fuck the press
Fuck the company, fuck the company
Your only friend is money
Oh, and you're just another hero riding through the night
Riding through the city, trying to lose your mind
And your Honey went to Norway
And your only friend is music, I tell you 
Your only friend's misusing, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh hero
You wanna live, you wanna die
You wanna run, you wanna fly
You wanna love, wanna fly
Hero
And you're just another hero
And you're just another hero
Just another hero
Just another hero
And you're just another hero3Embed
