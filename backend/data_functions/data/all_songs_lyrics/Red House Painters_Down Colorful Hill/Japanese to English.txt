Japanese to English LyricsI went as far as losing sleep
I went as far as messing up my life
Unloving still strike me different
A million miles away from home
And fifteen from a payphone
Where we sat lonely on the sand
Where we sat lonely on the sand
Where we sat lonely on the sand
Where we sat lonely on the sand
You're ten years older
We translate Japanese to English
And English to Japanese
It's not that simple
This dictionary never has a word
For the way I'm feeling
It's nothing plain for me
Of a different god and moral
What if I laid my head down on your stomach
And put my mouth to your hand
I cannot translate
Japanese to English
Or English to Japanese
What I had to say is unsaid
What I had to do is undone
And if it was done
I'm sure it would have killed our hour
Where we sat lonely on the sand
Where we sat lonely on the sand
Where we sat lonely on the sand
Where we sat lonely on the sand
Above the water the awful gray
Our current from Japan
Didn't sweep away1Embed
