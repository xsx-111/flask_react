Down Colorful Hill LyricsOut of the box, down colorful hill
Out of the box, down colorful hill
Winds lifting tired feet, skin sensing challenge ahead
Winds lifting tired feet, skin sensing challenge ahead
Prayers, prayers for success
Prayers, answer, prayers, always die in time
Losing the dream, face to face sleeping
Losing the dream, open mouth breathing
Where unadmired beings dread the due changes ahead
Where unadmired beings dread the due changes ahead
Prayers, prayers for success
Prayers, prayers, always die in time
Prayers for success
Prayers, answer, prayers, always die in time
Prayers
Prayers
Like empty roofs above, life for poor doves
Like empty roofs above rid of our love
Like empty roofs above, life for poor doves
Like empty roofs above rid of our love
Like empty roofs above, life for poor doves
Like empty roofs above rid of our love
Like empty roofs above, life for poor doves
Like empty roofs above rid of our love
Like empty roofs above, life for poor doves
Like empty roofs above rid of our loveEmbed
