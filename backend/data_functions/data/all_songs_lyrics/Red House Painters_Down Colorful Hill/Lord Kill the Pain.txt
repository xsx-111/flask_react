Lord Kill the Pain LyricsLord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Don't want to ask you again
Kill my girlfriend
And kill my best friend Sam
'Cause I saw them making eyes again
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Don't want to ask you again
Kill my neighbors
And all my family too
They doubt my direction
Lord let it rain
Lord let it rain
Lord let it rain forever
Lord let it rain
Don't want to ask you again
Drown my country
Drown everyone but me
So I can live peacefully
Or put me to sleep here
And wake me in Japan
I want to speak a new language
Drop me a line and pull me out
But do not find me
Amongst dead underground
Let me hear the whining sound
Of a pig drown
And lead me over summery hill
To a place I like to think about
And sedate me with Tylenol pills
Oh how I love to dream about
Drop me a line and pull me out
But do not find me
Amongst life on the ground
Let me see the burning down
Of my home town
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the pain
Lord kill the painEmbed
