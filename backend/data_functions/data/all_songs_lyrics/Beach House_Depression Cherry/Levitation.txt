Levitation LyricsYou and me with our long hair on the gold wall
After midnight we could feel it all
I'd go anywhere you want me to
You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
(When the train comes I will hold you)
Cause you blow my mind
On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
(When the unknown will surround you)
There is no right time
There is no right time
The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get over it
The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you (Were you high)
When they knocked on the door looking for you…
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you (Were you high)
When they knocked on the door looking for you…
When the unknown will surround you (take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you10Embed
