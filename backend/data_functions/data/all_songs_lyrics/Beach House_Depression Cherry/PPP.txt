PPP Lyrics
Out in the heartland
I looked in your eyes
And I asked, "Are you ready
Ready for this life?"

Did you see it coming?
It happened so fast
The timing was perfect
Water on glass

Like tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, oh well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake

Between the cities
Between the thrills
There's something inside you
That doesn't sleep well

It won't last forever
Or maybe it will
The white clothes they gave you
You wear them so well
Someone once told me
In love, that you must
Place all you're given
In infinite trust

Yet I'm tracing figure eights
On ice in skates, so well
And if this ice should break
It would be my mistake17Embed
