10:37 Lyrics
Chances are
Like night you’ll disappear
Caught in the atmosphere

Where you go
She casts no shadow
Still you know she's near
L–

Here she comes
All parts of everything
Stars in the motherhand

With the dark thunder
Above you
Come to us soaring
L–a–i–
Chances are
10:37
House made of the dawn
