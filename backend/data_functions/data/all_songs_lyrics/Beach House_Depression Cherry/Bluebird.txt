Bluebird Lyrics
Light that comes up
On the ceiling
My mouth
And these arms
Hold the feeling
Even I can't control my nature

If they should come up much before you
I would not ever try to capture you

Bluebird, where you gonna go now?

Lead me to the gallows
Where out corner my eye
There's something
It's pulling me back from nothing
From nothing

If they should come up much before you
I would not ever try to capture you
Bluebird, where you gonna go now?

Scenes change
Before they are over
Before they are over3Embed
