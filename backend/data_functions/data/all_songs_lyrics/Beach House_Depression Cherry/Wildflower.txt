Wildflower LyricsNo better color
Looked everywhere
We're driving home every night
The shadows stay by your side
You built a city
All in your head
Triangle of ever light
It turns you on every night
Need a companion
A hidden prayer
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
Baby I'm yours
No better color
Look everywhere
You built a city
All in your head
You know you're not losing your mind
What’s left you make something of it
The sky and what's left above it
The way you want nothing of it
