The City Lyrics
Going to stay out of New York
There's something there that drives me crazy
No I won't go back
There's something there that bleeds me dry
It gets so bad that I stop breathing
And then the sun don't want to shine
There's something wrong with New York
It's a prison without walls
No I won't go back there
I just don't like that place at all
Now you might call it sophistication

I said i won't go back to New York
There's a darkness all around
No, I just can't handle it
You know that place is getting me down
You can say it's sophistication
But I say time is running outEmbed
