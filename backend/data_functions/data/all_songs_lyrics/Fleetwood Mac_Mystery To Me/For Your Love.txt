For Your Love Lyrics
(For your love)
I'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
(For your love)
I'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night

For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

For your love, for your love
I would give you stars above
For your love, for your love
I'd give the stars if they were mine to give (For your love)


I'd give the stars if they were mine to give
(For your love)
I'd give the moon every day that I live
(For your love)
To thrill you with delight, I'd bring you diamonds bright
(For your love)
Everything that will excite
Make you dream of me at night
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your loveEmbed
