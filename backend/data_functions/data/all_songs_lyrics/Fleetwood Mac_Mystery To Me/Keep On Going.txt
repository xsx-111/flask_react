Keep On Going Lyrics
For a little peace in any season
I'd give up anything but your love
I don't want to trade, trying to be happy
That's only playing anyway
But if I dream about it, it makes me wonder
For every good thing, must you get bad
But I won't worry, and if I'm living on borrowed time
I'm gonna keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm going
For every crime, there's retribution
And every valley has a mountainside
No, I don't like to trade just to be happy
That kind of deal won't turn out right

See it is no good to stare inside yourself too long
For every true thing there's one more lie
But I won't worry cause if I'm living on borrowed time
I'll just try to keep on the way I'm going
Keep on the way I'm goingEmbed
