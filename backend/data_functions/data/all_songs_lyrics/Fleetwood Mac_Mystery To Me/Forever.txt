Forever Lyrics
I like the way the light falls today
Slow, too lazy for anything
I see boats that go sailing past me (But not too fast)
You know, I wish this day could keep on going and last forever
Please don't fool around with my happiness
I like the way the light falls today
Please just let it stay that way
Forever and ever and ever and ever

Dont fool around
Please don't fool around with my happinessEmbed
