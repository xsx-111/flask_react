Wonder Boy (Bonus Track) LyricsWonder boy, life's just begun
Turn your sorrow into wonder
Dream alone, don't sigh, don't groan
Life is only what you wonder
Day is as light as your brightest dreams
Night is as dark as you feel it ought to be
Time is as fast as the slowest thing
Life is only
Wonder boy, wonder boy
Everybody's looking for the sun
People strain their eyes to see
But I see you and you see me
And ain't that wonder?
Wonder boy, some mother's son
Life is full of work and plunder
Easy go, life is not real
Life is only what you conjure
Wonder boy and the world is joy
Every single day
It's the Real McCoy, wonder boy
Everybody is looking for the sun
People strain their eyes to see
But I see you and you see me
And ain't that wonder?
Wonder boy, some mother's son
Turn your sorrow into wonder
Dream alone, go have your fun
Life is only, life is only, life is onlyEmbed
