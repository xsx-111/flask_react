Some People Say LyricsWe’re on our way headed for the sunshine
I’ve got you and a bottle of wine
You played a song to me
It has a hidden meaning
You said you’ve never been in love
And maybe I believe you sort of
I have a feeling that this day will be amazing
Some people say
The stars and planets make their way
Some things can never change
Some people believe
You wish on satellites for your dreams
I wish some things would stay the same
So i go to see my good friend
The one who sings in a riot grrrl band
The way she dances on the stage
It is so awesome
And all i think of is where you are
And if you’re traveling then how far
And when you listen to these songs
If you’re ever lonely
Some people say
The stars and planets make their way
Some things can never change
Some people believe
You wish on satellites for your dreams
I wish some things would stay the same
You’re not alone
You’re not alone
We’re on our way headed for the sunshine
I’ve got you and a bottle of wine
You played a song to me
It has a hidden meaning
You said you’ve never been in love
And maybe I believe you sort of
I have a feeling that this day will be amazingEmbed
