Europe LyricsThere’s a question i’ve been meaning to ask you
How do you feel about europe?
Does it surprise you on the continent you don’t feel the same?
Cuz i’ve been here for days
And i’ve never felt so poor
And i have no idea what i am looking for
But it feels like i made it
And before these memories faded
You will ask again if this is really happening
I just wanna be closer to you
And there’s nothing left we need to prove
You said this is life and this is living
This is life and this is living
You haven’t felt this way since 1998
Dreamed of planes that would take you away
You were lost then and you were still just a kid
It didn’t turn out the way you expected
When i pick you up off the floor
Because you’re what i came here for
And it feels like you made it
And before these memories faded
You will ask again if this is really happening
I just want to be closer to you
And there’s nothing left we need to prove
You said this life and this is living
This is life and this is living
And i’ll remember these nights always
And i’ll remember these nights always
And i’ll remember these nights always
And i’ll remember them
And i’ll remember them
And how it feels like i made it
And before these memories faded
You will ask again if this is really happening
I just wanna be closer to you
And there’s nothing left we need to prove
You said this is life and this is living
This is life and this is livingEmbed
