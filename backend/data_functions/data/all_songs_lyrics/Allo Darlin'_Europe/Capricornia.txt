Capricornia LyricsCould you ever understand how you ended up here?
Any friend you've ever had has disappeared
And the tug of a heart string is the line that pulls you home
You bear witness to the ones you used to know
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
I will come to you when you fall down
And when the lights go out
And we will set the world to rights
When I find you under Capricornia skies
Don't you wanna be someone you've got to let it go
If we stay here, we'll be over before we know
And the shadow of the mid day sun burns beneath your feet
And the old dogs are still sleeping in the street
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
I will come to you when you fall down
And when the lights go out
And we will set the world to rights
When I find you under Capricornia skies
You ask more questions than you answer
It pulls me out and I go with the tide
And you tilt my world on its axis
Every time I look into your eyes
You say the things you love are the things you never had
And when you hold them they pass through your hands like sand
Well, I have made promises too that I could never hold
And underneath the Southern Cross these histories fold
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
And I keep having these dreams
I will come to you when you fall down
And when the lights go out
And we will set the world to rights
When I find you under Capricornia skiesEmbed
