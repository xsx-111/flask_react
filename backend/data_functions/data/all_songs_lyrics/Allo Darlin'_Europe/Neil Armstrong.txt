Neil Armstrong LyricsHeard you say "They didn't put a man on the moon
We just needed someone to prove all this floating's worth doing"
Then why did you say that you miss a simpler time
Well so do I and I find myself pining for you
And these days can a question be asked
When the hero comes in last, who is winning?
Well I am tired of feeling confused
And lest my words be misconstrued
I can't separate what's real
But I know that I believe in you
There you go out on the pavement walking alone
They could name a star after you and you'd still be complaining
And now it's clear
Now that you know why I wanted you here
There's a southern constellation that shines with your name on it
And I won't fly until the day that I die
But we can't keep out dreams in jars
So I'll keep yours close to mine
Well I am tired of feeling confused
And lest my words be misconstrued
I can't separate what's real
But I know that I believe in you
Well I am tired of feeling confused
And lest my words be misconstrued
I can't separate what's real
But I know that I believe in you
Darling, I believe in youEmbed
