Wonderland LyricsOn a blustery winter day
On a crowded underground train
We had the numbers
Holding the cards closer than ever
You could avoid those eyes forever
If you just try it
Lost to the city
Will I ever see your face again?
Lost to the party
It's a wonderland we're livin in
(Chorus)
And I'm not sayin' I'm waiting for a star sign
But you are on your way to being left behind....left behind...left behind
February rain is washing all our days away and you feel tired
And the puddles at your feet shine the traffic light
Wishes that you keep and you feel lucky
We could be lions and I'd protect you in our den
We could be polar bears and I would hunt you 'til the end
(chorus)
Feel like the world is ending and I'm with you and I don't care (x4)Embed
