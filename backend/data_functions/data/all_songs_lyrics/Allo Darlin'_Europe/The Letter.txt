The Letter LyricsFrom behind the dirty window
Looking out onto the frozen sea of Sweden
Dreaming of ice skating
On the back of a 2-for-1
I wrote you a letter
Taking for granted where we've been
We found solace in the shattered dreams of England
And we can't help the things we choose
And I pictured you singing the Silver Jews
I still wear my grandma's ring
And you sometimes will wear your granddad's tie
These days it's hard not to measure by what you've lost but what you can find
You said it's hard to believe
In the age of aeroplanes and miracles
But that kind of brightness never appealed to me
And I was already headed to the dance floor
And if I told you
I was never cool
And all I wanted
Was just to have you
And when I see you
I will put my arm around you
It will be hard to let you go
And If I told you
I was never cool
And all I wanted
Was just to have you
And when I see you
I will put my arm around you
It will be hard to let you go
And it'll be hard to let you goEmbed
