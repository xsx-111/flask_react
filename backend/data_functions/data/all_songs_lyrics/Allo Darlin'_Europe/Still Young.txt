Still Young LyricsWalkin’ hard look away
You’ve got a lot to give the world
But you wish you were old
And these days are cold enough
There’s a lot of fear around
Makes you wish you weren’t born
And you kinda figured
If you fight the good fight you’ll end up with a prize
And you always were impressed
With the ways that you surf
With the ways that you wanted to sing
And I cannot explain why I haven’t been feeling myself
These expectations taking hold
And pinned my back against the wall
But I’m not like them, I’m like you
And we’re not done ‘cos we’re still young!
And you thought I couldn’t see
When the lights were so bright that they had blinded me
And did you think I’d left behind
Those nights we lost
But I think of them all the time, all the time!
And if we carry on like this
We’ll have no choice but to drink so much harder
And do you know how it feels
To be lost in the crush when you feel so down at heel
And I cannot explain why I haven’t been feeling myself
These expectations taking hold
And pinned my back against the wall
But I’m not like them, I’m like you
And we’re not done ‘cos we’re still young!
And when I see you from the bus
It’s my heart that stops
And when I leave you in the station
I just wanna say
Hey baby, take me home
I feel so cold, and you’re so warm
Let’s bring it back
Let’s bring it back
Let’s bring it back
Let’s bring it back
Let’s bring it back (let’s bring it back)
Let’s bring it back (let’s bring it back)
Let’s bring it back (let’s bring it back)
Let’s bring it back (let’s bring it back)
‘Cos we’re still young (we’re still young)
‘Cos we’re still young (we’re still young)
‘Cos we’re still young (we’re still young)
‘Cos we’re still young (we’re still young)
‘Cos we’re still young (we’re still young)
‘Cos we’re still young (we’re still young)
‘Cos we’re still young (we’re still young)
‘Cos we’re still youngEmbed
