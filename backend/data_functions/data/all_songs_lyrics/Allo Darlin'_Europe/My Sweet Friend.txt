My Sweet Friend LyricsMy sweet friend and I go to the park
On the day a famous pop star died
And we stayed there until after dark
And happiness is an open box
And I was only dreaming of how
I will bring you to my love
Taken squinting at the camera
The lense is getting so much alpine
That we can look forever and
Bells ring out over an open field
And I was only dreaming of how
I will bring you to my love
You said
A record is not just a record
Records can hold memories
All these records sound the same to me
And I'm full up with memory
A record is not just a record
Records can hold memories
All these records sound the same to me
And I'm full up with memory
And I'm not wrong and
Maybe I'm not right
Can I call you up
When I can not get to sleep tonight
And I'm not wrong and
Maybe I'm not right
Can I call you up
When I can not get to sleep tonight
And I'm not wrong and
Maybe I'm not right
Can I call you up
When I can not get to sleepEmbed
