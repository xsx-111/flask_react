Atlantic City LyricsWell, they blew up the Chicken Man in Philly last night
And they blew up his house, too
On the boardwalk they're getting ready for a fight
See what them racket boys can do
There's trouble busting in from out of state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gambling commission's barely hanging on
Baby, everything dies, honey, that's a fact
Maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put my makeup on, and wear my hair up pretty
And I'll meet you tonight in Atlantic City
Well, I got a job and put my money away
But I've got debts that no honest man can pay
I drew what I had from the Central Trust
I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
Baby, everything dies, sugar, that's a fact
Baby, everything that dies one day comes back
Put my makeup on, and put my hair up pretty
And I'll meet you tonight in Atlantic City
Our luck may have died and our love may be cold
But with you forever I'll stay
We're going out where the sand's turning to gold
I'll pull my stockings up, baby, 'cause the night's getting cold
And maybe everything dies, honey, that's a fact
Maybe everything that dies one day comes back
Well, I'm looking for a job but it's hard to find
It's just winners and losers and I'm stuck on the wrong side of that line
I'm tired of coming out on the losing end
Last night I met this guy, I'll do a favor for him
Baby, everything dies, honey, that's a fact
Maybe everything that dies one day comes back
Put my makeup on, and wear my hair up pretty
I'll meet you tonight in Atlantic City
I'll meet you tonight in Atlantic City
I'll meet you tonight in Atlantic CityEmbed
