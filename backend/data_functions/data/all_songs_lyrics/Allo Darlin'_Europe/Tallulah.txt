Tallulah LyricsOn a drive from St Lucia to Surfers
In my old university car
We had the windows down for our air con'
The door was so hot that you burned your arm
It was the tail end of a summer
And the heat washed in with the breeze
And you were searching for something to sing to
As the radio played another terrible song
But lucky for me, you found the tape with Tallulah on
And it's been a long time
Since I've seen all my old friends
But I really love my new friends
I feel I've known them a long while
Then last summer you wrote me a letter
On the back of a surf magazine
You said you didn't have any paper
And maybe you wondered what could have been
So I sent you a postcard from Berlin of a fat man eating a sausage
It hid the fact that I was hiding
As the DJ played another terrible song
But lucky for us, we found a bar with the Maytals on
And it's been a long time
Since I've seen all my old friends
But I really love my new friends
I feel I've known them a long while
I'm wondering if I've already heard all the songs that'll mean something
And I'm wondering if I've already met all the people that'll mean something
But I find myself daydreaming of the places where we used to stay
We used to brush them away
St Kilda, Coolangatta, Bondi Beach and Coogee Bay
I like the sound of their names
And I wonder if you would wanna go there with me
When I'm finished over here
If you're not finished with meEmbed
