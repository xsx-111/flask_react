Lola LyricsShe lives alone
Lola
But every night she goes down
To the Chinese where
She works very hard there
Sipping her cocktails
Expenses paid
Lola
She is performing
For a cause
Her glances faking
A deep fascination
She wants information
She goes upstairs
Lola
Clinging on to
Another man
She lays him down, down
Almond eyes on fire
Seducing his mind
Behind the smoke and
Screens, ah
Lola is a
Private eye
She well disguises
Her lingering actions
No one suspecting
At the Chinese
Lola
Killed all those
Who did her wrong
Her soul is blazing
With blood thirsty craving
No one objectingEmbed
