Lycee LyricsI was looking through
Through the, the window pane
Tears of rain ran down
And blurred a sight so bad
Revolution now
Somehow, I feel afraid
I, I heard her cry
Out loud, echoes insane
She fell to the ground
Her hand reached out in vain
Young, Lycee was young
But now, oh there she lay
Who will call her name
Victim of blood red flame
She, a living sun
Will not come back again
I, I saw her face
Through the, the window pane
I, still hear her cry
I feel, I want to die
I, I saw her face
Through the, the window pane
I, still hear her cry
I feel I want to dieEmbed
