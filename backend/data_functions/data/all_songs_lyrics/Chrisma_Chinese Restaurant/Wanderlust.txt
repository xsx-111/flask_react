Wanderlust LyricsGot the wanderlust
You go to the airport
And see a plane take off
Go to England
Or take a trip by sea
And get off, where you want to get off
Write to the boy
Next door, who always wants
To do, what you're just about to do
Tell him that
You like New York City
I'm sure he'll like it too
You say you like your nation
So let's take a long vacation
Tell your navigator
To wait downstairs
With his white gloves on
Tell him to
Zip up your bag
With his white gloves on
Take your diamond
So if you've got the money left
You can always sell it
Here I come
Get ready
Get set fire go, go, go, go, go
You say you like your nation
So let's take a long vacation
My transfer agent
Sends me where I
Where I want to go
That's a fact
He thinks I'm great
'Cos I treat him like dirt, like dirt
He does me favours
But I could do with
Even better ones
They call him sticky
'Cos I treat him like dirt
Like dirt, like dirt
You say you like your nation
So let's take a long vacation
Your transit airman
Is heating up the engine
Clear your head
Go out and get it
Instead of watching T.V
And stagnating in your bed
By the window
Thinking of the next record
That you're going to buy
You like Maurice
With his safety pin
So it's gonna be a Punk one
You say you like your nation
So let's take a long vacation
Got the wanderlust
It's time to go
And do, what you've decided to do
Go to Milan
Or if not just you take a bike
To see a sight
I feel free
You feel free
And how about the boy next door
Tell him that
You like New York
I'm sure he'll like it too
You say you like your nation
So let's take a long vacationEmbed
