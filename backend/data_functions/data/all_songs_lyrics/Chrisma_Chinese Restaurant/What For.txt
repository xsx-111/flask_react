What For LyricsWhat for
She likes the way you bore
What for
Her foot's inside the door
What for
She'll push you to the floor
What for
She loves the way you bore
What for
She likes the way you go
What for
Her answer's never no
What for
She likes to take you so
What for
She loves you when you're low
What for
She likes to make you sigh
What for
She seems to get you high
What for
She's got to get some more
What for
She loves the way you bore
What for
She never did before
What for
She likes the way you know
What for
She likes it very slow
What for
Your mind's about to blow
What for
And you're just going to ow!
Got it
Got it
Got it
What for
She likes the way you bore
What for
She loves the way you bore
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it
What for
We're getting to the core
What for, we like the way we boreEmbed
