Black Silk Stocking LyricsSensitive her feeling, when she's Waking in the morning
Black silk stocking Black silk stocking
Put your hand inside it, and she'll tell you where to find it
Black silk stocking Black silk stocking
And when she is not talking, be sure she wants some rockin'
Black silk stocking Black silk stocking
If you're not into rockin' you're best to keep on walking
Black silk stocking Black silk stocking
You think she's going to leave you, but she only wants to see you
In her, black silk stocking Black silk stocking
Lutting instigation, her spell is captivating
Black silk stocking Black silk stocking
Provoking whip, lash lash, please stop smoking
Black silk stocking Black silk stocking
Ho baby, baby no-ones loving, your degeneration
Black silk stocking Black silk stocking
Oh baby, no-ones loving, your degeneration
Black silk stocking Black silk stockingEmbed
