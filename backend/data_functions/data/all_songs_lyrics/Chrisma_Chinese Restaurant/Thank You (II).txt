Thank You (II) LyricsWe would like to thank:
Mr. King: for the wonderful chinese food
Moira: for lending us coffee
Yannis: for inviting us to pay for meals
The Japs: for inventing the American finger tip orchestra
The traffic warden: for the 52 parking tickets
The Queen: for her Silver Jubilee...
Romeo Ongarello: for International telecomunications
The Publishers: for allowing us to earn 50% OF OUR RIGHTS
And to everyone else we have forgotten in words but not in thought...Embed
