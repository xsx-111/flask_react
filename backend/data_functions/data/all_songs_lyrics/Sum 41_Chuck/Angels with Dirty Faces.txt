Angels with Dirty Faces Lyrics
I need this to get me through, can't resist, don't want to
Believe it, I know it's true, can't beat it, don't want to try

Perfect hell! It's more to me than you ever will know
Down here where the rest of us fell
Waste away with nothing left to show
While I'm in this perfect hell

Obsession has begun, possessed by destruction
How did I get so low, believe me, no one knows
Sometimes I can't hold on, and no one can help me

Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
I don't think I can make it through this
Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
The less I do, the more it makes no sense

I'm walking pollution who's drained by delusions
On the verge of destruction I cave in to abduction
Thin blood I'm bleeding my pulse won't stop racing
Just as my heart explodes
No chance that I could win, too hard to not give in
I just don't feel the same, cause I'm the one to blame
Sometimes I can't hold on, and no one can help me

Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
I don't think I can make it through this
Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
The less I do, the more it makes no sense

I need this to be myself, it feels like I need some help
It's too late to save myself or it's just in my head

Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
I don't think I can make it through this
Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
The less I do, the more it makes no sense
Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
I don't think I can make it through this
Now it's got a hold of me (hold of me!)
The less I do, the more it makes no sense4Embed
