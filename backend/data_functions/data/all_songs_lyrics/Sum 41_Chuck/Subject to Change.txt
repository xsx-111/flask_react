Subject to Change Lyrics
How can we fake this, and take anymore
Looking up blindly and try to ignore?
It's better to miss it, there's no point of view
It's only a problem when it happens to you

Well, thanks for making this so easy
What's the point if it's so easy?
Why the fuck is it so easy?
Why's it, don't you say?

'Cause we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
And we'll be just fine, 'cause we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

Lies in the sender when nothing is true
Don't be surprised when it comes back to you
Are you on a mission to lose all control
Or waiting for tragedy to unfold?

What makes you think that it's so easy
Don't believe it will be so easy
Why the fuck would it be so easy
Why's it, don't you say?
'Cause we're doing fine and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
And we'll be just fine, 'cause we won't be bought and sold
Just like you

So how long has this gone, I don't see this ending
It's too late, we can't change what has now begun
We act like it's not right, why are we pretending?
We've been wrong for so long, we've known this all along

You created these problems, and you don't know what to do
You know you can solve them, but you can't be bothered to
You created these problems, and you don't know what to do
You know you can solve them, but you can't be bothered to

'Cause we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you
And we'll be just fine, 'cause we won't be bought and sold
Just like you!Embed
