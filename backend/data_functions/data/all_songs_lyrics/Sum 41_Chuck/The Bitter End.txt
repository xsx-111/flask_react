The Bitter End Lyrics

There's no doubt in my mind, when it's over, what is done will be
You will find when life gets colder, there's no sympathy

There's no point trying you can't escape the bitter end
Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end


All your choices chosen, you've got no say, your decision's made
Face your consequences as your life begins to fade

As time keeps spinning closer to the bitter end
Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end


Take a look at yourself, time keeps racing it's all you've come to be
What you expected or are you still chasing possibilities
Because all your prayers won't save you from the bitter end
Well, who will greet you when you're at the bitter end!
The bitter end!
The bitter end!
