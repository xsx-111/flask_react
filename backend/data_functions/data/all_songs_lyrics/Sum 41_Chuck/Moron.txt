Moron Lyrics
It's hard enough to even fake a smile
Disillusion, I'm in denial
There's something missing, 'cause I can't feel a thing
I'm desensitized

You can fake this, and I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough, I can't ignore
You can fake this, and I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough, I can't ignore anymore

All this confusion is running deep inside my head
How long can I keep this up before I end up dead?

I can't believe that it could come to this
It's only feelings so I can't resist
I'm falling deeper in denial
But I still try to believe in something

You can fake this, and I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough, I can't ignore
You can fake this, and I can't take anymore
I'm not so tough, I can't ignore anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore...Embed
