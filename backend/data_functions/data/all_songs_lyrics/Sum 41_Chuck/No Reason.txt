No Reason Lyrics
All of us believe that this is not up to you!
The fact of the matter is that it's up to me!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let's go!

How can we fake this anymore? (Anymore)
To turn our backs away and choose to just ignore
(Choose to just ignore)
(Some say!) Some say it's ignorance
It makes me feel some innocence
(Some say!) It takes away a part of me
That I won't let go of

Tell me, why can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?

Nothing could ever be this real (Be this real)
A life unsatisfied that I could never feel (I could never feel)
(Some say!) This future's not so bright
That some can't make the sacrifice (So bright!)
It's much more than just black and white
And I won't follow
Tell me, why can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?

Times like these, I've come to see how
Everything but time is running out
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
(What!) All of us believe in what we need
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
What we have's what we don't see

Tell me, why can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
When we all fall down, it will be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?

Can't you see it's not the way? (Not the way!)
(So how long, has this gone, I don't see this ending)
When we all fall down, it won't be too late
(It's too late, we can't change what has now begun)
Why is there no reason we can't change? (No reason!)
(We have time, it's not right, why are we pretending?)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame? Will it take?
(We fit along, for so long, we knew this all along)Embed
