Noots Lyrics
Today is too late, how long do we have to wait?
Oh no, I think she knows, that's why I can't let go
I feel this burning inside, a feeling that no one should know
This could be so good again, I'd wait here till then

But not with this
So now I'll leave with

No apologies
I never thought you'd be so easily deceived
Now I'll just hang my head (I'm falling further out of place)
Along with the dead (I don't know what I can't replace)

We're mad with regret, memories that we'll both forget
So far it's been so hard to cover up these scars
I see this falling apart, it's easy to just let it go
No luck between us both, so I keep waiting

But not with this
So now I'll leave with
No apologies
I never thought you'd be so easily deceived
Now I'll just hang my head (I'm falling further out of place)
Along with the dead (I don't know what I can't replace)

I'll just hang my head!

What's left to show? It's so bad, but I got to know
What's right? Don't know how to find it out on my own


One by one, we all fall down, but who's the first one to hit the ground now?
What's worse, to kick or fall, or be us, standing alone
I'll keep your promises if you take back everything I said
I find it's got so cold now that I've lost my heart and soul

No apologies
I never thought you'd be so easily deceived
Now I'll just hang my head (I'm falling further out of place)
Along with the dead (I don't know what I can't replace)
I'll just hang my head!
Hang my head!2Embed
