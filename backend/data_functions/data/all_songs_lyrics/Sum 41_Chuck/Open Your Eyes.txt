Open Your Eyes Lyrics
Lately, I'm not quite myself, maybe I do need some help
Just my confusion, trust my delusion
Don't you regret you met me, go through these steps to get me
Back to where we start, 'fore I fall apart

If I could black out, it'd become so clear
Standing face-to-face with everything I fear
Watch so closely, but still, I don't see
As bad as it seems, a piece of mind I steal
In ordinary life, the consequence is real
I'm past the point of reality

This isn't me, this isn't you, but it's just everything we do
'Til you open up your eyes and understand this isn't real
This isn't me, this isn't you, this is everything but true
'Til we come to realize it's what we put each other through

(Spent days without a trace and)
It's like a bad dream, that's becoming all too true
(I'm lost inside this place now)
Leaving me with nothing else left to do
Now so helpless, I'm not so selfish, tell me
How does it feel to have a face like that?
How does it feel to be replaced like that?
Now, so faceless, do you still feel?
This isn't me, this isn't you, but it's just everything we do
'Til you open up your eyes and understand this isn't real
This isn't me, this isn't you, this is everything but true
'Til we come to realize it's what we put each other through

It's hard to believe right now this seems to be real
Still phasing by this time, so why can't I wake up?


This isn't me, this isn't you, but it's just everything we do
'Til you open up your eyes and understand this isn't real
This isn't me, this isn't you, this is everything but true
'Til we come to realize it's what we put each other through1Embed
