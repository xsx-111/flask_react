Welcome to Hell Lyrics
Don't come to me with your problems, I don't need them
Your conscience is a weight that I won't hold
You'd rather be the only one who pretends
Is it 'cause you've been bought and sold so young?

Don't ask me questions, 'cause I don't got the answers
If you only knew what time will tell
It's all a test and lessons that you can't learn
You'll know when you spend your time in hell

So, as your blood's running thin, your time's running out
No one will be listening, not even when you shout
When your angels turn to devils, you'll finally figure out
That no one will be with you in the end

A hypocrite, you're just a contradiction
Wrapped up in your lies, who knows what's real?
Well, this is it, your lonely life of fiction
Do you even know how to feel?

So, as your blood's running thin, your time's running out
No one will be listening, not even when you shout
When your angels turn to devils, you'll finally figure out
That no one will be with you in the end

So, as your blood's running thin, your time's running out
No one will be listening, not even when you shout
When your angels turn to devils, you'll finally figure out
That no one will be with you in the end, the end, the end, the endEmbed
