88 Lyrics
Wait... how long would you wait just for me to call
I know you make mistakes yeah, but I hope someday you have it all

'Cause I feel like a prisoner trapped inside this broken world
While I'm playing the victim again running in circles
To me it's all the same, and though nothing's going to change
Still I hope someday you have it all


Take this aggravation that I've thrown myself into
Change this situation just cause I need something new

And still I feel like a prisoner trapped inside this broken world
While I'm playing the victim again running in circles
To me it's all the same, and though nothing's gonna change
Still I hope someday you have it all, I hope someday you have it all!


If we could all depend on what we know
If you could understand I'm losing control
That I'm losing control, that I'm losing control
That I'm losing control...2Embed
