Slipping Away Lyrics

I'm slipping away
In every way
I can't stay awake (and I don't know why)
I'm slipping away (and I don't know why)

I'm trying to make it through each day
I'm falling apart now in every way
I'm finding it harder to get by
There's a hole in my heart and I don't know why

Now I've come to realize I'm slipping away...
