Hot Stuff Lyrics

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff, gotta have some love tonight
(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin', gotta have love tonight (Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
Hot love, lookin' for hot love

Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
Hot, hot, hot

How's about some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'?
I need some hot stuff baby, tonight
Gimme a little hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Hot stuff, baby, gonna need your love tonight (Hot stuff)
I need hot love
Lookin' for hot stuff, wanna have hot love

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out, no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers lately
I'm bound to find somebody home
Gonna have some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
Lookin' for my hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Need some lovin', baby, gonna need your love tonight
Hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight, yeah, yeah
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I want some hot stuff, baby, tonight, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Hot stuff, baby
I need your hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want your hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Hot stuff, baby, gonna need your love tonight6Embed
