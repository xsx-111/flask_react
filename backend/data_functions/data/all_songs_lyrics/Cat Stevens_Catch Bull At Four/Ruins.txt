Ruins Lyrics
It's so quiet in the ruins
Walking though the old town
Stones crumbling under my feet
I see smoke for miles around
Oh, it's enough to make you weep
All that remains of the main street
Up in the park on Sunday
Dogs chasing and the children played

Old man with his head down
Can't see nothing more around, no
But he remembers how it used to be
Back in the old days

So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again
It's nice to see a friendly face
Come peeping through
Having tea In the afternoon, now
So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again

Ah, but it's all changed
Winter turned on a man
Came down on day
When no one was looking
And it stole away the land
People running scared, losing hands
Dodging shadows of falling sand
Buildings standing like empty shells
And nobody, helping no one else
Young child with his hands high
Ain't able to see no reason why, no
But he remembers how it used to be

So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again
It's nice to see a friendly face
Come peeping through
You'd better know
What you're going through now

You came back here to find
Your home is a black horizon
That you don't recognize
Evil destruction has taken everything
You'd better walk on the side
While you're still walking
Just keep on walking on
Down the street keep your distance
From the people you meet, oh, Lord
And you'd better watch your eyes
'Cause if smoke gets in them
Baby, you won't rise again
So nice to see you coming
Back in this town again
Where's it leading to?
Freedom at what cost?
People needing more and more
And it's all getting lost
I want back, I want back
Back to the time
When the earth was green
And there was no high walls
And the sea was clean

Don't stop that sun to shine
It's not yours or mine, noEmbed
