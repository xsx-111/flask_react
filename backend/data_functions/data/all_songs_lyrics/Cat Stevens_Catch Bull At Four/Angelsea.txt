Angelsea LyricsShe moves like an angel
And seven evening stars
Dance through the windows
Of her universal house
Of her universal house
Her voice, a crystal echo
Lies humming in your soul
So patiently awaiting
For your ears to behold
For your ears to behold
She ripples on the water
Leaves diamonds on the shore
And fish from every distance
Watch her ocean cellar door
Her breath, a warm fire
In every lovers heart
A mistress to magicians
And a dancer to the Gods
And a dancer to the Gods
Her clothes are made of rainbows
And twenty thousand tears
Shine through the spaces
Of her golden ocher hair
Yes, of her golden ocher hair
My babe, I want you
And on my life, I swear
My conscience will follow you forever
If you meet me everywhere
Yes, if you meet me everywhere
She moves like an angel
And seven evening stars
Dance through the windows
Of her universal house
Yes, of her universal house
Of her universal houseEmbed
