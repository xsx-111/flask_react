18th Avenue (Kansas City Nightmare) Lyrics
Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
The path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue

And it stung my tongue to repeat the words
That I used to use only yesterday
Meanings just dropped to the ground
I tried to remember what I thought
And what I used to say
"Don't let me go down"
No don't let me go

Oh my hands were tied as I struggled inside
The empty waste of another day
Memories were blank to my eyes
The fire and the glory of that night
Seemed safely locked away
Too hungry to rise
Oh, too hungry to

Well I rode a while, for a mile or so
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue
And the people I saw were the people I know
And they all came down to take a view
The path was dark and borderless
Down the road to the eighteenth avenue

But my head felt better as I turned the car
And the airport slowly came in view
One mile said the sign
Oh I checked my bags
And made it straight to End Gate 22
Made it just in time
Boy you made it just in timeEmbed
