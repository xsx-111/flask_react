The Boy With a Moon and Star On His Head Lyrics
A gardener's daughter stopped me on my way
On the day I was to wed
It is you who I wish to share
My body with she said

We'll find a dry place under the sky
With a flower for a bed
And for my joy I will give you a boy
With a moon and star on his head.

Her silver hair flowed in the air
Laying waves across the sun
Her hands were like the white sands
And her eyes had diamonds on

We left the road and headed up
To the top of the whisper wood
And we walked till we came to where
The holy magnolia stood

And there we laid cool in the shade
Singing songs and making love
With the naked earth beneath us
And the universe above
The time was late my wedding wouldn't wait
I was sad but I had to go
So while she was asleep
I kissed her cheek for cheerio

The wedding took place and people came
From many miles around
There was plenty merriment
Cider and wine abound

But out of all that I recall
I remembered the girl I met
'Cause she had given me something
That my heart could not forget

La la la la la la
La-la-la la la la
La-la-la-la-laa la-laa
La-laa la-laaa

A year had passed and everything was just
As it was a year before, as if was a year before
Until the gift that someone left
A basket by my door
And in there lay
The fairest little baby crying to be fed
I got down on my knees and kissed
The moon and star on his head

As years went by the boy grew high
And the village looked on in awe
They'd never seen anything like the boy
With the moon and star before

And people would ride from far and wide
Just to seek the word he spread
I'll tell you everything I've learned
And love is all, he said

La la la la, la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la, la la la la, la la la
La-la-la, la la, la la la laEmbed
