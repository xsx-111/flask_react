World Keeps Going Around Lyrics
Looking at the pictures of the places that he's been
Old man told me what he found
Said it don't make no difference whether you're out or whether you're in
You know the world keeps going around and around
Going around and around

Said he looked at the places, talk to the faces that he seen
Then he turned the pictures upside down
Said it don't make no difference how many places that you've been
Said the world keeps going around and around
Going around and around

Then he put up the pictures shook his head and with a grin
He talked about his ups and downs
Said it don't make no difference how many fixes you've been in
You know the world keeps going around and around
Going around and around

Betty Joe Johnson
Don't you pull no Daisy Mae on me
Daisy Mae, she did me dirty
So I had to leave her for Anna Lee
Anna Lee, she had big street feet
She spends her nights out on the road
So I started seeing Sally Jackson
I had to let old Anna Lee go
Sally Jackson was a player
Had another man along with me
So I just took me one step backwards
Checked up on old Anna Lee
Anna Lee still had them street feet
Like to dance all night and sleep all day
So I just took one more step backwards
Checked up on old Daisy Mae
Daisy Mae is still doing dirty
So I tell you what I had to do
I had to go just one step further
Betty Joe Johnson
And that's how I know you
Oh, now he looked at the places, talked to the faces that he seen
Then he turned the pictures upside down
Said it don't make no difference how many places that you've been
Said the world keeps going around and around
Going around and aroundEmbed
