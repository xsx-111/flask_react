Friend Of Mine LyricsMight be that we have, different views sometimes
But that's alright, you're still a friend of mine
Sometimes you go your way
Sometimes I go mine, but that's alright
You're still a friend of mine
Might not like your lady, you might not like mine
But that's alright
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You changed my cloudy days to sunshine
I'm so glad you're a friend of mine
You make clear waters out of muddy
I'm so thankful that you're my buddy
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You changed my cloudy days to sunshine
I'm so glad you're a friend of mine
You make clear waters out of muddy
I'm so thankful that you my buddy
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mineEmbed
