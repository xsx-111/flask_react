For My Friend LyricsOne of us has to say he's sorry
Or we will never be friends again
Lets have a drink and talk it over
I want to keep you for my friend
We're here today and gone tomorrow
None of us knows when life will end
I've said some things that caused you sorrow
But I want to keep you for my friend
