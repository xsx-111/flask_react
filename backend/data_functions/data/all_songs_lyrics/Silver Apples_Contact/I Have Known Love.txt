I Have Known Love LyricsI have known love and love has won
I burned my fingers on the sun
I have known love and love has won
I burned my fingers on the sun
I've been imprisoned in the moon
I've been imprisoned in the moon
I have known love and love has won
And I have learned what truth denies
I drank the teardrops from her eyes
I have learned what truth denies
I drank the teardrops from her eyes
I surrendered much too soon
I surrendered much too soon
I have learned what truth denies
I never heard the warning voice
I never knew I had a choice
I never heard the warning voice
I never knew I had a choice
Though I never wanted to return
I never wanted to return
I never heard the warning voice
But I have sailed upon the boat
That flew when there was room to float
But I have sailed upon the boat
That flew when there was room to float
And I drank out of the magic urn
And I drank out of the magic urn
But I have sailed upon the boat
And I have slept inside the shade
Encircled by the love we made
And I have slept inside the shade
Encircled by the love we made
And I have kissed the face of dreams
And I have kissed the face of dreams
I have slept inside the shade
And I have ridden on the glow
That warms the sky with a rainbow
And I have ridden on the glow
That warms the sky with a rainbow
And I have waded in its golden streams
And I have waded in its golden streams
And I have ridden on the glow
And I have danced between the stars
With music sung by sweet guitars
And I have danced between the stars
With music sung by sweet guitars
I've done some things that can't be done
I've done some things that can't be done
And I have danced between the stars
And I have smiled inside the storm
Reaching higher to keep warm
And I have smiled inside the storm
Reaching higher to keep warm
I've known love and love has won
I've known love and love has won
I have smiled inside the storm
I burned my fingers on the sun10Embed
