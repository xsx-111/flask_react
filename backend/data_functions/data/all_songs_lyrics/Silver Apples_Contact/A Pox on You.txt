A Pox on You LyricsA pox on you you love and you run
A pox on you you spoil all my fun
A pox on you you didn't say goodbye
A pox on you you didn't even cry
You wouldn't let my head
You wouldn't let my head
Get into yours
Oh- into yours oh- into yours
A pox on you you were so nearsighted
A pox on you you got me too excited
A pox on you you were so carefree
A pox on you i was so damn free
Before i let you get into me
And you left my love just lyin in the mud
Oh- lyin in the mud
Oh yeah
Lyin in the mudEmbed
