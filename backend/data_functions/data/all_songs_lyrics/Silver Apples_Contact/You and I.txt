You and I LyricsYou and I could walk together
You and I could talk together
You and I could have each other
You and I could touch each other
But we don't have time for the little things
No, there just ain't room for the little things, why?
You and I could fly together
You and I could hide together
You and I could see each other
You and I could love each other
But we don't have time for the little things
No, we don't have time for the little things, because
Life is full of important things
Life is full of necessary things
Life is full of big machines
And there ain't no room for the little things
No, there just ain't room for the little things, why?3Embed
