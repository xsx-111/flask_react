Gypsy Love LyricsSomewhere out in the yellow greyness
Lurks a lady
I have never seen my lady
My lady who so easily can hurt me
Iâ€™ve never seen my lady
My lady who so easily will love me
You harbor me
Behind your eyes
Dark sense within your morning smile
Unspoken agonies of love denied
Lady now I know
Your gypsy heart
Your gypsy heart
Lady
Lady!
Lady!
Behind your eyes
Woven into misery I find
Flames gushing extacy
Men to women scorching pain to joy
My lady New York City
Gypsy love
Gypsy love
My gypsy love
My gypsy love
Behind the grey
Behind the grey
Lurks
The pain
The pain!
The pain!
Pain hurts
Pain hurts
Pain hurts
Pain hurts
Pain hurts
Pain and joy
Pain and joyEmbed
