Water LyricsOceans full of bounty
That flows within their bodies
Quiet but mighty rivers
Ride the fields of tomorrow
It's the tears that turn to years
It's the tears that turn to years
Powerful things are bursting
With energy for the millions
Night more than darkness
Will course for the boaters
It's the tears that turn to years
It's the tears that turn to years
Oceans full of bounty
That flows within their bodies
Quiet but mighty rivers
Ride the fields of tomorrow
It's the tears that turn to years
It's our tears that turn the years
Imaginary rangers
Working for the strangers
Marriage for your daughters
Boats upon your waters
It's fun to play in the bubbles1Embed
