Mudkicker LyricsWe stand accused but you lie
Varicose-veined finger
Prejudiced evil mind
The young get stronger
Free living fast
But you're a sapsucker
You ain't gonna last, No
Your twisted mouths feed the
Minds of babes
Taught from birth it's crime that pays
One man's fortune is another
Man's pain
But that's how you play the game
I ain't the child of your disgrace
You're mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
Ha! here's mud in your eyes
Ladies and gentlemen and members
Of the jury
All rise, cause here comes the boss
He's your big brother the silver
Tongue's doublecross
His collar starched white, big black
Briefcase held tight
It holds the power to your demise, Yeah
The corporation blue sedan
Behind the wheel Mr. Business-man
He thinks he's got the upper hand
But he misunderstands
I ain't the child of your disgrace
You're mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
I ain't the child of your disgrace
Quit mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
Wow! here's mud in your eyes
(SOLO)
Your prestige is clear as day
But I can scrape the sewer bilge and
See the same
The young get stronger, free living fast
But you're a sapsucker you ain't
Gonna last
I ain't the child of your disgrace
You're mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
I ain't the child of your disgrace
Quit mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
I'll Say
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker kickin' me all around
I'll Say
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker kickin' me all around
I'll Say
Mudkicker kick, kickin' me down
Mudkicker kick - I don't fuck
Around, noEmbed
