Get the Fuck Out LyricsYour jokes ain't funny and there's nothin' you say that I wanna hear
The sound of the door slammin' your ass out is music to my ears
If I can't beat you, then I'm gonna beat you to a pulp
So can the TV rays and take my tonsil glaze right down your throat
You're standin' too close, what the fuck's with you?
You ain't my old lady and you ain't a tattoo
Well, no need to whimper
And no need to shout
This party's over, so get the fuck out
Get the fuck out!
Well, I puke, I stink, bitch, give me a drink 'cuz I'm payin' for the room
I ain't buying you breakfast, so keep your mouth busy and wrap your lips all around my attitude
Take a walk with me with your triple double D's and your 40-foot do
Why you walkin' funny? You must have spent some time with the boys in the crew
You're standin' too close, what the fuck's with you?
You ain't my old lady and you ain't a tattoo
Well, no need to whimper
No need to shout
This party's over, so get the fuck out
Get the fuck out!
(You know what I'm sayin'? Fuck you if you can't take a joke, man.)
The morning's comin' and this is my bed
If I find you here when I wake up
The maid is gonna find me dead
You're standin' too close, what the fuck's with you?
You ain't my old lady and you ain't a tattoo
Well, no need to whimper
And no need to shout
This party's over
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!Embed
