Riot Act LyricsI never wanted to be President
'Cause it's nothin' but an
Ego trip, yeah
I didn't want your education
'Cause it's notin' but a pile of shit
You bore me to death, so shut up
For God's sake
Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin'
Down my back
So stop readin' me the riot act
I couldn't listen to a word you said
This goin' nowhere thing
Is wearin' thin
When your sex, your drugs, and
Your valid vic'
Is just the spit I wipe off my chin
I'd rather go nowhere than not know
Where it's at
Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin'
Down my back
So stop readin' me the riot act
(SOLO)
I never wanted to be President
'Cause it's nothin' but an
Ego trip, yeah
I didn't want your education
'Cause it's notin' but a pile of shit
You bore me to death, so shut up
For God's sake
Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin'
Down my back
So stop readin' me
Stop readin' me the riot act
While my brains are still intact
You say it's raining, but you're pissin'
Down my back
So stop readin' me
The riot act
The riot act
The riot act
The riot actEmbed
