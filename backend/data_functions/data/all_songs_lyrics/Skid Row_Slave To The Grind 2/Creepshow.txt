Creepshow LyricsZoned out afternoon
Let's catch "who's on top of whom"
Tell it like it is
'Cause it isn't anyway
Much to my surprise
I caught it right between the thighs
My sweet little sister
Was layin' me away
My jaw dropped dead to the table
She put my cool in shock
Crack kills and blood spills baby
But psychos, dykes and transvestites
Are on the choppin' block
Oh no
I saw my baby on the creepshow
Out on
Spillin' my guts on the news
Oh no
I caught my woman on the creepshow
Hit me with a shovel
'Cause I can't belive that I dug you
She filled my boots with lead
Was it something that I said
A picture paints a thousand ugly words
Baby's acting tough
Check out my fisticuffs
That's just what she deserves
I can't flip from the station
Can't unplug what's done
Her six-foot-deep temptation
She nicked my shin
And then kicked me in
And then she buried me for fun
Oh no
I saw my baby on the creepshow
Out on
Spillin' my guts on the news
Oh no
I caught my woman on the creepshow
Hit me with a shovel
'Cause I can't belive that I dug you
My jaw dropped dead to the table
She put my cool in shock
Crack kills and blood spills baby
But psychos, dykes and transvestites
Are on the choppin' blockEmbed
