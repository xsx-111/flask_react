Outta Hand Lyrics
Hey, girl, come on walk a while with me now
I'm counting on you to make it
Let's slip out and find the way somehow
I know you can fake it
I know you're still far away
Well, I know you can fake it
And I know it's outta hand, okay
But I know you can take it
There's a part you're always leaving out
This feeling I can't shake it
It's not that I don't know what you're about
I know you can fake it I know it's all far away
Come on, you can make it
And I know it's outta hand, okay
But I know you can take it
And I know it won't be long
And I know it won't be long
When you'll come out and I'll be gone
Hey girl, won't you show me now ?

Don't know if I can take it
Can't you just believe yourself somehow
I know you can fake it
I know you're still far away I know you can't take it
And I know it's outta hand, okay
Is no way you can fake it
And I know it won't be long
And I know it won't be long
And if you felt this all along
And if it's time to say you're wrong
Come on out and I'll be gone
Come on out and I'll be goneEmbed
