Even You Lyrics
A time was when it seemed appropriate to walk away
And now you got to try to stay
They all asked me
Then you asked me
I was kind of stunned
Now it's me who wants to run

I've no right falling all around you
Suffocating bugs surround you
It's a shame, that's what it's done to you
It came so easily, I let it follow me right down
Crept in close without a sound
They all told me
Then you told me
But I stayed around
Then it hit, I hit the ground

No discussion could improve this
Next time going to have to lose this
No way you're going to hate it
I'll try not to overstate it
When I finally plan my trip
I know you're going to be there
When it's time I finally flip
I know you're going to be there
It seemed immediate
You stuck me and you walked away
It upsets me either way
I do anything if anything won't come too late
Not the best way to set things straight
No discussion could improve this
Going to be a pain to lose this
Even you could not excuse thisEmbed
