Get Out of This LyricsWill it come to me?
Will it come to me?
And I saw you
It's the hardest thing for me I started shaking
Wondering where could you be from
And it figures
That the only thing I want is already taken
Cut him off let's get it done I know, I know
Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?
And I know you are the one
I miss I try to figure
How I get out of this I know, I know
Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?
And I know about the way you tried to tell me
It was sticky
And settled in their tea
So I freaked out
Blank stared into my heart
Just like you killed me
Thinking they're still picking the key
Don't know how to break it to me
Don't know how to take it to me
Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?
And I know you are the one I miss I try to figure
How I get out of this I know, I know
Will it come to me?
Will it come to me?
