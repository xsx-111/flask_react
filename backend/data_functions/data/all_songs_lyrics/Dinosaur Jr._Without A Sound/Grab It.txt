Grab It Lyrics
Help me off your back
I found it's so futile to attack
So what else you got
You won't tell the truth until you're caught
I'll be in your room
You'll be coming soon
I'll be gone all day
Grab it, that's your way
I wish I could pretend
But you'll fire one off at me again
Revenge me
Now don't it seem like you're a little sweet In your room

Who was willing
Got to assume
Felt too hard
Pain is chilling
Caught off guard
And now should I fall apart
I'll be in your room
You'll be coming soon
Take it out of me
Grab it, that's your scene
I'm not feeling well
It's not going so good, oh can't you tell It's a crazy time
Fire one off at me and I'll be fine
In your room
Who was willing
Got to assume
Felt too hard
Pain is chilling
Caught off guard
Soon should I fall apart
It's so crazed
You were swinging
Still amazed
What's in your laugh ?
You're still swinging
You're so unphased I'd no idea you'd go this far

If I look back, would you hear
If that's what you decide to believeEmbed
