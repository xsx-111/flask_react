On the Brink LyricsI know I've been what's in your mind
You could use it, babe
If ever I could let you go
Is that hard to take
It's not often
You soften up enough to smile
I'm damaged, I'm sandwiched
In here for a while
Tomorrow it's the last event
That you'll be a man
Forget what you thought she meant
Thank her, wish her well I'm damaged
I'm sandwiched
In the tree of light
It's no wonder I'm under
And no strength to fight
If ever there had been a time
Would you let me know?
Is there enough of you around
Could you let some go?
All the love won't deny you
You're above all you cry to
Gave it all I could think of
Wish you'd get what you're on the brink of
All the love won't deny you
You're above all you cry to
Gave it all I could think of
Wish you'd get what you're on the brink of
All the loveEmbed
