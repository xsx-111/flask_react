Yeah Right Lyrics
Yeah, so I told you some stories
Yeah, I slipped you some lines
Maybe I burned all my bridges
Yeah, so I'm out of my mind
Yeah, it's not very tasteful
Yeah, it's not very wise
Well, it's the best I came up with
So it's not much of a surprise
Yeah, well I thought about it
Maybe you didn't catch my eye
So I can't live without it
So that's a big surprise
Yeah, right

Yeah, today was a good one
Yeah, today you came through
Just when I'd run out of suspects
You knew just what to do
Yeah, well I thought about it
Maybe you didn't catch my eye
So I can't live without it
So that's a big surprise
Yeah, rightEmbed
