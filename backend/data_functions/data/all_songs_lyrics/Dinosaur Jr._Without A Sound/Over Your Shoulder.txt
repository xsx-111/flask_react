Over Your Shoulder LyricsHey, look over your shoulder
Hey, it's me getting older
Always thought I should've told you
It's alright, but it's sure getting colder
I know you're over my shoulder
I know now you'll get to hold her
You're gone
But it can't be wrong
You're gone
Can't be for long
You walked over my shoulder
You came cause
I told you
You thought
I knew it was over
All you knew was to hold her
You're gone
It can't be wrong
You're gone
Don't stay for long

You figure this, you don't get to be
I'm wrong, whatever it's still the same
I know it's over your shoulder
I know now you'll get to hold her
When I wake up
And you are gone
When I wake up I knew all along
When I wake up
And you are gone
When I wake up
I knew all along
You're gone
But it can't be wrong
You're gone
Don't
Stay too long
You're gone
But it can't be wrong
You're gone
Can't be for longEmbed
