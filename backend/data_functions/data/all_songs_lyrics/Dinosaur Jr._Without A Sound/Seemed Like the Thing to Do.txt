Seemed Like the Thing to Do LyricsWon't you come?
Cause I've been waiting
Won't you come?
Cause I've been waiting
See if it's true
Won't you come ?
Cause I've been waiting
Won't you come?
Cause I've been waiting
See if it's true
See if it's true
See if it's true
Won't you come
Cause I've been waiting
Won't you come
Cause I've been waiting
Won't you come
Cause I've been waiting
Won't you come
Cause I've been waiting
See if it's true
See if it's true
See if it's true
Now I've lost the thing
That I had to say
I know you're no good that way
You send me, you wanted this, too
Take your heart I think I get it now
Well I just can't prolong
Somehow I'll really do
See if it's true
Won't you come
Cause I've been waiting
Won't you come
Cause I've been waiting
See if it's true
See if it's true
Time was we'd drop out everything
And there was a peace you'd bring
But you didn't want to go
Talked about the hell we'd both been through
Seemed like the thing to do
Like something I needed to know
See if it's true See if it's trueEmbed
