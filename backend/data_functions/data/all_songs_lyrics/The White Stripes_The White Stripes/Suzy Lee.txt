Suzy Lee Lyrics
There's a story
I would like to tell
My problem is
It's one you know too well
It's one you know too well
Ms. Suzy Lee
The one I'm speaking of
The question is
Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love? (alright)
Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love?

She sent me flowers
With her tears burned inside
And you know what I'd do
I would run and hide
I would run and hide
And the paper
On it was my name
With the question
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same? (alright)
To end this tale
The one I'm speaking of
I wish I had an answer but I just don't know
Is this really love?
Is this really love?
Is this really love?
Is this really love?1Embed
