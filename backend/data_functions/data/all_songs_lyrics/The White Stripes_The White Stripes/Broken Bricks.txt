Broken Bricks Lyrics
Well, have you been to the broken bricks girl
Snack down through the cyclone fence
Past the caution tape and the security gate
Backwards to the breakroom bench
Well, there's a little corner where you first got kissed
And felt your boyfriends fist and made the company list
And there's a little spot where your dad ate lunch
And your brother landed his first punch yeah, yeah, yeah

Well have you been to the broken bricks girl
Seen the barrels that they left behind?
Seen the machine that cut aluminium clean
And got tape from the caution sign
Broken tooth window panes
Just a rusty-colored rain that drives a man insane
You try to jump over water but you land in oil
Climb the ladder up a broken crane yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't go to the broken bricks girl
It's not the place that you want to be
Think about the spot your father spent his life
Demolition calls it "Building C"
Demolition calls it "Building C," now
Demolition calls it "Building C" now    yeah2Embed
