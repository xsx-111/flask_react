Little People Lyrics
There's a little girl who says bing bing bomb
There's a little girl who says bing bing bomb, hello oh oh
There's a little boy with a spider in his hand
There's a little boy with a spider in his hand, hello, oh oh

There's a little girl with the red shoes on
There's a little girl with the red shoes on, hello, oh oh
There's a little boy with twenty five cents
There's a little boy with twenty five cents, hello, oh oh

And there's a little girl with a tiger on her bed
There's a little girl with a tiger on her bed, hello, oh oh
There's a little boy with nothin' on his mind
There's a little boy with nothin' on his mind, hello1Embed
