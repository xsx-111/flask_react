Cannon LyricsOutside
My door
Unlocked
Iâ€™m lookin'
At this sound
That chime out of nowhere
Yeah, nowhere
Wheels turnin'
Scratching
And burnin'
Yeah
I saw guns
Tanks
Cannon
Cannon
Yeah
Tell me who's that writin'
John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'
John the Revelator
Who's that writin'
John the Revelator wrote the book of the Seven Seals
Christ went down on Easter mornin'
Mary n' Martha went down to see
"Go tell my disciples, to meet me in Galilee"
Who's the writer?
John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'
John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writer
John the Revelator wrote the book of the Seven Seals
Yeah!
Lord above
How can man
Be evil?
Evil
