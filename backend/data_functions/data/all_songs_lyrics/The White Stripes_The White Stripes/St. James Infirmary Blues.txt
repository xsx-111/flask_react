St. James Infirmary Blues Lyrics
Well, folks, I'm going down to St. James Infirmary
And see
My little baby, there
She's stretched out on a long, white table
Well, she looks so good, so cold, so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
You may search this
Whole wide world over
But you'll never find another sweetheart like me
Yeah

Take apart your bones and put 'em back together
Tell your momma that you're somebody new
Feel the breeze blowin', tell 'em all "look out, here he comes!"
Now I can say whatever I feel like to you

Then give me 6 crap-shootin' pallbearers
Let a chorus girl
Sing me a song
Put a red-hot jazz band at the top
We raise!
Hallelujah, as we go along
Well
Well, folks, now that you have heard my story
Say, boy, hand me another shot of that rye!
And if anyone else should ask you
Just tell 'em I've got some of those St. James Infirmary blues2Embed
