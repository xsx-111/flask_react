Stop Breaking Down Lyrics
I can't walk the streets now, to consolate my mind
Some pretty mama, she starts breaking down

Stop breaking down, stop breaking down
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out
Well, it'll make you lose your mind

You Saturday night women, you love to ape and clown
You won't do nothing but tear a good man's reputation down

Stop breaking down, stop breaking down
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out
Well, it'll make you lose your mind

I gave my baby the ninety-ninth degree
She jumped up to throw a pistol down on me

Stop breaking down, stop breaking down
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out
Yeah, it'll make you lose your mind4Embed
