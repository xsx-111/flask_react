Sugar Never Tasted So Good Lyrics
Sugar never tasted so good
Sugar never tasted so good
Sugar never tasted good to me
Yeah
Until her eyes crossed over
Until her mind crossed over
Until her soul fell next to me

Now
If the wrinkle that is in your brain
Has given you quite a sting
Your fingers have become a crane
Pulling on these puppet strings
Yeah

What a feeling that's begun
What a feeling that's begun
What a feeling that's begun
What a feeling that's begun

Alright
I felt just like a baby
Until I held a baby
What a fool this boy can be
Yeah
And her thoughts like a daisy's
How my mind gets lazy
I must have been crazy not to see
Alright
If the wrinkle that is in your brain
Has given you quite a sting
Your fingers have become a crane
Your fingers have become a crane
Your fingers have become a crane
Pulling on these puppet strings

Water never tasted so good
Water never tasted so good
Water never tasted good to me3Embed
