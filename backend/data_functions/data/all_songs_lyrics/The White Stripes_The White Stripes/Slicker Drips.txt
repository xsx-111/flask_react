Slicker Drips Lyrics
They're lookin' at me
No where to go
And what they're sayin'
Just don't know
A floor below me
A ceiling above
And I'm in the middle
With nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Nobody to love

They're lookin' at me
Nowhere to go
I hear what they're sayin'
I just don't know
With a floor below you now
A ceiling above
You're in the middle
With nobody to love
Nobody to love
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
