Do Lyrics
Well somebody walked up to me
But I didn't know what to do
And then somebody said hello to me
But I didn't know what to do
Because I think that my words could get
Twisted so I bend my back over take a
Gulp be funny cause I know there's nothing I can do

Then my mother tried to pick me up
'Cause I was sitting down on the ground
Something forced my little eyes come open
But I couldn't make out the sound
It doesn't matter cause my eyes are lying
And they don't have emotion
Don't wanna be social
Can't take it when they hate me
But I know there's nothing I can do

When my thoughts start to feel like mine
They're taken from me, it seems to happen every time
And the feelings that are fine for you
There's somebody there
Who doesn't think they are true
So think of something new
There's nothing left to do
And then my idols walk next to me
I look up at them they fade away
It's a destruction of a mystery
The more I listen to what they say
So does that mean that there's no more doing
And there's no more thinking
And there's no more feeling
Cause there's no right opinion
Can you tell me what I'm supposed to do3Embed
