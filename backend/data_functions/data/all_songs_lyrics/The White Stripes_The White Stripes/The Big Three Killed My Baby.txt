The Big Three Killed My Baby Lyrics
The Big Three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The Big Three killed my baby
Nobody's coming home again

Their ideas make me want to spit
A hundred dollars goes down the pit
Thirty-thousand wheels are rolling
And my stick shift hands are swollen
Everything involved is shady
The Big Three killed my baby!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

The Big Three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The Big Three killed my baby
Nobody's coming home again

Why don't you take the day off and try to repair?
A billion others don't seem to care
Better ideas are stuck in the mud
The motor's running on Tucker's blood
Don't let 'em tell you the future's electric
'Cause gasoline's not measured in metric
Thirty-thousand wheels are spinning
And oil company faces are grinning
Now my hands are turning red
And I found out my baby is dead!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
The Big Three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The Big Three killed my baby
Nobody's coming home again

Well, I've said it now, nothing's changed
People are burning for pocket change
And creative minds are lazy
And the Big Three killed my baby!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

And my baby's my common sense
So don't feed me planned obsolescence
Yeah, my baby's my common sense
So don't feed me planned obsolescence (yeah!)
I'm about to have another blow-out!
Yeah
I'm about to have another blow-out!3Embed
