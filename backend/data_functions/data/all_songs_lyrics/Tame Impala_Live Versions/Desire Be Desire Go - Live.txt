Desire Be Desire Go - Live Lyrics
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go
Oh, dare I face the real world?

Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out
Won't have to check my watch

I, I don't have the verve to be-elong to this dead side
Woah-oah, why I ever tried, I, I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world?

Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, every day
Every day, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I forget
Try to let desire be, desire go

We can keep on walking
You can get to know me
If you just let it happen
I wonâ€™t tell anybody
Feel, feel it come, feel it come
I..
Feel it come
I, I don't know how long it's gonna stay with me
Woah, I'll let desire be, desire go

Thank youEmbed
