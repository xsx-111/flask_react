Half Full Glass Of Wine - Live Lyrics
Thank you guys
Hey, uh, give it up for White Denim
Holy moly, what a-what a bunch of freakishly good musicians
They make us look like novices
Alright
Let's see if we can prove our musical prowess
On this song, called "Half A Glass of Wine"
Go crazy, Chicago

Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be

Thank God that I've been blessed with a patient mind
Cause' what I want to happen won't happen for a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
You don't know how hard it can be

Oh, oh
Thank youEmbed
