Endors Toi - Live Lyrics
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Check, check, check

Soothing repeat
I look down at my feet
It's a hypnotist's arm
And it works like a charm
But I won't be deprived
Real world, surreal life
Once inside, there is time
Go to sleep, you'll be fine
In the mornin' you'll find
Real life was such a grind
Off I go, day is done
Where a new one's just begunEmbed
