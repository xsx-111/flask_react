Be Above It - Live Lyrics
Gotta be above it, gotta be above it

And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now

And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
I know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

This time I'm just gonna take it
Or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make it so that
All those little things don't affect me now

I know that I gotta be above it now
And I can't let them all just bring me down

This time I'm just gonna take it
Never gonna shake it
Close my eyes and make it so that
All these little things don't affect me now

Just gonna take it
Just gonna
Just take it
Just say so, go to me, so, oohEmbed
