Apocalypse Dreams - Live Lyrics
Alright guys, thank you so much
We're called Tame Impala, and we love you guys
And this song is called, "Apocalypse Dreams"
Alright, I said I'd ask Kevin a topical question
Haha, what?

This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day
Oh, oh, oh my
Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear that

Everything is changing?
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here
Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Push it out the window
On and on, we all go
(This could be the day that we push through)
Into another morning
Doesn't even matter
It was only yesterday
(It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
Didn't even know you
Now I'm gonna miss you
(Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't...)

Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
Looks the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mum
But she'll just be excited

Thank you guys
We love you, thank youEmbed
