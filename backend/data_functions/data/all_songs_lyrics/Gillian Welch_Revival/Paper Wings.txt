Paper Wings LyricsPaper wings, all torn and bent
You made me feel that
They were heaven sent
Paper wings, not real at all
But they took me high
Enough to really fall
Your paper kisses faded too soon
Just like a paper rose
'Neath a paper moon
Paper wings, paper wings
Oh how could I expect
To fly with only paper wings?
Angels were singing, didn't you hear
If only I'd listened close
When they whispered in my ear
Paper wings, paper wings
Oh how could I expect
To fly with only paper wings?
I tried to fly but found
That I had only paper wingsEmbed
