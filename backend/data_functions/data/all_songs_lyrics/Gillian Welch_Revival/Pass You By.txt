Pass You By Lyrics
One, two, three, four

I got an old V-8 from the year I was born
Don't look like much, just a flat black Ford
But the engine's clean, I could paint it someday
But most of the time I like it this way

Don't turn no head, don't catch no eye
Just a wind on the road, gonna pass you by

I used to talk tough, I used to get loud
Wanna paint my name all over this town
The folks lined up just to dog my day
Now if i stay quiet, they stay out of my way

Don't turn no head, don't catch no eye
Just a wind on the road, gonna pass you by

I got a brand new plan, I'm gonna help myself
'Cause it's a fat man's town, I'm gonna share the wealth
Put the money in the bag, keep your hands in sight
Turn around, count to ten, and I go back into the night
Don't turn no head, don't catch no eye
Just a wind on the road, gonna pass you by
Don't come over here, don't scream, don't cry
Just a wind on the road, gonna pass you by

I got an old V-8 from the year I was born
Don't look like much, just a flat black FordEmbed
