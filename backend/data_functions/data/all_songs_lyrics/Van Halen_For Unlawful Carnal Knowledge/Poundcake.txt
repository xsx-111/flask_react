Poundcake Lyrics(Ain't that some shit?)
(Okay, ya ready to go?)
(Yeah)

Oh yeah!
Yeah!
She's gotta have soul
Or it won't feel right
Well, just plain, clean and simple
Wrapped up, nice and tight

Home grown, and down home
Yeah, that makes one
Cookin' up an old time, long lost recipe
For me
It's gettin' hard to find
Guess it ain't hip enough now
You take an average guy, he can't identify, uh
And there's a short supply of her fine, fine stuff

Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on some of that
Shake it up, bake it up nice, uh
Lemme get on, lemme get on, lemme get on all that
I sure love my baby's poundcake
Homegrown and down-home, yeah that's the one
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe
Lemme get on some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. I want some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. Gimme some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho-ow!

Ooh, got some real fine pound... Poundcake. Ahh..
I've been out there
Tried a little bit of everything
It's all sex without love
I found the real thing is poundcake
Home grown, and down home
Yeah, that's the one
Still cookin' with that old time, long lost recipe, yeah, whew!
She's down home and down home
Oh, that's my woman

Gimme some o' that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. Lemme hold that
Uh-ah uh-ho ho. Uh!
Uh-ah uh-ho ho
Home grown, and down home, whew!
C'mon, babe
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
Home grown, way down home, yeah!
Uh ha, uh ha, ho, yeah
Gimme some of that, whew!
C'mon babe!
Homegrown, homegrown, down-home
Uh-ho ho1Embed
