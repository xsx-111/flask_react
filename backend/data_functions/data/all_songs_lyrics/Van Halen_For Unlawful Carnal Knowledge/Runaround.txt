Runaround LyricsOh, oh
Mmm hmm
Ow
That's right
She don't like it when it's cut n' dry
And don't like me makin' future plans
And don't want me tryin' to pin her down
She ain't about to give an inch of ground, no, woo
Well, she can take me for a little ride
But just as long as she drive me home
Around the block maybe once or twice
And then some lovin' wouldn't that be nice? Yeah
I won't but I want it
Oh, what a fool believes
I got her in my sight but just out of reach, oh, oh
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
Run, run, run around, 'round, 'round, 'round, yeah
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
She givin' me the run around, 'round, 'round, 'round
Uh, a just enough to keep me hangin' on
She knows exactly what I need
And right down to the nick of time
I'm chasin' love down a fine, fine line
Ow, I won't but I want it
Oh, what a fool believes
I got her in my sight but just out of reach, whoa
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
Run, run, run around, 'round, 'round, 'round, yeah
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
She givin' me the run around, 'round, 'round, 'round
Oh ow
Yeah, hey yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, ah, it goes like this
Listen baby, ssss, ooh, ow, ah, uh
Oh man, it's hard enough, yeah
And you make it harder
Ah, fill me up, I'm never satisfied
Own me, she owns it
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
Run, run, run around, 'round, 'round, 'round
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
She givin' me the run around, 'round, 'round, 'round
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
Run, run, run around, 'round, 'round, 'round
Here we go around, 'round, 'round
She givin' me the run around, 'round, 'round, 'round, no
'Round and around
Oh, I like it, uh, I like it
Yeah, but I like it
Baby, say I like it
