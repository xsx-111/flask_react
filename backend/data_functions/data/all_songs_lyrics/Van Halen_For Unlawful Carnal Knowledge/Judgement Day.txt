Judgement Day LyricsIt's my life, get off my ass, get outta my face
Man, I don't see no problem
Kickin' back, ain't kickin' you, no no
Anyway, if I make 'em, I solve 'em
Whoa, that's right, yeah, whoo
Makin' plans a waste, ain't no future here
Got no faith, got no religion

Oh, tell me why should I
Care or even, why should I try?
I just slide, slide on by
Never bad enough to crucify me
Huh, put it off until Judgement Day
I'll bear the cross on Judgement Day
I do most anything, keep from doing anything, 'cause
Sometimes I just wanna do nothin'
Nothin' lost, so tell me, how can I lose, ha
When I'm startin' off with nothin'?

Oh, tell me why should I
Care or even, why try?
I just slide, slide on by
Never bad enough to crucify me
Ow, put it off until Judgement Day
I'll bear that same old cross on Judgement Day, ow
Ow, hey

Hey man, everything's alright, yeah
Whoa
Ow, put it off until Judgement Day
I'll bear the cross on Judgement Day
Put it off, put it off until Judgement Day
I'll bear the cross on Judgement Day
Ah! Whoa yeah, on Judgement Day
Ah! Whoa yeah, on Judgement Day
