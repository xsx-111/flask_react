Top of the World Lyrics
Hey, Baby, Whoo!
I know that you believe in me
That's all I ever need, uh huh
No, No, nothing's gonna stop me
Nothing will be scaring me, oh no
Hey baby, it's the only way out
Oh, little darling
C'mon what's it all about?
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got
Oh, I know it won't hurt
I gotta have a little taste
I just wanna sink my teeth in that
Fine piece of real estate, yeah
Hey baby, make it nice and sweet
Oh, little darling
Let's take a walk down easy street
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Let's give it all we got, oooh oooh
Baby, gotta feeling, oooh oooh
Oh, I wanna touch it,now, oooh oooh oooh
See the whole wide world turn upside down

Hey, Baby, Whew!
Someday, we'll be
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Till we got stung
Standing on top of the world
For a little while
Standing on top of the world
Gonna give it all we got
(Standing on top) Hey, baby
(Standing on top) Hey darling
Standing on top
Standing on top
Standing on top2Embed
