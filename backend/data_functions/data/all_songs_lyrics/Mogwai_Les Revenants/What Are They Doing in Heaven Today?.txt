What Are They Doing in Heaven Today? Lyrics
What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?

I'm thinking of friends that I used to know
Who lived and suffered in this world below
But they're gone off to heaven, but I want to know
What are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?

There's some whose hearts were burdened with care
They pay for their moment with fighting and tears
But they clung to the cross with trembling and fear
What are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?
And there's some whose bodies were full of disease
Physicians and doctors couldn't give them much ease
But they suffered 'til death brought a final release
But what are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?

There's some who were poor and often despised
They looked up toward heaven with tear-blinded eyes
While people heedless and deaf to their cries
What are they doing there now?

What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?
What are they doing in heaven today
Where sin and sorrow have all gone away
Peace abounds like a river they say
What are they doing there now?1Embed
