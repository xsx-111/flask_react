Sue LyricsI know a girl, her name is Sue
She says she really digs making love to you, here she comes
All alone she lives on my street
No jacket on her back or shoes on her feet and it's cool
She tries so hard to stop her pain
As she sticks a dirty needle in to her vein, here we go
I am so sorry, what I did to you
I didn't mean to hurt you, no, little Sue (that's okay)Embed
