(You Better Love Me) Before I Am Gone LyricsWhen I think about the life that you gave
And who are you trying to save?
Everyone of them you dug a grave
You better love me
Before I am gone
When I think about the good times and bad
And being so happy and sad
Quit it now cause' i'm getting mad
You better love me
Before I am gone
So long
Well I think about the future and past
Because the presnt it goes by so fast
And my money won't last
You better love me
Before I am gone
Come onEmbed
