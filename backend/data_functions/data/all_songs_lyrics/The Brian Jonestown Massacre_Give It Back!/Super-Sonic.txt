Super-Sonic LyricsThis song is about you
And my life now without you
And my reasons just for living and forgiving being known
All alone
If you do it well you better do it right
If you're screwed up well you better screw it tight
It's the way that you're living
I'm forgetting what i know
And i know
Do you have what you want?
No, you don't
You can do what you want but you won't
How can you live with yourself now that you're all alone?
When you stare at your face in the glass
When you're driving in your car and you crash
Do you know where you're going when it's over and done?
(i dedicate this chord to you)Embed
