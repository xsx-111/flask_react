Whoever You Are LyricsI will take you for a ride deep inside
Won't beg you step inside, please
Let me take you down to the place I'm going
More than treasures found, it's just in knowing you
You can show me what is real, really free
Let me take you down to the place I'm going
More than treasures found, it's just in knowing you
But it's getting late, I must be goingEmbed
