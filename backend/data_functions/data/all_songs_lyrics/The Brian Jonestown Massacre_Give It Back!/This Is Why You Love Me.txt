This Is Why You Love Me LyricsI heard you say
He's gone away
Every things ok
Hey
I'm going to stay
So dry your eyes
I'll never lie
Or treat you like he did
Hey
Come out and play
He never did nothing except for drag you down
You can rest your head, cause we'll be laying around
And i'm here to say
That there's no way
He'll love you like i do
Hey
Come out and play
He never did nothing except for fuck you around
You can rest your head cause we'll be laying around
You can rest your head cause will be hanging aroundEmbed
