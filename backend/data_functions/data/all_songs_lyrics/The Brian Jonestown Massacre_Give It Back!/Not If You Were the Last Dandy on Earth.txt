Not If You Were the Last Dandy on Earth LyricsAnd we like what you say
You got things we should learn
And we like what you're doing
You got speed to burn
And you look so cool
And you look so fine
And you know where we live
Come on, drop us a line
Yeah, you look so groovy
And the chicks all scream
It's like a 60's movie
You know the one I mean
And you look so cool
And you look so hot
And you look so wasted
And, baby, I know why
Take my money
Take my time
Take my sister
I don't mindEmbed
