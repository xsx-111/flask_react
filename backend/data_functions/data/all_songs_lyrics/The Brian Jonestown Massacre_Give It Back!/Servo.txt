Servo LyricsOpen up 'cause here I come (but I am)
With a gift for everyone (but I am)
And I'm sure you're not aware (but I am)
Closed your mind but you don't care (it's a shame)
Waking up to kingdom come (but it is)
With my gift for everyone (but it is)
I am the last of the natural ones (here I am)
Let yourself go and have some fun (yea right)
Open up 'cause here I come (here I am)
With the gift for everyone (here I am)
I am the good things that we all share (yes I am)
Take no chances that you're aware (but you're not)Embed
