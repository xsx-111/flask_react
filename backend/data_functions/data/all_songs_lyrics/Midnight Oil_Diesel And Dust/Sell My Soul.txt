Sell My Soul LyricsLet's begin, I am ready, let's begin
Sell my soul to him
Shed my skin, I just wanna shed my skin
I don't wanna sell my soul to him
Mechanize, city bursts and farmers die
They cry
Sleep face down in a goods train heading south in the rain
In this world I often think you'd understand me
In these words I often think you'd recognise me
'cos I just wanna swim with the fish in the sea
And I want faith to heal so that I can be clean
America's great now
If you don't talk back
You hide your face
Crawl and rubble
And smile and small
That snails-paced creature
Going up and down walls
Celebrate, I just want to celebrate
I'm not going to sell my soul to him
When you look right inEmbed
