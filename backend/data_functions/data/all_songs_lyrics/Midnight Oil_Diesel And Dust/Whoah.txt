Whoah LyricsThe lord is my temple
God is by my side
You pay rates on that temple
Build materials at the side
He gives reasons
To get through the day
He doesn't have rinse action
He just says
Whoah - oh
Don't wanna see you back here again
Girls are not smiling
The stars have gone out
The man with the landslide
Got his head in the ground
Like an unopened letter
Left under the door
He says I am the answer you're looking for
Whoah - oh
Don't wanna see you back here again
Above we dream in the Androporosphere
Who maintains the drunken machinery
Before we dream of a time
When those men come from West PointEmbed
