Raleigh Soliloquy Pt. III Lyrics
You guys don't know what love is.
You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you had a love you had to lose
You don't know what love is
Let's seeâ€¦ What's happening? The sacks are filling up again here, yeah. Well we can stop that thing, ya know. Any fuckin' time we want, let's do it.Embed
