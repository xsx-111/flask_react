Q-Ball Lyrics
And I'm through, gonna fuck with you
Then I say what the fuck with you?
And I'm out for the nine-deuce niggas

Comin' with, this is Nine-Tre, still Bad Azz, Lynch
Muthafuckin' Q-Ball, and my nigga Brad
With the funky reggae style, check it out
Bad ass, comin' once again, I'ma shock ya
Don't try to step, cuz I'm the rocka'
Listen I'm the nigga, bad ass on the cut
Don't try to step, I'll shoot your ass, I'll go nuts
Steppin' is his strength, Q-Ball got somethin' to say
He's up next, white chowder don't play

I come too dope, I'm kickin' the cash
Because I clash, I gash
The buck-shots hit your ass when you duck
Nigga rains be supremeEmbed
