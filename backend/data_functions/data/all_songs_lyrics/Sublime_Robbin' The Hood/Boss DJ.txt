Boss DJ Lyrics
There's a steel train comin' through
I would take it if I could
And I would not lie to you
Because Sunday mornin' soon will come

When things will be much easier to say
Up on the microphone like a boss D.J
But I won't walk up upon the sea like it was dry land
Boss D.J. ain't nothin' but a man

No trouble, no fuss
I know why

It's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice

Rumors are spreading all over my town
But it's just stones and sticks
'Cause on the microphone, is where I go to get my fix
Just let the lovin' take a hold, 'cause it will if you let it
I'm funky, not a junkie, but I know where to get it
No trouble, no fuss
I know why

It's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice

Oowee girl, oowee girl, oowee girl
Oowee girl and there really ain't no time to waste
Really ain't no time to hate
Ain't got no time to waste, time to hate
Really ain't no time to make the time go away
So mister D.J., don't stop the music
I wanna know
Are you feelin' the same way, too?
I wanna rock it with you girl
You girl, ooh girl, ooh
Don't stop

'Cuz it's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It's so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
Nowadays, the songs on the radio all, all drive me crazy3Embed
