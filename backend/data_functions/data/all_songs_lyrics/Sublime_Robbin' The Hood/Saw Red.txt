Saw Red Lyrics

Girls, don't go crazy
Ah, woman hold your man tight

Every day I love him just a little bit more
A little bit more, a little bit more
Every day I love him just a little bit more
And he loves me the same
Every day I love her a just little bit more
A little bit more, a little bit more
Every day I love her just a little bit more
And she loves me the same

Baby, if ya wanna get low
Oh, baby, if ya wanna get high
It makes no sense at all
I saw red
I saw red
I saw red
One more secret lover that I shot dead
Every day I wake up just a little bit more
Feelin' like the dog in our front yard, because it's just how we are
And every day I wonder if it's over when I wake up
Realize no, it ain't, and I break down the wall
You say it's black, but I can't believe you
And if I say it's white, you say I'm just trying to deceive you
And baby, I'm aware of the high and the low
And I'd be waiting for you in the middle, but I just lack control

Baby, if ya wanna get low
Oh, baby, if ya wanna get high
It makes no sense at all
I saw red
I saw red
I saw red
One more secret lover that I shot dead

Girls, don't go crazy
Girls, don't go crazy
Oh, girls, don't crazy when men use you
Ah, woman hold your man tight
If it makes you feel right
It's your own life3Embed
