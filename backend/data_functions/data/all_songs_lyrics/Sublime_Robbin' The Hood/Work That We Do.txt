Work That We Do Lyrics
Well, we realized so long, long ago
And I bet you
That we've seen it all, the lies won't let you
I've got fourteen miles to go
I've got rhythm, common sense, I've got the sto
But I won't wanna come around our love
So, why?
If you are rich, I'm gonna hang you on the wall
I'm-a find you
And when I find you, I'm gonna get your lovin' arms today
So, we fight to get, we fight to get our weary arms to bed
Real love's something that I still hope
People make their own places to go
And now in '94, we're gonna lie some more
In 1994, were going to die some more
Is it ever going to be the last show?
It's a-going to be the last straw
Forced him out to make the cards that we draw
The women don't mind, I've got ample time
They don't wonder why that they do

That's work that we do
Work that we do, is work that we do
It's a beat
Bass stop bumpin' all over the placeEmbed
