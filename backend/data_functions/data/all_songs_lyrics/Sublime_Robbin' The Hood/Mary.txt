Mary Lyrics
Baby one breath away
I'll find the words to say
I'll sit and light the bong
I'll hold my hit in real long
I don't know if I can go up inside of you tonight
Oh Mary baby please don't fuss and fight
You've heard the line before
Mary baby please don't think I'm a bore
If you come home to me turn off the lights, and lock up the doors, and start getting busy

I don't know if I can go so far up inside you tonight
Oh Mary baby I could do it right
When we got to the pad
Mary baby started calling me her dad
Yes, she gave me head
We could not find a damn bed!
Fifteen years old plus one, hotter than a microwave oven
Oh Mary baby, daddy is coming home2Embed
