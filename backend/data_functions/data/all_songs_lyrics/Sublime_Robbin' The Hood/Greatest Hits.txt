Greatest Hits LyricsGwan!

Wake up in the in the morning and it's hard to live
Hard to live, yes it's hard to live
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give
And every single day it's getting harder to live
But I would be up for being down with a ho
Lord knows that I got mic control, do you got mic control?
Ya know this here style is well original

This man, making money how I know, won't be no man of me
In my bed, I watch T.V
I'm drunk by noon, but that's OK, I'll be President some day
Light my cigarette, and I think how Bert Susanka made me drink
Load the box and I'll pump the shit

Got my greatest... hits
Got my greatest... hits

Is this band making money? I don't know
It's the writing on the wall
All my friends drink alcohol
I'm too drunk to light the bong
I'm too stoned to write this song
Light my cigarette, and I think how Bert Susanka made me drink
Load the box and I'll pump the shit
Wake up in the in the morning and it's hard to live
Hard to live, yes it's hard to live
And it will be a long time before shit starts to give
And every single day it's getting harder to live
But I would be up for being down with a ho
Lord knows that I got mic control, do you got mic control?
Ya know this here style is well original

This man, making money how I know, won't be no man of me
In my bed, I watch T.V
I'm drunk by noon, but that's OK, I'll be President some day
Light my cigarette, and I think how Bert Susanka made me drink
Load the box and I'll pump the shit
