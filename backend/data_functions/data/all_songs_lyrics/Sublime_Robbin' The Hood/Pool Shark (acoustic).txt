Pool Shark (acoustic) Lyrics
Lyin' in my plastic bed
Thinking how things weren't so cool to me
My baby likes to shoot pool
I like lyin' naked in my bedroom
Tying on the dinosaur, tonight
It used to be so cool, too

But now I've got the needle
And I can shake, but I can't breathe
I take it away, but I want more and more
One day, I'm gonna lose the war

Lyin' in my plastic bed
Thinkin' how things weren't so cool to me
My baby likes to shoot pool
Like lyin' naked in my bedroom
Tying on the dinosaur, tonight
It used to be so cool

Now I got the needle
And I can shake, but I can't breathe
I take it away, but I want more and more
One day, I'm gonna lose the warEmbed
