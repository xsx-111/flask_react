Freeway Time In LA County Jail Lyrics
On the freeway in the county, the sun don't shine
I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel a Bati man
Outside my cell, deputies creep
And in this cell, all I do is sleep
And I dream
That I'm free

And I'm back on the reef where I throw my net out into the sea
All the fine jainas come swimming to me
They hold me and they promise me things
And when the tides high, I cry like a little baby
Don't give me no right kinda love, no Sunday morning
Don't want no puppy lovin'
Hungry babe, a new stylee
Hungry babe, a new stylee
And a angry dog is a hungry dog
And a hungry dog is a angry dog

I feel like rockin'
I wan' rock with you

All a lie, gotta contact home
Gotta contact my baby girl
But a wood never could get up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
With myates and the eses, yes, they're steady on the fall
I'll be damned if a man with a shank in his hand will make me feel
I feel a Bati man
And I know, that I'm there, someday
Back on the reef where I throw my net out into the sea
All the fine jainas come swimming to me
Hold me, baby, promise me
With no protection on my erection I won't get no V.D
Don't give me no right kinda love, no Sunday morning
I don't want no puppy lovin', g'wan
Hungry babe, ah, the new stylee
And angry dogs are hungry doggies
A good man is a naked man
And a wicked dog is a hungry dog

I feel like rockin'
I wan' rock with you2Embed
