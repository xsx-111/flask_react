Idea Track LyricsDear Hugh Miller
I've thought it through for a while but it doesn't get any easier
And three months on in this bad design won't make it feel any easier
Your grave, it's your grave
Dear Hugh Miller
It's four months now from when we started and nothing feels much easier
I sit and stare in a cork tiled room and it doesn't get much easier
Your grave, it's your grave
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (you don't try)
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (don't try)
Dear Hugh Miller
It's four months now from when we started and nothing feels much easier
I sit and stare in a cork tiled room and it doesn't get much easier
Your grave, it's your grave
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (you don't try)
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (don't try)
Your grave, it's your grave
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (you don't try)
Pretend it works a while, it's transmitted live
Pretend it works a while (don't try)
I don't care if I don't have an idea track, it's an idea track, it's an idea
I don't care if I don't have an idea track, it's an idea track, it's an idea
Your grave, it's your graveEmbed
