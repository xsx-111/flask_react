Broken Windows LyricsI kick stones, kick stones, kick stones through windows
I kick stones, which somehow got home
But i'm not proud, that i'm a broken window
And i'm not proud, that i can't look through broken windows

I kick stones, kick stones, kick stones through windows
I've kicked stones which somehow got home
But i'm not proud, that i'm a broken window
And i'm not proud, that i can't look through broken windows
Froze in college, you said it was the wilderness
Froze in college, you said it was the wilderness of... frustration
Frustration
It was the wilderness of...
I kick stones, kick stones, kick stones through windows
I kick stones which somehow got homeEmbed
