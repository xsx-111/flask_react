The Bronze Medal LyricsIt felt cold inside
So we threw the radio onto the fire
It felt good to watch it
Burn away to nothing
You said you felt week
I hope it's got
Nothing to do with the things you told me
Nothing but your eyes
Looking down on the third place
You've got nothing but determination
To come in third
You were always going to be like this
When it's somewhere that's as cold as this
You were always meant to be like this in the cold
It felt warm inside
So we threw the television on the fire
It was in frustration
'Coz I had nothing to throw away
Nothing but your eyes
Looking down on the third place
You've got nothing but determination
To come in third
You know that you're always meant to be like this
You know that I'm always meant to be like this
You know that you're always meant to be like this
You know that you're always meant to beEmbed
