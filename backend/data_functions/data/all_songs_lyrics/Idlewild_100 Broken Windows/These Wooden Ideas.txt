These Wooden Ideas LyricsIts a better way to feel
Dont be real be post modern
(its not that one dimensional its not the only thought)
Its a better way to feel
Dont be real be post modern
(its not that one dimensional its not the only thought)
I stopped and waited for progress
I stopped and waited for progress
I stopped and waited
But im not willing to accept it all
This wooden idea is your method of repitition
This wooden idea is how you sell reduction
Its the best way to feel
Dont be real be post modern
(its not that one dimensional its not the only thought)
Its the better way to feel
Dont be real youre post modern
(its not that one dimensional its not the only thought)
You can't keep waiting for progress
You can't keep waiting for progress
You can't keep waiting
And im not willing to accept it all
This wooden idea is your method of repetition
This wooden idea is how you sell reduction
I bet you dont know how to spell contradiction
I bet you dont know how to sell conviction
I bet you dont know how to spell contradiction
I bet you dont know how to sell conviction
This wooden idea is your method of repetition
This wooden idea is how you sell reductionEmbed
