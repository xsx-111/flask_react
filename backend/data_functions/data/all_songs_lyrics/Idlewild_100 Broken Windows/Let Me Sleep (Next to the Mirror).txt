Let Me Sleep (Next to the Mirror) LyricsI woke up first this morning
I've never seen the dawn
But I know what the world looked like before
How would I know what you said?
You're always first to go to bed
You're intent on sleeping it off
Let me sleep, next to the mirror
I know you don't like mirrors
When they reflect on you
For every word that you write
They won't mean much as barricades (They hold me down)
I'm sure that you'll be fine
Ten more years of this
It will nearly be time
I'm sure that you'll be fine
It can't take ten more years
You woke up first this morning
You told me that you had a bad dream
Like one never before
What was in it?
My reflection showed that I'm far too critical
Let me sleep next to the mirror
Don't tell me that you don't like mirrors
Don't tell me that you don't like
Looking right through your own reflection
For every word that I write
They won't mean much as barricades (They hold me down)
I'm sure that you'll be fine
Ten more years of this
It will nearly be time
I'm sure that you'll be fine
But it can't take ten more yearsEmbed
