This Wreckage Lyrics
And what if God's dead?
We must have done something wrong
This dark facade ends
We're independent from someone

This wreckage I call me
Would like to frame your voice
This wreckage I call me
Would like to meet you, meet you
Soon

We write suggestions
Suggesting fading to silence
And that must please you
My mirror's tarnished with "no help"

This wreckage I call me
Would like to frame your voice
This wreckage I call me
Would like to meet you, meet you
Soon
別れよう
別れよう
Turn out these eyes
Wipe off my face
Erase me
Replay "The End"
It's all just show
Erase you
I need to
I need to
I need to

This wreckage I call me
Would like to frame your voice
This wreckage I call me
Would like to leave you, leave you
Leave you, leave you soon

別れよう
別れよう
別れよう
別れようEmbed
