Sleep by Windows Lyrics
You can cry by my window
You can crawl on the floor
You can scream if you want to
But I won't unlock the door
You can sleep in bus shelters
You can sleep in the park
But I'll rip up the trees
Until you tear yourself apart

But I don't love you
No, I don't love you
Do you dream?

Back to surveillance
Open eyes and wash out "tear"
A sign that says "no exit"
And "no one can save you here"
I could talk about my programme
Where everything is white
I could specialise in pictures
Where nothing's ever right

But I don't love you
No, I don't love you
Do you dream?
We are just sound
We are just noise
And we are all here to lie
And we are just sound
We are just noise
We are all here to lie
Here to lie
Do you dream?

You sleep by windows
You sleep by windows
Do you cry?
Do you dream?
Do you?
Did you?Embed
