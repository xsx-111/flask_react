Remind Me to Smile Lyrics
We'll take a taxi to the show
We could report by phone
We could remind ourselves that we must laugh
Reconsider: "fame"
I need new reasons
This is detention, it's not fun at all

Remind me to smile
You know, "the old friends" line
It gets so I feel like
I'm in this cold glass cage

I've got the horrors
Check over my shoulder
I punch the air and fight but no one's there

You, you (Oh no)
Old scars (Don't show)
We fall (You see)
Crawl, crawl (In love)
I dive (So clean)
Young things (Don't scream)
Toys, toys (So far)
Boys, boys (You are)
Remind me to smile
You know, "the old friends" line
It gets so I feel like
I'm in this cold glass cage

Get off the car
Get off the phone
Move from my window, leave me alone
Keep your revivals
Keep your conventions
Keep all your fantasies, that's all we are

You, you (Oh no)
Old scars (Don't show)
We fall (You see)
Crawl, crawl (In love)
I dive (So clean)
Young things (Don't scream)
Toys, toys (So far)
Boys, boys (You are)
You, you (Oh no)
Old scars (Don't show)
We fall (You see)
Crawl, crawl (In love)
I dive (So clean)
Young things (Don't scream)
Toys, toys (So far)
Boys, boys (You are)
You, you (Oh no)
Old scars (Don't show)
We fall (You see)
Crawl, crawl (In love)
I dive (So clean)
Young things (Don't scream)
Toys, toys (So far)
Boys, boys (You are)Embed
