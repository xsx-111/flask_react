I Die: You Die Lyrics
This is not love
This is not even worth a point of view
In Echo Park, I
Pause for effect and whisper "who are you?"

They crawl out of their holes for me
And I die: you die
Hear them laugh, watch them turn on me
And I die: you die
See my scars, they call me such things
Tear me, tear me, tear me

Now I have your names
Screaming "you will suffer" and "you're all too late"
Now I feel young
Does everything stop when the old TAPE fails?

They crawl out of their holes for me
And I die: you die
Hear them laugh, watch them turn on me
And I die: you die
See my scars, they call me such things
Tear me, tear me, tear me
But I'm still frightened by the telephoneEmbed
