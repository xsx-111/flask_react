We Are Glass LyricsWe are young, we can break
Watch us fall
We can take some train down to the sea
We are glass
We are glass
We are real, you can touch
Just for now
And I say "Hey you, which way is down?"
We are glass
We are glass
We are strong, we're unknown
We have time
And to you, I'm just one of those boys
We are glass
We are glass
We are cold, we're not supposed to cry
But it's all just a thought, so here am I
We are glass
We are glass
They run fast impressions
Of the floors inviting
Stay with me
Stay with me
They run past with telephones, they scream
Well, would you turn all this down?
Turn all this down
You are replaced, you are you
And now dreams are real and dreams are all we need
We are glass
We are glass
They run fast impressions
Of the floors inviting
Stay with me
Stay with me
They run past with telephones, they scream
Well, would you turn all this down?
Turn all this down1Embed
