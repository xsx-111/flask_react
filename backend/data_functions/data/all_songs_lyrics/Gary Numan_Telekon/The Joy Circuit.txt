The Joy Circuit Lyrics
Send in the guards
We are all new faces
I'm so sorry
But my reasons are wrong
My reasons are wrong

We are on joy circuit
The image fix
Rewind, cry
Well, it's somewhere to go
Well, it's somewhere to go

Tell me of your pain
Love it, love it
Show me the new way
Love it, love it
It's so unusual
But all I find is a reason to die
A reason to dieEmbed
