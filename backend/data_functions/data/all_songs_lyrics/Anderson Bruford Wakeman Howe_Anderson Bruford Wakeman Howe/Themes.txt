Themes LyricsI. Sound

II. Second Attention
Be gone you ever piercing
Power Play machine
Cutting our musical solidarity
For those who would break the windows
Of our true reflections
And perceptions of the world
'For I am out of thee with a vengeance'
Do not play me
You will never hear this
You will never hear this
Only feel it
For too long I have danced
To your destiny
No longer fill my head
With empty dreams
Of reality and gold
Your reality
For I am away this side away to the second attention
I can never ever play it or sing it
For it can never be shouted down
Or played every stronger
As I feel this never ending
Pattern of nature
I don't believe in Devils
I don't believe in Demons
I only believe in you
III. Soul Warrior
