Fist of Fire LyricsCarry forth as a guardian to Kingdom Come
With your daggers of the spirit
Let the dagger run
With the Fist of Fire
Be the master now
As the darkness of ages past
Riches silver and gold
In the liquid sea
Cast a net can you catch
So you can't see me
As in death you can climb
Higher thru the sky
Show your wings
Surely you can fly
Fly away past the guardian to Kingdom Come
See the miracle of life
Disappear it's gone
Go carry your silver ships of light
Go carry your silver ships of light
Go carry your silver ships of life
Go carry your silver ships of life
Go carry your silver ships of life
Keep the fire in your hand
It won't let you drown
As you fly with your wings
Won't come falling down
See the flower of youth
Disappear on high
As you gather your true wings
About to fly
To be ready
To be strong
Make it run
This righteous
This wrong
This right
This love
This is how nature controls
The way of all things
This is how the angels sing
Not afraid
No, not afraid
Not afraid of this or that
Not afraid
Carry forth as a guardian to Kingdom Come
With the ghost
And the spirit
Let the fire run
Thru the darkest age
We can surely fly
Thru the darkest age
With the Fist Of Fire
Thru the darkest age
With the Fist of FireEmbed
