Birthright LyricsA new born land
Dreaming by the sky
The scent of colours
In the flowers
Believe it's small
In many ways
It holds the key
That divides the super powers
This road is never lonely
To England they are tied
They were blasted by the Silver Cloud
There were blasted to the wall alive
This place, this place ain't big enough for stars and stripes
Counting out the statesmen
Bungling one by one
Spelling out this segregation
So the catchword be
Looking after number one
They release the fear inside
Are human after all
So begins our dream time
They hunted like the dinosaur
We the pure
They the savage innocent
How we crush our existence after all
Come on
For without them we are lonely
This England we are blind
Like all the Empires crumble
Will surely change the tide
This place ain't big enough for red and white
This place ain't big enough for stars and stripes
This place, this place
This place is theirs, by their birthright
This place
The sun gives better reasons
United we are blind
To deliver our existence
Keep it up
Keep it up
This human tide, give it some
We can break the ties
Of recent changes
Know the ones who
Hold the key
Singing out the congregation
We are them and they are we
This place ain't big enough for red and white
This place ain't big enough for stars and stripes
This place
This place
This place is theirs by their birthrightEmbed
