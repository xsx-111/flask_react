The Meeting LyricsSurely I could tell
When I sleep tonight
A dream will call
And raise it's head in majesty
Dividing all my energy
To the meeting of your love
Where from whence it came
Like a singer searching for a song
I try to reach where you belong
As I will be the song for you
I will be your servant child
No, oh no
I cannot be deceived
No, oh no
There's something
That I feel
There's something that I feel inside
Surely I could tell
If you ask me Lord
To board the train
My life my love would be the same
As I could be the one for you
In the meeting of your love
In the meeting of your loveEmbed
