Order of the Universe LyricsI. Order Theme

II. Rock Gives Courage
You don't need anybody, don't you give me that surprise
Everything about you inside your eyes
You don't need anybody in your family ties
You crossed over the river
You don't need any money to deserve all your friends
It's just the love you give them
You don't need anybody in this complicated life
You crossed over the river
And you're there on your own and you're lost in your life
And you think there's someone's gonna make you feel so good
You better lose control you better watch your step
For there's something inside you, they call it
Rock gives courage, a way to win the trust
Rock gives lover a way to win or bust
You don't need anybody in this complicated life
You crossed over the river
Rock gives courage, a way to with the trust
Rock gives lovers a way to win or bust
Rock gives sisters a way to speak their mind
Without this gift of rock and roll
We'd all be wasting time
III. It's So Hard to Grow
They say we've got it made, they say we gotta light
Where is the man with all the great directions
They say we gotta win, they say we gotta learn
But in the end it's just the same damn reason
They say you've gotta run, they say you gotta jump
Don't really need to know which way we're going
They say we gotta push, they say we gotta shout
Is this the way to keep our bonfires burning
Sick feeling, sick reasoning, sick challenge you la la la la
You can't imagine it, how hard it is to grow
You can't imagine it, can you imagine
The order of the universe
You don't need anybody, don't you give me that surprise
Everything about you inside your eyes
You don't need anybody in your family ties
You crossed over the river
You don't need any money to deserve all your friends
It's just the love you give 'em
You don't need anybody in the complicated life
You crossed over the river, you crossed over the river
You crossed over the river, you crossed over the river
