Teakbois LyricsAhhh Teakbois
Teakbois
Second Teakbois
Teakbois

Jump out, this next world is gone overground
That sky is ecstasy dancin'
My child, my woman, my daughter, my son
Together planning to party
Just wait for me
Out in the street
Teakbois is everywhere
Dancing with you
We're coming through
Somehow we'll all be there
This time is surely come once and for all
We've waited so now we're ready
Come on!

Be quick, be ready, be sure, and be smart
No need the energy wasted
I've dreamed of music that comes from the heart
As though the eagle has landed
Just wait for me
Out in the street
Teakbois is everywhere
Dancing with you
We're coming through
Everyone will be there
She smiles, my mind Is just blown, I can't stop
No time is better than now
This time!
(who this coming - bobby dread and the..)
(who this coming - bobby dread up early)

I wake up everyday before the sun is coming up
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
The fish to catch, the sea to swim, they say I got a life to live
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
My music is my only witness to my very soul
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
So when you need me, all you have to do is help me lose control
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
They say the world's a stage, so let me play for you and you and you
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
It's all I, ever in my life, really wanted to sing and do
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
We form a group, a simple name, a secret harmony like
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
We write our songs, we symphonize, some people say they like us
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)
(Bobby Dread and the kool running)

Sing it!
La la la la la laaa
La la la la la laaa
La-la la-la la-la la-la
La la la la la laaa
La la la la la laaa
La la la la la laaa
La-la la-la la-la la-la
La la la la la laaa

This summer you couldn't get it
This summer you couldn't get it
This summer you couldn't get it
This summer you couldn't get it
This summer you couldn't get it
This summer you couldn't get it
This summer you couldn't get it
This summer you couldn't get itEmbed
