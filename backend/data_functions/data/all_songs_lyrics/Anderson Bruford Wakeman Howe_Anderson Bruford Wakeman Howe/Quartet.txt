Quartet LyricsI. I Wanna Learn
I wanna learn more about you
We haven't spoke in quite a while
And all of the dreams that come true
So surprising how it catches you
I wanna learn more about me
I've been sinking like a setting stone
And now the dreams are realising it's true
That's why I wanna learn about you
I wanna know more about life
And things that can fly in between my mind
I wanna change all that I dream about
My waking and my so many lives, oh my
I wanna learn more about you
We haven't spoke in quite a while
Just let me, let me come through
I'll give you my heart, my life for life
II. She Gives Me Love
She gives me love
When love had gone away
When the pressure came so fast
She give me love
Long distance runaround
And in between the pressure
I was summoned
How did we dance on the south side of the sky
We saw the flags flying on the moon
And thru the gates of delirium so fast
Believing in the light was a beginning
Only to believe in you
Only to believe in you
She give me love
When I was losing fast
I was awakened by the dream
She was the love for me
The first and last
And all that I remembered
Was the roundabout only to believe in you
III. Who Was the First
Who was the first to show
The moon at night
Is never so far away
We are the first to define the
Languages of love
Who was the first to learn
The universal consciousness divine
We are the first to discover
This day in our time
And when the history of science
Re-writes itself each day
We are living in days of wonder simon says
So wonderful true believer
So wonderful I'm alive
Just take this world of life
Each day at a time
So up this universal
Combinations of the word
I'll try so hard to fulfill my belief
Take me I'm a love you
I'm a love you
No change in my mind
I'll walk with you to the end of the earth
I wanna learn more about you
We haven't spoke in quite a while
I wanna learn more about me
We haven't spoke in quite a while
So up this universal
Combinations of the word
So up this universal
Word of love
Take me I'm a love you
I'm a want you
No need to change my mind
I'll walk with you to the end of the earth
I wanna learn more about you
We haven't spoke in quite while
I wanna learn more about me
IV. I'm Alive
Only when you looked
Did I realise
Someone broke into your life
How we hurt and never show it
Come into my world hold me
In your arms
There's a mystery to the touch
How it heals so
When we're broken
I believe that all the fear you've had
Can gently fly away
We experience we hold together
Lost in one embrace
We will love forever (this eternity)
For in (this) love, I'm alive, I'm alive
Only when you spoke
Did I realise
How you understand this life
How you help me
With your eyesight
Only when we touched
Did it all come true
How you understand my life
How you helped me with your lightEmbed
