Life with the Lions LyricsI hate the arsehole I become
Every time I'm with you
You know you've got me on the run
But let me make it clear to you
It's taken two fools such as we
To make love deaf, dumb and blind
Now you're upset 'cos I can't read your mind love
You're upset Cos I can't read your mind
I hate the arsehole I become
Every time I'm with you
I get the feeling looking in your eyes
That somehow I should forgive you
I know that I'm guilty but I don't know what I've done
You're not about to let me join in the fun are you
You're not about to let me join in the fun
I hate the arsehole I become
Every time I'm with you
I hate the way you try to give me back
All the things I give to you
I know when I leave the room
They say what's up with him
But love is not a game you play to win girl
Love is not a game you play to win
If that face of yours could only talk
The stories it could tell
The chase is always better than the kill, love
The chase is always better than the killEmbed
