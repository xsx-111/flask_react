The Only One LyricsSometimes when you lose your way to me
I think you don't care at all
If you don't get here soon
I'll tear that clock down from the wall
Your family and friends don't understand
They treat me so strange
The book you said to read
Well I have read but nothing's changed
The clocks go forward the clocks go back
Yet here I sit as if I were the only one
And oh you cannot hear me
Oh you cannot hear me
Can anybody hear me out there
He's up on his high horse again
You're down in the park
I'm left to fight my impulses alone here in the dark
The chain that fell off my bike last night
Is now wrapped round my heart
Sometimes I think that
Fate has been against us from the start
I long to let our love run free
Yet here I am a victim of geography
And oh you cannot hear me
Oh you cannot hear me
Can anybody hear me out there
She said kiss me or would you rather
Live in a land where the soap won't lather
And oh...
You know you are the only one
Yes you are the only one
Yes you are the only oneEmbed
