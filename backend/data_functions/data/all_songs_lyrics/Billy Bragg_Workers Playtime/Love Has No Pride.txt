Love Has No Pride LyricsI've had bad dreams too many times
To think that they don't mean much anymore
Good times have gone, left my sad home
Friends who once cared don't call back anymore
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one to blame
But I'd give anything to see you again
I've slept alone too many nights
To think that you would come back again
I've heard you talk, "He's crazy to stay"
But this love hurt's me so I don't care what you say
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one to blame
And I'd give anything to see you again
If I could buy your love
Then I'd surely try my friend
And if I could pray
My prayers would never end
And if you want me to beg
I'll fall down on my knees
And ask for you to come back
Honey, I'd plead you to come back
Beg for you to come back to me
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Love has no pride when there's no one but myself to blame
And I'd give anything to see you again
Yes, I'd give anything to see you againEmbed
