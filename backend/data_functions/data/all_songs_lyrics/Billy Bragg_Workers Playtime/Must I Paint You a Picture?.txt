Must I Paint You a Picture? LyricsIt's bad timing and me
We find a lot of things out this way
And there's you
A little black cloud in a dress
The temptation to take the precious things
We have apart to see how they work
Must be resisted for they never fit together again
If this is rain, let it fall on me and drown me
If these are tears let them fall
Must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel?
You know my love for you is strong, girl
You know my love for you is real
It took a short walk and a talk
To change the rules of engagement
While you searched frantically
For reverse
And then claiming that virtue never tested
Is no virtue at all
And so I lost my ignorance
And now the bells across the river chime out your name
I look across to them again
Must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel?
You know my love for you is strong, girl
You know my love for you is real
All your friends said come down, it will never fly
And on that imperfect day we threw it all away
Crisis after crisis, with such intensity
This would never happen if we lived by the sea
Most important decisions in life
Are made between two people in bed
I found that out at my expense
And when I see you
You just turn around and walk away like we never met
Oh, we used to be so brave
I dreamt the world stopped turning as we climbed the hill
I dreamt impossible dreams that we were lovers still
Must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel?
You know my love for you is strong, girl
You know my love for you is real
Must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel?
You know my love for you is strong, girl
You know my love for you is real
Must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel?
You know my love for you is strong, girl
You know my love for you is real
Oh, must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel?
You know my love for you is strong, girl
You know my love for you is real
Must I paint you a picture
About the way that I feel?
Love is strong, love is real
Must I paint you a picture?1Embed
