The Price I Pay LyricsMy friend said she could see no way ahead
And I was probably better off without you
She said to face up to the fact that you weren't coming back
And she could make me happy like you used to
But I'm sorry to say I turned her away
Knowing everything she said was true
And that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
There's something inside that hurts my foolish pride
To visit the places we used to go together
Not a day goes by that I don't sit and wonder why
Your feelings for me didn't last forever
Girl I love you so much that sometimes it's such
I'd walk a mile with a stone in my shoe
And that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
Yeah, that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
So keep that phone out of my way for the things I must say
Are empty if you don't believe they're true
That's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
Yeah, that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
Girl, I love you so much that baby it's such
I'd walk a mile with a stone in my shoe
And that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
Yeah, that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
And that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
Yeah, that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
And that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
And you know that I do
Yeah, that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I do
And that's the price I pay for loving you the way that I doEmbed
