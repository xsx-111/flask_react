Rockers East Vancouver LyricsWe used to go out
Get drunk and get sad
Good friends
But this town
And this scene
Has gone bad
We kept waiting, but still nothing changes
It's a shame
Tired old youth
Burnt right out
We kept waiting, but still nothing changes
It's a shame
All those past dues
All those bad moods
All those half truths
All those sad tunes
You wrote while you wasted away
Your big break was what you wanted
A little change was what you needed
Your big break was what you wanted
It's a shame (x2)
We kept waiting, but still nothing changes
It's a shame
Tired old youth
Burnt right out
We kept waiting, but still nothing changes
It's a shameEmbed
