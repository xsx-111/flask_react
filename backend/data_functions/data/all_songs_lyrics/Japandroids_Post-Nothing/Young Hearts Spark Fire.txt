Young Hearts Spark Fire LyricsWe finished our old lives (Yeah!)
Like we finished off the wine (Yeah!)
Now we're used to staying up all night (Yeah!)
Two hearts beating
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Well you can keep tomorrow
After tonight we're not gonna need it
Beat up! (Beat up!)
Beat down! (Beat down!)
Wet ground, but too drunk to feel it

Oh, we used to dream
Now we worry about dying

I don't wanna worry about dying
I just wanna worry about those sunshine girls
Young hearts
Spark fire
All night
Oh yeah, oh yeah



Oh
