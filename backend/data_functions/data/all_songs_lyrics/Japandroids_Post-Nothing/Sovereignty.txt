Sovereignty LyricsForget their blessing
Forget the weather
We'll join our Christian names together
Write all our friends back home
We'll leave tonight and
We'll leave together
I'll say what airline and you'll say whatever
Leave all our friends back home
You'll talk of sons
And I'll talk of daughters
We'll find a little place by the water
Worry all our friends back home
I'll do the talking
You'll write the letters
And I'll sing the Beatles and you'll sing them better
Forget all our friends back home
It's raining in Vancouver
But I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm far from home tonight
It's raining in Vancouver
And I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm alone with you tonight
It's raining, oh, in Vancouver
But I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm far from home tonight
It's raining, oh, in Vancouver
But I don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm in love with you tonight
Oh
Oh
Oh
OhEmbed
