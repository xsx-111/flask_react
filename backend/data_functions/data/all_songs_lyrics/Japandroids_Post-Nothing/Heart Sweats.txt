Heart Sweats LyricsYour heart is cold as ice girl
I should know I've been to the north pole
Your soul is black as death girl
I should know I have crossed the threshold
Your style is such a mess girl
I should know I used to date a stylist
Still my heart sweats
Your heart is cold as ice girl
I should know I've been to the north pole
Your soul is black as death girl
I should know I have crossed the threshold
Your style is such a mess girl
I should know I used to date a stylist
Still my heart sweats
Your heart is cold as ice girl
I should know I've been to the north pole
Your soul is black as death girl
I should know I have crossed the threshold
Your style is such a mess girl
I should know I used to date a stylist
Still my heart sweats
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
My heart sweats
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
My heart sweats
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
My heart sweats
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
My heart sweats
Your heart is cold as ice girl
I should know I've been to the north pole
Your soul is black as death girl
I should know I have crossed the threshold
Your style is such a mess girl
I should know I used to date a stylist
Still my heart sweats
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
Our hearts sweat
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
Our hearts sweat
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
Our hearts sweat
XOXOX XOX, some hearts bleed
Our hearts sweatEmbed
