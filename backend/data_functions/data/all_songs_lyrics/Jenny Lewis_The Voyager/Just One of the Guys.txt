Just One of the Guys Lyrics
All our friends, they're gettin' on
But the girls are still staying young
If I get caught being rude in a conversation
With a child bride on her summer vacation

No matter how hard I try to be just one of the guys
There's a little something inside that won't let me
No matter how hard I try to have an open mind
There's a little voice inside that prevents me

How I live, it got me here
Locked in this bathroom, full of tears
And I have begged for you and I have borrowed
But I been the only sister to my own sorrow

No matter how hard I try to be just one of the guys
There's a little something inside that won't let me
No matter how hard I try to have an open mind
There's a little clock inside that keeps ticking

There's only one difference between you and me
When I look at myself, all I can see
I'm just another lady without a baby
No matter how hard I try to be just one of the guys
There's a little something inside that won't let me
No matter how hard I try to have an open mind
There's a little cop inside that prevents me

I'm not gonna break for you
I'm not gonna pray for you
I'm not gonna pay for you
That's not what ladies do
Oh, when you break
When you break
Oh, when you break
Oh, when you break10Embed
