Slippery Slopes Lyrics
I am still into you
Dreams really do come true
I feel it everywhere
Even in my red hair

And if you don't wreck it, then I won't wreck it either
When I'm out on the road
If for just one second, he helps me to forget all about
Slippery slopes, whiskey and cloves

I see it happening
I'll get the golden ring
I want eternity
For her, you and me

And if you don't expect it, I won't expect it either
When we take off our clothes
If for just one second, she helps you to forget all about
Slippery slopes, mushrooms and coke

Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Is anyone listening?
There's joy that freedom brings
And I'll be a libertine
If she eats after me
'Cause if you don't express it, you will express it later
With who, God only knows
If for just one second, it helps us to remember
That we like each other the most
Sleeping with bros, slippery slopes1Embed
