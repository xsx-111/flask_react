Love U Forever Lyrics
When I met you, you were just a boy
And you were tongue-tied and wearing corduroy
When you kissed me, I was so annoyed
'Cause I was already gone

Call up your girlfriends, let's go out tonight
We're gonna drink ourselves some burgundy wine
Talk all about how we've saved the date
I can't believe I'm getting married in May

I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you 'til all the Polaroids fade

We were kids then - in the Daisy Age
And we wore peace signs as the riots blazed
When we candy-flipped, we'd stay out too late
'Cause we were already gone

Call up your girlfriends, let's go out tonight
I want to reminisce and get a little high
Talk all about how we've saved the date
I can't believe I'm getting married in May
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you 'til all our hair turns gray

Now we are living in Ladonia Estates
And we eat out every night and drink every day
But there are some things money cannot say
Like the feeling of hell in a hallway

I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever
I could love you forever1Embed
