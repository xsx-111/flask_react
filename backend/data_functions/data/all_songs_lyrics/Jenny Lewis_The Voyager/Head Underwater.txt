Head Underwater Lyrics
I been wearing all black since the day it started
When I stopped and looked back as my mind departed
I been losing sleep and I cannot sit still, oh
I'm not the same woman that you were used to, oh

I put my head underwater, baby
I threw my clothes away in the trash
I stood barefoot on the blazing concrete
I was waiting for the gut of the thunder to crash

I don't wanna bore you with how I feel
But when the walls came down, the shit got real, oh
I never thought I would ever be here
Looking out on my life as if there was no there, there

I messed around with somethin' I always hated
I took a blanket into the bath
Opened my eyes and hallucinated
I took a nap and woke up in the grass

There's a little bit of magic, everybody has it
There's a little bit of sand left in the hourglass
My own mortality, I contemplated
Down in the valley I got hypnotized
It left a mark that hasn't faded
That's when I realized

There's a little bit of magic, everybody has it
There's a little bit of sand left in the hourglass
There's a little bit of magic, everybody has it
There's a little bit of fight left in me yet

I put my head underwater, baby
I held my breath until it passed
Crossed my fingers and concentrated
I closed my eyes and I was free at last5Embed
