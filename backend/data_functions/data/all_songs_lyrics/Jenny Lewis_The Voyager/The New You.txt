The New You Lyrics
When the twin towers fell and it all went to hell
I knew you'd be leavin' me soon
It's what tore us apart, you perfected the art
Of making it all about you

But I can read your fortune
Just lay out your palm
Whatever you're avoiding
Will greet you at the dawn

'Cause it's a new you every day
Puttin' on a different face
And the farther that you run from it
How will you overcome it?
It's a new you every day

And you struggle with sobriety
Dreams of notoriety
Listening to Kill 'Em All
Tend for high society, social anxiety
We missed you at the Head Banger's Ball
But I can read your fortune
Just lay out your palm
Whoever you're avoiding
They will all sing along

'Cause it's a new you every day
Puttin' on a different face
And the farther that you run from it
How will you overcome it?
It's a new you every day

Where you come from
Gets the best of you

'Cause it's a new you every day
And when I loved you, I used to say
The farther that we run from it
How will we overcome it?
It's a new you every dayEmbed
