The Voyager Lyrics
By the time I got your letter
I had lost my mind, I was trippin'
When you're getting better, it's a jagged line
Nothing lasts forever when you travel time
I've been sippin' that Kool-Aid of the cosmos

'Cause the Voyager's in every boy and girl
If you wanna get to heaven, get out of this world
The Voyager's in every boy and girl

When it finally hit me, I did not cry
'Cause I was at the 7-Eleven
Flippin' through The New York Times
I saw it printed in black and white
The Voyager goes up in smoke

The Voyager's in every boy and girl
If you wanna get to heaven, get out of this world
You're the Voyager
You're the Voyager

You scared me straight
Right into your arms
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
The Voyager's in every boy and girl
If you wanna get to heaven, get out of this world
You're the Voyager
You're the Voyager, hey
You're the Voyager
I'm the VoyagerEmbed
