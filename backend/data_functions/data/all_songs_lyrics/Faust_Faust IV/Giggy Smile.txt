Giggy Smile LyricsPlease me baby tease me
And I love your giggy smile
Lots of naked Germans
Where at last we used to cry
Please me baby tease me
And I love your giggy smile
Lots of naked Germans
Where at last we used to cry
Better touch me before you go down
Better touch me before you go down
Please me baby tease me
And I love your giggy smile
Lots of naked Germans
Where at last we used to cry
Please me baby tease me
And I love your giggy smile
Lots of naked Germans
Where at last we used to cry
Better touch me before you go down
Better touch me before you go down
Kill me but don't kill me baby
Naked Lunch was fun
God it's crazy I'm so lazy
In the rising sun
Kill me but don't kill me baby
Naked Lunch was fun
God it's crazy I'm so lazy
In the rising sun
Better touch me before you go down
Better touch me before you go down
Kill me but don't kill me baby
Naked Lunch was fun
God it's crazy I'm so lazy
In the rising sun
Kill me but don't kill me baby
Naked Lunch was fun
God it's crazy I'm so lazy
In the rising sun
Better touch me before you go down
Better touch me before you go downEmbed
