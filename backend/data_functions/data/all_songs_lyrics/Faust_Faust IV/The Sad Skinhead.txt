The Sad Skinhead LyricsApart from all the bad times you gave me
I always felt good with you
Going places, smashing faces
What else could we do?
What else could we do?
Apart from all the good times I gave you
You always felt bad with me (with me)
I was nervous, you were nervous
What else could have happened to us?
What else could have happened to us?
Apart from all the bad times you gave me
I always felt good with you
Going places, smashing faces
What else could we do?
What else could we do?Embed
