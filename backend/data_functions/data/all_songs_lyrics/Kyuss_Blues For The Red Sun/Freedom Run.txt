Freedom Run Lyrics
Freedom run
Free to run
Freedom run
Free to run
Freedom run
Free to run
Freedom run
Free to run
Freedom run
Free to run
Freedom run
Free to run

No break through, I'll steal for you
I need ya, and there's nothin' you can do, yeah
Walked million miles of desert sun
To grasp the chance that I'll be gone
Be one with you, yeah

Freedom run
Freedom run
Freedom run
Freedom run
Well I'll break through
Will I steal for you?
Well I need ya, and there's nothin' you can do, yeah
No fun could last, well I hope you last
You're in my grasp, well no cure, yeah

Freedom run
Freedom run
Freedom run
Freedom runEmbed
