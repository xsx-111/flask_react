Thumb Lyrics
You don't seem to understand the deal
I don't give two shits on how you feel
You're burned by my lighter
You've been burned by my lighter
And my lighter is held down by my thumb

Living in thought so
Living in thought so
You're living in thought so

You tried to turn me off
But you couldn't even turn me down
As I said, then I told you were living in hell
You're on desert ground (You're on desert ground)
And now you've found (Now you've found)
Mouth open and kneelin'
Your sister caught in this well

You're living in thought so
You're living in thought so
You're living in thought soEmbed
