Thong Song Lyrics
I don't need a seance
I don't read grey lines
I signed it away
Way long
I hate, slow songs

Whoa yeah
I don't even care
Whoa yeah
I go over there

My hair is
Real long
No brains
Or brawn
No shoes
Just thongs
I hate, slow songs

Whoa yeah
You cry like I care
Whoa yeah
Buck naked and there...
Hooray for, hooray for you
Hooray for, hooray for you
Hooray for, hooray for you
Hooray for, hooray for you
Hooray for, hooray for you
Hooray for, hooray for youEmbed
