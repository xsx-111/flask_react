Writhe Lyrics
Everyone seem to be singin' for Satan
Guess I will too
What a joke, you make me laugh 'til I turn blue

Everyone’s hair is out to there
What a manly lookin' crew
I don’t think I'll tease my hair
I’d rather sit here, teasin' you

Won’t you writhe, like snakes down on the floor?
Out you go, and in come one hundred and more

I seem to’ve lost my cowboy boots
With green fringe runnin' down the side
My sewing machine has made me green
Cause my jeans didn’t turn out tight


And all these roads I turn for you
You keep my livin' alive
Your smile over-weighs the miles
And your kiss makes it worth the ride
Won’t you writhe, like snakes down on the floor?
Out you go, and in come one hundred and moreEmbed
