If She Wants Me LyricsI wrote a letter on a nothing day
I asked somebody 'Could you send my letter away'?
'You are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope'
I said goodbye to someone that I love
It's not just me, I tell you it's the both of us
And it was hard
Like coming off the pills that you take to stay happy
Someone above has seen me do alright
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
Upon your face, you may think you're alone but you may think again

If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang about and be there with my best friend
If she wants me
And far away somebody read the letter
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
For all your curious nerve and your passion
I'm going deaf, you're growing melancholy
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
But life is good and 'It's always worth living at least for a while'
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there with my best friend
If she wants me
If you think to yourself 'What should I do now'?
Then take the baton, girl, you better run with it
'Cause there is no point in standing in the past cause it's over and done
I took a book and went into the forest
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness so I went home
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there with my best friend
If she wants me
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there with my best friend
If she wants me
If she wants me, yeah
If she wants me, yeah
If she wants me, yeah2Embed
