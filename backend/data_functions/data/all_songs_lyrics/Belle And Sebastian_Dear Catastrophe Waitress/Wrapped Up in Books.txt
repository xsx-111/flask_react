Wrapped Up in Books LyricsIt was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I could see into your window although you’re far away
You were racing in a car
Beside a boy, you just don’t know if he is up for
What you have in mind
If he is up for what you have in mind
Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
But I never want to leave you
We’ve never had a fight
You should never split a pole
You should never split at all
I wish I had two paths I could follow
I’d write the ending without any sorrow
I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
I will wrap my hands around you
So I know it will be fine
We’ve got a fantasy affair
We didn’t get wet, we didn’t dare
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks
Summer’s hastening on
I’m trying to get a feeling from
The city but I’ve been unfaithful
I’ve been traveling abroad
We’ve got a fantasy affair
We didn’t get wet, we didn’t dare
But the fantasy remains
You better come back to Earth again
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks1Embed
