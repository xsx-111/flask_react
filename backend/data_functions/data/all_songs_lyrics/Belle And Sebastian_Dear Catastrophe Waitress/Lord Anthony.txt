Lord Anthony LyricsAnthony, bullied at school
Get your own back, now you are cool
Or are you scared?
Bunking off though you're a toff
It's all gone wrong again, you've got double maths
And the teacher's got no control
The boys will run riot, you will stay quiet
Or you will die
Tony at the back of the gym
Smoke another one, your chances are slim
'Cos here they come again
And they got you on the ground
Tasting blood again, at least it's your own
When will you realise it doesn't pay
To be smarter than teachers
Smarter than most boys?
Shut your mouth, start kicking the football
Bang on the teeth, you're off for a week boy
You may as well take it in the guts - it can't get worse
Take it in the guts - it can't get worse that this
Cause you'll soon be old enough to leave them
Without a notion of a care
You'll lift two fingers in the air to linger there
Tony, you're a bit of a mess
Melted Toblerone under your dress
If the boys could see you they would pass you right by
Blue mascara running over your eye
When will you realize it doesn't pay
To be smarter than teachers
Smarter than most boys?
Shut your mouth, start kicking the football
Bang on the teeth, you're off for a week boy
(Anthony it could be worse, Anthony it could be worse)
They call you Lord Anthony
But hey, it could be worse than (Anthony it could be worse)
Lord Anthony
But hey, it could be worse (Anthony it could be worse)
Lord Anthony
But hey, it kind of suits you anyway (Anthony it kind of suits you)
You'll soon be old enough to leave them
Without a notion of a care
You'll lift two fingers in the air to linger thereEmbed
