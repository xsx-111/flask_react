A Lifeless Ordinary (Need a Little Help) LyricsI didn't think I would make it
Thought everybody was against me
All those conquered eyes and Christmases alone
I never gave an honest answer
But I made a lot of angry organs
Are we copasetic? Are we behaving now?
Filling up on endless insights from other people's ugly insides
All this bitterness is starting to grow cold
When comfort is an empty evening hanging on to complications
Sometimes quicksand has a massive appeal to me
I wanna be somewhere else
I think I can figure it out
But I'm gonna need a little help to get me, need a little help to get me
I think I can figure it out
But I'm gonna need a little help to get me through it, to get me through it
I always knew I had the answer but I never understood the question
Indoor living lacerated to the bone
And now we've re-align the edges
I'm doing very well; I thank you
All this empathy is starting to wear me down
I wish I was someone else
I think I can figure it out
But I'm gonna need a little help to get me, need a little help to get me
I think I can figure it out
But I'm gonna need a little help to get me through it, to get me through it
I'll try to work this out, I'll try to get it on
I'll try to work this out, I'll try to get it on
(I'd like to tell you that I'm ready for whatever's coming)
(But to be honest, there's a part of me that loses control)
I'll try to work this out, I'll try to get it on
(I'd like to tell you that I'm ready for whatever's coming)
(But to be honest, there's a part of me that loses control)
I think I can figure it out
But I'm gonna need a little help to get me, need a little help to get me
I think I can figure it out
But I'm gonna need a little help to get me, need a little help to get me
I think I can figure it out
But I'm gonna need a little help to get me, need a little help to get me
Need a little help to get me, need a little help to get me through itEmbed
