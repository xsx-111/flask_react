The Weakends LyricsQuicksand as a coat of arms
Loose leaf, and some liquid fiction;
Last Rites every Friday night
Am I weaker with the lights on?
High tide tight around the neck;
The same song everybody's bleeding
What makes me so different?
The insides work the same
You ever fear the dark impressions of your future?
The slightest gravestone whisper?
The stillness of your heart?
I feel it growing dark
A fever inching deeper
A fever inching to the core
I'll kick tomorrow
Fight back at the pouring rain
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drain
I'll kick tomorrow
Fight back at the pouring rain
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drain
Shore lines all around the world
Bright lights and some heavy breathing
Lipstick and the dagger's kiss-
Just a figment of a feeling
Hands pressed up against the chest
Holding out for the big connection
Last lunge never looked so good
It's a junk show all the way
As years go crashing by
I think of all I've pondered
So many minutes squandered
So many things undone
I've tried to figure out
How many lives I've wasted waiting for the perfect time to start
I'll kick tomorrow
Fight back at the pouring rain
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drain
I'll kick tomorrow
Fight back at the pouring rain
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drain
I'll kick tomorrow...
I'll send the weak ends...
I'll kick tomorrow...
I'll send the weak ends...
I'll kick tomorrow...
I'll send the weak ends...
I'll kick tomorrow... (fight back at the pouring rain)
I'll send the weak ends... (fight back at the pouring rain)
I'll kick tomorrow
Fight back at the pouring rain
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drain
I'll kick tomorrow
Fight back at the pouring rain
I'll send the weak ends down the drain, down the drainEmbed
