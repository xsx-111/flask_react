Pulp Fiction Lyrics
Smoke and mirrors and everything nice
I wasn't married to the weekend
I was banking on the back end
Kamikaze and Miami Vice
She shook a few of my favorite things

Like Cloak and Dagger
So Seabury Quinn, I couldn't keep it all together
I was spooking in the end zone
Arigato
Go-go gadget arms
She only took me for 10,000 yen

It's like a bad dream
Something from the back of a magazine
Black and white and cheaply put together
Like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous
God damn, these killings are gorgeous

Darkened corners at every bend
I wasn't sucking down the poison
I was working on the Q.T
Shaky-shaky, all over the world
She tried to cartwheel at every turn
The creepy crawlies, a case of revenge
I had the martyrs that I bartered from the barons for the bandoliers
Karaoke, her feminine flaw
I had a feeling this was not the end

It's like a bad dream
Something from the back of a magazine
Black and white and cheaply put together
Like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous
And like a nightmare
Covering the tracks that had brought you there
Paranoid and frozen in the heathers
Like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous

Cave in, cave out
Nothing but nervous doubt
Waiting for the big bang to get me
Cave in, cave out
Nothing but nervous doubt
Waiting for the big bang to get me
Waiting for the big bang

Wrapped in plastic, we all get the end
She had to take it to the majors
Couldn't keep it on the down low
Silly rabbit
Good grief, tambi√©n
Another stiff at the scene of the crime

It's like a bad dream
Something from the back of a magazine
Black and white and cheaply put together
Like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous
And like a nightmare
Covering the tracks that had brought you there
Paranoid and frozen in the heathers
Like a slasher film
I'm torn in opposite directions
The plot sucks but the killings are gorgeous
God damn, these killings are gorgeousEmbed
