Her Words Destroyed My Planet Lyrics
Maybe you were right after all...
Maybe I'm just bad news...
I've been drowning in memories
Call it residual blues
I fell asleep watching Veronica Mars again
(Hey!)

I still futz with that tourniquet
I tried to squeeze on your dreams
Slung it on — it's a perfect fit
What do you suppose that means?
My parents keep asking when you're planning on coming around

If we'd only stayed together
I might not have fallen apart
But the words you served destroyed my planet
I stall before I start
I stall before I start anything at all

Got a job at Uncommon Grounds
I finally shaved off that beard
I sold my Xbox to Jimmy down the street
Hell, I even quit smoking weed
I'm taking an online course — I'm learning to speak Japanese
If we'd only stayed together
I might not have fallen apart
But the words you served destroyed my planet
I stall before I start
I stall before I start anything at all

The things that used to mean so much to me...
Have gone the way of dinosaurs, hopes and dreams, and everything
All I want for you to be is happy or something...
I guess anything is better than the time you spent hoping I'd get it sorted out

I sent you a post card
But the post office sent it back...
They said the building's been torn down
I just miss what I thought we would have

If we'd only stayed together
I might not have fallen apart
But the words you served destroyed my planet
It's all my fucking fault!
If we'd only stayed together
I might not have fallen apart
But the words you served destroyed my planet
I stall before I start
I stall before I start anything at allEmbed
