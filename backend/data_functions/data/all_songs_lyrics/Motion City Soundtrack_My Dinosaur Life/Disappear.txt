Disappear LyricsTo the deep end, to the hard line
Hold this trick together, man
Hold this trick together if you can
Little fevers wrapped in dedication
All strung out on novelty
Collapse yourself and try to comprehend:
An angry island, a bitter bee sting
Severing each artery to free the self and fix the in-betweens
Isolation
Mark the earth around you
Guess who's on the waiting list?
I'll let you in on something secret
I can disappear anytime I want to
Time, I feel you shovel through my skin
I am with you 'til the end
First, you breathe out
Then, you have to breathe in
Lash yourself repeatedly
Until it sticks, until it sticks under the eyelids
Carry on cadaver
Festering interiors
All hollow breech and vapor silhouette
Need medication, more medication
Coursing through your inner states
All matter gray, confused and counterfeit
Kamikaze
Sear the blood inside me
Guess who's got it figured out?
I'll let you in on something secret
I can disappear anytime I want to
Time, I feel you shovel through my skin
I am with you 'til the end
And I can decompose
When it suits me, I accelerate it
Wicked on all fours
I surrender to the storm
You'll never know how it feels
You'll never know how it feels
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I can disappear anytime I want to
Time, I feel you shovel through my skin
I am with you 'til the end
I can decompose
When it suits me, I accelerate it
Wicked on all fours
I surrender to the storm
I can disappear anytime I want to
Time, I feel you shovel through my skin
I am with you 'til the end
I'm with you 'til the endEmbed
