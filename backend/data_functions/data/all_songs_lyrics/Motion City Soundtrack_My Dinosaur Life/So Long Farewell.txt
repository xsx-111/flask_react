So Long Farewell LyricsI heard an angel sing hey-hey-hey
Made your Jesus and Mary ch-ch-chain
She was loaded and knocked out on the marble tiles again
I put an angel to sl-sl-sleep
Major feelings of feelings went cr-cr-creep
I was watching her kung-fu through the darkness and the dreams
I wonder why she's so fragile and I wonder why she never smiles
She's the saddest music in the world tonight
She had a fever burn-burn-burn
Holy watering eyeballs churn-churn-churn
She was violently comatose - the best part of the day
Several hours went by-by-by
She crawled out from the blankets and sigh-sigh-sighed
She clambered into purgatory once the sun went down
I wanted to help so badly
But my help just prolonged her descent
She's the saddest music in the world tonight
So long, farewell
May I see you when it's over
Good night, good luck
I hope it all works in your favor
So long, old friend
Take my words and think them over
So long, farewell
You're the saddest music in my world tonightEmbed
