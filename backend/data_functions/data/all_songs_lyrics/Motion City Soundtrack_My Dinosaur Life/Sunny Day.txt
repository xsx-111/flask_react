Sunny Day LyricsShe is the queen of anarchy, I am the only one who cares
I met her in Minnesota over some pizza and diet soda
She's into pain and Purple Rain
I'm into robots and music
We're drowning in Minnetonka, hoping to purify ourselves
And I sing
"Not that I am special, not that you're some work of art
Let's lose us some sleep and that is somewhere to start."
Let's get, physical!
Try and break our bones tonight
Let's share chemicals
Try and break our bones
Try and break our bones tonight
She is the gin and I'm vermouth in these mad cocktails of despair
We try hard to keep it sober until the evening just fucks us over
To tell the truth, we're badly bruised
There is no future and we both are thinkin'
"So this is my dinosaur life...so this is my dinosaur life."
I know that I'm not special and you are nobody's work of art
Let's lose us some sleep and that is somewhere to start
Let's get, physical!
Try and break our bones tonight
Let's share chemicals
Try and break our bones
Let's get, physical!
Try and break our bones all night
Try and break our bones tonight
Not that I am special, not that you're some work of art
Not that we're not perfect for each other's fucked-up hearts
Beating through the evening, bearing witness to the ceiling
Feeling alright
Let's get, physical!
Try and break our bones tonight
Let's share chemicals
Try and break our bones
Let's get, physical!
Try and break our bones all night
Try and break our bones
Try and break our bones
Try and break our bones tonightEmbed
