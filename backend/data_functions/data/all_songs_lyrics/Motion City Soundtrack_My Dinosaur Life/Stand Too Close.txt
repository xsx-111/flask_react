Stand Too Close LyricsIf I stand too close, I might fall in
But if I’m too far gone, I’ll never win
If you believe in me, I might just wanna spend some time with you again
I’m afraid I tend to disappear
Into an anxious state when you draw near
There is no reasoning; it’s quite a silly thing
But it’s the way I’ve been for years
So I will understand if you don’t stay
They say I’m great at first, but then the magic fades
Into an awful hue of dismal views and pessimistic attitude
All this distance...
Years of sweet resistance
Swirling overhead like angry clouds of discontent
I have apologized a billion times
When I've gone off the wall like Busta Rhymes
And pulled a stupid stunt that left you thinking there was something wrong with me
You’ve thrown a few choice phrases out my way
And I’ve ignored them all as best I could
Except that tiny bit — how I just can’t commit
There is some truth in what you say
All this distance...
Years of sweet resistance
Swirling overhead like angry clouds of disco
If I stand too close, I might fall in
But if I’m too far gone, I’ll never win
If you believe in me, I might just want to spend some time with you again
I'll spend some time with you again
If I stand too close, I might fall in
But if I’m too far gone, I’ll never win
If you believe in me, I might just want to spend some time with you again1Embed
