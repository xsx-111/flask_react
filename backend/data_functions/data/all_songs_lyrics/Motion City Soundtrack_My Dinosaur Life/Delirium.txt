Delirium Lyrics
There's a stain, there's a stain
There's a stain on the floor
I wanna soak, wanna scrub
Wanna clean it, and more
But all the nurses are refusing to let me out of bed
And my eyes are pouring nightly

There's a crowd, there's a crowd
There's a crowd on my ward
All full of joy, full of glee
Jubilation and more
These crazy stupid mother fuckers never leave me alone
And my lungs are wheezing slightly

There’s a buzz, there’s a buzz
There’s a buzzing of bugs
From flower beetles, yellow jackets
Silverfishes to slugs
It’s always raining caterpillars from the circular fan
And my heart is pounding brightly
I swim in pharmaceuticals
I swim in pharmaceuticals
The medicine deactivates the things I take
The things that take me
(Delirium)
I swim in pharmaceuticals
I swim in pharmaceuticals
The medicine deactivates the things I take
The things that take me

There’s a voice, there’s a voice
There’s a voice in my head
It’s rather soothing and it tells me I’d be better off dead
But if I beat it, maybe punch it, even kick it away
Then everything will be all rightly

I swim in pharmaceuticals
I swim in pharmaceuticals
The medicine deactivates the things I take
The things that take me
(Delirium)
I swim in pharmaceuticals
I swim in pharmaceuticals
The medicine deactivates
I didn’t know it was hot in the middle
I touched it once, then I touched it a second time
'Cause I am that naïve;
A myriad of bright ideas
I didn’t know I'd get caught in the middle
I touched it once, then I touched it a second time
'Cause I am that naïve;
A myriad of bright ideas

I swim in pharmaceuticals
I swim in pharmaceuticals
The medicine deactivates the things I take
The things that take me
(Delirium)
I swim in pharmaceuticals
I swim in pharmaceuticals
The medicine deactivates

I didn’t know it was hot in the middle
I touched it once, then I touched it a second time
'Cause I am that naïve;
A myriad of bright ideas
I didn’t know I'd get caught in the middle
I touched it once, then I touched it a second time
'Cause I am that naïve;
A myriad of bright ideasEmbed
