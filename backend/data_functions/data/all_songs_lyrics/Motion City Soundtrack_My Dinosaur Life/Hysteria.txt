Hysteria LyricsTick-tock, sweat, switch up the fingers
Those silly integers; always on vacation
I didn't think it was a bad idea
I just couldn't figure out how to make the phone work
That said, it was no different from the others
Except that this is now and that was then and everything
Seems to repeat in a cyclical pattern
I hum myself to misery and wish these words against my pillow
I will try not to lose control
Hysteria, hysteria, it's happening again
I fall apart, I fall apart, I'm back where I began
If it were anybody else but you, I would not be afraid
A total calamity, the choices I have made
Rip, scrape, slash, burn up the courage
That tawny yellow cat â€” always on vacation
I wish I hadn't been so damn obscure
I just tried too hard for the perfect word score
Can't stand it, end up cursing out the covers
A little J&B for restless leg in effigy
Damn you camera and your lack of emotion
I sling my blades at everyone
Collect their heads and run for cover
Hysteria, hysteria, it's happening again
I fall apart, I fall apart, I'm back where I began
If it were anybody else but you, I would not be afraid
A total calamity, the choices I have made
Come help me figure it out
Come help me get it right this time around
If you can figure it out
Then you could help me loosen up and get me off the ground
Hysteria, hysteria, it's happening again
I fall apart, I fall apart, I'm back where I began
If it were anybody else but you, I would not be afraid
A total calamity, the choices I have made
A total calamity, the choices I have made
A total calamity, the choices I have madeEmbed
