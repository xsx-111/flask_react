History Lesson LyricsWhat are you asking me for?
It’s not my god damn history
What do you hope to find here?
There’s nothing left as you can see
When the beatings all began, we'd begun to scream and run
But the current pulled us down
And the smallest ones were drowned
Now we sit and drink all day and sing their songs of praise
What are you asking me for?
It’s not my goddamn history
What do you hope to find here?
There’s nothing left as you can see
There was something in the waves that arrived to take our place
We were broken one by one by the angels in the sun
Now we sit and drink all day, telling tales of yesterday
And it always ends the same
What’re you asking me for?
It’s not my god damn history
What do you hope to find here?
I thought I'd made it crystal clear
We learned a lot about the art of contradiction
We learned a lot about the company we keep
We learned a lot about what keeps us all together
I am with you until the end
What are you asking me for?
What are you asking me for?
What are you asking me for? (It’s not my goddamn history!)
What are you asking me for? (It’s not my goddamn history!)
What are you asking me for? (It’s not my goddamn history!)
What are you asking me…
Let the beatings now beginEmbed
