Skin and Bones LyricsWhat if there's nothing more to me;
I'm just skin and bones
There's no mystery?
What if you're just an empty shell;
All your spare parts were used up by someone else?
What if there's no way to explain things like Déjà vu and acid rain?
What if we're all just broken shelves full of someone else's thoughts?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
What if there's nothing more to us
We're just carbon-based
We're just pixie dust?
What if life is a magic trick
Some quick sleight of hand just to make us think?
What if consciousness can't expand
And we fool ourselves with absurd demands?
What if there is no point at all;
We just grow up to fade away?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we get lost slowly drifting through these dead end lonesome heights?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
What if there's nothing more to me;
I'm just skin and bones?
What if there's nothing more to you?
What if there's nothing left for us?
Will anyone remember
Or does it all just simply turn to dust?
Will we be alright? (Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it tonight?)
Will we be alright, left alone tonight? (I can feel it, I can feel it, and the feeling is alright, alright.)
Will we be alright? (Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it tonight?)
Will we be alright? (I can feel it, I can feel it, and the feeling is alright.)
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we be alright? (Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it tonight?)
Will we be alright? (I can feel it, I can feel it, and the feeling is alright.)
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we get lost slowly drifting through these dead end lonesome heights?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?
Will we be alright, left alone tonight?Embed
