@!#?@! LyricsIn early '99, I beat the Ocarina of Time
I'm quite the legend in this town
My friends get wicked shit from all the foul-mouthed fools you roll with
Just push your luck, there will be blood
Most likely our own carnage
We all just wanna do our thing
Without the misery you bring
Go fuck yourselves
Leave us alone
You all need to go away, you motherfuckers
You all need to leave me and my homeboys alone
You all need to go away, you motherfuckers
You all need to leave me and my sensitive homeboys alone
I can't say that character would be one of your strongest assets
Not that we're perfect, merely extra-perfect
So don't think you know a thing about a thing you know nothing about
Go fuck yourselves
Leave us alone
You all need to go away, you motherfuckers
You all need to leave me and my homeboys alone
You all need to go away, you motherfuckers
You all need to leave me and my sensitive homeboys alone
When the fever hits the fan and you spout out your commands
Remember that we all feel the weather;
That we all feel the weathering hours of disconnect
Though we may fear the litmus test
Age-old harassments fuel this quest
For a better way to all stick together
Way to all stick together, you god damn hypocrites
You all need to go away, you motherfuckers
You all need to leave me and my homeboys alone
You all need to go away, you motherfuckers
You all need to leave me and my sensitive homeboys alone
