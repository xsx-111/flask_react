Oh No No No (studio out take) Lyrics
You think by leaving me
The sun will go away
You think that if you go
There'll be no other way
But your leaving now
Won't even spoil my day

Oh no no no
Oh no no no

You keep a-waiting for the tears
I'm supposed to cry
The promise leaves
So I'm supposed to die
I'd forgotten who you were
Until you dropped on by

Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
You think I'm guilty throwing
Off the likes of you
That there'll be no one else
But there'll be quite a few
At least I've got my head
But somehow I'll pull through

Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no

Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no no
Oh no no noEmbed
