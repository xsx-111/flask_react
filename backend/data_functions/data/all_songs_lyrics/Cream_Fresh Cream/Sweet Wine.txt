Sweet Wine LyricsWho wants the worry, the hurry of city life?
Money, nothing funny, wasting the best of our life
Sweet wine, haymaking, sunshine day breaking
We can wait 'til tomorrow
Car speed, road calling, bird freed, leaf falling
We can bide time
Sweet wine, haymaking, sunshine day breaking
We can wait 'til tomorrow
Car speed, road calling, bird freed, leaf falling
We can bide time
Who wants the worry, the hurry of city life?
Money, nothing funny, wasting the best of our lifeEmbed
