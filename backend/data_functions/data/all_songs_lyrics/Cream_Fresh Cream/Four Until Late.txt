Four Until Late LyricsFrom four until late
I was wringing my hands and crying
From four until late
I was wringing my hands and crying
I believe to my soul
That your daddy's Gulfport bound
From four until late
She made me a no-good barroom clown
From four until late
She made me a no-good barroom clown
You know, she won't do nothing
But tear a good man's reputation down
A woman is like a dresser
Some man always running through its drawers
A woman is like a dresser
Some man always running through its drawers
She cause so many men
To wear an apron overall
When I leave this town
I will bid you fare farewell
When I leave this town
I will bid you fare farewell
And when I return again
You'll have a great long story to tell1Embed
