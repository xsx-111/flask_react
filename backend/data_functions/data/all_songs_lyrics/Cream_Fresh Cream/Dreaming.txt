Dreaming LyricsDreaming about my love
You bring me joy and happiness
More or less
I dream my life away
Waiting for you to come
Changing my life and emptiness
Meaningless
Minutes just drift by
I don't care if I get nowhere
I can just dream, and you'll be there
What else is there to do?
Dreaming about my life
Where are you now, and when will you
Come to me?
I dream my life away
I don't care if I get nowhere
I can just dream, and you'll be there
What else is there to do?
Dreaming about my love
You bring me joy and happiness
More or less
I dream my life away
Dreaming, dreaming1Embed
