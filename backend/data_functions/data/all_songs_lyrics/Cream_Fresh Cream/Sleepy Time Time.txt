Sleepy Time Time LyricsI'm a sleepy time baby
A sleepy time boy
Work only maybe
Life is a joy
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
Sleepy time time
Sleepy time time all the time
Asleep in the daytime
Asleep at night
Life is all playtime
Working ain't right
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
Sleepy time time
Sleepy time all the time
I have my Sunday
That ain't no lie
But on Monday morning
Comes my favourite cry
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
We'll have a sleepy time time
Sleepy time time
Sleepy time all the timeEmbed
