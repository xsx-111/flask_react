Saku Lyrics
Shouldn't be the one who's alone
I deserve somebody
Can't say that the feeling was strong, oh no
Know you're thinkin' of me

I just need to feel what I felt before
Can you help me feel what I'm waitin' for?
I just need to feel everything before
Can you help me feel what I'm searchin' for?

Shouldn't keep the feelin' alive, but I want you
Can't let it control me
I just wanna leave it behind
Just tell me, how can I be set free?

But I need to feel what I felt before
Can you help me feel what I'm waitin' for?
I just need to feel everything befor–µ
Can you help me feel what I'm searchin' for?Embed
