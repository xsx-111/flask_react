All Time LyricsReflecting on whatâ€™s been
Though past will be future
When again yesterday to be made
For me hazy times, fume all around
Burning grass in a field of endless supplies
Tall people casting shadows on the short
Little people running circle round the wide
Lazy times, waste it well
What better to do with my mind
Crazy times, no rhythm too hard
Deep corners and people with my time
Over ground in joy
In clouds sunlit, snow untouched
Make pure silhouette, catches steam grass and dew
Rays not harm the upward gaze
Hosts bring out a game of open fields on the box
Watch the guests who bring the heat of outside
Flag of faith for boundaries to fight
The young so wise before their time
My time, Your time, All time
My time, Your time, All time
Over ground in joy
In clouds sunlit, snow untouched
Make pure silhouette, catches steam grass and dew
Rays not harm the upward gaze
Rhythm to your right rhyme the other side
Expression outside and poetry inside
Pleasure to your touch, taste of heaven on your mind
And colours before your very eyesEmbed
