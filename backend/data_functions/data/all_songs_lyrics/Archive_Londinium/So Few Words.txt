So Few Words Lyrics
So few words
So few words

We are movin' round to the hour
Force from the power
Thunder reigns down in a mass mind shower
Levellin' vibes unravellin' scribes
Take a venomous sting that's unsettlin'
But consequences awaits me around the corner
Reminiscent of my twistin' fate
All down to the fact it's a hard life
Travel on with the sense of a telling adventure
So as I wait for the opportune time to create
Soul energy that will then enable me to realise
Analyse all aspect of man-made decision
The vision the many ways
Wrong turn right, right turn... left
Ain't no way back straight ahead along track
Counteract react higher pace embrace
Expression when written on the face
Ya babblin' on flip automatic overide
So when pride gets swallowed
Check the events that follow
Interconnection bafflin' coincidence
All going hand in hand
They demand supply I deliver my peace
In what can be known as my only release
In the bellyfull beast tearin' up
And it's a cryin' shame it remains the same
Turn the next page over
So few words
So few words

Then on straight down
Thru the valley I roam
Lay claim my terrain thru my artery vein
But first intuition state my incondition is the reason
Why you'll never get my submission
True as I'm present in time
I'm headlin' for the future
Movin' with a haste from time to waste
Break loose from a goose chase
What I do I take feathers and fly in spiritual sky
Return to ground zero zero
Now for the intrepid hero
Non-sense there will be no
I overrun cos unless I'm in a situation
I can learn a lesson in
One specimen away say a line refine
Humanity race ever being like one of a kind
Now we can never rewind so press
Forward to the end
With the passionate fruit from mother nature
So few words
So few wordsEmbed
