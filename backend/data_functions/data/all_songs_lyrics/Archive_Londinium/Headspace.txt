Headspace LyricsGo away, go away
You fill my head space
With evil thoughts unkind
I can do without
You move with hate
Your darkness my light cannot take
You deceive without a second thought
I receive, my heart an open world
You say you hurt yourself when you fuss around
But I feel your soul penetrate
When your gaze, your touch
With desire on another domain
I say to myself walk tall, head held high
Donâ€™t look behind, not good things to find
Go ahead taste with your eyes
Feel with your head and think with your heart
Look up to celebrate with nails blood red
See a moon halfway clear in the sky
I wonder if you do from underground...Embed
