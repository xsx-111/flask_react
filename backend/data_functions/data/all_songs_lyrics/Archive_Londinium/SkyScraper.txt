SkyScraper LyricsOne man climbs higher then one bites dust
Thru the dark hours in dark towers we trust
Forever the rays of light will energise my
Born ability mind stability much creativity
39 steps 22 catch boxed in
Tales of the city we are lost in
Living in a haze I'm amazed by the ways in the days
Of forever go non stop pressure
The risking obelisks stands stable in the skyline
You will find icon is symbol and symbol is sign
Higher aspect looking down over the horizon
The cloud nine zero back down to the ground
Skyscraper you will never feel
What it's like to be, or how it seems to me
It's all man-made material
Scribbled down by the architect
Just parallel lines on the paper
Surrounded by walls that vary in size
Still they cast an intimidating image in my eyes
But ya concrete block will never rock my stone
Inya zone I'm unbreakable able to resist
Overthe stage in timea newer age
And still I'm in a rage of dilemma
Minds eye spray gamma hammer nail
Again it presents itself
What's life like upon the top shelf ?
It really doesn't matter if I'm any
Lesser than your higher status
See the press haven't you heard the latest
The greatest thing about being 'I' is me
And what I really can be I never
Run you never ran me
I stand my ground found solid stance
Never take a step back move forward
Remember this skyscraper ya building blocks
Will trickle down like sands of time
So roll the dice then pay the priceEmbed
