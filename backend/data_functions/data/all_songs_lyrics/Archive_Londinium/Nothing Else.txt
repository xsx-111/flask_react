Nothing Else Lyrics
My Angel, clipped wings I know
Wanders in darkness, on grimy ground
In a forest, unclean, unsound
Everything, everything's gone wild
Make land for the cows to graze
Leaflets scatter around to advertise
Sellout
A swamp, in it hands streched out
To catch a passing dime
Donations to the rich
Widened pavements for the poor
Somewhere else to lie
But my friend the carriage door
Stands slightly ajar
And I know clipped wings make uneasy flight
But we've gotta reach

A place where the feast never ends
A moment when the music celebrates
In a time when darkness belongs
To night skies and
Nothing else, no
Nothing else
Tomorrow my spirit's seen
Fears today my mind
Soul aches so deep
Always craves my body to reach

A place where the feast never ends
A moment when the music celebrates
And a time when darkness belongs
To night skies and
Nothing else, no
Nothing else1Embed
