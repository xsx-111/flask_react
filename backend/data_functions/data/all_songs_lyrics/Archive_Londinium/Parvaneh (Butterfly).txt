Parvaneh (Butterfly) LyricsI lie on my blue sheet so blue
Wait for sunrise and wait it brings
Wait for tomorrows I look to find
So tired sleep rest in peace
Let the wind fulfil your dreams
Let the sea heal your wounds
Tell the trees secrets so deep
In a kaftan of leaves I float
Sunrise bought me the peace I sought
I fly with no form to tie me down
I'm free to live, to live
To let the wind heal my wounds
To let the sea fulfil my dreams
And heart the trees secrets so deep
Don't let them tie you down
Fly where you pleaseEmbed
