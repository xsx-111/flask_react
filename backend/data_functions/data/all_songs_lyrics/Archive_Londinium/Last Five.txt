Last Five Lyrics
Hell was a place I knew a long time ago
Everything was dark, there were mazes all around
Here is where I am, here is where I was
Here is where I don't want to be
Hell was a place I found by mistake
A garden's secret yet inviting door
Leading to a place
I'm finding hard to let go

From the downside to the upside
From the inside to the outside
There I'll be making my vocabulary overstand this
Ain't no mountain high enough, valley low enough
I will cross over the wake and take it all
Inside stride seven cracks in the walls of ya concrete
Roots to mother nature found the foundation
Separating us with characterization
Sensation in my body feel life never tires
And the ways of the world inspire
Myself an entire being is fact
Ancient artifact shows a generation, try and understand
And a man-made decision in division all men
Then again when or why must eye reign speech
Everyone and each must reach for the step
They wanna climb to there is always time to
Lift an uplift with the gift we are all blessed
Lesson and test much more and no less
