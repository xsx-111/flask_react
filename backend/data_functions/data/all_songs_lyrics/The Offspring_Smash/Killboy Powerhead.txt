Killboy Powerhead Lyrics
He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer step
He always busts his knuckles
When he's wrenching up his shit

He's a Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead
Killboy Powerhead, yeah

You know, I saw his woman
She was writing his name in blood
You know, I saw his woman
Hard as a rock
She said she was his baby
Who looked just like the Hoover Dam
You know, I saw his woman
Hard as a rock



Killboy Powerhead, yeah
He's a Killboy Powerhead, yeahEmbed
