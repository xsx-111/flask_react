Smash Lyrics

Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now, I don't wanna do it no more
I held it all in with blood on my face
Built it up, man, so bad, you can taste
I don't slag no one, I don't even judge
Don't give me shit ’cause I'm not gonna budge
I just wanna be who I wanna be
Guess that's hard for others to see

I'm not a trendy asshole
Do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
’Cause I am alive

Smash is the way you feel all alone
Like an outcast, you're out on your own
Smash is the way you deal with your life
Like an outcast, you're smashing your strife
Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now, I don't wanna do it no more
I just wanna be who I wanna be
Guess that's hard for others to see
I'm not a trendy asshole
Do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
’Cause I am alive


Head over heels, I've fit in before
Now, I don't wanna do it no more
I just wanna be who I wanna be
Guess that's hard for others to see

I'm not a trendy asshole
Do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
I'm not a trendy asshole
Do what I want, do what I feel like
I'm not a trendy asshole
Don't give a fuck if it's good enough for you
’Cause I am alive, I am alive
I am alive
There. I hope you enjoyed our time together today. You know, it seems harder and harder to just sit back and enjoy the finer things in life
Well, till next time... ta-ta!
