Bad Habit Lyrics
Hey, man, you know I'm really okay
The gun in my hand will tell you the same
But when I'm in my car, don't give me no crap
â€™Cause the slightest thing and I just might snap

When I go driving, I stay in my lane
But getting cut off, it makes me insane
I open the glove box, reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

I guess I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away (Yeah, Yeah)
I got a bad habit (Yeah, Yeah)
And it ain't goin' away (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, Yeah)

They say the road is a dangerous place
If you flip me off, I'll get in your face
If you drive on my ass, your foot's on the gas
And your next breath is your last
I guess I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away (Yeah, Yeah)
I got a bad habit (Yeah, Yeah)
And it ain't goin' away (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, Yeah)

Drivers are rude
Such attitudes
But when I show my piece
Complaints cease
Something's odd
I feel like I'm God
You stupid dumbshit goddam motherfucker!

I open the glove box
Reach inside
I'm gonna wreck this fucker's ride

I guess I got a bad habit
Of blowin' away (Yeah, Yeah)
I got a bad habit (Yeah, Yeah)
And it ain't goin' away (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, Yeah)
Yeah, oh6Embed
