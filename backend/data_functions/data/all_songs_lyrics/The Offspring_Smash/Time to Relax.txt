Time to Relax Lyrics
Aah, it's time to relax
And you know what that means
A glass of wine, your favorite easy chair
And of course, this compact disc playing on your home stereo
So go on, and indulge yourself... that's right!
Kick off your shoes, put your feet up
Lean back and just enjoy the melodies
After all, music soothes even the savage beast3Embed
