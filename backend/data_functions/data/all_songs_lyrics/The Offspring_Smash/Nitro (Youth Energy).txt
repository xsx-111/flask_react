Nitro (Youth Energy) Lyrics
Our generation sees the world
Not the same as before
We might as well just throw it all
And live like there is no tomorrow

There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow

We are the ones who are living
Under the gun every day
You might be gone before you know
So live like there is no tomorrow

(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life)
There's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna live it for me)

Hey, believe it
The official view of the world has changed
(In a whole new way)
Live fast â€™cause if you don't take it
You'll never make it
So if you understand me
And if you feel the same
Then you will know what nitro means
You'll live like there is no tomorrow

There's no tomorrow...3Embed
