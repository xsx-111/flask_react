The Jessica Numbers Lyrics
Let me through
Paper in fist
Jessica numbers, tell me if
We're clear
Write me a storm
Just tape the letter to the door

This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition

Brave under the role
Jessica numbers to the wall
Slip through
Ever the thief
It's posted  but we'll see

This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition

Push me through
Counting the lines
Measuring all my shadows by
Old star
Shift into red
Just take the numbers to the bed
Head-tripping on
The sadness as it passes
Ask her to cross
The window frosting out
Starting to feel
The kicking here at last, yeah
Something worth keeping an eye on...

Let me through
Paper in fist
Jessica numbers, give me lift
Let's fall
Look where we land
Just write the answer on my hand

This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition


This thing is your mission
The lone wish and condition
Jessica numbers, are we due?
Jessica numbers, are we due?
Jessica numbers, are we due?Embed
