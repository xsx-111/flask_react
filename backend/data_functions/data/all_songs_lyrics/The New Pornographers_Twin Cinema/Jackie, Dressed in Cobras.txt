Jackie, Dressed in Cobras Lyrics
Look, we've seen this kind of thing before:
Jackie threats with cobras at the door
Don't live your life inside an arrow
Filled with glances
You look sick, you've had your chances
Yes, you've had 'em
Yes, you've had 'em
Yes, you've had 'em

On a train devouring the land
There's a kid going insane over her man
Insane over her man
Insane over her

Look, we've seen this kind of thing before
Orchids hanging from the reverend's door
And if he hollers, let him out
'Cause he's going to shout
She's something and the way she moves
Just shouldn't be allowed, oh

Wrecked on the jungle floor
Jackie's dressed in cobras
Giving me ideas
What I really need now is ideas
Look, we've seen this kind of thing before:
Vampires float across the ballroom floor
The snake has blood that's squeezed for dancing
You look sick, you've had your chances
Yes, you've had 'em
Yes, you've had 'em
Yes, you've had 'em

On a train devouring the land
There's a kid going insane over her man
Insane over her man
Insane over her
On a train devouring the land
There's a kid going insane over her man
Insane over her man
Insane over her
On a train devouring the land
There's a kid going insane over her man
Insane over her man
Insane over her

Wrecked on the jungle floor
Jackie's dressed in cobras
Wrecked on the jungle floor
Jackie's dressed in cobras
Wrecked on the jungle floor
Jackie's dressed in cobras1Embed
