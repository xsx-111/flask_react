Streets of Fire Lyrics
Come on, come out of the rain
You're not impressed, you're just too learned
I took the book, I lit the page
Your sabbatical was burning

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Let's sully every stage
Lick my lips and twist my hips
But Contessa, I already did

Some things work, but me, I choose to lose my skin in the dirt
This whiskey priest, he burned the church to keep his girls alive

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Let's sully every stage we meet
Lick my lips and twist my hips
But Contessa, I already did

Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the street
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet fires in the streetEmbed
