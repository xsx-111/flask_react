Three or Four Lyrics
Give me a home where the past won't pay no mind
In case I'm bringing my own
Bring me a team of replacements
Just in case the place I'm taking's my own, own, own
Own, own, own

Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us

Tell me I'm numb, I'll be back in just a shake
To see how my babies have grown
Circle the chairs to protect us from the law
In case you needed my own, own, own
Own, own, own

Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us

Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of us
Three or four out of usEmbed
