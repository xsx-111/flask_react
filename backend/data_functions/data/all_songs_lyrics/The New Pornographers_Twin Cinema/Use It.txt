Use It Lyrics
The cat calls through the night
And two chicks in the parking lot
Crack wise on the price of fame
They stood to gain
The phone book's been ripped off
And two shapes in the dark
Across the way know the price of flight
Its weight and size
If you've got something
That sheds some light

Use it tonight, tonight

Heads down thumbs up
Two sips from the cup of human kindness
And I'm shit faced, just laid to waste
So wait here, wait up
Stock tips from the credit checks
Come next in the logic's line
All on my dime
If you've got will and a little time

Use it tonight, tonight
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right

Phantom of the heart
Four beats from the party line
Been mine since I was a child
It just grew there wild
So heads down thumbs up
Four beats from the starting line
Get set to exercise your right
Use it tonight
If there's a choice between a chance and flight

Choose it tonight, tonight

You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right
You had to send a wrecking crew after me
I can't walk right
I can't walk right
Use it tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Night
