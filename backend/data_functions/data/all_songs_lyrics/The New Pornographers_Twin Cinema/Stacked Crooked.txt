Stacked Crooked Lyrics
I counted on my private Altamont
Trusted it all along but now I'm on my way
We left the house, your fingers in my mouth
Stacked crooked all along but now I'm on my way
Stacked crooked all along but now I'm on my

Way-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The force left through the red light of the hours
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it
The vantage falling from the ivory tower
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it

You clipped and tossed your cryptic crossword locks
Union abandoned talks and now it's hard to say
While we would wake in smoke-and-mirror states
Stacked crooked all along but now I'm on my way
Stacked crooked all along but now I'm on my
Way-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The force left through the red light of the hours
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it
The vantage falling from the ivory tower
I tried to imagine it
I couldn't imagine it

Do not do not deny me, tonight I lost a deal
Do not do not deny me my Achille's heel
Do not do not deny my attention to detail
Do not do not deny me the clicking of the heels
Do not do not deny me, deny my loss of feel
Do not do not deny me my Achilles' heel
Do not do not deny my attention to detail
Do not do not deny me the clicking of the heelsEmbed
