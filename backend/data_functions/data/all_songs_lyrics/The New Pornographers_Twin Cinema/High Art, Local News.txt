High Art, Local News LyricsIn a good girl new world, teaming with you, filled to the roof
To make high art, mad love, nightly news
Skip the reviews
They don't want to be known, don't want it read
"It's just something that's floating in somebody's head"
So let me, princess, print this. Let me, princess, print this
In a postcard parkside rendez-vous, teaming with you
To make high art based on walking the dog
Walking through fog
And please skip the reviews, because someone you've met's
Become something exploding in somebody's head
Let me, princess, print this. Let me, princess, print this
It leaves voices in people
In a countdown downtown
Total eclipse, big as the Ritz
You find new signs
No time
Some you could use
Lost in your shoes
But don't skip the reviews, we don't want it said
"It's just something that's floating in somebody's head"
Let me, princess, print thisEmbed
