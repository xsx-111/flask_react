Broken Breads Lyrics
I could have lived without the whores and their monies
I suppose that father knows best (where the wind blows)
You could always see into the dark for miles around
My job was to try and make a sound
Then

I heard the call of, I heard the call to, screaming "I don't wanna"
I saw the girls, the new world minstrels, whispering "I don't wanna"
Tormented kings, your children of the earth sing:
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"
Under an embalmed clear sky
Under an embalmed clear sky

I foresee that you'll be weakened, the children of New York, gosh
And I can tell you can't live without it
Who was I to come between a whore and her money?
Yes, there is a war: boys versus girls, clowns versus their curls

"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"

I invested well and heavily into your antics
I requested "Suicide Blonde" loudly
Yes, there is a war, it's much like the one I've been waiting for:
Boys versus girls, clowns versus their curls
I heard the call of, I heard the call to, screaming "I don't wanna"
I saw the pearls, the new world minstrels, whispering "I don't wanna"
Tormented kings, your children of the earth sing:
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"
Under an embalmed clear sky
Under an embalmed clear sky

I heard the call of, I heard the call to, screaming "I don't wanna"
I saw the pearls, the new world minstrels, whispering "I don't wanna"
Tormented kings, your children of the earth are singing:
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"
"La dadadada dada dai dai dai dai"Embed
