Sing Me Spanish Techno Lyrics
Don't you know
After picking the glass off the ground
Don't you know
After shaking the thing for a sound
Do we see what the clock makes you do
But I won't let this happen to you

In a town
Where I lost every shirt on the fence
Don't you know
I am bleeding a trail through the lens
When I see what I now know is you
I was caught in the eye as you came
Pulled by my name
I'm fallin' through

Traveling at godspeed
Over the hills and trails
I have refused my call
Pushin' my lazy sails
Into the blue flame
I want to crash here right now
The hourglass spills its sand
If only to punish you
For listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song
Sing me Spanish techno

Listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song
Sing me Spanish techno

Don't you know
After wiring the thing to explode
Wired for sound
Wide awake here for days in a row
Now we see what the engine can do
And I won't let this happen to you
I won't let this happen to you
Traveling at godspeed
Over the hills and trails
I have refused my call
Pushin' my lazy sails
Into the blue flame
I want to crash here right now
The hourglass spills its sand
If only to punish you

For listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song
Sing me Spanish techno

Listenin' too long
To one song
Listenin' too long
To one song
Sing me Spanish technoEmbed
