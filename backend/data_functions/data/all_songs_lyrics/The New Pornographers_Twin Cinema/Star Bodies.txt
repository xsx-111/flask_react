Star Bodies Lyrics
On a tear, under siege, under oath, Anna Lee
Won't you come strap yourself to my side?
With our grill in disguise, we've got more lives than I
Ever dreamed you could own at one time

There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom

For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning

On a tear, cautiously we advance, Anna Lee
Won't you come pass the torch? Bring your hands
Yes and no, there's no right, but we have no better light
To see through to our star bodies go

There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom
For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning

Now, take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister lives

On a tear, far from home by a thread
Anna Lee, what's been said has to stay between us
Call me over, I trust we lay here
'Til we must make our break to our star bodies go

There's a shake with the shock and a gift off with them
They carry the dust of the failing wisdom

For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning
'Til we skip through the towns to the bright, sweet, passed on
And bury the dust of the failing wisdom

For you, there's not any warning
For you, there's not any warning
And love is five in the morning
For you, there's not any warning

Now, take me to where your sister lives
Take me to where your sister livesEmbed
