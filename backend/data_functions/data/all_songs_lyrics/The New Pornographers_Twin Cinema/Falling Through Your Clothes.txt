Falling Through Your Clothes Lyrics
Pinwheel, spark, break loose and roll
Where you stop nobody knows
Just a thought, but goddamn
It's been carved into a point, understand?

Turned into someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only know
When you're falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only know
When you're falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Turn, run, run, deep breath, then jump
Roll with your vertigo stomp
Now you're clear, but goddamn
You've been cleared of every charge, understand?

You've turned into someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only know
When you're falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only
Someone that you only know
When you're falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothes
Falling through your clothesEmbed
