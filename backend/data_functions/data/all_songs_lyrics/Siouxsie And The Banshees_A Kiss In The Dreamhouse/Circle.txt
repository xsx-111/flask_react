Circle LyricsPretty girl of 16 has fun and runs crazy
Ruined girl of 16, now a mother, grows lazy
Next a 16-year old baby like mother, grows lazy
And her stomach is churning
Whilst her eyes keep on turning
Round and around, round and around
Getting no higher from the ground
Round and around, round and around
The circle has an empty sound
Father inflicts discipline, boy rebels against him
He leaves for the big town for love and adventure
But the words he first heard, unlike his instincts, run deeper
Now boy beats his children
If they disobey him
And the cat riddled with worms chases his tail
Round and around, round and around
Getting no higher from the ground
Round and around, round and around
The circle has an empty sound
The endless full circle for the next in line
The endless full circle take the red line
The green line, the silver or blue
Any line you can think of except for the yellow
Take a trip with your family
And see where they go
Give them a free ticket
It's the best thing to do
And if you wind up on the circle line
Hell, it's not from lack of options
Then if you run into the yellow
Well, that's up to you
Round and around, round and around
Getting no higher from the ground
Round and around, round and around
The circle has an empty sound
The circle has an empty sound
Round and around, round and around
Round and around, round and around
Round and around, round and around
Round and around and around
The endless full circle for the next in line
The endless full circle, are you the next in line?
Round, round and round and around and around
Round and around and around and around
Round and around and around and around and aroundEmbed
