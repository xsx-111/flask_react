Green Fingers Lyrics
Hibiscus head
In a flower bed
A finger hewn
Planted and sewn

Oh, magic in her hands
She could make anything grow
Magic in her hands
She had green fingers

It's curious where animals don't go
Mandrake rooted deep into the soil
Where the sun won't fall but it flourishes
See the pretty maids all in a row

Magic in her hands
She could make anything grow
Magic in her hands
She had green fingers

It's reaching and groping
A clammy handshake clawing the ivy
Crawling the tightrope along the lattice work
With this hand I thee wed, with this hand I thee bed
With this hand I
With this hand, ohh
With this hand I
With this hand
Ohh, with this hand
With this hand
With this hand
With this hand I
With this hand
With this hand
With this hand IEmbed
