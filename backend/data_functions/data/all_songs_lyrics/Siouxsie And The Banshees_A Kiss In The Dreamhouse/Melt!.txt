Melt! Lyrics
You are the melting men
You are your situation
There is no time to breathe
And yet one single breath
Leads to an insatiable desire
Of suicide in sex

So many blazing orchids burning in your throat
Making you choke, making you sigh, sigh in tiny deaths

So melt!
My lover, melt!
She said melt!
My lover, melt!

You are the melting men
And as you melt
You are beheaded
Handcuffed in lace and blood and sperm

Swimming in poison gasping in the fragrance
Sweat carves a screenplay of discipline and devotion
So melt!
My lover, melt!
She said melt!
My lover, melt!

Can you see?
See into the back of a long, black car
Pulling away from the funeral of flowers
With my hand between your legs
Melting

She said melt!
My lover, melt!
She said melt!
My lover, melt!
So Melt!
My lover, melt!
She said melt!
My lover, melt!1Embed
