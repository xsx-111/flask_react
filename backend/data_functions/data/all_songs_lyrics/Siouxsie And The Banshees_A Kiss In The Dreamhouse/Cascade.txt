Cascade Lyrics
Oh the air was shining
Shining like a wedding ring
Barbed like sex, I felt 10,000 volts
My chest was full of eels, pushing through my usual skin
I opened up new wounds
Pouting, shouting

Oh, love like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Oh, lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades

The Sun was rich, rich with a song of sin
My breath melted my words into strange alphabets
Tormenting my tongue
Pouting, shouting

Oh, love like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Oh, lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades
The heartbeats were echoing
Echoing the revolver
Emptying into my mouth
I pulled a face from my pocket
And smiled a Leper's grin
I felt somebody close
Oh, pouting, shouting

Oh, love like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Oh, lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades, ohh
Oh, love like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Oh, love, lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades, ohh

Love like liquid falling
Falling in cascades
Lovelorn victims
Laughing in cascades
Oh, love like liquid falling down
I'm falling in cascades
Oh, lovelorn victims
Laughing, laughing in cascades
In cascades
In cascades,  in cascadesEmbed
