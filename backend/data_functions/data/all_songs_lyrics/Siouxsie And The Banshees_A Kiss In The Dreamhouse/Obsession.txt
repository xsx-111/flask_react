Obsession LyricsDo you hear this breath?
It's an obsessive breath
Can you feel this beat?
It's an obsessive heartbeat
Waiting to be joined with its obsession
I close my eyes but I can't sleep
The thin membrane can't veil the branded picture of you
The signs and signals show
The traffic lights say go
Again you baffle me
Pretending not to see, oh, me
I broke into your room, I broke down in my room
Touched your belongings there and left a lock of my hair
Another sign for you
You screamed into my face "get the hell out of my place"
Another sign for me?
Can you forgive me?
For not understanding your ways
You know sometimes you take it all too far
Then I remember it's a game between you and me
A divine test for us two
It's all in my imagination
Yes, they even say that our mission
Is only my obsession
Do you hear this breath?
It's an oppressive breath
Suffocating in the poison
Of your obsession
Can you feel this beat?
It's a possessive beat
Your pulse stops in the claws
Of your obsession
The signs and signals show
The traffic lights say go
Again you baffle me
Pretending not to see, oh, meEmbed
