Painted Bird Lyrics
On lead-poisoned wings
You try to sing
Freak beak shrieks are thrown
At your confusing hue
The peacock screaming eyes
Show no mercy
Oh, no mercy

Painted bird
It's absurd
Just a tainted bird
Hurting their twisted nerve
Painted bird
It's absurd
Just a tainted bird
Hurting their twisted nerve
Painted bird

The flock will make you choke
On this sadistic joke
And the whippoorwills
They make a din
In laughing unison
You're hitchcock carrion
In laughing unison
You're hitchcock carrion, carry on
Painted bird
It's absurd
Just a tainted bird
Hurting their twisted nerve
Painted bird
It's absurd
Just a tainted bird
Hurting their twisted nerve
Painted bird

I hear your sorrow
Maybe tomorrow
You'll lose your sorrow
When a fated weather will cleanse away
That painted feather
And all that sorrow, sorrow, sorrow
Ooh

A coquette in fur
Purr for the painted bird
Confound that dowdy flock
With a sharp-honed nerve
Because we're painted birds
By our own design
By our own design
And there's no more sorrow, sorrow, sorrow
Have you heard
About the painted bird
Just a tainted bird
Hurting their twisted nerve
We've lost our sorrow
Now it's tomorrow-morrow
No need to hide your feather
Until a fated weather
No more sorrow, sorrow
We've lost our sorrow
Now we're painted birds
Mocking that twisted nerve
Painted birds
It's absurd1Embed
