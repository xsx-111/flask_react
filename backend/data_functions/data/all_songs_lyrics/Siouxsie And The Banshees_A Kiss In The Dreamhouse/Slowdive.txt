Slowdive LyricsGet your head down to the ground
Shake it all around, a dirty sound
Put your knees into your face
And see if you can race real slow
It's a slow dive
When you die slow
Oh, it's a low jive
Do the slow dive
Get your head down to the ground
Shake it all around, a dirty sound
Put your knees into your face
And see if you can race real slow
Now you jump back like a hound
Emit a howling sound
Dig those limbs into the floor
And holler out for more
And you revel in the dips
When your backbone slips
Taking honeysuckle sips
From your rolling hips
It shifts and it shifts
It's a slow dive (a slow dive)
When you die slow
It's a low jive
Do the slow dive
It's a slow dive (a slow dive)
When you come alive
It's a low jive
Do the slow dive
Slow dive, slow dive
Do the slow dive
Slow dive, slow dive
Do the slow dive
Slow dive, slow dive
Do the slow dive
Slow dive, slow dive
When you die slow
When you come alive
It's a low jive
Do the slow dive
Slow dive, slow dive
Get your head down to the ground
Shake it all around, a dirty sound
Put your knees into your face
And see if you can race real slow
It's a slow dive
When you die slow
Oh, it's a low jive
Do the slow diveEmbed
