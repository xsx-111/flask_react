Cocoon LyricsHere in my cot where my cot loves me
I'll stay here a while in the cotton wool cocoon
'Til the chrysalis is ripe
'til the time is right
With this feeling of insecurity
I have to shrink back inside
Run and hide
Back in the cocoon hugging my knees
Watching my insides the skinned glow-worm writhings
Lying in blankets, I've been here a while
Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms
Against the mattress and wall
The heat melts the sheets
Another layer is peeled
Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms
Just my cot, the wallpaper and me
I've been here awhile
Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms
Still finding charms in the memory of those constrictor arms
Glowing in the dark in my luminous green
A pearl beaded lizard bathed in a gossamer scent
With my heat detector lip-pit pulling at the newly formed tissue
Lying in blankets, I've been here awhile
Tapping out rhythms, tapping out rhythms
Against the mattress and wall
Waiting, waiting to loose the bandages
Waiting for new appendages
Lying in blankets, I've been here a while
I've been here too long
Banging out rhythms, listening for other tappings
Banging out rhythms, banging out rhythms
Banging out rhythms, listening for other tappings
Banging out rhythms, banging out rhythms
Back in the cocoon
Back in the cocoon
Back in the cocoon
Tapping out rhythms
Tapping out rhythms
Tapping out rhythmsEmbed
