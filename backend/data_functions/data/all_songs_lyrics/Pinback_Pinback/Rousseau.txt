Rousseau LyricsThey're aware of you
Beneath the chutes now
Tampering with the levers
You release their drones
Indistinct wires
The red black wire
The red black
Indistinct colors
The drones are near
The drones are near
Roomsick Man is easy now
Arrested day. Awake n grey
Bedsick Man I read somehow
Once he was full. He's empty now
Is a part of my soul asleep today?
Is it hid under the pillow where
Cleophus lays?
Is it stuck inside the dash
With the shitty comp. tapes?
Something's wrong with my soul
( I do not belong in this place and i want to returned to Earth)
They have lied to you
Beneath the ships now
Tampering with the levers
The drones are near
The drones are near
Roomsick Man is easy now
Arrested day. Awake n grey
Bedsick Man I read somehow
Once he was full. He's empty now
Is a part of my soul asleep today?
Is it hid under the pillow where
Cleophus lays?
Is it stuck inside the dash
With the shitty comp. tapes?
Something's wrong with my soul
My heart beats from the outside
(We run from the drones)
And I'll do anything to keep me inside
(We run from the drones)
Cause I'm busy dodging rocks
(I want to run from the drones with you)
And I can barely pick you up
(I want to run from the drones with you)
But I can sense a faint disinterest
(I don't want to run from the drones and you...)
Although my levels are all fucked up
(real good!)
Is a part of my soul asleep today?
Is it hid under the pillow where
Cleophus lays?
Is it stuck inside the dash
With the shitty comp. tapes?
Something's wrong with my soul
Is a part of my soul asleep today?
Is it hid under the pillow where
Cleophus lays?
Is it stuck inside the dash
With the shitty comp. tapes?
Something's wrong with my soul
Is a part of my soul asleep today?
Is it hid under the pillow where
Cleophus lays?
Is it stuck inside the dash
With the shitty comp. tapes?
Something's wrong with my soul
Is a part of my soul asleep today?
Is it hid under the pillow where
Cleophus lays?
Is it stuck inside the dash
With the shitty comp. tapes?
Something's wrong with my soul
Is a part of my soul asleep today?
Is it hid under the pillow where
Cleophus lays?
Is it stuck inside the dash
With the shitty comp. tapes?
Something's wrong with my soul2Embed
