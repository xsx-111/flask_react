Crutch LyricsIt kicks in like an ugly sound
And I'm split divides me
Skull collides
Such a long way down
Such a big big bad
Such a bright white light
Rubber crutch lands so hard
I got to know the way - today
'Cause you fly with me again - away
This memory of you holds more
Than a photograph
It's much more than a book of
Old pictures locked away
Without a name
Some sit down
Let the rest decide
Over what divided you
Besides, it's a long time now
Yea, so far away
No one cares too much over
What happened to you
I got to know the way - today
'Cause you fly with me again - away
It's much more than a stack of old
Pictures locked away, DalhiaEmbed
