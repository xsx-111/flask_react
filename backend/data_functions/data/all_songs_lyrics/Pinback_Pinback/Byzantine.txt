Byzantine LyricsSpin my dreidel, and I will split your atom
Spin the bottle, and I will play assassin
We never shoot to kill, for we fear the empire
We never shoot to kill, for we fear the empire
Oh-oh-oh-oh...
Pale metals crumble on
Well, I'm waiting for the sun to go out
(It won't fail)
Tripping like a Sunday
Standing at my doorstep (it won't fail)
Clowning like a fig and
Wearing down a bore's head
I will not to help you
I will not to wake up (it won't fail)
I will not to ask you
If you're not in close up
You can help me figure out this time
Figure out this time
We never shoot to kill, for we fear the empire
We never shoot to kill, for we fear the empireEmbed
