Chaos Engine LyricsWoo woo... woo woo woo... woo woo oo...
I'll head them off a pass +1
I'll clear the tracks
For now, +1
Eee You, Ee Ya Ooo
The lid is clean
The lense has been disposed at last
Wrote on the cast: "Chaos Engine"
Try to bluff my way out of here
I've bled for less, for sure, then best
I've been impressed today
UndressedEmbed
