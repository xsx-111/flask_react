Tripoli Lyrics(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
No one would believe me, and no one cared to check it out
(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
No one would believe me, and no one cared to check it out
You know what's gonna happen, you know what's gonna happen
He's gonna go down, and gonna come back again
You know what's gonna happen, you know what's gonna happen
He's gonna go down, and gonna come back again
Sad I'm gonna die
Hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think
Sad I'm gonna die
Hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think
(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?
(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?
You know what's gonna happen, you know what's gonna happen
He's gonna go down, and gonna come back again
You know what's gonna happen, you know what's gonna happen
He's gonna go down, and gonna come back again
Sad I'm gonna die
Hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think
Sad I'm gonna die
Hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think
They'll tie me up and send me off
To set me off on someone's lawn
They'll tie me up and send me off
To set me off on someone's lawn
Sad I'm gonna die
Hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think
Sad I'm gonna die
Hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think
(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
Sad I'm gonna die, hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think
(Did I forget that I said to you that I'd be there?)
Sad I'm gonna die, hope it's gonna happen later, later than I think2Embed
