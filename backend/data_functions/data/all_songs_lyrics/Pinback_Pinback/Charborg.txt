Charborg LyricsAnd if you asked me to fly I would do so
And if you asked me to climb I would do so
And if you asked me to shine I would do so
And if you asked me to dance I would do so
What a surprise!
Crazy lady waits like a man on the scene!
Are you ready? Drop in
Yes we're ready. Drop it in
Sayonara. Bebe
Checking one two
Checky checky check, is this mic here working?
Can you hear me out there?
Yes, we hear you out here
The monitors are crappy
Wa hooEmbed
