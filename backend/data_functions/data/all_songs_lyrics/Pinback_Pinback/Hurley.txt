Hurley LyricsI went outside to catch the snow
Ice is raining
Ice is raining
Ice is raining (the snow)
Ice is raining
I went outside to catch the snow
How far will I go
To protect my hide
Protect my
Will I go protect my hide
Protect my
I went outside to catch the snow
Ice is raining
Ice is raining
Ice is raining (the snow)
Ice is raining
I went outside
To catch the snow
How far will I go to protect my hide
Will I go protect my (hide)
Will I go protect my hide
Will I go protect my (hide)
As seal myself inside
The zippers catch my skin
And as I waddle towards the doorway
A freezer hits me
And as i stumble from my house
I reach down for the sled
And as I start to shape my weapon
A cold one hits me
I turn around
And walk back home (repeat until end)1Embed
