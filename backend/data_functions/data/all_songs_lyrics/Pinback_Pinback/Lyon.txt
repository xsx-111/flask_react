Lyon LyricsI'm headed to the ditch
To take my fifteenth leap
Gonna be out of touch
Once I carry our legs
Backward sweeps the tide
I'd take you to the bridge
But the bridge has seen better days
I'd take you out to the park
We don't know who's working there tonight
(Pave the way for the manta ray)
(Pave the way for the manta ray)
I wish that you were here
We'd have a tea party to celebrate
Drive a cop car into the lake
Hold our breath for two long boring days
(Pave the way for the manta ray)
(Pave the way for the manta ray)
(Pave the way for the manta ray)
(Pave the way for the manta ray)
Sometimes wish there was a slide out my window
Sometimes wish there was a flume ride  at Wonderland
That way, no one gonna steal your wallet
Buried in the sand under your blanket
Move her out of that hot burning sun
And I'll take you, take you with me
To the deep end...1Embed
