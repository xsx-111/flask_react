Shag LyricsIt rained because I took the dust of
Your bones crushed and seeded all the clouds
It rained for days a blaze of Hail and stones
The size of men around your house
Rusty spring uncoils in a baby bottle
Toddler screams over power the infant death rattle
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs....
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs....
It's lame because it fell above the needs of his
Pretend life and his wishes
So now it limps and counts the hours
Watches the clock by pounding doves and dishes
Delta Force plays on your old gray monitor
Power Team breaks flaming blocks of cinder
Sick of sickness. You're unkind and a liar
Get your kicks a witness to feeble slaughter
In your castle all your candles drip on the pavement
From what I've heard
And the cattle that you laid down drip on the pavement
From what I've heard
Cold wet floor
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs....
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs....
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs....
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the
Push the little baby down the spiral stairs....
