Versailles LyricsIt was a grey bitter night
Full moon had all disappeared (two more times)
We asked the tide where he had gone
She said to you he's gone to versailles
We packed the ship left that day
Stand at the side and the sky in versailles
Stand at the side and the sky in versailles
The time took us left us there
You found him on the hillsides of versailles (no more times)
He asked the moon to come back to our side
Stand at the side and the sky in versailles
Stand at the side and the sky in versailles
Stand at the side and the sky in versailles
Stand at the side and the sky in versailles
Ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Make away, the moon tonightEmbed
