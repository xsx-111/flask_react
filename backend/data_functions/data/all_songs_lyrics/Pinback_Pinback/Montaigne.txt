Montaigne LyricsShe's been all used up
Like the gum in her ashtray
(I wanna take the waves)
And none she can focus so well
(I wanna take the waves)
Some try to hide her
And others just like her
(I wanna take the waves)
On the backs of old postcards
With the names scratched off
With razorblades
(waves) But I can trace you
Waves waves waves
I wanna take the waves
I wanna take the waves
I wanna take the waves
Whoooooooooooooooo
Lead me on
(waves)
Well I've been betrayed now
(waves)
That's the way it's always been
(waves)
(waves)
Well I've been betrayed now
(waves)
That's the way it's always been
(waves)
(waves)
Well I've been betrayed now
(waves)
That's the way it's always been
(waves)
Well I've been betrayed now
That's the way it's always been1Embed
