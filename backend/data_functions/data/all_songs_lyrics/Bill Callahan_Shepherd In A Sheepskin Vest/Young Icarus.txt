Young Icarus LyricsYoung Icarus flew at night for years
He flew and flew and flew
Over the maze he was born into
He flew and flew and flew
Until he reached morning
It was a cold, cold sea
And we crawled out of the water
As obsessed with evolution as ever
From a hill behind a gas station in Scranton
I could see the old ways stitching out in their graves
And I thought, but I didn't say
"Woman, ain't it glorious?
Without a past there'd be no one here but us
Lonely as Adam and Eve"
So I left Eden with a song up my sleeve
Well, the past has always lied to me
The past never gave me anything but the blues
Oh, what's a hot poor boy to do?
Empty the nest for the cuckoos
And wander, wander, wanderEmbed
