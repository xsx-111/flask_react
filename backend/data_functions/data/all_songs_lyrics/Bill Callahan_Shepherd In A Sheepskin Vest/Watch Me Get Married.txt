Watch Me Get Married Lyrics
The stars are blue around me, that much I can see
Like distant members of my distant twinkling blue family

Watching me get married to the immensity
The orchid in the canyon is the one for me

As the lion returned to the family crest
The shepherd took off his sheepskin vest
And the children came pouring and pouring out of my chest
Oh, all of the lives I had carried
Just staggered me, staggered me, staggered me

How joyous to know
What we knew was out there wanting to
Finally came home
Let's spend a light year together
Oh, I know it's a distance from here to the stars

Watching us get married to the immensity
The orchid in the canyon is the one for meEmbed
