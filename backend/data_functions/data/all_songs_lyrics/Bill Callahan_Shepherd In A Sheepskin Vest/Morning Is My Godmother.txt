Morning Is My Godmother Lyrics
Morning is my godmother
Loving me like no other
Yeah, morning is my godmother
Loving me like no other

She comes to me in the setting up
And in the breaking down
She shows me what is infinite
And how it fits within the grasp of man

Yeah, morning is my godmother
Loving me like no other


Morning is my godmother
Loving me like no otherEmbed
