Lonesome Valley Lyrics
Everybody must walk the lonesome valley
Yeah, they must walk it by themselves
There's nobody here can walk it for them
Yeah, they got to walk it by themselves

My father's got to walk the lonesome valley
Yeah, he's got to walk it by himself
There's nobody here can walk it for him
Yeah, he's got to walk it by himself

My mother's got to walk the lonesome valley
Yeah, she's got to walk it by herself
There's nobody here can walk it for her
Yeah, she's got to walk it all by herself

My sister's got to walk the lonesome valley
Yeah, she's got to walk it by herself
There's nobody here can walk it for her
Yeah, she's got to walk it by herself

Everybody's got to walk the lonesome valley
Yeah, you got to walk it by yourself
There's nobody here can walk it for you
Yeah, you got to walk it by yourselfEmbed
