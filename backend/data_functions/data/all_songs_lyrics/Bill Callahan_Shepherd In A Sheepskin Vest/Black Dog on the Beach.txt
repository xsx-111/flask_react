Black Dog on the Beach LyricsA black dog followed me
We chased the seagulls in the sky
And the shadows on the sand
Well, if Dad was in the Navy
I'll be a riverboat gambling man
Not counting the buffet
Iâ€™d walk with a thousand dollars a day
Oh, Dad always said
If he could have he would have loved to live this way
Sick and lonesome and in need
Of discipline and company
The discipline of company
Well, I guess I can describe it best
As the year the lion left the family crest
And we made a crown out of the space that was leftEmbed
