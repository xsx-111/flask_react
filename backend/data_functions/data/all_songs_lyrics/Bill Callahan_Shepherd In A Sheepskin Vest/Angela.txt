Angela Lyrics
Angela, whoa, Angela

Like motel curtains, we never really met
And cutting our losses is our best bet
And I'll owe you the rest, Angela
Love goes on like birdsong
As soon as possible after a bomb

Angela, with every loss we rise again
With new strength and new purpose
And I'm as free as a mockingbird
Just as free as a mockingbird
Singing your last song back to you

Angela, whoa, Angela

Storm doesn't ask the flower for the rain
I never asked for anything back again

Angela, whoa, Angela
You got a garden, don't you mind a little rain
