Writing LyricsIt feels good to be writing again
Clear water flows from my pen
And it sure feels good to be writing again
I'm stuck in the high rapids as night closes in
It feels good to be singing again
Yeah, it sure feels good to be singing again
From the mountain and the mountain within
Music came down from the mountain
And she danced with all the men
Yeah, she danced with all the men
Yeah, music came down from the mountain
And she danced with all the men
We lined up with our hearts waiting to grow
Sometimes I have to wonder on
Where have all the good songs gone?
Yeah, sometimes I have to wonder on
Where have all the good songs gone?
Where have they gone?
Writing mountain music, yeah
Writing mountain music, whoaEmbed
