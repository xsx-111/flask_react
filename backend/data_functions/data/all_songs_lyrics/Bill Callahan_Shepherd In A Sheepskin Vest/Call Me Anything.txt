Call Me Anything LyricsI never was the things I said I was
But it's not as if I lied
What I was, all I was
Was the effort to describe
The effort to describe
Now, I may not have been born to deliver the truth
But I sure do love to ride the route
When Iâ€™m on my bicycle
I am a seagull
Made of man and metal
And I am flying, flying
Let the blind call me dark
Let the weak call me peak-ridden
Let the butchers grind our hearts
And claim there's no love within
But you can call me anything
Just as long as I can sing
Yeah, you can call me anything
Just as long as I can sing
I sing for answers
I sing for good listeners
And tired dancersEmbed
