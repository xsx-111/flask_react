Circles LyricsI made a circle, I guess
When I folded her hands across her chest
She made a circle, I guess
And a circle does what a circle does best
With a face as stark as Genesis
And I can't stop the quest
I mean, who can stop the quest?
Death is beautiful
We say goodbye to many friends
Who have no equals
With kisses sweet as hospital grapes
As she slips out the door
To flirt with the boys on the library floorEmbed
