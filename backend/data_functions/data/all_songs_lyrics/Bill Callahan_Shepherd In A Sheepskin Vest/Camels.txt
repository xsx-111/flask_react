Camels LyricsCamels dying in the desert
Dropping to their knees
War is man's nature
And I take notes aggressively
Of camels dying in the desert
In the heat, in the heat, in the heat, in the heat
Well, the house is hot too
So don’t start no fire
Or we'll burn right up in two
Well, baby's gone to get more ice
For icing down the dying
Camels in the desert
As he watched the drought on TV
From your rowing machine
War is man’s nature
And I'm a man
In a peaceful kind of place
Can't separate the man from his place
Like to separate the canyon from its graceEmbed
