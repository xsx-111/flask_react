When We Let Go LyricsWhen we let go
Our arms are open
And our hearts are exposed
When we let go
And you will jog lightly into the kingdom
The kingdom of strangers
When we let go
You will see leaving
As the freedom from others
When we let go
And you'll make your own way
And thatâ€™s the way the road goes
When we let go
And we will be waiting
And we will be strangers
When we let go
Our arms are open
And our hearts are exposedEmbed
