The Beast LyricsSky change the sea
Love changed me
In that battle cloud way
I'd like to say we left the field smoking
Smoking, smoking
I see what you see, don't you worry
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love is a hill with a view of reality
Smoking, smoking
And the gravestones from here look like teeth
With a beast asleep at our feet
Borrowed breath, borrowed thrones
In the end, we'll solely be
To fill one another's needs
Sky to the sea
The center holds together
A stubborn, old sailor
Forever the salt of the sea
With one hand on the wheel
And one on my shoulder
Dividing the water, the water, the water, the water, the water, the water
'Til beast, released beast, released beast, released beast
Released beast, released beast, released beast, released beast
Released beastEmbed
