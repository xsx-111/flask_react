747 LyricsIs it going?
I woke up on a 747
Flying through some stock footage of heaven
This is the light right here
Before clouds bittersweet and with suggestion
This is the light
Bald and bold as baby crawling toward adulteration
There was blood when you were born
And the blood was wiped from your eyes
This must be the light you saw
That just left you screaming
And this must be the light you saw
Before our eyes could disguise true meaning
And this must be the light you saw
Just as you were leaving
Leaving
We walked on the moon
Like flies on a mule
We walked on the moon
Flaws in a jewel
We are flies on a mule
And we're good at what we do
We turn darkness into morning
We turn belief into evening
Yeah, we turn darkness into morning
And we turn belief into eveningEmbed
