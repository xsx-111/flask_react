Believe Me LyricsEverything that I tell you girl, every word that you hear
Every little whisper, let me make myself clear
There ain't no lies to deceive you, I love you too much for that
Every word that I say is true, you can believe me on that
My friends tell me jealous lies
Now I'm getting my goodbyes
A life without you, my dear
Was dull, as dull as can be
I ask you, my love, why not take me now
Not to leave me in misery
Saxophone

If you take in all they say
I guess I'll be on my way
Please, my darling, it's not true
I don't know this girl called Sue
Sue's a name I have not heard
I lost my girl from that one word
Will she come back, I just don't know
And I'm takin' a heavy blow, oh
I've got myself together
I can't go on in this cold weather
Christmas comes but once a year
It's a time of love and cheer
Your friends tell you jealous lies
Now I'm getting my goodbyes
No no no no, no no no no
No no no no, no no no noEmbed
