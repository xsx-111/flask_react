One Step Beyond Lyrics(Hey you, don't watch that, watch this!
This is the heavy heavy monster sound
The nastiest sound around
So if you've come in off the street
And you're beginning to feel the heat
Well listen buster
You'd better to start to move your feet
To the rockin'est, rocksteady beat
Of Madness
One step beyond!)
(One step beyond!...)4Embed
