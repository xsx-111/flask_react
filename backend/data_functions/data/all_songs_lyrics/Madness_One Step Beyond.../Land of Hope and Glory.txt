Land of Hope and Glory LyricsUrrrrh
What's the time?
I was trying to get some sleep
Attention, urrraaah
Bridges, Sharkey, Nutley, Jackson, Thompson, Master
Well, as you can see we've got a new recruit to this land of hope and glory
Hands behind backs and legs apart and tell us all of your unfortunate story
Who me sir?
Yes, you ssssir!
I was an innocent man till someone grassed me of a plan
Of earning some big a money
If I hadn't mouthed it about, I am sure without doubt
I'd 'ave missed this land of hope and glory
Well you poor poor sod, here you're up sharp at six thirty
Cold shower down to breakfast, can't have you looking dirty
I suggest you eat what's given you even if it doesn't agree with you
Cos It's all you're be getting up until twelve thirty
In between this time stay up in your room, you can dream of life
Good things
Two years of my teen age life given to this stand to attention life
Of land of hope and glory
I get so bored as time goes by, I think I'll do something dirty
I pick at the floor for juicy butts and I'll make myself a smoke
A bog roll and envelope stick it, all this helps to pass my time
As the evening drags on, you can watch a little telly
Hot Gossip pans people with a little bit of belly
A hot drink served cold with the heat of yesterday's
Don't complain learn the game and I'll get through another day
I watch the second hand on the clock at long last is nine thirty
Off to bed straight to sleep as I leave this land of hope and glory
But only for a few seconds I'm in n ecstasy
Before the bell rings to let me know, sharp at six thirty
A the, a two, a six, a ta
Quiet, come on you lot, come on, lights outEmbed
