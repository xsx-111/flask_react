Take Me Somewhere Nice Lyrics
Ghosts in the photograph never lied to me
I'd be all of that, I'd be all of that
A false memory would be everything
My denial, my eliminent

What is that for?
What was that for?

What would you do if you saw spaceships
Over Glasgow? Would you fear them?
Every aircraft, every camera
Is a wish that wasn't granted

What was that for?
What was that for?

Try to be bad
Try to be bad15Embed
