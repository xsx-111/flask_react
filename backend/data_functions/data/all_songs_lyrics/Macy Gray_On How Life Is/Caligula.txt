Caligula LyricsHush the neighbors hear you moanin' and groanin'
I just can't help it 'specially when we be bonin'
I can take your fears away he says
It's so much better when you do it my way
I could not believe it
Hey what's your bag?
He's something like my favorite movie
I wanna see him again and again
He like my disco - he really groovy
When we go out I'm gonna let him in
He wanna fight and make me feel like nothin'
Never lovin' but we're always fuckin'
I can take your fears away
But I kinda I kinda miss them
Now that they're gone astray
I could not believe it
Hey what's your bag?
He's something like my favorite movie
I wanna see him again and again
He like my freight train - he really move me
When we go out I'm gonna let him in
He's something like my 7-Eleven
He got me open like an all night store
He like my blue sky - he next to heaven
He give me something and I want some more
I could not believe it
Hey what's your bag?
He's something like my favorite movie
I wanna see him again and again
He like my disco - he really groovy
When we go out I'm gonna let him in
Like a Jacuzzi
I'm hot and bubbly
It like the sunshine
You're gonna love it
He's something like my favorite fix
I've got to have it - again and again
Again and again
Again and again
Something like that
Something like that
Again and again
Again and againEmbed
