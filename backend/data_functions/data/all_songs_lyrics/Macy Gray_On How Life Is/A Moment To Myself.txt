A Moment To Myself LyricsI saw a rainbow just earlier today
Lately those rainbows be coming round like everyday
Deep in the struggle I have found the beauty of me
God is watching and the devil finally let me be
Here in this moment to myself
I'm gonna vibe with no one else
There is a conversation I need to have with me
It's just a moment to myself
They're all looking at you, you've got everything to lose
Get up and dance girl, sing your tu-rah-loo-rah-loo
And quit your bitching bout how nobody don't really love you
Spread your rubber loving it bounces back to you
Here in this moment to myself
I'm gonna vibe with no one else
There is a conversation I need to have with me
It's just a moment to myself
Flowers are blooming under grey skies and moons
Seems like I'm winning everytime I lose
And the answers I been looking for been here all this time
Spread my rubber loving and everything was fine
Here in this moment to myself
I'm gonna vibe with no one else
There is a conversation I need to have with me
It's just a moment to myselfEmbed
