Sex-O-Matic Venus Freak LyricsSuperlove is somethin that they say is very rare
In the dark, in your world it's everywhere
And I feel like an x x rated movie star
It's the way you love me down
It's the way you love me down
Everytime we kiss you bring out the woman in me
Everytime you holler out my name you set me free
I am a sex-o-matic venus freak when I'm with you
And I will stop it only when you tell me to
I am the automatic easy freak all over you
And I will stop it only when you tell me to
Superlove
Gimme some, some, some
We are the genius of love
Feel like an x x rated movie star
It's the way you love me down
It's the way you love me down
Everytime we kiss you bring out the woman in me
Everytime you holler out my name you set me free
I am a sex-o-matic venus freak when I'm with you
And I will stop it only when you tell me to
I am the automatic easy freak all over you
And I will stop it only when you tell me to
When we seek and hide
When my hands are tied
69 positions and
Whip cream all over my skin
Lick you from bottom to roof
Love to get down with you
I am a sex-o-matic venus freak when I'm with you
And I will stop it only when you tell me to
I am the automatic easy freak all over you
And I will stop it only when you tell me toEmbed
