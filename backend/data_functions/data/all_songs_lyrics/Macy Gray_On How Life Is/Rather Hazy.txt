Rather Hazy LyricsI said I loved him and forever I would stay
Took everything he had and ran away
He reminded but I guess it's been a while
Cause it's rather hazy to me now
Rather hazy to me now. (repeat)
I said that I'd be true and love until the end
Then he caught me messin' with his friend
He reminded me but I guess it's been awhile
Cause it's rather hazy to me now
Rather hazy to me now
Thought my sense was washed away
Wracked my brain on why you stay
So easy to be good to him
I don't think I've ever been
Maybe shady, maybe cowardly
I turned and gave him no apologies
Said I'll see you 'round
Don't know what you talking 'bout
Don't remember guess it's been awhile
Cause it's rather hazy to me now (to me now)
(Repeat 4x)Embed
