Still LyricsIn my last years with him there were bruises
On my face
In my dawn and new day
I finally got away
But my head's all messed up and he knows
Just what to say
No more dawn and new days
I'm going back to stay
So why say bye bye
When it only makes me cry
I still
Light up like a candle burnin when he calls me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burning everytime we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
I still
Be lovin you baby and it's much too much
We are going down
Cuz you're always getting high
And your crumbs of lovin
No longer get me by
Wow! It gets better everytime that we get high
Then your crumbs of lovin
They somehow get me by
Why say bye bye
When it only makes me cry
I still
Light up like a candle burnin when he call me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burning everytime we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
I still
Be lovin you baby and it's much too much
Can't I go my severed way
Some rain for my sunny day
Not even one reason to stay
Why?
I should've left you
Why?
I can't forgetcha baby
Why?
Ever since I metcha it's
Why?
I still
Light up like a candle burnin when he call me up
I still
Melt down like a candle burning everytime we touch
Oh say what you will
He does me wrong and I should be gone
I still
Be lovin you baby and it's much too muchEmbed
