The Letter LyricsAll I ever wanted was some love and peace and harmony
I could dance in the raw in the sun underneath the stars
When I walk over to my money tree ain't nobody there
Trying to take from me
When they ask "Are you truly free?" I'd say "Yes, truly"
But down here in reality everybody knows there ain't no such thing
And it's clear
It's obviously this is not the place I'm supposed to be
On and on and on I've searched
What I'm lookin for is not here on earth
I can't stand, I can't take no more
So I know that I gotta go
CHORUS:
So long everybody
Mama don't be sad for me
Life was a heartache and now I am finally free
Don't know where I'm headed
Hope I see you some day soon
So long everybody
I have gone beyond the moon
All I ever wanted, love and the peaceand the harmony
Just to be to live and shine
When I get ready I up and fly
And I can't remember, none of the things that I want to forget
It's the best- satisfaction no less
Ask me if I'm free and I'll say "Oh yes"
But down here in reality everybody knows there ain't no such thing
And it's clear
It' obviously this is not the place I'm supposed to be
On and on and on I've searched
What I'm lookin for is not here on earth
I can't stand, I can't take no more
So I know that I've gotta go
CHORUS
Before I do
Just one more look at you
It's worth the stay
But I'll meet you later at that better place
All I ever wanted was
All I ever wanted was
All I ever wanted was
