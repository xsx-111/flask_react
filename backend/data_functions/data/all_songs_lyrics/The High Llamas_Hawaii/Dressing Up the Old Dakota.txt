Dressing Up the Old Dakota LyricsDressing up the old Dakota
Giving it another shot
Freddy buys them up
And charters out the lot
Fly them to the Riviera
Fly them to the U.S.A
Fly them 'til you think they've
Reached their dying day

Landing on the rough terrain
Serving up the young burritos
On the plane
What's that cymbal sound?
Old Dakota's still around
Aviation in the jungle
Landing on the rough terrain
Serving up the young burritos
On the planeEmbed
