Peppy LyricsGather up your belongings
Gather them around your feet
Shine up the bottles and booties
Right before you sleep
Doctor's got a roadside manner
Handing the prescriptions round
And this is what they ask for
When they burn the surgery down
This is what they ask for
When they burn the surgery down
Peppy's just another kulak
Owns another patch of land
Doesn't have a lot to speak of
So the children lend a hand
Never really been too happy
Never really been too sad
And he doesn't know what he wanted
And he doesn't know what he had
Doesn't know what he wanted
And he doesn't know what he had
Doesn't know what he wanted
And he doesn't know what he had
Never really been too happy
Never really been too sad
And he doesn't know what he wanted
And he doesn't know what he had
Doesn't know what he wanted
And he doesn't know what he had
Doesn't know what he wanted
And he doesn't know what he hadEmbed
