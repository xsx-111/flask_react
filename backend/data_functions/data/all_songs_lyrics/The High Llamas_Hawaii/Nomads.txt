Nomads LyricsStanding in the lightweight suit
Reports from the location shoot
It seems to be a period piece
It could be Spain, it could be Greece
This is what the nomads did
This is what the nomads did
This is how they fed the kids
This is what the nomads did
That's as close as you can get
To the secrets of the super set
I'm sorry but it must be said
The dead man isn't really dead
This is what the nomads did
This is what the nomads did
This is how they fed the kids
This is what the nomads did
At midday I'll begin to fade
So we'll have to move into the shade
Clutching to the Cadbury cup
The method actor's acting up
This is what the nomads did
This is what the nomads did
This is how they fed the kids
This is what the nomads did
This is what the nomads did
This is what the nomads did
This is how they fed the kids
This is what the nomads didEmbed
