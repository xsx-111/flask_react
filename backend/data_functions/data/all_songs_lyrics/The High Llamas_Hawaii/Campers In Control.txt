Campers In Control LyricsSinking in the seat
And hoping for a race well run
They jostle and they beat
The reasoning to kingdom come
The woman and the man grew weary
As the time swung round
The hours fade away
And neither stays to stand the ground
The camper in control
Is slowly going round the bend
His friends are very nice
And hoping for the trip to end
The military have come
And cordoned off the hotel grounds
They're piling up the junk
And hope you'll take a good look roundEmbed
