Theatreland LyricsIt's the final night
And they still can’t get it right
The movement on the stage was so slow
They're calling it the Stop and Go Show
Is there much appeal
When you can't believe it’s real
The music was a little shaky
The scenery, a little flaky
The audience surprised themselves with
The strength of the abuse they handed
And the radio play
Leaves you angry for a day
Written like a first confession
You ponder on this strange profession
As the sands will shift
Theatreland is on the drift
Paddle round the bend to nowhere
Ratty and his friends will be there
Given up for good and hounded
Given up for good and boundedEmbed
