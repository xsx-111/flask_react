Tides LyricsIn the dead of night
The anchor checks the sway
They gather here, this makeshift pier
Trading with the tide
This fair exchange provides
The market sought, the buyers bought
Patrols pass by, they can but try
No need for haste or hurry
No cause for the waste or worry
They can but try to tell the tide
They can but try to tell the tide
The market sought, the buyers bought
Patrols pass by, they can but try
They can but try to tell the tide
They can but try to tell the tide
They can but try to tell the tide
They can but try to tell the tideEmbed
