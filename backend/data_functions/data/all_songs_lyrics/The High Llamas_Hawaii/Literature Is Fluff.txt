Literature Is Fluff LyricsTake care to avoid the heavy stuff
I give up, this literature is fluff
Trawled through sketches of notes the night before
Chased the baffled employees floor to floor
Hung a Do Not Disturb on glass swing doors
Fabled diaries written to be read
Creaking uprights ring through Nissen sheds
You are clearly a man of influence
Your collectable tales do so impress
Now the world can enjoy your savvy sense
This poor devil does not want to be
An out-of-habit radio emcee
And he sensed the unease, the governor's words
Treated baffled colonials rhyme and verse
Now I will not expect that visit firstEmbed
