Pilgrims LyricsArt deco and a little off-the-wall
It's the service that you wouldn't want to call
Pilgrim Fathers like to wander
Beat the path that makes the heart grow fonder
Come and see the bags are heavy
We are waiting for the bellboy to return
Stunning vistas to the left and to the right
It's the goosey in the bucket on the bike
Pilgrim Fathers like to wander
Beat the path that makes the heart grow fonder
Come and see the bags are heavy
We are waiting for the bellboy to return
Outposted, unattended for a while
Horsetrading like it's going out of style
Pilgrim Fathers like to wander
Beat the path that makes the heart grow fonder
Pilgrim Fathers like to wander
Beat the path that makes the heart grow fonder
Pilgrim Fathers like to wander
Beat the path that makes the heart grow fonder
Pilgrim Fathers like to wander
Beat the path that makes the heart grow fonderEmbed
