The Real Sugar LyricsTonight
If only tonight
I need something stronger, baby
Tonight
Like the moon and the stars
I don't know what you are
I can't wait any longer
Tonight
Only love is the real sugar
Only love is the real...
Everybody's ever felt lonely snap your finger
Everybody's ever felt lonely...
They say
There is a way
If you believe in something good
It could happen today
And baby
I'm trying hard to sound vague
But can i just hold you in my arms
Promise you we'll never
Talk about the promise again
Only love is the real sugar
Only love is the real...
Tonight
If only tonight
I need something stronger, baby
Can you provide?
Like the moon and the stars
I don't know what you are
I can't wait any longer
Tonight
Cause only love is the real sugar
Only love is the real....
Everybody's ever felt lonely snap your fingers
Everybody's ever felt lonely...Embed
