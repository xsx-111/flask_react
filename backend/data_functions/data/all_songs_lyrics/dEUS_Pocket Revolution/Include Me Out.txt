Include Me Out LyricsWhere have I seen this before?
When will I feel it again?
Somebody opened a door
I'm afraid to walk in
Imagination will kill
If imagination stands still
I read it in open book
Read it in open book
Oh man, I read it in books of laughter
Oh man, I read it in books of pain
What are you talking to me
Cause I'm not really here
Like a spirit that's free
I am as light as the air
Oh man, i'm as light as the air and floating
Oh man, i'm as light as the air and floating
Take me on
Where the fire winds blow
Of where a fallen leaf stays
For days
On your shoulder
Cause all i need
Is to find my own
And that summering drone
Illicit and golden
Oh lord where have I seen this before
Oh lord when will I feel it again
Read it in every move (Oh lord where have I seen this before)
Read it in every game
Read it in what you do (Oh lord when will I feel it again)
Read it in everything
Oh man, as light as the air and floating
Oh man, as light as the air and floating
Take me on
Where the fire winds blow
Cause when time stands still
I wait until
It's over
And all I need
Is to find my own
And the summering drone
Illicit and goldenEmbed
