Nightshopping LyricsBoth sides of happy
Both sides of grief
Man, they're staring at you
It's beyond belief
Both sides you kick it
Both sides you hide
Both side you'll never see
However hard you try
Both sides of politics
Both sides of shame
Was it the good side of you
That took the blame
Both side of secrecy
Both side of spying
I'm hearing ten sides now
They're multiplying
Both sides of trouble
And if that's the price
Take your time to stand up
And get organized
Cause i been away
But i feel i'm back
You can find me at the mothership
I'll be dressed in black
This ain't no time now
To go pick a fight
To investigate both sides
We got all night
You got me all wound up now, kick it
Now it ain't hard falling in love
With you baby
Got me all wound up
Your both sides are driving me crazy
Don't let the pressure drop
Having my way makes me lazyEmbed
