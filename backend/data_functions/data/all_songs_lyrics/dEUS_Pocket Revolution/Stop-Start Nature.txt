Stop-Start Nature LyricsCamelot
In smithereens
Your kingdom
Has gone down my friend
Camelot
In washed out jeans
Your staying power
Has come to an end
The sweetest stroke
Went up in smoke
And love's a joke
Or a spaceship
Or a plant
Or a tubezipper
It's what you want it to be
It must have crossed your mind
You run a little behind
With all schemes and programs
You have 'em built in
Need a small device to screw it out
And unlearn the craft
You been drilled in
(It's too late, you are now becoming) NATURE
Backdated trip
Backfired whip
You bite your lip
But do what you want
And then a shoulder to cry
Makes your eyes run dry
Stop-start nature
I wish you all you wish for
And when i walk i will stumble no more
It's a new beginning
It's a new dawn
And all the magic you missed
And all the days you squandered
And all the nights you passed out
Countless are the nights you wandered
It's as good as you can handle
It's as good
It's what you want it to be
It must have crossed your mind
You run a little behind
Stop-start nature
I wish you all you wish for
And if i run i will hurry no more
It's a new beginning
It's a new....
Stop!
I got some fine reasons to get out of there
Great motivation to go back in
I know i repeat myself
But that ain't a sin
If it's like a nature
Like natureEmbed
