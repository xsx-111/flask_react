Cold Sun of Circumstance LyricsDon't keep quiet
Find a deal
If they can't think it
Make 'em feel
Use your eyes
Don't compare
On a global scale
Strip it bare
Think out loud
Stay in shape
Spill your wine
On the devils cape
Waste your money
Like you think you should
And raise your glass
To the brotherhood
It's the devil in the blood, baby
He's the cutter of a mighty funky deal
Be it only for a real short time now
Before the cold sun of circumstance
SHINES ON!
Smile on picture
Smoke in bed
Don't ever think
You know your pet
Use your charm
But don't compare
Tell them when
But never where
It's the devil in the blood, baby
He's the cutter of a mighty funky deal
Be it only for a real short time now
Before the cold sun of circumstance
SHINES ON!
Don't be precious
Don't be proud
The past means nothing
When you're down
Living hard
For a while
Will hurt your bones
But not your style
It's the devil in the blood....Embed
