Pocket Revolution LyricsThere's no rules here
I been making stuff up from the beginning
How I feel today
Is it the price I pay
For all my sinning
I'm just a lonely boy
Would you be my enemy
I'm finding little joy in repetition
This routine they call destiny
When you put me down
Revenge is the first thing on my mind
But that's just stupid, man
I need a better plan
Delicate and refined
Between thunder and lightning
There is a gap
I should have listened to the warning
I would have seen the trap
Can you feel it
When all is stuck right
In front of you
Can you heal it
It's gonna take a revolution now
To get through to you
You don't know what you're destroying
I got all qualities of a stalker
I'm right behind you
Don't dare me now
I'm a faster walker
I'm right on top of you
I'm just a lonely boy
Would you keep me company
You keep me on my toes
You get me going
When I'm weak
Can you feel it
When all is stuck
In front of you
Can you heal it
It's gonna take a revolution now
To get through to you
Can you see it
The sky has lit up
Exposing you
Can you heal it
Are you gonna be found out
Or is it something new
You don't know what you're destroying
Watch me wallowing in sweet denial
Teach me to win and lose
I been waiting it's a slow arrival
Wash it over me
And clean my soul
I give control...1Embed
