I Wanna Thank You Lyrics
You had the best of intentions now
But the bad inventions let us down
And now it's gone
Who really cares if we ever find a home?
Yeah, yeah

I wanna thank you
Thank you for all the times we had
Too bad there's no more money, next part ain't so funny
Everybody's leaving, it seems to be the season
When your thoughts return to home
Can't you see that I'd rather be alone, yeah, yeah

Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime

Well, let me know if you're back this way again
We'll sing a song that reminds us of our friend
Ba-ba, ba da ba da da
Ba-ba, ba da ba da da...

I wanna thank you
You know all those times don't seem so bad
We live in a reflection, eliminate detection
As well as rhyme or reason, we always aim to please them
And my thoughts begin to roam
Still I think I'd rather be alone, yeah, yeah

Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long, see you sometime
Goodbye, so long...Embed
