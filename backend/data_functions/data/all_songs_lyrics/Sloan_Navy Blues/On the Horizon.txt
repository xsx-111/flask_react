On the Horizon Lyrics
These are a few of the states I'm in
The first one Jersey, the second one thin
The nicest thing of mine is yours
So take a letter down, and send it to the highest bidder

On my team and my horizon
And you'll shine in that scene capitalizing
Now just the thing for me is maybe let me be
Because someone's gotta sign on the dividing line

I'll be setting up my sights (Woo!)
To watch me programming all the glamour rites
The thing for you to do was leave
I'll see you when it's snowing, and give me back the master key

To my place on the horizon
And we'll shine all of the time, capitalizing
And you'll beat out all the odds of staying thin


Wouldn't you like to keep moving?
Your life would be a-slightly improving
When you better come on by
And take a letter down, and send it out as sympathy

For my team on the horizon
And we'll shine all in that scene capitalizing
So just sign it, underline it
And represent the scapegoats
And we will blame it on you
'Cause someone had to state it
So I could imitate it masterfully
