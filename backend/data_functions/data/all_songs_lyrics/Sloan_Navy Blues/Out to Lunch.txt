Out to Lunch Lyrics
Burn it down, now we can't have any more
So turn it south, we're headed for sunny shores
Pick me up in your limousine
And take me out to lunch
Pry my mind with the best champagne
And make me talk too much

Something's always wrong with this situation
(Something's always wrong)
'Cause when it comes down to you and me, we never get along
I know someone that looks like you
But they don't have the fire you do in your eyes

Heads up, a-here she comes
Eyes glazed over and a bottle of fun
She keeps moving but she's fading fast
She says she's never felt sicker but she's having a blast
But look inside, she feels like crying
Bottle's dry and no one's buying

Something's always wrong with this situation
(Something's always wrong)
'Cause when it comes down to you and me, we never get along
I know someone that looks like you
But they don't have the fire you do in your eyes
Have a drink to toast yourself
And another to your health
And one more for the road
And the good times


Burn it down, and we can't have anymore
So turn it south, we're headed for sunny shores

Something's always wrong with this situation
(Something's always wrong)
'Cause when it comes down to you and me, we never get along
I know someone that looks like you
But they don't have the fire you do in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyesEmbed
