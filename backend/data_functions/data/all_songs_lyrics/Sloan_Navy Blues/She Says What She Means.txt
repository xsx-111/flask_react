She Says What She Means Lyrics
When in the world?
I'm gonna get it together
I'm telling you, girl
I'm gonna make it all better

But I don't know how I'm going to
'Cause I don't know what she is going through
What I know is that's even mean for me

'Cause she means what she says and she says what she means

What is the word
It's like you don't even know me
Haven't you heard?
This sort of thing is below me

But I don't know what I would stoop to
Have you got another jump I could hoop through
Now, I don't know if that's even meant for me

'Cause she means what she says and she says what she means
When she says that I'm mean, does she mean what she says?
(And she says what she means, and she means what she says
And she says what she means, and she means what she says)
Oh, maybe I don't stay in touch much
'Cause it makes me feel I'm goin' Dutch
Ooh
Maybe I'm the sort who's sordid
Yeah, but I won't be extorted
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh

Whenever you want me, whenever you need me
I know that you're angry, you know that I'm sorry
But this situation has come back to haunt me
Whenever you need me, whenever you want me
Whenever you want me, whenever you need me
Whenever you want me, whenever you need me
Whenever you want meEmbed
