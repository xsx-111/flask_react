Money City Maniacs Lyrics

All you've found
Is another back door
That no one sees
A reason for
At the heart of the travelling band
You have to understand
There's a driving need
To hit the yellow line

And the joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke fizz
And the joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke fizz

Hey you
You've been around for a while
If you admit that you were wrong then we'll admit that we're right
Hey you
Come along for the ride
We'll hit the money city if it takes us all night
And the joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke fizz
And the joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke fizz


Hey you
We've been around for a while
If you admit that you were wrong then we'll admit that we're right
Take the heart of the travelling band
You'll never understand that
All they know
Is the yellow line, yeah
Woo!

And the joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke fizz
And the joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke, yeah yeah yeah
Joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke, yeah yeah yeah
Joke is
When he awoke his
Body was covered in Coke fizzEmbed
