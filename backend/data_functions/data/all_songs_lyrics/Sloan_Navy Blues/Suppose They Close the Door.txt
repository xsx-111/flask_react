Suppose They Close the Door Lyrics
Hey, you've shed your reputation
Now, deny your compensation
So put the pardon in me
It pays to tell me I'm forgiven
Raise the standard, stop reliving
Don't worry that anyone won't want you to
'Cause nobody likes a quitter

I need a list of all the ways to get even
If I'm going to keep track of them
I'll need to list off the number of reasons
Why I'm turning my back on them
Suppose they close the door
Suppose they close it for good

Don't worry that anyone won't want you to
An eye for an eye is no way to get even
When you think that fair is square
You can be forgiven, I will not forget
There are times I wonder why that you should forgive
I fantasize that you can hit them right where they live
Don't worry that anyone won't want you to
'Cause nobody knows
I made a list of all the ways to get even
If I'm gonna get back at them
I made the list up and you made it, I'm teasing
But it's hard to keep track
When you're watching your back
But I gotta get back at them
Suppose they close the door
Suppose they close it for good

Gonna put you on and on and on and on and on
Gonna put you on and on and on and on and on
Gonna put you on and on and on and on and onEmbed
