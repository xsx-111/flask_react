Stand by Me, Yeah Lyrics
You gotta roll with the punches to get to what is real
Knock down the bastards and show them how it feels

'Cause you know
It's not easy when you feel they go out of their way to get you
It's not easy when you feel they go out of their way to get to you

And all your dreams are coming true
And now you wish they'd stayed inside you

It's not easy when you feel they go out of their way to get you
It's not easy when you feel they go out of their way to get to

(Stand by me, ooh)
Stand by me, yeah
(Stand by me, ooh)
Stand by me, yeah
(Stand by me, ooh)
Stand by me, yeah
(Stand by me, ooh)
Line them up, knock them down
They all come running when the word gets around
You gotta roll with the punches to get to what is real
Knock down the bastards and show them how it feels

'Cause you know
It's not easy when you feel they go out of their way to get you
It's not easy when you feel they go out of their way to get to

(Stand by me, ooh)
Stand by me, yeah
(Stand by me, ooh)
Stand by me, yeah
(Stand by me, ooh)
Stand by me, yeah
(Stand by me, ooh)
Line them up, knock them down
They all come running when the word gets aroundEmbed
