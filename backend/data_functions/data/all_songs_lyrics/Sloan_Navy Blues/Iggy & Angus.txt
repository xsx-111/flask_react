Iggy & Angus Lyrics
Someone better get insurance
To take good care of me
'Cause if I'm stuck with my own bad luck
Well, that's the saddest sight you'll see

'Cause if I stumble, then I fall, and get back up
Try to brush the dust off
And everything is black when I close my eyes
I lose all sense of time
It hurts, it's cruel, but it feels real good
I'm gonna do it after all

We're still the same
After all these years
It's funny how you get a feel for it
When you finally lose your sense of fear

But when Iggy said it's loose down on the street
Living in the city
And everything went black cause it's in my eyes
Everything denied
Kurt's still cool and Angus rules
I'm gonna plug it in again
We're still the same
After all these years
It's funny how you get a feel for it
When you finally lose your sense of fear

Someone better get insurance
To take good care of me
Cause if I'm stuck with my own bad luck
Well, that's the saddest sight you'll see

It hurts, it's cruel, but it feels real good
Well, that's alright
Kurt's still cool and Angus rules
And that's alright
AlrightEmbed
