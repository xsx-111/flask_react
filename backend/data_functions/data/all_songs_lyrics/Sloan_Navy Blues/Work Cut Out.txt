Work Cut Out Lyrics
I feel lied to
I don't believe a word that you say
'Cause you said you were gonna help me out
But what's the first thing that you do?
I guess you've got your work cut out for you
I have tried to
Forget about the thing that you say
'Cause you said you were absolutely sure
It can't be that hard to get through
It's worst thing they could do

If you said, "Come over here, boy"
What could I do?
It's the worst thing they could do

I feel lied to
'Cause you said
You said, "Come over here, boy"
And what could I do, yeah
I had to get my work cut out for you

You read what I had written
Why wouldn't you?

I had got my work cut out for you
It was the least that you could do

I feel lied to
I don't believe a word that you say
'Cause you said you were gonna help me out
But what's the first thing that you do?
I guess you've got your work cut out, your work cut out for youEmbed
