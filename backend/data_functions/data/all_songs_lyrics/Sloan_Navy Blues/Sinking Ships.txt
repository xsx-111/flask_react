Sinking Ships Lyrics
You take control of having what you want around you
And every blink of your eye can make an old man seem younger
Than every single day in his life before you
Carried 'round his weight like it was yours to show the world

I'm kinda level-headed too
But this loose lip of yours could sink Fifth Avenue
We all tried to share your point of vie-e-ew
Before we set the wheels in motion
And launched into the ocean

All aboard, the sinking ship is leaving
With all the secrets that you sold me, the ones without replies
All aboard, you'd better stop believing
We've only watered down the smallest town so we can multiply

I want a special meeting too
With Captain Everyday of Station Navy Blue
Oh, we all tried to share your point of view-eh-ew-ew
But you've completely undermined us
And now I'm here to drop a line, let's turn around
There's nobody around for miles (there's no one around)
There's nobody around for miles (there's no one around)
(We got a long, we got a long, we got a long way to go)
There's nobody around for miles (we've ran aground)
There's nobody around
(We got a long, we got a long, we've got a long way to go
We got a long, we got a long, we've got a long)

I'm kinda level-headed too
But this loose lip of yours could sink Fifth Avenue
We all tried to share your point of view-eh-ew-ew
Before we set the wheels in motion
And launched into the ocean

All aboard, the sinking ship is leaving
With all the secrets that you sold me, the ones without replies
All aboard, you'd better stop believing
We've only watered down the smallest town so we can multiply
