Seems So Heavy Lyrics
There's an aircraft somewhere down by the river
The thing ran underground, and was completely soundless
Until we cut it down to size and then we galvanized it
I stare into the sky
And it keeps me flying high
Head to head, we're staring equal, sharing empty eyes
And you've given everything to me
So if you really have to take off
I guess there's nothing I can say

Except I can't believe your plane is flying
It seems so heavy
I can't believe your plane is flying
It seems so heavy

Take a look around (take a look around)
You maybe think that you've found us
But nothing lies like no parade for the highest grade
It's time to call a spade a spade
And it takes a while to realize
That everything around you is too beautiful
She keeps me out of telling lies
And understands that giving personality is what she's done for me
Oh, yeah
I can't believe that your plane is flying
It seems so heavy
Watching from below, I'm reminded
My girl is ready
I can't believe your plane is flying
It seems so heavy
Watching from below, I'm reminded
My girl is ready
