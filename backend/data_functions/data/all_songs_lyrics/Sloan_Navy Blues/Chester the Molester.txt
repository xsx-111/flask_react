Chester the Molester Lyrics
Chester the molester's not without his charm
She can see herself hangin' off his arm
He's saying, "Hey bartender, put it on my tab
Unless my limit's running out again" (out again)
He's generous, but when he tired of coughing it up
Well, there's a bill that says he will
But he's never concerned
If he gets burned

Because it's hotter than lava at the centre of the sauna
But you know you're gonna get it when I get you where I wanna
I know (no!) it can't be too soon
Ooh

Chester the molester's trying to hide his ring (what a man!)
But he's the only guy who's halfway interesting
He's saying, "Hey bartender, can you fill 'er up
Because you see she's running out again" (out again)
"You thought I was the type of guy that never put out, but I'm not
Any more than you were..."

Because it's hotter than lava at the centre of the sauna
But you know you're gonna get it when I get you where I wanna
I know (no!), can't be too soon
I know (no!) it can't be too soon
Ooh
Don't give in
Say you're gonna turn around and leave
Don't give in
Say you're gonna turn around and leave

Chester the molester never kept his word (what a man!)
He never bought that drink and now he's lost his bird
He's saying, "Hey bartender, can I look you up
If I'm ever coming out again" (out again)
She's courteous but shuts him down, he's wondering still
If there's a pill that says she will
Cause he's never concerned
But he'll get burned

Because it's hotter than lava at the centre of the sauna
But you know you're gonna get it when I get you where I wanna
I know (no!) it can't be too soon
I know (no!) it can't be too soon
