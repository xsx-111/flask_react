Modern LyricsJericho's strange, throbbing with life at its heart -
People are drawn together, simultaneously torn apart....
Foundations are shattered in the city
Inside the barricaded doors;
Hiding behind their walls, lonely as night falls
Maybe the people are waiting for trumpets
Babylon's strange, seventh wonder of the earth -
Gardens ablaze in colour, slowly rotting in the dirt
And, with your head on fire, you can't really see
The hanging gardens sing
But with a hollow ring :
The life is false, it's killing me....
Don't look back or you'll turn to stone;
Look around before your life is overgrown
With concrete slabs
On your back the searching eyes that stab
Between chintz curtains, glinting
But never owning to a name...
Like the inmates of asylums
All the citizens are contagiously insane....
Atlantis is strange, the explosion of an age -
No-one really knows what to do
And the city is a cage
It traps in ashen hours and concrete towers
Imprisons in the social order
The city's lost its way
Madness takes hold today...
I can't live under waterEmbed
