Red Shift LyricsOnce, all the stars in the sky were bright
Now they're red and fading
And all the colours we wore, the shades that we bore
Have moved
And the gold turns to red with no time for changes
Red Shift, all moving away from we
Once, constellations were holy, now darkness
Pervades all the older ones
And in the brunt of implosion, all yesterday's golden
Now reddened suns
And hope is a word with no space for blame in
Red Shift, displaced now in time and relativity
Red Shift, all moving away from we
So here I am, though I might well be with me
I'm falling down deep to the rim of the wheel
Is it sham?
Does the world have a meaning?
The more that we know , the greater confusion grows:
Stars are like atoms, and atoms are patterns
And probably in the end
Maybe its all been a dream ....
Time locked in negative matter
All theories shatter beneath the weight
Happy is the man who believes that the world
Is a dream and all reason, fate
And time moves on with no time
The eye moves on with no rhyme
And I'm a song in the depth of the galaxies
Red Shift is taking away my sanity
Red Shift, all moving away from we ....Embed
