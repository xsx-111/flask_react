Nice Day for a Sulk Lyrics
Nice day for a sulk, the girl smells of milk
Her horsey teeth explode around us
And we run for cover, she found us
In the cheapo bar with a bag of chips

Nice day for a mood, the forecast is good
The kids are melting in the doorway
Keep the gang together, there's no way
You will ever be misunderstood by me


Nice day for a jam, the fall Manfred Mann
Dance party summer lasts forever
When the band's together and Bobby
Drank too much and fell in the ClydeEmbed
