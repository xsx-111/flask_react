Beyond the Sunrise LyricsJoseph was traveling with a heavy load
His dreams were broken and deep sorrow flowed from his brow
Closer to sundown he prepared to rest
Set down the burden
Lay upon his chest
Then she came
Sir, come to me and I will keep you warm
Taste hope in my skin and faith with the dawn
You will rise
Beyond the sunrise that is where we live
Feeding our counsel and true comfort give
Traveling men
Joseph was sure the liquor had caused this dream
His eyes were sure that heaven was not her scene
She was no saint
Sir, come to me and I will keep you warm
Taste hope in my skin and faith with the dawn
You will riseEmbed
