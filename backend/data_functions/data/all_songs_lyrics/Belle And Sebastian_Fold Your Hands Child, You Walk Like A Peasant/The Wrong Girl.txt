The Wrong Girl LyricsI went looking for my darling
I went looking for a sign
And I found her in the morning
Somewhere in the back of my mind
I'm not what I could be
I need a true love
I went looking and I found one
The wrong girl, the wrong kind
The wrong hand to be holding
The wrong eyes to go searching behind
The wrong dream to have in my mind
I went looking for my darling
I went looking for a sign
And I found her in the morning
Somewhere in the back of my mind
I'm not what I could be
I need a true love
I went looking and I found one
The wrong girl, the wrong kind
The wrong hand to be holding
The wrong eyes to go searching behind
The wrong dream to have in my mind
I'm not what I could be
I need a true love
I went looking and I found one
The wrong girl, the wrong kind
The wrong hand to be holding
The wrong eyes to go searching behind
The wrong dream to have in my mindEmbed
