Here We Go LyricsUh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah

Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner

Well, I got the mean time slippin' down the slide
Some uptight right wing political homicide
Do what you want
Take what you will
Take it in like a south paw
Flip it on the grill
Bourgeoisie, protocol
Bottoms up boys, this is your last call
Happy hour doesn't last too long
You know it never does
So I sit here on a bar stool lookin' at the sky
Got a buck and a quarter
And a bucket full of rye
Don't step out of line, you'll get time in the brig
Don't yield to the mighty
You got your own dirt to dig
Dirt to dig, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah

Well, me and my flea bag friends, we ran
To have our own feast of Crispian
Murphy was there with a number 22
They were got caught in the middle
Of a coup, you will
Lose me if I don't lose you
And I will lose me if I don't lose you

So, we haven't chosen
Anyone of you to condemn
So, make your decision and choose your side
Or let us begin
(Oh yeah, yeah) (Oh yeah, yeah)
(Oh yeah, yeah) (Oh yeah)
Steeped in knowledge
I'll step from the board
Down to the speak easy
With my double-edged sword
You know the deal
You got to spin the wheel
I heard the heavens are full of sevens
And as a matter of fact
You know that cat, suicide jack
He don't play like that
Truth is, he don't really play at all

Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeah
Here we go
Leave it on the back burner
Take it to the dry town, yeahEmbed
