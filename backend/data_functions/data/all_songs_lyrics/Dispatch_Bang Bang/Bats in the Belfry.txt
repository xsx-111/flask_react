Bats in the Belfry Lyrics
Old man river
Said you can go your own way
If you just leave him alone
It doesn't matter
Do not deliver all your things today
We are going home

Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry, now
We're now so...hungry

I've got bats in the belfry
I'm in the kitchen boiling society
I'm in the open catching all the leaves
We all see what we want

Old man river (Old man river)
Said you can go your own way
If you just leave him alone
It doesn't matter
Do not deliver (do not deliver)
All your things today (all your things ooooo)
We are going home
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry now
We're now so...hungry

I've got bats in the belfry
I'm in the kitchen boiling society
I'm in the open catching all the leaves
We all see what we want

I have a crazy idiosyncrasy
Its affinity to serendipity
And in this eternal epiphany
No hypocrisy or duplicity

Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry now
We're now so...hungry

I've got bats in the belfry
I'm in the kitchen boiling society
I'm in the open catching all the leaves
We all see what we want1Embed
