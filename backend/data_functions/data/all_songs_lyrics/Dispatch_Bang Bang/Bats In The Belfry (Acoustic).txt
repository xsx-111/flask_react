Bats In The Belfry (Acoustic) LyricsBats in the Belfry, take one

Old man river
Said you can go your own way
If you just leave him alone
It doesn't matter
Do not deliver all your things today
We are going home

Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry, now
We're now so...hungry

I've got bats in the belfry
I'm in the open catching all the leaves
I'm in the kitchen boiling society
We all see what we want

Old man river (Old man river)
Said you can go your own way (go your own)
If you just leave him alone (leave him alone)
No matter
Do not deliver (do not deliver)
All your things today
Everyone will be alone (alone)
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry now
We're now so...hungry

I've got bats in the belfry
I'm in the open killing society
I'm in the kitchen boiling all the leaves
We all see what we want

I have a crazy idiosyncrasy
Its affinity to serendipity
And in this eternal epiphany
No hypocrisy or duplicity

Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry now
We're now so...hungry

I've got bats in the belfry
I'm in the kitchen boiling society
I'm in the open catching all the leaves
We all see what we want
I've got bats in the belfry
I'm in the kitchen boiling society
I'm in the open catching all the leaves
We all see what we want

Old man river (old man river, yeah)
Old man river
Old man river (old man river, yeah)
Old man river (old man river, yeah yeah yeah)

Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama, oh mama
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama, oh mama
Oh mama, we're now so hungry (I'm so hungry)
Mama, we're now so hungry
Mama, we're now so hungry
We're now so, yeah, yeah, yeah, hungry (hungry)
YeahEmbed
