Mission Lyrics
Let it be known
To all your misbelievin'
Whatcha been seein'
That we will not stand off
Will not be mistaken

We will go there, leave this weakness
Can't take this from me
Oh yeah, we will go there, leave this weakness
Cause you're
I have been waiting

Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission to be
So well, oh well, the way I see

People damn this and damn that
There will be no talk of turnin' back, yeah
Damn this, damn that, damn people talkin'
We will fly sometimes
We will find our own way
We will fly sometimes
We will find our own
Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission to be
So well, oh well, the way I see

That we are not so
We are not given
We are not sold on what we have seen
We are not so
We are not given we
We are not sold on what we have seen
( never coming back, yeah)
Oh we could! We could!
The list is long, we are many strong, the ceilings are comin' down!

Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a mission
Low, we are not so, we on a missionEmbed
