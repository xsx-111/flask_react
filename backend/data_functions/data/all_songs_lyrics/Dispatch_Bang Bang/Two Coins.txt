Two Coins Lyrics
I stick loneliness, your lips, and the two coins of your eyes
Into my pockets, yeah
Well, the train skates into Port Henry
Late Sunday (alright)
Sometimes when I'm riding high
Feeling fine
You know there's something troubling you
Troubling my mind

So I reach into my pocket for some small change
I reach into my pocket for some small change

I want bones like iron, blood like mercury
So I can tell you when I'm rising
When I'm, sinking in
(I'm sinking in)
(I'm sinking in)
I'm sinking in

I reach into my pocket for some small change
I reach into my pocket for some small change, yeah
(Harmonica Solo)

I'm gonna take it to the people
Yeah
We're gonna take it to the people
Yeah
We're gonna take it to the people
Yeah
We're gonna take it to the people
Yeah

Hey, let's drink from the cup and share some luck
Go ahead and laugh, 'cause it don't cost much
No, no, it don't, don't cost much

I stick loneliness, your lips, and the two coins of your eyes
Into my pockets, yeah
I stick loneliness, your lips, and the two coins of your eyes
Into my pockets, yeahEmbed
