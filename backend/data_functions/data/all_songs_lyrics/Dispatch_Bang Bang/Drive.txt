Drive Lyrics
Daddy, I want to fly today
I wanna get up and go, wanna find some time
Mama, I hear what you're sayin'
I wanna feel alive and get inside

Hey I wanna drive
I'm alright if you're alright
Hey I wanna drive
I'm alright if you're alright

Tell me what to think
It's been years since we've been flyin'
Show me what you're seein'
I wanna feel alive, wanna take this dive

Hey I wanna drive
I'm alright if you're alright
Hey I wanna drive
I'm alright if you're alright

Hey I wanna drive
I'm alright if you're alright
Hey I wanna drive
I'm alright if you're alright
You're alrightEmbed
