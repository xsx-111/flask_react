Railway LyricsYeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
So all of a sudden I'm facing the raging river that passed me by
Do I turn around, do I turn my eye to the sun
In the apex of the high, high noon
I'm on a flatbed yellow pickup underneath the half moon
Cut me, cut me, cut me some slack, Jack
And jump on the back, if you can handle the candle
Then you can't handle the wax
Your just going to get sacked
It's as simple as that
But before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In a boat a little bigger than a bath tub
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
This water that I must give her, can I get some?
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
(I think I heard you, yeah)
Down by the railway station
People move a new direction
Take a ticket from who you can
And then drive that train
(Repeat)
She was a black Thai bombshell out of Bombay
She was easy on the eyes so I had nothing to say
Said take your water to the Leprechaun man
You got to the bell rings three, do you understand?
Little piece of me wants to go (I don't know)
Turn around and what do ya do? (I don't know)
Look at me, what do ya do? (I don't know)
DING DONG DING
(That's the bell!)
And I know you know I know I don't know you very well
But if I did I would groove, and hit the ground running
But I don't, and I won't, so you've got another thing coming
He kicked up the river with a flick of his wrist
I popped him in the kisser cause I couldn't resist
I said to my sidekick, I'm up to my high wick
And now I'm getting a little homesick
So before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In a boat a little bigger than a bath tub
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
This water that I must give her, can I get some?
Before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In a boat a little bigger than a bath tub
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
This water that I must give her, can I get some?
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
(I think I heard you, yeah)
Down by the railway station
People move a new direction
Take a ticket from who you can
And then drive that train
(Repeat)
Drive it, Drive it
I said now, Drive it, Drive it
I said now, Drive it, Drive it
You've got to drive your train
Ride it, Ride it
I said now Ride it, Ride it
I said now Ride it, Ride it
You've got to ride your train
Yeah Yeah, (now ride it, you've got to ride it)Embed
