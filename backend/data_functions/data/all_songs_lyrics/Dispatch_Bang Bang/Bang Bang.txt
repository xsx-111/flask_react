Bang Bang Lyrics
Yeah

She woke me up with a bang, bang
Looking over cross eyed;
Had a big hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up, all the blood to my head
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I went over to the way side
Looking for the high tide
What will I find, will I find, will I find find
All I saw was a man that had a hat
That had a pom-pom, he's been there for years
Can someone tell me how long
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me
What I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me
What I could not find

You see this woman woke me up at a quarter 'til three
And I didn't know it then but she put a spell on me
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
And meet an old man to present my plea
So I headed way down to the big pier
To await and confront my big fear
I wheeled around behind to my blindside
To find an old man with a lime and a kind eye
Said "Mister, mister, with your beard so long
Won't you be a saint and tell me just where I'm going"
He pointed to a conch shell and then to the lime
And said, "This is all I really need to get by"
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find

Hey, hey mister man
I know you don't know who you think I
Think I am
But I can safely say, that I
Should've been sleeping, been sleeping
Been sleeping, been sleeping the day away
Hey, hey


I said "'Scuse me, have you got the time"
He shrugged his shoulders said, "Get a spine"
Coconut hit me on the head,  jonesin' for a fig
I got booked last night, I need another fix, dig?
Yeah, just then I see a twinkle, twinkle in the old man's eye
And a wave-tossed bottle is thrown to the sky
I caught it on the rebound, it landed with a soft sound
I took out the message and put the bottle down
Inside was the antidote to the spell
And I read it to the man 'cause he couldn't read so well
Said "Don't worry about a thing, ya know your path is true
Just ease your mind have a banana or two"
Well, goodness, goodness, woe is me
The man nearly flipped to learn that he was free
But just before we left and started kicking it
I picked up the bottle and star-sixed it
Kick kick shuffle shuffle back to the beach
With a tune on my lips and my quest in reach
If that woman comes to you with her song so sweet
Say damn, let the poor sucker sleep
Let him sleep
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find1Embed
