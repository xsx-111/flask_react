Out Loud Lyrics
Would you be the wind to blow me home?
Would you be a dream on the wings of a poem?
And if we were walking through a crowd
Well you know I'd be proud

If you'd call my name out loud
If you'd call my name out loud
Do you suppose that I would come running?
Do you suppose I'd come at all?
I suppose I would

And if we were walking down a dead-end street
Would you be the one to let our eyes meet?
Or would you just keep on walking down to the turnaround?
'Cause you know I'd be proud

If you'd call my name out loud
If you'd call my name out loud
Do you suppose that I would come running?
Do you suppose I'd come at all?
I suppose I would

And if I was gone from the land we know
Would you be the dawn, let your beauty still show?
And if you were walking, heard the cold night coming
Would you call my name, 'cause you know I'd come running

If you'd call my name out loud
If you'd call my name out loud
Do you suppose that I would come running?
Do you suppose I'd come at all?

You know I would
You know I would
You know I would
You know I would
I'd come running
I'd come running
If you'd call my name out loud1Embed
