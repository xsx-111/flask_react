The Way It Goes Lyrics
A forgotten whisper screams at me now
So that I don't forget how
To sit like a child on my mothers knee
How dare that child be me

And it's trot trot to Boston
And trot trot to Lynn
And trot all the way home again
But don't let me fall in

'Cause I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs

So race me up the loft
Up the ladder until I get lost
And let you be an arms length away
So you can wake me and tell me of the day

And it's trot trot to Boston
And trot trot to Lynn
And trot all the way home again
But don't let me fall in
'Cause I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs

So where are you going?
Did you follow me?
And how could you see so well? So well
You were helpless like a dove at bay
But what, what did you say when he pulled it out
Did you shout, did you shout, did you whoa

'Cause I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs
I'm slipping through your legs

So where are you going?
Did you follow me?
And how could you see so well? So well
You were helpless like a dove at bay
But what, what did you say when he pulled it out
Did you shout, did you shout, did you whoa
And the way it goes, and I can't remember
And the way it goes, and I can't remember
And the way it goes, and I can't remember
And the way it goes, and I can't remember
And the way it goes, and I can't remember
And the way it goes, and I can't rememberEmbed
