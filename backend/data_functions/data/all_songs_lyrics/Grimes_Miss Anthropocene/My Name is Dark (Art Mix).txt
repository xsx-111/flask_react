My Name is Dark (Art Mix) Lyrics
So, we party when the sun goes low
Imminent annihilation sounds so dope
I'm not shy but I refuse to speak
Because I don't trust you to understand me

You know me as the girl who plays with fire
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark

(I hear they're calling my name)
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
(I hear they're calling my name)
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore
I never trust the government and pray to God for sure, yeah
I don't need to sleep anymore
That's what the drugs are for

Every city has a place like this
Underneath the bridges where the tainted kiss
Put on "Bullet with Butterfly Wings"
So that I can sing along while I break things
You know me as the girl who plays with fire
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark
Ooh, you know me as the girl who plays with fire
But this is the song I wrote you in the dark

(I hear they're calling my name)
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore
I never trust the government and pray to God for sure, yeah
I don't need to sleep anymore
That's what the drugs are for

Paradise on my right, and h-h-hell on my left
The a-a-angel of death, right behind me
Paradise on my right, and h-h-hell on my left
The a-a-angel of death, right behind me
Paradise on my right, h-h-h-hell on my left
And the angel of death, she said to God
"Un-fuck the world, un-fuck the world
You stupid girl, you stupid girl"

Oh, oh
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
I'm not gonna sleep anymore
The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore
I never trust the government and pray to God for sure, yeah
I don't need to sleep anymore
That's what the drugs are for
That's what the drugs are for
(Anymore, that's what the drugs are for)

The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore
I never trust the government and pray to God for sure, yeah
The boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore
I never trust the government and pray to God for sure, yeah26Embed
