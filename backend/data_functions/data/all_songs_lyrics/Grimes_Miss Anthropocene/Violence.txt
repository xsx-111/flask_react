Violence Lyrics
I'm, like, begging for it, baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby, it's violence, violence
Baby, it's violence
But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
'Cause you, ha, ha, you feed off hurting me
Off hurting me, yeah, ha

I'm, like, begging for it, baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby, it's violence, violence
Baby, it's violence
But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
'Cause you, ha, ha, you feed off hurting me
Off hurting me, yeah, ha-ha

You wanna make me bad, make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna make me bad? Pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"
I'm, like, begging for it, baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby, it's violence, violence
Baby, it's violence
But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see
'Cause you, ha, ha, you feed off hurting me
Off hurting me, yeah

You wanna make me bad, make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna make me bad? Pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"
You wanna make me bad, make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna make me bad? Pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"
You wanna make me, make me
Make-make me, make me, make-make me, make me
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna pay me, pay me
Pay me back-back, pay me back
Said, "I like it like that," said, "I like it like that"
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
And I like it like that23Embed
