IDORU Lyrics
You are the only one
Babe, I was so numb
And even though I'm breaking, at least
I feel something (Just like release)

Look, I say
As my fingers tremble
This is what I am
And, and, and you
Fingers tremblin' too
Understand

Yeah, we could play a beautiful game
We could play a beautiful game
You could chase me down in the name
Of love
I wanna play a beautiful game
Even though we're gonna lose
But I adore you
Adore you

You are the only one
Babe, I was so dumb, ooh, ooh
And even though I'm breaking, at least
I feel something (How can you be so mean?)
Choose, I say
As my fingers tremble
This is who I am
And, and, and you
Fingers tremblin' too
Understand

Yeah, we could play a beautiful game
We could play a beautiful game
You could chase me down in the name
Of love
I wanna play a beautiful game
Even though we're gonna lose
But I adore you
Adore you

Unrequited love has reassembled me
I think it's crazy
And if you said I do
I'd reassemble you, baby
And you're so cool
'Cause you don't think you're cool
You can abuse it
Because you made my all-time favorite music
We could play a beautiful game
We could play a beautiful game
You could chase me down in the name
Of love
I wanna play a beautiful game
Even though we're gonna lose
But I adore you
I adore you
So, I ignore you

We could play a beautiful game
We could play a beautiful game
You could chase me down in the name
Of love
But there you are, getting away
Think we finally lose
But I adore you
I adore you
I adore you, oh
I adore you
I adore you
I adore you

You, you
You, you
You, you
You, you, you17Embed
