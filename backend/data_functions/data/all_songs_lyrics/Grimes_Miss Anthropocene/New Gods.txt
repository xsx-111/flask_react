New Gods Lyrics
Oh, you're all I know
But what can I do if I can't see you? It's too bright
Broken glass that shines like Northern Lights
So I pray, but the world burns
And still, you need to come first
So I don't know where you stand

Are you a man?
Are you something I can't stand?

Hands reaching out for new gods
You can't give me what I want

But what do I know? Oh
What do I know?
I wanna let go, I
I wanna, wanna, wanna let go

I wear black eyeliner, black attire, yeah
So take me higher and higher and higher
But the world is a sad place, baby
Only brand new gods can save me
Only brand new gods can save me
Only brand new gods

Hands reaching out for new gods
You can't give me what I want
Hands reaching out for new gods
You can't give me what I want12Embed
