Before the fever Lyrics(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I tease my little ashtray
With a burning cigarette
I don't want to run away
I don't even know you yet
I got everything you want
I can make it feel so wet
I'm a little bit in love with you
I can take your picture, baby
This is the sound of the end of the world
Dance me to the end of the night, be my girl
Madness, intellect, audacity
Truth and the lack thereof
They will kill us, oh, have no doubt
There are many ways in
But there's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's so many ways in
But there's only one way out
This is the sound of the end of the world
I get lost
Can you get lost with me, baby?
I get lost
Can you get lost with me, baby?
I get lost (I get lost, I get lost)
I get lost (Can you get lost with me, baby?)
(Lost)
(I get lost) (Lost with me, baby?)
(I get lost)
(There's a way through, ooh)
(There's always a way through)
(Ooh-ooh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)8Embed
