So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth (Art Mix) Lyrics
O silly love
Coming here
When I said, "Go"

Weigh me down
O love
Me now
O love

Yeah, oh
So heavy, I fell through the earth
Yeah, oh
'Cause I fucking love
Yeah, oh
So heavy, I fell through the earth
Yeah, oh
'Cause I'm full of love from you

O silly love
Coming here
When I said, "Go"
Weigh me down
O love
Me now
O love

Yeah, oh
So heavy, I fell through the earth
Yeah, oh
'Cause I fucking love
Yeah, oh
So heavy, I fell through the earth
Yeah, oh
'Cause I'm full of love from you

So heavy I fell
Through the earth, baby
So heavy I fell
Through the earth, baby
So heavy I fell
Through the earth, baby
So heavy I fell
So heavy I fell
So heavy I fell12Embed
