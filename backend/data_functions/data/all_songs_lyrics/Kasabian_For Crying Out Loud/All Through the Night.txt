All Through the Night Lyrics
All through the night I see her as a confusion
Love seems to be a distant light
Long was the road for your heart was an illusion
Haven't figured out the way you roll

I'm tired of sleeping in the day
Tried to look the other way
All I ever hear is you call my name, call my name

Call my name (all through the night)
Call my name (all through the night)

Down in the woods you can hear the wolves are howling
Climbing up the walls again tonight
Throw on some shades mooch around, do some prowling
Nothing seems as good as it once was

I'm walking in a trance, you see
Caught in her electricity
All I ever hear is you call my name, call my name
Call my name (all through the night)
Call my name (all through the night)
Call my name (all through the night)
She could always make the bed bugs bite

Call my name (all through the night)
Call my name (all through the night)
Call my name (all through the night)
Had enough I'm turning out the lightsEmbed
