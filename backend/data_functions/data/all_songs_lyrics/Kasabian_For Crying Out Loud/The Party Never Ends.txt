The Party Never Ends Lyrics
Here we are looking at the sun
Nothing's gonna change
All strung out beached upon the shore
You said I don't ever want to change no more

We spent all our nights drinking Patrón
Under shark infested skies
All those fine weather friends, they were out of control
In your hilltop paradise
Go again
The party never ends

Basquiat's hanging on the wall
Sugar daddies at your beck and call
It wears me out but we do it all again
I love the way you walk into the room and set it off

We spent all our nights drinking Patrón
Under shark infested skies
All those fine weather friends, they were out of control
In your hilltop paradise
Always dance with the devil under pale moonlight
Never faced up to the fear
You would strut around like Cruella De Vil
But the view looked good from here
It’s all we ever know
Another lost weekend
Trading all the blows
The party never ends
The party never ends

The party never ends
The party never ends
The party never ends1Embed
