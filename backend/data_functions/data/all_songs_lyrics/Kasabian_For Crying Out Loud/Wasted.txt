Wasted Lyrics
Summer is here once again
So I'm told
But you won't catch me in my shorts
I'd rather just sit in this bar and drink all day
Knowing that you'll wander in through the door, door

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died

Summer is here once again
And there you are
I see you're alone so I make my move
Give me the eyes the ones that lit the fuse
The eyes that could lift up my feet off the ground, ground, ground

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died
Come on now, come on now
Come on let's get together
Come on now, come on now
Come on let's get together

There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died
There's been so much time wasted without you by my side
Remember how we danced off our heads
Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never diedEmbed
