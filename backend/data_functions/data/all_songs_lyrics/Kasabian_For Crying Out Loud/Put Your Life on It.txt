Put Your Life on It Lyrics
Put your life on it
Put your life on my love
We'll get right on it
Like we always could
We can ride through it
I'll take the rain out of the storm
Take a chance on it
What you waiting for?

Everybody wants you
You don't even have to try

Put your light on it
Shine a light on our love
We were made for it
You've been sent here from above

Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it now?

And I
Wanna say I love you
Won't let you down
You're never gonna be without
(Never gonna stop, never gonna stop)
Put your life on it
Put your life on my love
Take the weight from it
Take the weight out of your world
Get the car, we can run
Get the jump on everyone
No limit to my love
No places I won't go

Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it now?
(No limit to my love, no places I won't go)
We just gonna sing it
We just gonna sing it loud
(Never gonna stop, never gonna stop)

And I
Wanna say I love you
Won't let you down
You're never gonna be without
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)
And I
Wanna say I love you
Just one more time
Let me scream it out
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)
And I (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Wanna say I love you (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Won't let you down (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
You're never gonna be without (Oh)
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)
And I (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Wanna say I love you (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Just one more time (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Let me scream it out (Oh)
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)
And I (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Wanna say I love you (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Just one more time (Put your life on it, put your life on it)
Let me scream it out (Oh)
(It's never gonna stop, it's never gonna stop)
Put your life on it
Put your life on my love
Put your life on it
Put your life on my love2Embed
