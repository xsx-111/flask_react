Twentyfourseven Lyrics
Where goes, where goes the sunlight?
I wish I knew cos it is gone now
You've been staring at the traffic
Just try your hardest not to panic

You want to rock it cos you got none
You can't taste it cos you feel numb
No one will give it so just take some
You're trying hard just to be someone

Toss and turning in your bed
There's no escaping from what's in your head
Living is easy when you're dead inside
You want to run but you can't hide

You want to rock it cos you got none
You can't taste it cos you feel numb
No one will give it so just take some
You're trying hard just to be someone

Twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, Twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, Twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, Twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven
You want to rock it cos you got none
You can't taste it cos you feel numb
No one will give it so just take some
You're trying hard just to be someone

Are you mad in England?
Cause the walls are paper thin
Yeah, we're all mad in England
The city's crumbling
Twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, Twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven, twenty-four seven

You want to rock it cos you got none
You can't taste it cos you feel numb
No one will give it so just take some
You're trying hard just to be someoneEmbed
