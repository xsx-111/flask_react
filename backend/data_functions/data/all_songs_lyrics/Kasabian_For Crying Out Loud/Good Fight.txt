Good Fight Lyrics
She looked cold, I said it's alright
Come with me and fight a good fight
Take my coat and two's a cigarette
Keep on moving on with no regret

She don't like the sun
She love the rain
Let it pour on everyone
She dont want it safe
She want it strange
Set the freaks on everyone

Don't get blinded by the bright lights
Come with me and fight the good fight
Do you feel like a melted sky
Work it out cause there's a reason why

She don't like the sun
She love the rain
Let it pour on everyone
She could have you all it's just a game
Let me play it all night long
I got a good one, I got one good
I try to get through to you
I can't stop myself I'll always want you
Almost there I said hold tight
Come with me and fight the good fight
Worked my fingers right to the bone
Don't want to spend the night all alone

She don't like the sun
She love the rain
Let it pour on everyone
She could make the stars give up on fame
Watch them all just sing along

I got a good one, I got one good
She said, "You're mouthy, unhealthy
But I think I would"
I try to get through to you
I try to get through to you
I try to get through to you
I can't stop myself I'll always want youEmbed
