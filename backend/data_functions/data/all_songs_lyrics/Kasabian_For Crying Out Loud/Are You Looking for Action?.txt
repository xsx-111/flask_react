Are You Looking for Action? Lyrics
We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Broken bottles, leather biscuits
I see no way of getting outta here
I can't hear you, better use a speak and spell
It's such a lovely way of getting out of it

We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Tollbooth parking Ford Fiesta
Got me licking on your '99
Satsumas crawling with your ski boots on
I said I've never met anybody as high as you

We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
We're just looking for some action
Just looking for some action, over here
Everybody in the place now
We're giving you the chance to disappear
To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Everybody down into the basement
Give up get down, until the sunlight
They'll be sweeping you up off the pavement
Give up get down get your flashlight
Give up get down get your flashlight
Give up get down get your flashlight
Give up get down get your flashlight1Embed
