Sixteen Blocks Lyrics
A true friend is hard to find
Go get yourself outside of your mind
Whether it's right or whether it's wrong
I'm on the treadmill all day long
A true friend is hard to find
Chicken on the high street making you bind
Shimmying up the totem pole
I got sick of the arctic roll

I walked for sixteen blocks
Tiptoed over those burning rocks
You were a household name
Wonder what they say if they knew your game

Let's go daywalking
I heard enough of everybody talkin'
I hear the choir singing
And now the alarm bells are ringin'
Cause you can't, can't stop this
Ain't never ever ever gonna top this
Cause I'm all, all in this
And you'll be lucky to survive this
A true friend is hard to keep
I'm so quick I'm fast asleep
What went down in the function room
All you talk is doom and gloom

I walked for sixteen blocks
The plastic beakers gave electric shocks
Oh no, dude got grey
Should have stayed at home with your bird of prey

Let's go daywalking
I heard enough of everybody talkin'
I hear the choir singing
And now the alarm bells are ringin'
Cause you can't, can't stop this
Ain't never ever ever gonna top this
Cause I'm all, all in this
And you'll be lucky to survive this

Let's go daywalking
I heard enough of everybody talkin'
I hear the choir singing
And now the alarm bells are ringin'
Cause you can't, can't stop this
Ain't never ever ever gonna top this
Cause I'm all, all in this
And you'll be lucky to survive thisEmbed
