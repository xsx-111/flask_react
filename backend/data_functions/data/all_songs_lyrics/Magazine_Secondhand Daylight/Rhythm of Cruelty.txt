Rhythm of Cruelty LyricsI brought your face down on my head
It was something I rehearsed in a dream
You're too good looking for your own damn good
And you don't know what it could mean
You've got me dying of thirst in the meantime
It even hurts when I scream
You've got me drowning and still in the meantime
You don't know what it could mean
Because in my drunken stupor
I've got to admire your ingenuity
And I nod my head, oh so wisely
To the rhythm of your cruelty
You've got me dying of thirst in the meantime
It even hurts when I scream
You've got me drowning and still in the meantime
You don't know what it could mean
Because you want to have your price
And something you could hold your faith up to
I don't know how to tell you this
But you've got it coming all the way to you
You don't even know what it could mean
You don't even know what it could mean
I don't know what it could mean...
We don't even know what it could meanEmbed
