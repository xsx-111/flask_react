Believe That I Understand LyricsHere is the love of your life
Once again. once again
She fits the part
She fills the space
She'll never ever be out of place
She's got it all with her saintly face
Another sick monkey
With a saintly face
Here is the lie of the land
Once again, once again
You squeeze yourself
Out of your thin inner world
You squeeze yourself
Into the big wide world
It's all in the hands
Of your very best friends
It's good to agree
With the good guys again
You win some
Then you lose some
Put it out of your mind
You should look at me
So tell me your troubles again
And again and again
Tell yourself not to do it again
And again and again
You want to touch me
Show me your hands
You'd better believe that I understandEmbed
