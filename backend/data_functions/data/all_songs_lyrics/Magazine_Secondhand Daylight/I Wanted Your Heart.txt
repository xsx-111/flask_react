I Wanted Your Heart LyricsI wanted your heart
For the last time
I want to be in your bed
I want your words
To colour all that's been said
"I will love you when the devil is blind"
I wanted your heart
You didn't want mine
This is as close as I get
As I ever get
Falling for things
I never thought
I'd find myself
Falling for
As close as I get
Old ladies on the pavement
In the dense and empty hours
All as hard as nails
And brittle as pressed flowers
I was cold at an equally cold place
A cigarette between the flame and my face
You were laughing
Like the goon squad in my heart
This is as close ...
I wanted your heart
What do you think about
What I think about!
Truths that are lies
When you spell them out
Don't worry
Don't betray the slightest emotion
Yes I know
It's a separate emotion
As close as I getEmbed
