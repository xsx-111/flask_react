Rest Cure LyricsWhen this world is gettin' you down
And nothing is in its right place
Your friends are lettin' you down
And you can't seem to find the right face
All you want is me
All you need is me to give you
Rest cure for all your ills
Rest cure to make the world stand still
Rest cure and the world will bring you down no more
When livin' becomes just a task
And your burden's too heavy to bear
And life is travelin' so fast
That colours become just a glare
You can lean on me
And take my eyes to see, to give you
Rest cure for all your ills
Rest cure to make the world stand still
Rest cure and the world will bring you down no more
Take my hand and I'll show you where
Love can banish all your worries and despair
When you can't cling onto the past
'Cause you're not proud of anything you've done, no
And each moment seems like your last
'Cause you're robbed of all you've won
All you want is me
All you need is me to give you
Rest cure for all your ills
Rest cure to make the world stand still
Rest cure and the world will bring you down no more
You know the world won't bring you down no more, babe
And while I'm here, I'm just gonna make sure
You go on and on and on this wayEmbed
