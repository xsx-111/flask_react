Stone on the Water LyricsSo we restore harmony
Smooth the lines on the face of an old enemy
But there's no wood on the fire again
We could meet in a place, you know where
I know when to go
Skipped like a stone on the water
Fall with no trace to lie permanently
Ooh
Into the valley we roam, where we fumble around
Till we find our way home
Yet all we have is an old ball of string
Will it reach to the end of this dark labyrinth
No
Skipped like a stone on the water
Fall with no trace to lie permanently
Ooh
