Once Around the Block LyricsYou quiver like a candle on fire
I'm putting you out
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
And I'm fascinated by your style
Your beauty will last for a while
You're feeling instead of being
The more that I live on the inside
There's nothing to give
I'm infatuated by your moves
I've gotta search hard for your clues
I want to repair your desire
And call it a gift
That I stole from just wanting to live
Now I see the vision through your eyes
Your innocence no longer fuels surprise
Trying to outrun your fear
You're running to lose
Heart on your sleeve and your soul in your shoes
Take a left
A sharp left and another left
Meet me on the corner, we'll start againEmbed
