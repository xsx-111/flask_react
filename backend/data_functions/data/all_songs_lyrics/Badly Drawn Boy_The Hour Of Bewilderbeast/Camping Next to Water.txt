Camping Next to Water LyricsCamping next to water
The Fish infested slaughter
I feed the fishes into me
It's misty within reason
I'm hoping I don't freeze here
I fuel the fire, I feed its glow
But there's no use in feeling
All the things I'm feeling
There's no one here to feel with me
The second day is easier
Though it may be breezier
And the snow is falling down
But as the fire smolders
I never will grow older
Because I drink from Waterfalls
The stars above shine on me
I beckon them to fall on me
I'll catch and save them in a jar
My feet a mass of blisters
Collecting frost on whiskers
As I taste the morning Dew
I think my mind is clearer now
I want you to be nearer now
I'm ready to come back to you
'Cause there's no use in feeling
All the things I'm feeling
There's no one here to feel with meEmbed
