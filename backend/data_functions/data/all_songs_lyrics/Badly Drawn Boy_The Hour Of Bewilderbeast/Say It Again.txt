Say It Again LyricsYou squeeze the life right out of me
Like sapping the juice of a bumblebee
And then you call me honey
You say it once and it isn't funny
When you say it again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Now inside there's a style going on
A head full of dreams only room for one
Now I know you can't live without me
But I've no doubt that you'll never doubt me
Like you did before
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
And we're pumping out love into the sea
I'm full bodied and bursting with energy
Cold blooded your engines are running
But where you're going I'm not coming
'Cause I'm happy here
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Happy here)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Say it again
Say it again
Now we've find a rock steady beat
Now all we need is a melody
And words that mean something and nothing
So people hear and sing along
Until they say it again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Say it again)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
If there's trouble ahead it won't bother me
With no future I'll live on a memory
Dried up thoughts but my nose is runny
Say what you think but I know I'm funny
And I'll say it again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Say it again)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Say it again)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Say it again)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Say it again)
Say it again
Yeah say it again
Say it again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Say it again)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Say it again)
Say it againEmbed
