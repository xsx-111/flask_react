This Song LyricsThis Song will be here when you're old
This Song will heat you when you're cold
Believe you when I don't
This Song will heal from your soul
This Song will help you find a place to live
And teach you not to take but give
This Song will help you on your dying doubts
This Song song will send your lover flowers
Rest by this Song and the peace it brings
Beautiful song it has wingsEmbed
