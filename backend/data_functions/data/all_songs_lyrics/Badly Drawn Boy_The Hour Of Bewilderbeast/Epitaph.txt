Epitaph LyricsPlease don't leave me wanting more
I hope you never die
These's no need to say why
Just promise that you'll try
To give me all you can
I'll never ask for more
There's a new life thru the door
A cradle rocks and falls
As new fruit fills the trees
Cements the melody
To signify we're free
Our troubles passing
Through decaying, simple times
I'll tread your tail with pride
C'est maintenant decide
I've nothing better
Please don't leave me wanting more
I hope you never die
There's no need to say why
Just promise that you'll tryEmbed
