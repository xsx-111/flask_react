The Shining LyricsFaith pours from your walls
Drowning your calls
I've tried to hear
You're not near
Remembering when
I saw your face
Shining my way
Pure timing
Now I've fallen in deep
Slow silent sleep
It's killing me
I'm dying
To put a little bit of sunshine in your life
Soleil
All over you
Warm sun
Pours over me
Soleil
All over you
Warm sun
Now this slick fallen rift
Came like a gift
Your body moves
Ever nearer
And you will dry this tear
Now that we're here
And grieve for me
Not history
But now I'm dry of thoughts
Wait for the rain
Then it's replaced
Sun's setting
And suddenly you're in love with everything
Soleil
All over you
Warm sun
Pours over me
Soleil
All over you
Warm sunEmbed
