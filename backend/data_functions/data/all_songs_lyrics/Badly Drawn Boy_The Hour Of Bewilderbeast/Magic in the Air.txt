Magic in the Air LyricsWe laughed so much, then we cried all night
And you left your shoes in the tree, with me
I'll wear them to your house, tonight
Magic in the air, tonight
Yes, I just might try her
How she made me feel
Today, today, today feels right
We slept on leaves on my drive, all night
And you you gave me no restime
Nothing in this life for me, tonight
But nothing ever seemed so bright
And if you should lose me
You will track me down again
Before the summer ends
Cause love is contagious, when it's alright
Love is contagious, when it's alright
Love is alrightEmbed
