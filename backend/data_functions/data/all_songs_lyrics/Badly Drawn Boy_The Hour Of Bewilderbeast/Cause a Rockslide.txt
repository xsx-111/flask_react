Cause a Rockslide LyricsCan I get close to ya
If only for a while
I don't need to busy you
You're the jive guru and
I want to sing along with you
With you
Your sweetness, would cause a rockslide
If only before the summertime
This could be our last goodbye
Please darling, please don't cry
Ohh, ohh
Feeling the same as I did
Feeling the same as I might do tomorrow
Watching my hopes follow dreams down the drain
I'm only joking of course yet again
As I do
Watching another day turn into night
There goes another month
Doesn't it frighten you so?Embed
