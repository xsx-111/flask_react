Pissing in the Wind LyricsI've been pissing in the wind
I chance a foolish grin
And dribbled on my chin
Now the ground shifts beneath my feet
The faces that I greet never know my name
Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Now the drought is crippled by the rain
That hammers on my pain
We lose ourselves again
But all we need
Is to find a place to look
Our worm is on its hook
A love which dangles free
Let's watch it swim
Against the water's flow
In doubt the courage grows
With no guarantee
Just give me something
I'll take nothing
Just give me something
I'll take nothing
And so it goes
A moral to the tale
As tortoise catches snail
A strong heart will prevail
It keeps on pumping
It still needs something
Just give it something
I'll take nothing
Just give it something
To keep it pumping
And I'll take nothing
Just give me somethingEmbed
