Another Pearl LyricsWhy are you trembling so much
I don't think I ever felt so good
When all I need is to be free
Where I love you and you love me
Follow the circle sur la plage
On a mono coloured trip voyage
This is the colour of my world
Stay and watch me find another pearl
Follow the gold leaf trail back where
We were young and didn't have a care
Tracing the circles that we made
I don't wanna live life in the shade
Will this be a desert or a beach
Or a place to find the things we need
Now you and I make up perfect things
Watch me trade my wheels for wings
But don't ever use the wings to fly
Just the essence of a lullaby
Now I am a giant grain of sand
But I maybe slipping through your hand
Follow my colour coded world
And watch me find another pearl
It's a sound that I love
And it came from above
There's the sound of the sea
Are you following me?
Let's walk to the sound of distant shells
To a place where life would have no end
You'd be the mother of my pearls
If you follow me into my world
Back to a place where we'd be free
Where I love you and you love me
This is the colour of my world
Watch me find another pearl
Watch me find another pearlEmbed
