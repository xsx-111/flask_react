Sheep Lyrics
You are my shepard babe
I wouldn't have it any other way
My heavenly shepherd
Shepherd babe
You're such a good shepherd
Oh heavenly shepherd
We wouldn't have it no other way
Nah nah nah nahhhhh

I wish I was a sheep
Instead of a lion
Cause then I wouldn't have to eat
Animals that are dying
I wish I was a sheep
Instead of a lion
Cause then I wouldn't have to eat
This meat that is dying
I wish I was
One of your sheep
Only because
I wouldn't have to kill to eat
Oh how I wish I was
One of your gentle sheep
Only made out of love
Like a bird in retreat
Nah nah nah nahhhhh

If I was a sheep
I'd have to be quick on my feet
Running away all day
From a lioness trying to eat
Some do enough to creep
One of my fellow sheep
Living so humbly
Sympathetic with harmony
Have you ever seen
Two lions wearing meat?
Eagles too quick to creep
One ends up in another's teeth
It wouldn't be this way
If they were eating leaves
Oh how I always pray
I was one of your sheep

I'm a lion babe
Feeding off the sheep that graze
Off the leaf's and blades
I wouldn't have it any other way
I'm a lion babe
See me livin in the shade
I have everyone afraid
Roamin' free so no one's safeEmbed
