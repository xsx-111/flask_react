Made LyricsWhen covering skies
I'm all in
When covering eyes
You might miss your calling
Clouds in the distance
Rain drop falling
Don't cast your resistance
Upon those that are crawling
Breathing in inhale the pollen
Breathe again, inhale us all in
Why would I lie?
The Lord keeps on calling
Mayday
Mayday
Mayday...
Its finally paytime
Its finally paid
We're finally made
Its finally may
Its finally maytime
Its finally paid...Embed
