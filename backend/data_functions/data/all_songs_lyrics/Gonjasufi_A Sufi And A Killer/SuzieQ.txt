SuzieQ Lyrics
Suzie never made it, doesn't laugh
She was just wiling on her phone
Tell them everybody what we have
Killing them all night long

Tell them what to get
To want to
Blap blap blap blap
Pop pop pop pop

Carrying my halo
It's just following me
My ghetto
It keeps on swallowing me
My ghettos
It's just following me
Baby my ghetto
Keeps on swallowing me

Yeah wooh
I got em running through
Uh uh uh uh
What are we coming to?
Uh uh uh uh
What is it coming to?
What is it coming to?Embed
