Dobermins LyricsSitting here
Wonderin' how long will this
Fucking stop light take
All day feel the presence of
Another old cop's light
Rottweilers
Dobermins
Caught in a dog fight
Cops try and kill me
Guiltiness is not mine
I see their filthyness, caught
In my gods eye
Sniffin poweder from their gun
They're nothin' but some
Cowards on the run
Iâ€™m tearing their face up
Belly down and face up
Time for your to wake up
Pigs on horses wearing cowhideEmbed
