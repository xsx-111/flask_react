Love of Reign LyricsMaking love with angel's prey
Upon the children with a rainbow's play
Take me ya'll into another plane
The only counter music doesn't change
Save me now from them golden days
My body finally start to decay
Far across from his mother's pain
His sister never knew her brother's name
With blood we share the love was gained
I never lied you for the price of fame
No need for your umbrella- feel the love of reign
All of a sudden you're buzzed and chained
It's so enslaving, day by day
Fold into the pavement while we pray
While we pray
While we pray
Day by day
The love of reignEmbed
