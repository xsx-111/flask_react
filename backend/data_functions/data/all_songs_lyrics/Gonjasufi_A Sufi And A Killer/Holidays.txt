Holidays LyricsThose holidays
Lonely holidays
Holidays
Lonesome holidays
This life I live is like the lonely ways
The only way
Through these lonely days
Is to pick up those times I've thrown away
When will this feeling go away?
Oh, babe
Holidays
Babe, my holidays
Baby, my holidays
Such a lonely day
Why would I waste my time with them that don't replay?
Why would I waste my life trying to rewind the only state?
In past times I never spent so much energy on one repaste
This role had them all on- I know it's the only way
Hey, hey
So when I feel like I ain't got time to stay
I'll call you on my phone on holidays
On a holiday
All the lonely days
Sitting holidays
Jagging my hollow way
Janesaw Jennylaw
It's the only way
Oh, my...Embed
