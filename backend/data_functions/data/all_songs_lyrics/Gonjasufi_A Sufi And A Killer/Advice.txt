Advice LyricsIt's your only life
So it"s only right
To take your own advice
Cos' it's your only vice
Take your own advice
Cos it's only right
Its your only life
So take your own advice
Take your own advice, as if it was mine
You could save some lives, you could save some time
It's such a good life, if you make it right
Living on the cutting edge
Depending on the shape of the knife
Life is what you make it, and that's alright
Making the most of your days
Before you have to say goodnight
As the world continues to spin
Will you continue to sin?
Advice, advice...
Advice, advice...
Who will you turn to, when your love's spreading thin?
When no one's loving you, not even your own brethren
When sisters turn in too, and the light's looking dim
All the hate could hurt you, so you better look within
Advice, advice...
Advice, advice...Embed
