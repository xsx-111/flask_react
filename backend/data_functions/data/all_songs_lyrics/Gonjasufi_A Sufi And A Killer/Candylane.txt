Candylane LyricsCandylanes
Them streets at night
So deep in light
Covered with sheets of ice
And candy canes
So sweet and rot
Let's keep it tight
What an evening sight
With these fancy games
Ha-haa
Can't be named
The secret price
To seek advice
How to keep your life
Can't be chained
Backed by freedom's rights
Act with peace for verbs
Packing peaceful pipes
On all your family's mane
Ha-hooEmbed
