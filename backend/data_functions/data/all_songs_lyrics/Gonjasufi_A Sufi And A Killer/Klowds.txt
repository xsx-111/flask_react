Klowds LyricsLook to the sky
I see clouds
Look to the sun but I see clouds
Covering our skies
Look to the sky but I see clouds
Covering our sun
This is the result of our own
Wicked association
Surrounded by the fear and doubt
That lies within these wicked ones
All our lives they draw their knives
This is not our home
We are strangers unto this foreign land
Take head brothers and sisters, as these snakes breed
It's not our home, it's not
It is
It's not our home, it is
It's not our home
It's not our home
In the beginning was the WORD
Then came light
Heard through the nightEmbed
