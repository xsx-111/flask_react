She Gone. Lyrics
She's gone
She's gone
She's gone
She's gone
And I don't ever want to see her again
She's gone
She's gone
She's gone
She's gone
And I don't ever want to see her again

She keeps feeding us that hatred
And wondering why she's feeling
So mistreated and forsaken
It's because her inner demon
Keeps on stealing it, keeps taking
Oh my God how we've been waiting
We've been waiting
Waiting
Patient so patient
We've been waiting, so damn patient
We're patient, I'm waiting
Waiting!

I gave you my heart and love
And all you ever did is leave us so vacant
I tried, I gave
I cried, I prayed
I even played father to your kin
And everytime I was giving all you ever did is leave us with your hatred
When you're driving down the street
And acting like you do not know me
Wondering why your life's incomplete and you feel so damn lonely

Lonely
Lonely
Holy
Holy
Lonely
Lonely
Lonely
Lonely
Holy
Holy
AHH!
