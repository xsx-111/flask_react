Duet LyricsWhere did you find me?
Baby, don't you undermine me
You can refine me, you have perfect timing
You remind me of someone I've met before
Please underline me and let your wetness show
Let's do a duet
Let's do it and make it grimy, the way that the truth is
To the dotted line, you will never sign me
You remind me of someone I have let go
Baby you're shiny, sweetheart you have that glow
Let's keep it fluid, make me some music
Baby I'm winding; lady you have that soulEmbed
