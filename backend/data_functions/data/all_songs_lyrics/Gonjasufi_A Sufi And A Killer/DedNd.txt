DedNd LyricsEastern dreams going round my brain
Eastern dreams driving me insane
I got the trigger cocked back
Watch these devils drop back
They don't know where god's at
I'll show em if they talk back
Clicck powwwwwwwwwwww
They got that capped
Hahahaha
Watch they face get rocked back
Oh mighty lord in heaven
Do they know where they are heading
Looking at they skin it's shedding
They're heading for another deadenddddddd
Awwwww
They keep running away
Put em in a grave
Though he's coming today
See if they are saved
Though your running to play
None of you will pray
Til it's the coming of days
And you can't run away
To the beast
To the beast my brother
To the beast
To the beast
To the beast
To the beast my brother
To the beast
Eastern dreams going round my brain
Eastern dreams driving me insane
He say she say
Everybody think that they say
We say he say
Nobody is safe
Anything thing that we say
She think that she say
We think that we say
Nobody is safe
Why are you running ?
I keep running
Why are you running ?
I keep running
Why are you running ?
I keep running
Why are you running ?
I keep running1Embed
