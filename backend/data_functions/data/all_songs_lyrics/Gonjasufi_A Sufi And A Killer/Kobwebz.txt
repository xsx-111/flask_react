Kobwebz LyricsI gave your darkness some of my Heaven
I gave your heart and lungs a new wedding
I came with Hearts while you came with weapons
I came with God whom you are forgetting
Don't aim your problems in this direction
Don't blame Allah for your misconception
I'll play my odds
I'll take number seven
While you stay caught up in those thoughts you're webbing
Bendless is this animal2Embed
