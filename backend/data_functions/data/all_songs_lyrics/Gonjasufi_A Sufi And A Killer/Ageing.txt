As I'm getting older
I'm feeling so young
Breathe in the air
Like life just begun
I'm on a rant
Yes I have come
Thinking all in the spring time
Look what has sprung
Lord here I come
For you can know
And look who I brung
We've come as one
Ahahhah
Ahahhah
Ahahhah
Whooh
Once a man
Twice a child
Once a man
Twice a child
Once a man
Twice a child
Once a man
Twice a child
Once a man
Twice a child!
So while you're alive
Give them the highest vibes
Cause before you die
You gone end up again a child
Ohhhoh ooohhoh ohhohhohEmbed
