Bridge & Crown LyricsWelcome to the Bridge & Crown
Because we can go no farther down
There's a calm in the atmosphere
Only four types of patients here
Exacting, philosophical, indifferent, or hysterical
We seek relief
The common complaint
If you have a ring complete
Of ebon intaglio
Of quick Hermes
And his winged hat
You can enter entirely
Retire in the aftermath
So sing what you're feeling
And be surprised when the results arrive
Plan the way you want to wait it out
As you are
A doctor killed my father
So excuse me if I writhe this out alone
Everybody knows only the end can claim
Ultimate success
Everybody knows
We're holding on to little dreams
To drive our bodies all down the line
Till there's nothing left
Everybody knows
We're holding on to little dreams
To drive our bodies all down the line
Till there's nothing left
But the Bridge & Crown1Embed
