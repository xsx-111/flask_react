Modern Business Hymns LyricsOnce the tranqs had hit
Sleeping mind, spazzed into the future
Every night
Dream of screaming death
Silence in a vacuum
What a way to die
Pulled apart by the absence of what sustains us
I didn't dare go far
Years peeling faster
Modern Business Hymns
On the jump to Mars
And if what I saw was true
We'll never make the grade
No matter what we saved
'Cause to those that always have it
Money is no matter
And in these hungry times
Those trapped between stations
Will forget their manners
I didn't dare go far
Saving oxygen
For Modern Business Hymns
Before the Warp Guard
And if what they say is true
We'll never make the grade
No matter what we saved
'Cause to those who always have it
Money is no matter
And in these hungry times
Those trapped between stations
Will forget their manners
Around a distant star
Still counting credit, coin, or shell by proxy
Stuck on Earth
Eating dirt and growth from built-up respirators
While the rich
Sup on zebra mussels broiled in plankton
Wake me up
Let me live out my hours in a world that's on the level
The past is full of dead men
The future is a cruelty
Resign yourself
The past is full of dead men
The future is a cruelty
Resign yourself
Hey, have you heard them say
