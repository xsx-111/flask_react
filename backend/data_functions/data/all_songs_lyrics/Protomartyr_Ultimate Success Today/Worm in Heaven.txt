Worm in Heaven LyricsSo it's time to say goodbye
I was never too keen on last words
Hope I said something good
Grass has grown over me
Long before now
I hope you walk through life with a smile
Keep a knife in your purse
Be as needed as the nail
As neat as the pin
Stick into things
Stab into things
I wish you well, I do
May you find peace in this world
And when it's over
Dissolve without pain
I am the worm in heaven
So close to grace
Could lick it off of the bootheels
Of the blessed
I am the worm in heaven
After my life
They'll have me living out in the foothills
Cleaning the gilded gutter
I am the worm in heaven
Remember me how I lived
I was frightened
Always frightened
I did exist, I did
I was here, I am
And what I left behind
Never be the simple kind
I exist, I did
I exist, I did
I was here, I was, or
Never never never never never never never was
Never never never never never never never was
Never never never never never never never was
Never never never never never never never was
Never never never never never never never was
Never never never never never never never was
Never never never never never never never was
Never never never never never neverEmbed
