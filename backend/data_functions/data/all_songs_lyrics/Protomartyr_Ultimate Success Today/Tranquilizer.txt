Tranquilizer LyricsThe pain, the pain
Arrives again
Wait for relief
Under the tongue
One sixty seconds
Wait for the dissolve
The pain from side to side
Of right up from the gall
Black bile inside the mind
Fight off the pain
The pain into the sun
Unlocked, dissolve
Dissolve the pain
The pain, the pain
The pain, the pain
Relief, again, the pain
The pain, the pain
The pain, the pain
The pain, the pain
Tranquilizer
Get out, sit down
Tranquilizer
Get out, sit down
Tranquilizer
Get out, get out
In a golden light
Bent, curved, shut out
In a golden light
Hamadryads
Grow through me
In a cooling tower
Absence of being
The pain, the pain
It comes back again
The pain, the pain
The pain, the pain
From side to side
To side to side
To side to side
To side
Tranquilizer
Get out, sit down
Tranquilizer
Get out, sit down
30 seconds left
In a golden light
In a golden lightEmbed
