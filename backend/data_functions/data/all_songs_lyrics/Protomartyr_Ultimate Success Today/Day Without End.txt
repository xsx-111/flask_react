Day Without End LyricsI could not be reached
No matter how
Many times she repeats
An empty space
That's the whole of me
Forward is all I heard
Between the striking of the rod
A floating shadow of a hand
Across my heart
This is the dawning of the day without end
When fear steps into light
I've been planning for this day all my life
Or have I not?
Ultimate success today
Ultimate success today
Dull ache turned sharp
Short breath, never caught
Dull ache turned sharp
Short breath, never caught
Dull ache turned sharp
Short breath, never caught
Dull ache turned sharp
Short breath, never caught
Dull ache turned sharp
Short breath, never caught1Embed
