Processed by the Boys Lyrics
When the ending comes, is it gonna run
At us like a wild-eyed animal?
A foreign disease washed upon the beach
A dagger plunged from out of the shadows

A cosmic grief beyond all comprehension
All good laid low by outside evil
Against belief, a riot in the streets
A giant beast turning mountains into black holes
Fiction
Fiction
No, none of that
Rolling in your heads
Reality has a far duller edge

Everybody's hunted with a smile
Being processed by the boys

They got the job when they came back to town
Why not let 'em earn a living?
Fill out the form, download the app
Submit your face into the scanner
Everybody's hunted with a smile
Being processed by the boys

In their tatterdemalion uniforms
They look so nice
Tattoos of their children
So cool, so nice
This time will be gentle enough
Gentle enough
This time will be gentle enough
Gentle enough
Next time will be different
Different
Next time will be different
So cool, so nice
They'll be gentle enough
Gentle enough
They'll be gentle enough
Gentle enough1Embed
