June 21 LyricsSpotlight sweeping an empty stage
For a prima ballerina that has passed away
Sirens dopple after semi-automatic report
Chargers whine through the valley concrete
Reminds me of the squeal of stolen Sprees
Across the fields of my memories
Summer in the city
Bring me low
Lonely backyard dog sings out to the moon
Beyond the garage, a yellow Zephyr on blocks
Windows rust shut, the fan is not enough
Feel the heat and sorrow descend into my heart
Summer in the city
Bring me low
Wait up with me tonight if you want
Till the moment is gone
Don't go to the BP after dark
Don't be caught dead at the Short Stop
Green lights are flashing, no love for the outer ring
All the cops are working traffic for the stadiums downtown
Summer in the city
Bring me low
Wait up with me tonight if you want
Until the feeling is gone
Mass for the shut-ins, the dread of sleep
It's on ice, but it won't keep
Summer in the city
Bring me low
Bring me low
Bring me lowEmbed
