Body Language Lyrics
Give me, body
Give me, body (Body)
Give me your body

Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk, don't talk)
Baby, don't talk

Body language
Body language
Body language

Give me your body
Just give me, yeah, your body
Give me, yeah, your body

Don't talk

Body language
Body language
Body language
You got red lips
Snakes in your eyes
Long legs
Great thighs
You've got the cutest ass I've ever seen
Knock me down for a six anytime
Mmm, ha
Look at me, I got a case of body language
Look at me, I got a case of body language
Look at me, I got a case of body language
Look at me, I got a case of body language
Of body language
Of body language
Yeah

Sexy body
Sexy, sexy body
I want your body

Baby, you're hot

Body language
Body language
Body language
Body language
Body language
Body language
Body language
