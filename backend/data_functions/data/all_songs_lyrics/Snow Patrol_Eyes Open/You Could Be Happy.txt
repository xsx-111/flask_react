You Could Be Happy Lyrics

You could be happy and I won't know
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
And all of the things that I wish I had not said
Are played in loops 'til it's madness in my head
Is it too late to remind you how we were?
Not our last days of silent screamin' blur
Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walkin' out the door

You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far
Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
Do the things that you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
More than anything I want to see you, girl
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
