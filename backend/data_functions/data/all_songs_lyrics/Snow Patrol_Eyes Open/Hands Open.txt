Hands Open Lyrics

It's hard to argue when
You won't stop makin' sense
But my tongue still misbehaves
And it keeps diggin' my own grave

With my hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hopin'
That your heart opens

Why would I sabotage
The best thing that I have?
Well, it makes it easier to know
Exactly what I want

With my hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hopin'
That your heart opens
It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy
It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy

Put Sufjan Stevens on
And we'll play your favourite song
"Chicago" bursts to life
And your sweet smile remembers you

My hands open
And my eyes open
I just keep hopin'
That your heart opens

It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy
It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
Collapse into me, tired with joy
It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right (With my hands open)
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right (With my hands open)
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
(With my hands open)
Collapse into me, tired with joy (With my hands open)
It's not as easy as willin' it all to be right (With my hands open)
Gotta be more than hopin' it's right (With my hands open)
I wanna hear you laugh like you really mean it
(With my hands open)
Collapse into me, tired with joy (With my hands open)Embed
