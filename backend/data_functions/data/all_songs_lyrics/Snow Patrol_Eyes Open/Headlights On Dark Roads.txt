Headlights On Dark Roads Lyrics

For once I wanna be the car crash
Not always just the traffic jam
Hit me hard enough to wake me
And lead me wild to your dark roads
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear

My tongue is lost so I can't tell you
Please just see it in my eyes
I pull up thorns from our ripped bodies
And let the blood fall in my mouth
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear
Headlights before me
So beautiful, so clear
Reach out and take it
'Cause I'm so tired of all this fear
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Headlights (Ooh, ooh)
Headlights (Ooh, ooh)Embed
