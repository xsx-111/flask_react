The Finish Line Lyrics

The Earth is warm next to my ear
Insect noise is all that I hear
A magic trick makes the world disappear
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear

A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
The snowin' ticker-tape blurs all my senses numb
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radio seems close enough to touch

Coldwater, cleaning my wounds
A sad parade, with a single balloon
I'm done with this, I'm countin' to ten
Bluest seas, runnin' to them

I feel like I am watchin' everything from space
And in a minute I'll hear my name and I'll wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want
