Carry Me Home LyricsI can't help just falling down
My eyes rolling in the ground
It's all too much, I'm losing touch
Time that I was not around
Won't you just carry me home
Won't you just carry me home
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
I can't help just falling down
My head spinning round and round
It's all too much, I'm losing touch
Time that I was not around
Won't you just carry me home
Won't you just carry me home
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
Won't you just carry me home
Won't you just carry me homeEmbed
