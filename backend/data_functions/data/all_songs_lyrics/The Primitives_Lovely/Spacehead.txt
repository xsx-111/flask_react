Spacehead LyricsWho's that boy with the vacant stare
Walking round like he just don't care
Looks so cool in his purple socks
Saw him sitting on a pillar box
Singing sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
When he walks on by
He looks at the sky
What is that boy on
He's a strange person
Lives all alone ina beat up car
Don't have to drive so he don't go far
Guess his head must be some place else
Cause he's always talking to himself
Singing sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
When he walks on by
He looks at the sky
What is that boy on
He's a strange person
Who's that boy with the turquoise hair
Walking round like he's still in bed
Guess his head must be some place else
Cause he's always talking to himself
Singing sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la laEmbed
