Ocean Blue LyricsWhat's the rush, just take it slow
Ease your mind, let your heart flow
Don't think twice I'm here for you
Swim with me in ocean blue
Like children do
Ain't life a game
Worry not of what will be
Take my hand come close to me
Easy dreams down lazy streets
Turn towards a world so sweet
Like children do
Ain't life a game
In ocean blue
Like children do
I'm ready nowEmbed
