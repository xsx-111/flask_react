Stop Killing Me LyricsYesterday I was smiling
Everything seemed alright
But today sun's not shining
Seen you in a different light
I don't want you now
How can I love you now
Just keep away from me
'cause you're killing me
Stop killing me
All the things I never asked for
All the things I thought were mine
Thought that I could see forever
Thought that things would work out fine
Repeat chorusEmbed
