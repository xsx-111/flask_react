Dreamwalk Baby LyricsGuardian angel, broken halo
Dreamwalk baby where will you go today
You gave it away
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to me
You don't have to crawl
If you don't want to
Tight rope walker, feeling dizzy
Dreamwalk baby you're so easy today
You gave it away
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to me
You don't have to crawl
If you don't want toEmbed
