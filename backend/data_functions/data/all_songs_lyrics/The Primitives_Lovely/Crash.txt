Crash LyricsHere you go, way too fast
Don't slow down, you're gonna crash
You should watch, watch your step
Don't look out, gonna break your neck
So shut, shut your mouth
Cause I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you
Enough to last a lifetime through
So what do you want of me
Got no words of sympathy
And if I go around with you
You know that I get messed up, too
With you
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Here you go, way too fast
Don't slow down, you're gonna crash
You don't know what's been going down
You've been running all over town
So shut, shut your mouth
Cause I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you
Enough to last a lifetime through
So what do you want of me
Got no cure for misery
And if I go around with you
You know that I get messed up, too
With you
With you
With you
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)
Na na na na na na na na na
(Slow down, you're gonna crash)Embed
