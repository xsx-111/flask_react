Nothing Left LyricsCrawling round my room on a wasted afternoon
Passing time away with dreams, it's so cozy and serene
I'd like to scream
Here's a door, step outside
Oh I could walk around till dark
Count the flowers in the park
Waste the hours until dark
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
The sun comes up then it slips away
Oh I could walk around till dark
Count the flowers in the park
Waste the hours until dark
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
The sun comes up then it slips away
Crawling round my room on a wasted afternoon
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
The sun comes up then it slips away
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
I've got nothing left to say
The sun comes up for another dayEmbed
