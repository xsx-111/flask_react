Out of Reach LyricsI just had the strangest dream
Walking barefoot on the beach
Sun filled valley and grass so green
Sky and sea were out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reach
Someone said we were all dead
Life's worth nothing at all
That's not true
I'm here with you
And i've been here before
Then i found a four leaf clover
In a field where I lay
Fear of dying passed right over
Hope they get it right someday
I want to stay, I want to say
I want to stay, I want to say
Out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reach
I just has the strangest dream
No more thunder only peace
Sun filled valley and grass so green
Sky and sea were out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reach
Out of reachEmbed
