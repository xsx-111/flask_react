Thru the Flowers LyricsFeel the sun burning bright
I'm cut loose out of sight
Slipping thru shadows
You won't find me
Found myself all at sea
And you won't find me - no, no
And you won't find me - no, no
And you won't even know
What it took to let you go
If I could only make you see
Then you could follow me
Thru the flowers
Thru the flowers
Feel the sun burning bright
I' cut loose out of sight
Singing in the daises
You won't find me
Found myself lost at sea
And you won't see me - no, no
And you won't see me - no, no
