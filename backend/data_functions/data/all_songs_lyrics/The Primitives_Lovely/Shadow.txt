Shadow LyricsHold the shadow, breathe the shadow
Hold the shadow, breathe the shadow
Something crawls into your open head
Of all the thing she said
Of all the things she said
Of all the things she said
Of all the things she
Listen to the voice of everything
Snatch your soul away, steal your heart away
Snatch your soul away, steal your heart away
How many stars can you count
When your lights go out
When your lights go out
When your lights go out
When your lights go
Hold the shadow, breathe the shadow
Hold the shadow, breathe the shadow
Something crawls into your open head
Of all the things she said
Of all the things she said
Of all the things she said
Of all the things she saidEmbed
