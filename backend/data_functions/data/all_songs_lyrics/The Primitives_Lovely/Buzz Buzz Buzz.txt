Buzz Buzz Buzz LyricsI was waiting for the sky to rain
Thinking everything would be the same
Then I saw you, sky turned blue
I don't know what happened next
But the whole world felt brand new
And thing are just beginning to make sense
Ever since we fell down from that fence
Down on the street, that's where we meet
Y'send a running shiver from my head down to my feet
Church bells ringing
Blue birds sing
A noise in my ears going
Ring ring ring about you
What can I do
I got that buzz
I got that buzz
A noise in my head going
Buzz buzz buzz about you
What can I do
Buzz about youEmbed
