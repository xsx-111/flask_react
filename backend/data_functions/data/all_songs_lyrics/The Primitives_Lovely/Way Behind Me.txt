Way Behind Me LyricsI don't remember what you said
I'm gonna leave the past behind me
All those lies inside your head
Took my hand and lead me blindly
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I want to go
I want leave
I want to grow
I want to breathe
I didn't want to be a fool
Took my hand and so unkindly
Cut me down with words so cruel
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I don't remember what you said
I'm gonna leave the past behind me
All those lies inside your head
Took my hand and lead me blindly
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I want to go
I want to leave
I want to grow
I want to breathe
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
I'm gonna try my best move
I'm gonna leave you way behind me
Way behind me
Way behind me
Way behind meEmbed
