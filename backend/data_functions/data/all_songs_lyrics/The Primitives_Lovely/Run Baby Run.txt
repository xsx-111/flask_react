Run Baby Run LyricsTime to move along
Everything's gone wrong
Better catch that bus
Put all that wicked lying behind you
And all those nights of crying behind you
A million wasted tears far behind you
Run baby run
It's all been said and done
Run baby run
Into the setting sun
Said that it's okay
That everything's okay
But you're too blind too seeEmbed
