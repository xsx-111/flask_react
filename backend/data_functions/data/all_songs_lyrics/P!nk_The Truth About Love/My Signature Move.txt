My Signature Move Lyrics
I've got a way of making everything a confrontation
And you've got a way of bringing out the worst in me
You see, it's just if I'm bored
I'll find a way to make an accusation
I've got a problem with more
So give me, give me everything

STOP!

Not my fault, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line, take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me I'll make a lie out of truth, it's true
And then I'll break it up, make it bleed
Tell you that it's you not me
Make a scene, at a show just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I can't prove
To get it back to you
That's just my signature move

You call me crazy (Cray) and I think it's mean
I just don't like it (Like it, like it)
I'm just a sensitive baby (Babe), and you need to please me right (Better please me, better please me right)
You know I said I would change (Change)
I did, I went and tried a different outfit
(Did it, didn't fit, feel you knowing it)
And if that's not enough (No) you won't be riding dirty tonight
STOP!

Not my fault, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line, take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me I'll make a lie out of truth, it's true
And then I'll break it up, make it bleed
Tell you that it's you not me
Make a scene, at a show just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I can't prove
To get it back to you
That's just my signature move
(That's just my signature move)
(That's just my signature move)
(That's just my signature move)

I start fights in my dreams
I kick, I kick off the sheets
I don't apologize
You wouldn't see it in my eyes
I'm not a good best friend
If there's a rule I will bend
That makes it trouble for you
It's all I know how to do
I'm not responsible STOP!
Ha-ha yup!
Not my fault, not at all
I can't help you what you want
Get in line, take a number
Get you when my song is over
If you leave it up to me I'll make a lie out of truth, it's true
And then I'll break it up, make it bleed
Tell you that it's you not me
Make a scene, at a show just because the wind blows
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I can't prove
To get it back to you
That's just my signature moveEmbed
