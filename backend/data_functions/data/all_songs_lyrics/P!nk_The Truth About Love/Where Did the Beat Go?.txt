Where Did the Beat Go? Lyrics
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ba da ba bum
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ba da ba bum
Ba da ba bum
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I can hear planes
Flying over my head
Just hours before
You occupied my bed
In our darkness
We conjured up sunlight
In our haste, our need, our thirst
We lost our sight
But I was inspired
Tracing the lines on your face
To the poetry the first time
I heard your name
When I trip from your lips
My heart was like a kick-drum
And it silenced the guilt
I wasn't raised to hurt anyone
Uh oh, does he know
That I'm lying in the afterglow?
That I'm lying but I can't go, can't say no?
Make him think he's crazy
While his paranoia grows
What he should be asking
Is "where did our love go?"
Then I wouldn't be basking
In another man's afterglow
Where did the beat go?
(In another man's afterglow)
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?

So how do I justify
To the judge and the jury
The voices in my head
That caused this fury
Never had to play
With matches to start a fire
But it got so cold
And I thought I'd forgotten desire
I was your concubine
And your Madonna
You couldn't see anything
Behind your baby's mama
How long is lonely supposed to last?
I was naked and waiting
For you to come back
Mm
Uh oh, does he know
That I'm lying in the afterglow?
That I'm lying but I can't go, can't say no?
Make him think he's crazy
While his paranoia grows
What he should be asking
Is "where did our love go?"
Then I wouldn't be basking
In another man's afterglow
Where did the beat go?
(In another man's afterglow)
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
There's a cause and effect
Although I took the steps
I dove off the bridge
'Cause I had nothing left
All I ever wanted was you
And in the absence of you
I fell through

Uh oh, does he know
That I'm lying in the afterglow?
That I'm lying but I can't go, can't say no?
Make him think he's crazy
While his paranoia grows
What he should be asking
Is "where did our love go?"
Then I wouldn't be basking
In another man's afterglow
Where did the beat go?
(In another man's afterglow)
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?
(In another man's afterglow)
Where is the beat?
Where did the beat go?
(Where did the love go?)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Where did the beat go?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Where did the love go?Embed
