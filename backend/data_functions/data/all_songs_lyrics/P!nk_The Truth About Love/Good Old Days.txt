Good Old Days Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five years go by
I don't really know why, I don't really know why
Six, eight, nine, eleven years go by
I don't really know why, I don't really know why
I still feel the same way I did when I was seventeen
I still look over my shoulder, waitin' for the world to change

But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I think I'd like to stay
Oh, I'd like to stay
Oh, I'd like to stay

One, two, three, four, five years ago
I didn't see a belly with a child on the inside
Six, seven, eight, ten years ago, I thought I knew about love
I only knew about the fight
I look back and I realize all those times I was lonely
Praying for someday to hurry up and come and save me

But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay
I wish that I could stay
I wish that I could stay
These are the good old days
They're to stay
These are the good old days
And the more that you let go
The faster the time goes
The darker the night is
The lighter the moon glows
But these are the good old days
These are the good old days

One, two, three, four, five years from now
I hope I'm still gettin' down
I hope I'm still around
But six, seven, eight, ten beers ago
I had a revelation
All's well right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now

But these are the good old days (Good old days)
These are the good old days (These are the good old days)
These are the good old days (Good old days)
And I wish that I could stay
These are the good old days (Good old days)
These are the good old days (These are the good old days)
These are the good old days (Good old days)
I wish that I could stay
These are the good old days (Good old days)
These are the good old days (These are the good old days)
These are the good old days (Good old days)
And I wish that I could stay
I wish that I could stay
And I wish that I could stay
These are the good old days (And I wish that I could stay)
These are the good old days (These are the good old days)
These are the good old days (These are the good old days, yeah)
These are the good old days (These are the good old days, yeah)
These are the good old daysEmbed
