Find a Way to My Heart Lyrics
Find a way to my heart, and I will always be with you
From wherever you are, I'll be waiting
I'll keep a place in my heart, you will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow you

This journey's not easy for you, I know
If your footsteps get too faint to hear, I'll go
Cos you know, questions are never that easy
And never the same
You have the answer believe me
If you have the faith

So find a way to my heart
And I will always be with you
From wherever you are
I'll be waiting
I will keep a place in my heart
You will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow you

Time may come, and time may go, I know
If you should call out for me, I'll go
But you know, there is a code to be broken
I wrap it around
Without a word being spoken
Without a sound
There's a reason I hide my heart
Out of sight out of mind
And when I find out just who you are
The door will be open for you to
Find a way to my heart
And I will be always with you
From wherever you are
I'll be waiting
I will keep a place in my heart
You will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow you
Oh, find a way to my heart
And I will be always with you
From wherever you are
I'll be waiting
I will keep a place in my heart
You will see it shining through
So find a way to my heart
And I will, I will follow youEmbed
