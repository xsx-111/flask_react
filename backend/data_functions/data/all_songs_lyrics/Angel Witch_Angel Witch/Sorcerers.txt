Sorcerers LyricsAs I walk alone I can feel you there
People said to me
That you've got long black hair
You are the sorceress
I've seen your castle
Oh take me there
And hold your wand up high
A star of spectrum
A rainbow sky
Dancing around your grave
I'm glad you're gone
Can your soul be saved
Go back to where you belong
You walk through the mountain side
Mysterious powers go passing by
A storm is coming near
A soft warm breeze blows through the trees
You're dead!Embed
