Free Man LyricsI've been locked away for all these years
Now I can see the light of day
Things have changed a lot since I was last out here
I guess that's the way things, way things go
Now I'm a freeman again
I don't give a damn what happens in there
Now I'm through, what a life
Because now I'm a freeman
As I look around I couldn't remember my old home
Now there's a tower block in its way
I remember all my friends and my wife
They don't want to know me anymore
They wouldn't listen, they didn't understand
They accused me of crime I didn't commit
It was some other guy, but it wasn't me
They wouldn't give in, they wouldn't believe me
But now I'm a freeman again
I couldn't give a damn what happens in there
Now I'm through, what a life
Because now I'm a freemanEmbed
