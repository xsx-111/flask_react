Confused LyricsStand looking for a friend
Someone I can rely on
All the people laugh at me
I hide in my room
They don´t understand me
Think that I have gone insane
These four walls are closing on me
Can´t they realize my pain
Confused, confused, confused
Can´t you see that I´m confused
The wild state of affairs gets worse and worse day by day
Everybody seems to be confused
Noone ever knows the way
But still life carries on
And you live a day and you just wait
You only get one chance, don´t let it just slip away
Confused, confused, confused
Can´t you see that I´m confusedEmbed
