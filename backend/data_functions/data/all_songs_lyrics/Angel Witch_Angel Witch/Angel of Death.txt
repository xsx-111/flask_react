Angel of Death LyricsAngel of death
A faceless evil spirit that haunts
Searching for the soul that he must take
Steed of white he rides through the realms of unknown
He is only a messenger from hell
(from hell)
Scanning the oceans searching for victims to taunt
Looking for those who dare rise him from the grave
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Riding along he cannot find those that he seeks
Yet he knows he is on the right trail
Breaking the circle, not knowing of the danger she's in
He takes her with him throuogh stygian to hell
To hell
Scanning the oceans searching for victims to taunt
Looking for those who dare rise him from the grave
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
Suddenly I awake, looking 'round to see where I am
Realise it's been just a crazy dream
I open the door to find that he is waiting there
The angel of death has come to take my soul
My soul
Scanning the oceans searching for victims to taunt
Looking for those who dare rise him from the grave
Angel of death
Angel of death
Angel of death
