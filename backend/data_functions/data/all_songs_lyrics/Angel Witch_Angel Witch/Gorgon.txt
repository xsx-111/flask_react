Gorgon LyricsCan you hear the voice
Of a thousand years ago
The laughter of the gorgon
A female that brings doom
Don't look her in the eyes
Or you'll turn to stone
Don't let her deceive you
If you sense her don't look 'round
Or you'll find that she will lead you
And you'll be buried in the ground
You may gaze at her reflection
In still waters of the lake
But don't look at her directly
Or death will be your fate
Beware of her at all times
Her serpents of hypnosis
More evil than the devil
Can kill you with her eyes
You have to get rid of her
The only way I know
Creep up behind with an axe
And decapitate with one blow
I can see you're all confused
And you feel you're being used
And now your heart is broken
So I watched as he set out
And without a doubt
He did as I advised him
You could hear the breaking of her bones
As the axe went through her neck
Didn't realise at the time
That he killed the one that he lovedEmbed
