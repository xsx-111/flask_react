Sweet Danger LyricsOn the fifth storey block you can´t seem to keep away from the edge
When you´re getting pushed off you´re thinking this is gonna be the end
You keep on falling, keep on falling till you awake
Sweet danger, sweet danger
Sweet danger, sweet danger
Trying to get away from, something drives you out whereever you go
The harder you try the more your legs don´t want to know
Please wake up, please wake up, you´ll have an attack
Sweet danger, sweet danger
Sweet danger, sweet danger
When you´re there nightly and you ought to know the end of the scene
You got to get up somehow, till you realise it´s only a dream
Please wake up, please wake up, it´s only a dream
Sweet danger, sweet danger
Sweet danger, sweet dangerEmbed
