Atlantis LyricsThere´ll be no tomorrow if the final curtain falls
As a volcano erupts everything crushes to the ground
No one can hope, unsafeness panic blocks their roads
And their paths
Apocalypse is happening and nobody stands a chance
It´s falling, it´s falling
The final bell is tolling
The world is at its end
To wait for Atlantis to rise
Atlantis to rise, Atlantis to rise
An empire underwater to rise up from its ocean grave
Through all this planet, witness kings who´ll
Overpower any god
And we can´t stop this power as it will invalid men´s
Creations
The perfect race, the perfect world to rise from the
Oceans depths
It´s falling, it´s falling
The final bell is tolling
The world is at its end
To wait for Atlantis to rise
Atlantis to rise, Atlantis to rise
There´ll be no tomorrow
If the land slices from the sea
As an earthquake begins
Nothing and no one will survive
Everything will be destroyed
Nothing will be left to the fire
As evolution begin to gain
Earth will turn to fire
It´s falling, it´s falling
The final bell is tolling
The world is at its end
To wait for Atlantis to rise, Atlantis to riseEmbed
