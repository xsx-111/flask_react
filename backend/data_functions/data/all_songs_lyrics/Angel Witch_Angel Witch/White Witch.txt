White Witch LyricsIn the middle of last night she went out to get her revenge
On the black witches they tried to kill her
They tried to sacrifice and burn her soul in flames
Some unknown force came and freed her
Burn the white witch
Burn the white witch
Death bears a sickly smile. Will the fools ever learn
They still smile when their own death is near
She has got more power than you will ever know
They tried to harm but it's too late
Burn the white witch
Burn the white witch
Standing by your shadow
Your eyes are full of tears
You cannot seem to unwind yourself
You have killed death and fear
Forever and ever we are free
Together forever for eternity
She died early this morning from the spells of the dead
Death had its own way and won
Now she can rest in peace and sleep inside her grave
She cannot be harmed anymore
Burn the white witch
Burn the white witch1Embed
