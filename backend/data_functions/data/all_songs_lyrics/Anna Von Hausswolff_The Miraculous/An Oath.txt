An Oath LyricsTouched the middle
Of his eye
Kiss him gently
Goodbye
I swear to the nature
And to his heart
That all will be there for him
And nothing is lost
Oh, touched the middle
Of his eye
Kiss him gently
Goodbye
I swear to the nature
And swear to his heart
The  is  and will still be there
And nothing, nothing, is lost1Embed
