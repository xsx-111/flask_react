Come Wander with Me / Deliverance LyricsCome wander with me
Come here
Come wander with me, love
Come wander with me
Away from this sad world
Come wander with me
He said "Come wander with me, love"
Come wander with me
Away from this sad world
Come wonder with me
He came from the sunset
He came from the sea
He came from this sad world
And can love only me
Walk with love
Walk with soul
Walk with dreams
Through the cold
But I will never be freeEmbed
