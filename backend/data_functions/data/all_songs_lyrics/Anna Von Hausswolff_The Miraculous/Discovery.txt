Discovery LyricsOh my...
I'm guided by something
I'm shocked, I'm stunned and I can't sing
A beauty, a spirit
A body for me to inherit
Oh Mother, I plead
The Earth, the Sun
The rats, the dust
The lost son
The sea, the sky
The stars, the night
I miss my sister, my flickering light
A hand that reaches out for me
I hear it somewhere but I can't see
We stumble upon a broken tree
I leave the past to set me free
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run to the Sun
Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun
Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, Sun, SunEmbed
