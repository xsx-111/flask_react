Stranger LyricsWe're walking in a curved line into something new
The birds are watching every step I take
Beneath the stars, beneath the moon there is a hole
It's covered up in darkness and fear
But then there is something moving against me
It's not in line with what I know
Changing the heart
Changing the spirit
Changing my path
Changing my soul
My sight is clear the colors are expanding
I don't drown in the mirror on the wall
There is no time, there is no face, there is no me
I'm following a shadow while I'm reaching for the sun
But then, you tell me I shouldn't worry
You tell me to stay strong
You tell me I shouldn't worry
Why is this stranger in sync with my heart?
I tip toe here I don't want you to see me
I'm listening
I'm stolen by every word you say
A dream is pulling out my heart and spirit
And I'm scared to fall, I'm scared of death
And I am scared of all the lies
But then you tell me I shouldn't worry
You tell me to stay strong
You tell me I shouldn't worry
We live now, let's live now, as we won't live for longEmbed
