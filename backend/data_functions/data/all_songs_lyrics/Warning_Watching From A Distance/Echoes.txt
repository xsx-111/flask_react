Echoes LyricsI think of mornings we might spend
If I came home to find you there
Both talking freely of ourselves
Or sleeping through the break of day
And so much honesty
That's why I'd never feel the pain
And in my weakest moments
I'd often look that way again
I think of evenings we might spend
If you stayed home to find me there
Reaching across our distance
With all the hurt that's in our lives
And if it came to be
I would not understand the pain
And in my darkest moments
I want to feel that way again
And I know that I'm wrong
I know that I'm wrong
But casting shadows, there's a light that shines on
But when I look into your eyes I know I'll find it there
So I don't understand the pain I thought was never there
And when I see you smile, I know there's something stronger yet
Than any dream I ever placed at someone's feetEmbed
