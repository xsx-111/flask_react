Footprints LyricsI am not feeling the green burning flame
As I gaze back along footprints you have made
I am not dreaming of more than you have shown
You are not a foundation
You are not a stone
But I'm afraid of the way that I'm feeling;
Afraid of this new understanding now;
Afraid for the beauty within me
And that which I hold within my hand
And this is the ultimate secret
That many before me have ever known
So capture me while I am weakest
I want to know
I want to know
Here I am wide open, surrendering to your side
I have laid down my armour
I have no sword at my side
I leave behind me the ruins of the fortress I swore to defend;
I leave behind me foundations
I'll leave you a man I'll need you to mend
And through all the battles around me
I never believed I would fight
Yet here I stand, a broken soldier
Shivering and naked in your winter lightEmbed
