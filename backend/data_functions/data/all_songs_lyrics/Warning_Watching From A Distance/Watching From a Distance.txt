Watching From a Distance LyricsSometimes when I watch you
You seem like the same person that I once knew
And watched from a distance
But never able to do more than I ever would
Looking at you, I find again
I am starving in your mystery
So far away, and some kind of helplessness
And then I remember that I know you love me, I know you do
Sometimes when I listen to your fearless voice
It's the voice I once heard
I want to know you and understand you
More than I think I do
To keep the wonder, the moment you seem
Like a stranger to my heart and me
And all at once in an instant
I see you perfected again
Though you've never changed
Please remember when you ever think of meEmbed
