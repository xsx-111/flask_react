Bridges LyricsIn the darkness I unravel
New truths I have suffered
For so long to embrace
They will change me from here on
But I can't share it with anyone
I wish you were with me tonight
When I am not alone I sever silent moments
Building bridges with meaningless words
And only feel the distance further
Remember being happy in our silence?
I wish that you were with me tonight
I don't need a reason, there's nothing to explain
I can't reproach your leaving to justify my pain
But can I really understand?
I wish you were with me tonight
I read over all you wrote me
The words mean so much more these days
They echo in my soul
They sting me like a burn
Can someone feel too much?
I wish you were here with me tonight1Embed
