Faces LyricsI want to be master of my own emotions with a fire that fills me
But I don't understand myself and I don't know
I don't know what my heart is anymore
I don't want to be standing in this war
Through pity and responsibility
So come into my life, with your violence and pain
Because I feel the depths of a love I've never known
Take a hold of my life
Make it into one that I want it to be
Make a whole of my life
Make my faces one that I want you to see
I can't stand to see confusion in your eyes
When I drift away sometimes
Could I ever be more faithless in my life?
For all the hope that I've found in these days
It's always frightened me how some things lose their meaning
How some things change direction with a breeze
Don't ask me where I am, I am trying to come home
But I can't keep myself from drifting

Take a hold of my life
Make it into one that I want it to be
Make a whole of my life
Make my faces one that I want you to see
Sometimes it makes me feel
Feelings which I never hoped to find
Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm living out of time
Sometimes it makes me feel
Feelings which I never hoped to find
Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm living out of timeEmbed
