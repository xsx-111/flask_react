Beneath Lyrics
It's time to go into the me below
My morbid self beneath
A peril trip the last way out
I spin as I let go
In spirals down the narrow lines
Passing through my aura
Spit me out into my mind
A journey through disease

I'm behind my cynic eyes
That stare but cannot see
The sickness in me
Beneath

I fall in untruthful me
The essence of my thoughts
Swirling in a thousand vows
Endless, truthless

What am I this me beneath
A vain organic lie
That rules me from inside
Immobile now I bow
Before reality itself
It's substance moving through my eyes
My life is transferred once
Suffused upon my mind
The view erases
Burns inside and then
Another fall

I plunge into a well of lies
A cold perennial flow
The vortex of my soulEmbed
