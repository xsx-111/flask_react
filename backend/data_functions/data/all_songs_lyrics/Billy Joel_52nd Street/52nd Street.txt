52nd Street Lyrics
They say it takes a lot to keep a love alive
In every heart, there pumps a different beat
But if we shift the rhythm into overdrive
Well, we could generate a lot of heat
On 52nd Street
On 52nd Street

We're gonna have a little show parade
Before they know the second bar was played
We're gonna slip it to 'em short and sweet
On 52nd StreetEmbed
