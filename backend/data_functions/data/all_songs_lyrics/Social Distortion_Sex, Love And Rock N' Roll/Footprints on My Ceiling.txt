Footprints on My Ceiling Lyrics
Everybody wants a lover
Nobody wants to uncover
What may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past
Wanna go without a care
Pull Gardenias from her hair
I think of a time we didn't have a care in the world
Captivated by her beauty I knew it was my life long duty
She had all the grace and charm of a radiant queen

How do you talk without speaking? yeah!
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling? yeah!
How do you take without giving?
And keep it all inside?

There are footprints on my ceiling
I can't help this fucked up feeling
Something's wrong, you ain't coming 'round here no more
Try to get my thoughts together
I think of a time when things were better
This miscommunication is breaking me down

How do you talk without speaking? yeah!
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling? yeah!
How do you take without giving?
How you treat your new best friend?
Everybody wants a lover
Nobody wants to uncover
What may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past
My heart is heavy slowly sinking
I redirect my desperate thinking
And kiss her red full lips like I did the very first time

How do you talk without speaking? yeah!
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling? yeah!
How do you take without giving?
There are footprints on my ceiling, yeah!
And I kept it bottled up inside... all my lifeEmbed
