Faithless LyricsI know a girl who warns of the dangers of love
All the pain and the anguish, the sorrow that it brings
She keeps herself in a world that's protected
Her outsides are tough
But inside her heart longs to sing
Chorus:
Don't let your walls down
You might fall in love, you might fall in love
He's gonna get his girlfriend's name tattooed on his neck
And hope he never, never lives to regret
He's gonna walk down that long dark alley
And what he finds there you know he'll never forget
Chorus:
Don't let your walls down
You might fall in love, you might fall in love
They're crashing down now, you might fall in love
I remember a time I believed
That the words love and pain were both one in the same
I'm gonna trade in my old ways for a new shot at life
I'm gonna change, change my direction
I'm gonna change my ways
Chorus:
Don't let your walls down
You might fall in love, you might fall in love
They're crashing down now
It's you I'm thinking of, it's you I'm thinking of
You might fall in love; it's you I'm thinking of
We might fall in love
Let's fall in loveEmbed
