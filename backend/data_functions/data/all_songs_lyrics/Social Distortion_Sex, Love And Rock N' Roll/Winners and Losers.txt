Winners and Losers LyricsWinners and losers, turn the pages of my life
We're beggars and choosers, with all the struggles and the strife
I got no reason to turn my head and look the other way
We're good and we're evil, which one will I be today?
There's saints and sinners
Life's a gamble and you might lose
There's cowards and heroes
Both have been known now to break the rules
There's lovers and haters
The strong and the weak will all have their day
We're devils and angels
Which one will I be today?
Chorus:
Are you happy now with all the choices you've made?
Are there times in life when you know you should've stayed?
Will you compromise and then realize the price is too much to pay?
Winners and losers, which one will you be today?
There's a light and a dark side
Standing at the crossroads, there we'll meet
There's prophets and fools there
The lies and the truths, will be at our feet
I got a reason to turn my head and look the other way
Its heaven and hell here, which one will I live today?
Chorus:
Are you happy now with all the choices you've made?
Are there times in life when you know you should've stayed?
Did you compromise and then realize the price is too much to pay?
Winners and losers, which one will you be today?
Which one will you be today?
Which one will I be today?Embed
