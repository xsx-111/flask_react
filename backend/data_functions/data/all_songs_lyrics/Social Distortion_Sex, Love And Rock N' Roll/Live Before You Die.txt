Live Before You Die LyricsWhen pressures up and the stress is high
And I wanna bid this world good bye
I'm gonna bury my frustrations
Grab some of life's satisfactions
Yeah I'm gonna live before I die
I try to find some peace of mind
When my life's treating me unkind yeah
Pain will be my motivation
I'm gonna use my imagination
Yeah I'm gonna live before I die
Chorus:
So close your eyes and embrace your memories, your memories
Leave your troubles and your worries far behind, so far behind
Stop contemplating and start celebrating
Yeah you gotta live before you die
I think of chances I didn't take
I try to learn from my mistakes, yeah
I'm tired of being pushed around now
Life ain't gonna drag me down now
Yeah, I'm gonna live before I die
Chorus:
So close your eyes and embrace your memories, your memories
Leave your troubles and your worries far behind, so far behind
Stop contemplating and start celebrating
Yeah you gotta live before you die
Before you die, before you dieEmbed
