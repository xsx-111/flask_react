Intimate Lyrics
Collecting hearts
Another love is another place to stay
Another face
We close our eyes
And feel our way
A new fit
You're positive
But they don't need to know
Another boy, another girl
Another place to go

Collecting hearts
Another love is another place to stay
Another face
We close our eyes
And feel our way
A new fit
You're positive
But they don't need to know
Another boy, another girl
Another place to go

It feels like sleep
It feels like being born
Return to soil
Return to frailer form
Collecting hearts
Another love is another place to stay
Another face
We close our eyes
And feel our way
A new fit
You're positive
But they don't need to know
Another boy, another girl
Another place to go

It feels like sleep
It feels like being born
Return to soil
Return to frailer form
It feels like sleep
It feels like being born
Return to soil
Return to frailer form2Embed
