Birds Lyrics
Layers of lace
Held in place
Diagnosed
You're a ghost

Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb

Pull out their eyes
Apologize
Emerald waves
To lubricate

Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb
Show up, throw up into the womb1Embed
