Baptism Lyrics
Hold my head under water
Take a breath for the Father
Learn to love, lessons repeating
The Chronicles are so misleading

This is your baptism
And you can't forgive 'em
This is your baptism
And you can't forgive 'em

Hold my head under water
Take a breath for the Father
Learn to love, lessons repeating
The Chronicles are so misleading

This is your baptism
And you can't forgive 'em
This is your baptism
And you can't forgive 'em

And you can't
This is your baptism
And you can't forgive 'em
This is your baptism
And you can't

Hold my head under water
Take a breath for the Father
Learn to love, lessons repeating
The Chronicles are so misleading14Embed
