Fainting Spells Lyrics
I'll make you forget
With the taste of lambskin
The bounty is yours
It tastes like medicine

We evaporate
Without condensation
But heaven is still
Your only expectation

I'll make you forget
With the taste of lambskin
The bounty is yours
It tastes like medicine

We evaporate
Without condensation
But heaven is still
Your only expectation4Embed
