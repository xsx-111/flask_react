How Do You Feel Lyrics
Look into her eyes
Do you see what I mean?
Just look at her hair
And when she speaks, oh what a pleasant surprise

How do you feel?
Just look at her smile
Do you see what I mean?
She is looking our way
Oh how I wish we could stay, just stay for a while
How do you feel?

When I meet a girl like that
I don't know what to say
But to greet a girl like that
Brightens up my day
My day, oh
How do you feel?

Just look at her walk
Do you see what I mean?
She is coming our way
Oh, how my heart beats, I don't even think I could talk
How do you feel?
When I meet a girl like that
I don't know what to say
But to greet a girl like that
Brightens up my day
My day, oh
How do you feel?

How do you feel?
(Do you know how you feel?)
Just look at her smile
(Tell me how do you feel?)
Look into her eyes
(Tell me how do you feel?)
She is coming our way
(Tell me how do you feel?)
Look into her eyes
(Tell me how do you feel?)
She is coming our way
(Tell me how do you feel?)Embed
