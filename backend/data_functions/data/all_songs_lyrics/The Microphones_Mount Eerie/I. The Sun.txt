I. The Sun Lyrics


See me wave my handkerchief on the shore
See my arm raised high

See that ship sail off with its sails aloft
And see me dry my eyes
And see more salty tears flow
As my house is blown wide
And see me watch the waves roll in from (somewhere)
See me squint my eyes
See me learn to live without my loved ones
See me scan the skies
And see the flock of birds' goodbye
And turn to go inside

But I feel you
On my neck:
You are a ball of fire!
See me reach up
See me touch my neck
And see my fingers recoil
See the life come back into my body
See me living wide and
See me look from side to side
And tiptoe in your light
See me look at you
And lose my sight
And while my eyes burned I saw it
Oh, no!

H-here comes a black ship
Rising under red sail
See it fill the sky!
See it billow up!
See their gleaming eyes
And hear their scary trumpets!
Ohhhh, ummm
See me run in terror for the mountain
See me scramble high and
See me burned and blind
And all hopeless and barren
See me sprawled out
See me crawl and whine
See me search for signs
And I see you
Weird and high:
You are a ball, a ball of fire
You are a ball of fire!
You are a ball of fire!
You are a ball of fire!Embed
