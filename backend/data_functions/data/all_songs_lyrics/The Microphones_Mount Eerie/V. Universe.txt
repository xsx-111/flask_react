V. Universe Lyrics
Now that I have disappeared I have my sight
Beautiful Black, you are unveiled
Now you're mine
So let my voice bellow about you Silent Night
Let my voice echo out from caves and mines

Oh, you have a bright disguise: Mountains and Lights
But, Universe, I see your face in blackest night
And you see mine
Oh, Universe, I see your face looks just like mine!
We are open wide!1Embed
