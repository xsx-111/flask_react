IV. Mount Eerie Lyrics
"Your legs walked your heart high
Your whole body, sprawling out, made your view wide"

I'm on a boulder over alpine tops I'm peeking
I watched you across the water in the evening
"I watched you from above"
Into my eye your grays and blues were blown
"To your eyes I'm blown"
The (something) that I held onto is leaving
The shape to what I saw has slowly grown

You're higher on your hill
So your Big Black Cloud will come
So your Big Black Cloud will come
And press you to the ground
The air will leave your chest
You'll fade from where you're found
When you find you're standing still
And your fingers all go numb
Get higher on your hill
So your Big Black Cloud will come
So your Big Black Cloud will come
And press you to the ground
The air will leave your chest
You'll fade from where you're found
When you're finally standing still
And your fingers all go numb
Get higher on your hill
So your Big Black Cloud will come
So your Big Black Cloud will come
Rah! Do you see what happens?
Do you see what happens?!
When the Big Black Death
Breathes on you with his breath
I'm wild and woolly
A bloating bully
I'll strike you down and then
I'll strike you down again
Do you see what happens? (What?)
Do you see what happens? (What?!)
When I peel away your bark
And stain your blue sky dark

Your breath I take to live
Your Death I ache to give
So take me in and crumble
Be smothered in my rumble!
My flash of thunder booms
Your lack of wonder looms
I press you to the ground
You'll fade from where you're found

The way they share (The flesh we tear)
They feast (So, innocent of memory, we feast)
They invite each bite (We invite each bite)
Into flight (Into our flight)
Since blood, now wind (We give our blood to you)
And feathers from skin begin (And feathers from skin begin)
I am the twilight upon the porch
A leaf falls into your lap
I am the candle falling
Your hands gripping the tablecloth
Your eyes only three years old
The way they share
The memory you did wear
And now your song
Is inside them1Embed
