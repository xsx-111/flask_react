II. Solar System Lyrics
Oh, a ball...
I am a ball...
A ball of fire...

Oh no! I am lacking
I want what I see
You, Fireball, have rolled away
And shaded valleys
So here I am in the creekbed
So here I feel my way, in the dark
What wonder? What treasure map?
What breaking of day?
What stream used to flow here?
And now what dusty decay!

Let the flash flood begin!
Wash me down the canyon!
Quicksand pull me in!
Blow over me, Solar Wind

You're vultures in trees
I know you're out there
You're lanterns on lakes
I know you're out there
You're soccer balls on knees
Through your skirt I see
Your legs gracefully
I know you're out there
You're swaying and pleased
I know you're out there
You're vultures in trees
I know you're out there
In mountainous peaks
Don't let gravity win
Blow on me, Solar Wind1Embed
