III. Universe Lyrics
See me look unveiled when I walk out of the canyon, and
See me start to climb at the end of day
But who's there to see me walk out?
There's no beacon; no sun to block out
No bird of blaze
A Close Dark Voice says:

"Do you really think there's anybody out there?"
Uh huh... Huh uh...

So what? No one sees me
What do I care now that the Black Night has seized me?
On a mountain's mane I climb to my claim
And I am aimless, alone, and unraveling
And above Barren Wastelands stare at me
They know my name

"What do you want?"
(note progression)

And I know I'll be in the air
And that my trail passes lions' lairs
And I see summits buried in more air
Buried in space
"See Phil? There's no end in sight!"
How many times have I learned this before?
How many times have I made up this song before?
How many times have I died up here before?
And oh how hidden tomorrow morning is!
What heavy fog!
What wide shadow!

"Universe, I know you"1Embed
