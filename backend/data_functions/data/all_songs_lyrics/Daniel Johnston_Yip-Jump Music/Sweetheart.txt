Sweetheart LyricsYou have a sweet heart, sweetheart
You have a nice smile, baby
You drove me crazy down lover’s lane
It’s close to pain, this love I have for you
I cannot tame my desire for you
And when we start to bed, don’t forget I love you
Oh my love, take my hand we’re walking
The moon and stars are singing in the sky
And everyone I know must be jealous
Cause they don’t have such a love as I
You are my sweetheart, sweetheart
You are my baby, baby
You drove me crazy down lover’s lane
I can’t explain this love I have for you
I cannot tame my desire for you
And when we start to bed don’t forget I love you
And when we start to bed don’t forget I love youEmbed
