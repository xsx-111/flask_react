Speeding Motorcycle LyricsSpeeding motorcycle, won't you change me?
Speeding motorcycle, won't you change me?
In a world of funny changes
Speeding motorcycle, won't you change me?
Speeding motorcycle of my heart
Speeding motorcycle; always changing me
Speeding motorcycle, don't you drive recklessly
Speeding motorcycle of my heart
Pretty girls have taken you for a ride
Hurt you deep inside but you never slowed down
Speeding motorcycle in my heart
Speeding motorcycle, let's speed smart
Cause we don't want to wreck but
We can do a lot of tricks
We don't have to break our necks
To get our kicks
Speeding motorcycle, the road is ours
Speeding motorcycle, let's speed some more
Cause we don't need reason and we don't need logic
We've got feeling and we're dang proud of it
Speeding motorcycle, there's nothing you can't do
Speeding motorcycle, I love you
Speeding motorcycle, let's just go
Speeding motorcycle
Let's go let's go let's go
