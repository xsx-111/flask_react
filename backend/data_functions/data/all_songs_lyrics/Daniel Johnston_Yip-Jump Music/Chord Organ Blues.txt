Chord Organ Blues LyricsEverything's big in Texas, you know it is
I think I might've made a big mistake, oh, oh, oh
Chord organ blues
Chord organ blues
Singin' those chord organ blues
Wherever I go, it's a wild wind
Maybe someday it'll blow me back home again
Chord organ blues
Chord organ blues
Singin' those chord organ blues
For every chord that is played
There is a reward in my heart that is jade
Because my soul loves music
And it loves to hear it made
Singin' those chord organ blues
Everything's big in Texas, you know it is
I think I might've made a big mistake, oh, oh, oh
Chord organ blues
Chord organ blues
Singin' those chord organ blues1Embed
