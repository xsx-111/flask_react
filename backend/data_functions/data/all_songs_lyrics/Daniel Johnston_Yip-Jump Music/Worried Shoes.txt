Worried Shoes LyricsI took my lucky break and I broke it in two
Put on my worried shoes
My worried shoes
And my shoes took me so many miles and they never wore out
My worried shoes
My worried shoes
Ooo
My worried shoes
I made a mistake and I never forgot
I tied knots in the laces
Of my worried shoes
And with every step that I'd take I'd remember my mistake
As I marched further and further away
In my worried shoes
Ooo
My worried shoes
And my shoes, they led me down a crooked path
Away from all welcome mats
My worried shoes
And then I looked around and I saw the sun shining down
And I took off my
My worried shoes
And my feet broke free to breathe the air
And I didn't need to wear
My worried shoes
My worried shoes
And then I knew the difference between worrying and caring
'Cause I've got a lot of walking to do
And I don't want to wear
My worried shoes
Ooo
My worried shoes2Embed
