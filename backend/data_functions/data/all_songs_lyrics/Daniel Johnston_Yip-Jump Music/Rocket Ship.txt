Rocket Ship LyricsRocket ship
Rocket ship
Going on a trip far away
I'm leaving today
Rocket ship
My bags are packed I'm ready to go
My bags are packed I'm ready to go
10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1!
The stars are blurry; we're going fast!
Rocket ship
Rocket ship
Planet X
There's this girl there
Her name is X
I say, "Hello, you don't know me but I don't know you either."
Rocket ship
Rocket ship
Our bags are packed we're ready to go
Our bags are packed we're ready to go
10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1!
The stars are blurry; we're moving fast!
We're going on a trip far away
We're leaving today
Our home is our rocket ship1Embed
