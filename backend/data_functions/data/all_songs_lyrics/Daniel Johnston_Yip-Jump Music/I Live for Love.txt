I Live for Love Lyrics
I live for love
I live for love

And I can hardly wait 'til Saturday
When I see her because I live for love
The moon and the stars they know how I feel
'Cause I live for love


And I can hardly wait 'til Saturday
When I see her because I live for love
The moon and the stars they know what I'm thinking of
'Cause I live for loveEmbed
