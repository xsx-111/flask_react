Casper the Friendly Ghost Lyrics
The coyote goes:
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

He was smiling through his own personal hell
Dropped his last dime in a wishing well
But he was hoping too close and then he fell
Now he’s Casper the friendly ghost

He was always polite to the people who’d tell him
That he was nothing but a lazy bum
But goodbye to them he had to go
Now he’s Casper the friendly ghost

Nobody treated him nice while he was alive
You can’t buy no respect like the librarian said
But everybody respects the dead
They love the friendly ghost

And now they say we’ll never forget that he learned, yes
We were mean to him but he never burned us, and
Love lives forever, thanks to you, the friendly ghost
Thank you, Casper the friendly ghost
And so the legend grew
And all the people that he knew
Go and spread the news of
Casper the friendly ghost

The cow says:
