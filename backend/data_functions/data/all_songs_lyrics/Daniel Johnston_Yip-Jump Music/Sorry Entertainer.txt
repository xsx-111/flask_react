Sorry Entertainer Lyrics
Where the wind blows
That's where I go
Where the moon is
That's where I am
And when I get
Have a problem
Always hoping the wind will blow me away again

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer

Drove those demons
Out of my head
With an organ and a pencil full of lead
And when I'm dead
I'd like to have it said
He drove those demons out of his head

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
Now the curtain
Parts the stage
It's the dawning of a new and exciting age
And I'm free
Free at last
Like a monkey out of its cage

I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainer
I'm a loner
I'm a sorry entertainerEmbed
