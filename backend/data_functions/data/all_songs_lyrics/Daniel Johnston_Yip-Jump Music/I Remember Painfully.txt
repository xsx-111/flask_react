I Remember Painfully LyricsI remember how we looked at the embryo in the jar together
And I remember how we stood talking in the store to each other
It was love
But what is it now
It's pain
I remember your face and I remember your grace
I remember, I remember, I just remember
And I remember how we laughed at the jokes that we had between us
And I remember how we talked and mocked each other blatantly
It was fun
But what is it now
It's pain
And I remember how you smiled
And that light that was in your eyes
And I remember how pretty you were always a pleasant surprise
It was nice
But what is it now
It's pain
I remember your face and I remember your grace
I remember, I remember, I just remember
And I remember you at the funeral shaking hands and hanging coats
And I remember you standing pregnant at the art room
It was weird
But what is it now
It's pain
I remember your face and I remember your grace
I remember, I remember, I just remember
When I saw you at the department store
I said "have a nice baby"
You were standing happy, I left you with that smile on your face
Years later I was hitchhiking and that mortician picked me up
Then he said to me, he said "good luck"
I remember how we looked at the embryo in the jar together
And I remember how we stood talking in the store to each other
It was love
But what is it now
It's pain
