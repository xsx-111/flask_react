The Creature/3rd Chair Lyrics
Love is priceless
And I'm still paying the bill
I get to loving you so much
It just ain't right sometimes
The creature's panting through his gill
Can't you see the pleading in his eyes?
It says "If you want me to, I will"
Just don't ask him why
She was my girl
But now she's goneEmbed
