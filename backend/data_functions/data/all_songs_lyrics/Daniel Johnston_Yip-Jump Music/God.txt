God LyricsGod made the world
God made you
God made me too
God made the stars
God made the moon
God made the earth too
God made everything
But God is still creating
God makes me glad
God makes me glad
God made the sea
God made the land
I'm glad God made me
'Cause I love the stars
And I love the moon
And I love the earth too
And I love the God
That made all these things
He made me love him
'Cause he loved me first
God made the world
God made you
God made me too
God made the stars
God made the moon
God made the earth too
God made everything
But God is still creating
God makes me glad
God makes me gladEmbed
