Love Defined LyricsLove is patient and kind
Love is not jealous or boastful
It is not arrogant or rude
Love does not insist on its own way
It is not irritable or resentful
It does not rejoice at wrong
But rejoices in the right
Love bears all things
Believes all things
Hopes all things
Endures all things
Love never endsEmbed
