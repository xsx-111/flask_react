Museum of Love LyricsGone with the wild wind
Like it was a dream
Preserved now for all to see
Like nothing you've ever seen
Right this way
To the Museum of Love
Right away
You've got to see 'em
It's love love love
This is right here where he stood
When he wrote those sacred words
And he made a holy vow
And these are the drawings and his library card
And this is the cow
See it all
In the Hall of Sadness
Please don't miss
The Exhibit of Madness
As legend would have it
He had this nasty habit
Of a longing that was wronging himself
But still he would persist
In fact he would insist
That there was nothing nobody could do to help
He really loved her
He really did
And his love went 'round and 'round
And though he tried to keep it hid
He had lost what he had found
He had lost what he had found
Now all this pain preserved for all to observe
But please don't touch
It's an inspiration to think or try to believe
That someone could love someone that much
So now we declare a new holiday for lovers everywhere
For each and every one to have their own share
He would have liked it that way
Right this way
To the Museum of Love
Right away
You've got to see 'em
It's love love loveEmbed
