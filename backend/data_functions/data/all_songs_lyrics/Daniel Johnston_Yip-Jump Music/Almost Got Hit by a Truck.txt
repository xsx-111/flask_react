Almost Got Hit by a Truck LyricsI was walking across the bridge
Going to my friend's house
When I was crossing the road
A truck almost ran me down
Ran me down ran me down oh oh
Oh I'm so sad
And I know you'll be glad when I find my way
Find my way oh oh
I was walking on my way to work
The same day I wasn't looking
And I was in the middle of the street
And a truck almost hit me
Almost hit me almost hit me oh oh
Oh I'm not so bad
Please don't be mad
I'm finding my way, finding my way oh oh
Got to stay along the straight and narrow
Stand off the obstacle course
Or something's liable to happen
Like a truck will run you right over
Run you right down
Run you right over oh oh
Oh I'm so glad
And I know that you'll be glad
If I find my way
Find my way oh oh
Almost got hit by a truck
Almost got hit by a truck
Almost got hit by a truck
Almost got hit by a truckEmbed
