Love of My Life Lyrics
Where you are, that's where I wanna be
Through your eyes are all the things I wanna see
In the night you are my dream
You're everything to me

You're the love of my life
And the breath in my prayers
Take my hand and lead me there
What I need is you here

I can't forget the taste of your mouth
From your lips, all the heavens pour out
I can't forget when we are one
With you alone I am free

Everyday, every night
You alone are the love of my life
Alright, alright
Everyday, every night
You alone are the love of my life
We go dancing in the moonlight
With the starlight in your eyes
We go dancing till the sunrise
You and me, we're gonna dance, dance, danceEmbed
