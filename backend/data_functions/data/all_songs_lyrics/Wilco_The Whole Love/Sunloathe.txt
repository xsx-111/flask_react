Sunloathe Lyrics
I loathe the sun
Sometimes I don't
Know how to love
Anything myself
It's hard to become
Hold on to it all
But I kill my memories
With a cheap disease

To the sails, fail
To the bird and the whale
Remove my misery
It's all or nothing I see
I don't wanna lose this fight
I don't wanna end this fight
Goodbye

I loathe the sun
Someday I know
I'll learn how to love
Anymore is enough
I don't wanna lose this fight
I don't wanna end this fight
GoodbyeEmbed
