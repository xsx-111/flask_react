Sometimes It Happens LyricsSometimes it happens that you are friends
And then you are not friends
And friendship has passed
And whole days are lost and among them
A fountain empties itself
And sometimes it happens that you are loved
And then you are not loved
And love is past
And whole days are lost and among them
A fountain empties itself into the grass
And sometimes you want to speak to him
And then you do not want to speak
Then the opportunity has passed
Your dreams flare up, they suddenly vanish
And also it happens that there is nowhere to go
And then there is somewhere to go
Then you have bypassed
And the years flare up and are gone
Quicker than a minute
So you have nothing
You wonder if these things matter and then
They cease to matter
And caring is past
And a fountain empties itself into the grass
And sometimes it happens that you are loved
And then you are not loved...Embed
