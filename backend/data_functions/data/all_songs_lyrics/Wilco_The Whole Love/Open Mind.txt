Open Mind Lyrics
I will throw myself underneath the wheels
Of any train of thought
Running off the rails, I'll sail you through
The rogue waves of your brain
If I could bring a light to shine
Upon the dark and disobeying
Night so young but I still say
We're too old for clich√©s

Oh, I can only dream of the dreams we'd share
If you were so inclined
I would love to be the one
To open up your mind

I could base my whole existence
Upon the cherry-strands of your gold hair
I would ask, almost insist
Upon treating you kind and fair

Oh, I can only dream of the dreams we'd have
If our hearts would be entwined
If you would let me be the one
To open up your mind
I'd still be myself beneath the banks
All broken beside the stream
Ready to return your thoughts unlearned
So it goes, so it seems

Oh, I can only dream of the dreams we'd share
If you weren't so defined
I would love to be the one
To open up your mind

If you would let me be the one
To open up your mindEmbed
