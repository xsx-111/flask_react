Dawned on Me LyricsI been young, I been old
I been hurt and consoled
Heart of cold, heart of gold - so I'm told
I been lost, I been found
I been taken by the sound of my own voice
Voices in my head

I can't help it if I fall in love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know it dawned on me
Every night is a test
To the east or the west
The sun rises and sets
That's the sun at its best
I forget that I know
I regret letting you go
Sometimes I can't believe how dark it can be

I can't help it if I fall in love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know it dawned on me
So on and so forth
And again I will start to begin at the end
I can't help it if I fall in love with you again
I'm calling just to let you know it dawned on meEmbed
