Black Moon Lyrics
I was always right
About the morning
Okay, I'm an old shoe
Danced above the blaze
Never stopped crawling
Over the black dunes

And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now too?

I'm always one
Without a warning
Old days re-appear
Lift away, past the gate
Desert keeps forming
Underneath the black moon

And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now too?Embed
