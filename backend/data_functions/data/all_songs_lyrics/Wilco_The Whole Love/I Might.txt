I Might Lyrics
Was I wrong?
Off all night long?
So high
As the stinking sun
I came alive then I felt, oh uh oh
Some guys have everything I know

It’s alright
I've done a lot of crawling around outside
And I heard it's alright

Your sno-cone, and it's piss and blood
It’s in the cards, oh oh
'Get Well Soon - everybody'
Do all lies have a taste?
Let it go, I don’t know, oh
A cow’s neck, bad shave, in the low blow slo-mo

It’s alright
You won't set the kids on fire
Oh, but I might, oh
You come on, sentimental
If the solar car’s coming, I’m home
The Magna Carta’s on a Slim Jim blood, brutha
The sunk soul with the coal clean toe is the mutha

Yeah, that’s right
When you gonna find out
I’m all inside
You still might

It's alright
It's alright

It’s alright
You won't set the kids on fire
Oh, but I might, oh

It's alright
It's alright1Embed
