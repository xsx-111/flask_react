I Love My Label Lyrics
Oh yes
I love my label and my label loves me
For she's so good and kind together we will pave our destiny
My label always loves to hear some pretty chords on its records like these ones
She's always pleased to hear some of these pretty melodies so I sing them some

I love my label, I love my label yeah
And my label's got high hopes in me

Play the blues
Oh I'm so proud of them up here, we're one big happy family
I guess you could say I'm the poor relation of the parent company
They always ask for lots of songs but no more than 2:50 long so I write them some
They never talk behind my back and they're always playing my new tracks when I come along
