Capitol City Lyrics
Capitol city, skyline photo
Skyscrapers shine, the sun's so
Low in the sky
Secretaries at the hot dog vendors
Cabs honk at the bicycle messengers
Rolling by
I can't call with a subway token
Anyway, the phones are all broken
I wish you were here
Better yet I wish I was there with you

You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breathing that country air
You wouldn't like it here

Capitol towers radiate a steam vent
Scream along with the clarinets and arguments
Echo down the hall
I can't sleep, I can't wake up
Shaking up, maybe we should break up
I wish you were here
Better yet I wish I was there with you
You wouldn't like it here
You should stay right there
Breathing that country air
You wouldn't like it here

Capitol city, skyline photo
Picture postcards, sad and lonesome
Low in the sky
I can't smile when my heart's still broken
Far away, in love and unspoken
I wish you were here
Or I was there with youEmbed
