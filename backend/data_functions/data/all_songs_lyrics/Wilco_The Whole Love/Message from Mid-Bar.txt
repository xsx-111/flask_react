Message from Mid-Bar LyricsHate will keep us together
Love will tear us apart
What has joined us
In the dark
Oh I was worried
I would drive you away
You felt different and I felt the same
Then I told you
And you agreed
Some days I despise
Everyone I see
We're all swine
But you're all mine
What will keep us together
Will tear us apart
Maybe making up your mind
Breaks your heart
Hate will save the dolphins
I wish there was a way
I could change it so nothing
Would ever change
Or stay the same
All I can do
Is sing it for you
Whole lives go by
Then we die
You're all swine
We're swine
Love will keep us together
Love will tear us apart
I don't care what the song says
It's not my heart
Anyway, the point is
Things can always be worse
When you don't have a chorus
It's verse after verse after verse
Then I told you
In my arms
I hate you less
Than the rest
We're all swine
But you're all mineEmbed
