Overtime LyricsOvertime
That's what they all tell me
That's what they say to me
Overtime
Overtime
That's what they all tell me
That's what they say to me
Overtime
Your blue eyes, your black eyelashes
The way you looked at life in your funny way
I guess out of the blue, you won't cross my mind
And I'll get over you over time
Your pale skin, your sexy crooked teeth
The trouble you get in in your clumsy way
I guess one afternoon, you won't cross my mind
And I'll get over you over time
I guess out of the blue, you won't cross my mind
And I'll get over you over timeEmbed
