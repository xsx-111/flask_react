Those Three Days LyricsYou say there's always gonna be this thing
Between us, days are filled with dreams
Scorpions crawl across my screen
Make their home beneath my skin
Underneath my dress stick their tongues
Bite through the flesh down to the bone
And I have been so fuckin' alone
Since those three days
Did you only want me for those three days?
Did you only need me for those three days?
Did you love me forever just for those three days?
You built a nest inside my soul
You rest your head on leaves of gold
You managed to crawl inside my brain
You found a hole and in you came
You sleep like a baby breathing
Comfortably between truth and pain
But the truth is nothing's been the same
Since those three days
Did you only want me for those three days?
Did you only need me for those three days?
Did you love me forever just for those three days?
You say there's always gonna be this thing
Between us, days are filled with dreams
Scorpions crawl across my screen
Make their home beneath my skin
Underneath my dress stick their tongues
Bite through flesh down to the bone
And I have been so fuckin' alone
You built a nest inside my soul
You rest your head on leaves of gold
You managed to crawl inside my brain
You found a hole and in you came
You sleep like a baby breathing
Comfortably between truth and pain
But the truth is nothing's been the same
Since those three days
Did you only want me for those three days?
Did you only need me for those three days?
Did you love me forever just for those three days, baby?
Did you only want me for those three days?
Did you only need me for those three days?
Did you love me forever just for those three days?
For those three days
For those three days1Embed
