Words Fell LyricsWords fell like roses at our feet
When you let me see you cry
Your silent lips against my cheek
Words fell on a night as black as coal
Your kisses traveled deep
Your eyes pierced my soul
Words fell
Words fell in another place and time
We lived within the woods
Ate berries from the vine
Words fell when we lay among the stones
And watched the Druids dance
And walked along the rocky shores
Words fell
Words fell in another place and time
I knew your mournful blue
Knew your golden grace
Words fell when we let the ocean hold us
And sank beneath the waves
In the silence of the roses
Words fell
Words fell
Words fellEmbed
