World Without Tears LyricsIf we lived in a world without tears
How would bruises find the face to lie upon?
How would scars find skin to etch themselves into?
How would broken find the bones?
If we lived in a world without tears
How would heartbeats know when to stop?
How would blood know which body to flow outside of?
How would bullets find the guns?
If we lived in a world without tears
How would misery know which back door to walk through?
How would trouble know which mind to live inside of?
How would sorrow find a home?
If we lived in a world without tears
How would bruises find the face to lie upon?
How would scars find skin to etch themselves into?
How would broken find the bones?
If we lived in a world without tears
How would bruises find the face to lie upon?
How would scars find skin to etch themselves into?
How would broken find the bones?
How would broken find the bones?
How would broken find the bones?Embed
