Righteously LyricsYou don't have to prove
Your manhood to me constantly
I know you're the man can't you see
I love you righteously
Why you wanna diss me
After the way you been kissin' me?
After those pretty things you say
And the love we made today
When you run your hand
All up and run it back down my leg
Get excited and bite my neck
Get me all worked up like that
Think this through
I laid it down for you every time
Respect me, I give you what's mine
You're entirely way too fine
Arms around my waist
You get a taste of how good this can be
Be the man, you ought to tenderly
Stand up for me
Flirt with me, don't keep hurtin' me
Don't cause me pain
Be my lover, don't play no game
Just play me John Coltrane
