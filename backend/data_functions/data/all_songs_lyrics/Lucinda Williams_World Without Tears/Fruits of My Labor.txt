Fruits of My Labor LyricsBaby, see how I been living
Velvet curtains on the windows to
Keep the bright and unforgiving
Light from shining through
Baby, I remember all the things we did
When we slept together
In the blue behind your eyelids
Baby, sweet baby
Traced your scent through the gloom
'Til I found these purple flowers
I was spent, I was soon smelling you for hours
Lavender, lotus blossoms too
Water the dirt, flowers last for you
Baby, sweet baby
Tangerines and persimmons
And sugarcane
Grapes and honeydew melon
Enough fit for a queen
Lemon trees don't make a sound
'Til branches bend and fruit falls to the ground
Baby, sweet baby
Come to my world and witness
The way things have changed
'Cause I finally did it, baby
I got out of La Grange
Got in my Mercury and drove out west
Pedal to the metal and my luck to the test
Baby, sweet baby
I been tryin' to enjoy all the fruits of my labor
I been cryin' for you boy but truth is my savior
Baby, sweet baby if it's all the same
Take the glory any day over the fame
Baby, sweet baby1Embed
