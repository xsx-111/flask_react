Ventura LyricsI think I'm gonna make myself a little something to eat
Get a can down off the shelf, maybe a little something sweet
Haven't spoke to no one, haven't been in the mood
Pour some soup, get a spoon, stir it up real good
Go out with a friend, they know the music might help
But I can't pretend, I wish I was somewhere else
I wanna watch the ocean bend
The edges of the sun, then
I wanna get swallowed up
In an ocean of love
Put on my coat, go out into the street
Get a lump in my throat, and look down at my feet
Take the long way home, so I can ride around
Put Neil Young on and turn up the sound
Drive up the coastline, maybe to Ventura
Watch the waves make signs out on the water
I wanna watch the ocean bend
The edges of the sun, then
I wanna get swallowed up
In an ocean of love
Stand in the shower, clean this dirty mess
Give me back my power, and drown this unholiness
Lean over the toilet bowl, and throw up my confession
Cleanse my soul, of this hidden obsession
I wanna watch the ocean bend
The edges of the sun, then
I wanna get swallowed up
In an ocean of love
I wanna watch the ocean bend
The edges of the sun, then
I wanna get swallowed up
In an ocean of love1Embed
