Sweet Side LyricsYou run yourself ragged tryin' to be strong
You feel bad when you done nothin' wrong
Love got all confused with anger and pride
So much abuse on such a little child
Someone you trusted told you to shut up
Now there's a pain in your gut that you can't get rid of
No one heard your screams when you were nine
When bad dreams filled your summertime
So you don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
You're tough as steel and you keep your chin up
You don't ever feel like you're good enough
You've had the blues ever since you were six
Your little tennis shoes and your pick-up sticks
You were screamed at and kicked over and over
Now you always feel sick and you can't keep a lover
Every Christmas there were presents to unwrap
But the things you witnessed when you were five and a half
So you don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
Someone deserted you, the damage is done
Now you don't deserve to be loved by no one
Hands that would feed you when you were two
Were the same hands that beat you black and blue
You get defensive at every turn
You're overly sensitive and overly concerned
Few precious memories no lullabies
Hollowed out centuries of lies
You don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
You don't always show your sweet side
I've seen you in the kitchen cookin' me supper
I listened to you bitchin' and I watched you suffer
I still love you, baby, 'cause I know you
Don't mean to do the cruel things you do
I've seen you sewin' buttons on your shirt
I've seen you throwin' up when your stomach hurt
I stick by you, baby, through thick and thin
No matter what kind of shape you're in
'Cause I've seen your sweet side
I've seen your sweet side
I've seen your sweet side
I've seen your sweet side
I've seen your sweet side, baby
I've seen your sweet side
I've seen your sweet side, baby
I've seen your sweet sideEmbed
