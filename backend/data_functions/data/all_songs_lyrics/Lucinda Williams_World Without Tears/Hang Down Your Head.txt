Hang Down Your Head LyricsHush a wild violet
Hush a band of gold
Hush you're in a story
I heard somebody told
Tear the promise from my heart
Tear my heart today
You have found another
Oh, baby, I must go away
So hang down your head for sorrow
Hang down your head for me
Hang down your head tomorrow
Hang down your head, Marie
Hush my love the rain now
Hush my love so true
Hush my love a train now
Well it takes me away from you
So hang down your head for sorrow
Hang down your head for me
Hang down your head
Hang down your head
Hang down your head Marie
So hang down your head for sorrow
Hang down your head for me
Hang down your head
Hang down your head
Hang down your head, MarieEmbed
