Atonement LyricsCome on, come on
Kill the rats in the gutter
Come on, come on
Sings the voice in the choir
Come on, come on
Bring your Father and your Mother
Come on, come on
Sing it higher and higher
Shake the clammy hand
Repeat the 23rd psalm
Make you understand
Where it was you went wrong
Voices from tapes
Shouting with twisted tongues
Emotional rape
Hellfire scorched lungs
Come on, come on
Pay close attention to this
Come on, come on
Let me give you something good to eat
Come on, come on
Bite down hard 'til it sticks between your teeth
Come on, come on
Glory, glory, we've killed the beast
Blinded by glittery diamonds
Resting on crooked fingers
Shaded eyes, they are the ones
Who'll lead you to your deliverance
From the figure of doom
Force you to understand
Lock you in a room
With a holy roller and a one man band
Come on
Kill the rats in the gutter
Come on
Sings the voice in the choir
Come on
Bring your Father and your Mother
Come on
Sing it higher and higher
Shake the clammy hand
Repeat the 23rd psalm
Make you understand
Where it was you went wrong
Voices from tapes
Shouting with twisted tongues
Emotional rape
Hellfire scorched lungs
Blinded by glittery diamonds
Resting on crooked fingers
Shaded eyes, they are the ones
Who'll lead you to your deliverance
From the figure of doom
Force you to understand
Lock you in a room
With a holy roller and a one man band
Come on
Kill the rats in the gutter
Come on, come on
Sings the voice in the choir
Come on, come on, come on
Bring your Father and your Mother
Come on, come on, come on
Sing it higher and higher
Come on, come on, come on
Pay close attention to this
Come on, come on
Let me give you something good to eat
Come on, come on
Bite down hard 'til it sticks between your teeth
Come on, come on
Glory, glory, we've killed the beastEmbed
