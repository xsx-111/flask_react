Chillout Tent Lyrics
There was a stage and a PA
Up in western Massachusetts
And the kids came from miles around
To get messed up on the music
And she drove down from Bowdoin
With a carload of girlfriends
To meet some boys
And maybe eat some mushrooms
And they did and she got sick
Now she's pinned and way too shaky
She don't want to tell the doctor
Everything she's taken
The paramedics hovered over
Like a somber, mourning family
They gave her activated charcoal
They flooded her with saline

I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent
They gave me oranges and cigarettes

He was rough around the edges
He'd been to school but never finished
He'd been to jail but never prison
And it was his first day off in forever, man
The festival seemed like a pretty good plan
Cruise some chicks and get a sun-tan
His friend gave him four
But he said, "Only take one"
But then, he got bored
And he ended up taking all four
So now, my man, he ain't that bored, anyways
The paramedics found him
He was shaking on the side of the stage
Everything was spinning; then, I came to in the chillout tent
They gave me oranges and cigarettes
I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent
They gave us oranges and cigarettes

She looked just like a baby bird
All new and wet and trying to light a Parliament
He quoted her some poetry
He's Tennyson in denim and sheepskin
He looked a lot like Izzy Stradlin
They started kissing when the nurses took off their IVs
It was kind of of sexy, but it was kind of creepy
Their mouths were fizzy with the cherry cola
They had the privacy of bedsheets
And all the other kids were mostly in comas

He was kind of cute, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that boy again
She was pretty cool, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that girl again
He was kind of cute, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that boy again
She seemed pretty cool, we kind of kicked it in the chillout tent
And I never saw that girl again1Embed
