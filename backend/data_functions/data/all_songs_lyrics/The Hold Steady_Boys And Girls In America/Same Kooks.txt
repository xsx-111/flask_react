Same Kooks LyricsThey found me in a florist
I was fried and out of focus
I was kicking it with chemists
The scratches on my back, they formed into a choir
And belted out a chorus
There were clicks and hisses and complicated kisses
Gideon's got a pipe made from a Pringles can
Hey, hey, Providence
You gotta fall in love with whoever you can
The sheets stain but the sins wash away
Naked bodies in the Narragansett Bay
Same kooks don't shoot but they sure do sniff
Same kooks can't fly because their wings are clipped
Same kooks can't come but they sure do kiss
Making love to the girls with the wrapped up wrists
The lord takes away and the lord delivers
Washed it all off in the Mississippi River
We slept it off in the matinees
We rip it up just like razor blades
Now we just need something to celebrate
I wanna open some bottles up
I'm getting tired
Of all these Styrofoam coffee cups
She said, "It's hard to feel holy when you can't get clean."
And now, she's bumping up against the washing machines
She said, "It's hard to slow down when you're picking up speed."
It was those two same kooks from that one stupid photo shoot
It was those two same kooks from that one stupid photo shootEmbed
