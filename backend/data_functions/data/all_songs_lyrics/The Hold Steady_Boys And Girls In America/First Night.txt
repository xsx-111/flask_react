First Night LyricsCharlemagne shakes in the streets
Gideon makes love to the sweets
Holly's not invincible
In fact, she's in the hospital
Not far from that bar where we met
On that first night
Charlemagne pulls street corner scams
Gideon's got a pipe made from a Pringles can
Holly's insatiable
She still looks incredible
But she don't look like that same girl we met
On that first night
She was golden with bar light and beer
On that first night
She slept like she'd never been scared
And then last night
She said words alone never could save us
And then last night
She cried and she told us about Jesus
Holly's inconsolable
Unhinged and uncontrollable
'Cause we can't get as high as we got
On that first night
Boys and girls in America
Boys and girls in America
Boys and girls in America
Boys and girls in America
Don't bother talking to the guys with the hot soft eyes
You know they're already taken
Don't even speak to all those sequencers and beats boys
When they kiss, they spit white noise
When they kiss, they spit white noise
When they kiss, they spit white noise
When they kiss, they spit white noise
When they kiss, they spit white noise
Yeah, when they kiss, they spit white noise
Yeah, when they kiss, they spit white noise
When they kiss, they spit white noiseEmbed
