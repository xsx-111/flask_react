Party Pit Lyrics
I guess I met her at the party pit
She said those kids she's with were selling it
So we sailed off on some separate trips
She got pinned down at the party pit
I went away to school that fall
She stuck around with all those stickpin dolls
Sped through the scene until the engine stalled
Some suburban shopping mall

Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit
Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit

I came back to start a band, of course
Saw her walking through the Crystal Court
She made a scene by the revolving doors
She's gonna walk around and drink some more
So we walked across that Grain Belt bridge
In a brand new Minneapolis
She said, "I think that all those things I did
Were just momentum from the party pit."

Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit
Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit
Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down at the party pit
Sailed away on such separate trips
And she got pinned down and I'm pretty sure we kissed
And I'm pretty sure we kissed

Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
I'm gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink
Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink
Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink
Gonna walk around, gonna walk around
Gonna walk around and drink
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some more
Gonna walk around and drink some moreEmbed
