You Can Make Him Like You Lyrics
You don't have to deal with the dealers
Let your boyfriend deal with the dealers
It only gets inconvenient
When you wanna get high alone
You don't have to know how to get home
Let your boyfriend tell the driver the best way to go
It only gets kind of weird
When you wanna go home alone
You don't have to know the inspiring people
Let your boyfriend know the inspiring people
You can hang in the kitchen
Talk about the stars and the upcoming sequel

If you get tired of your boyfriend's things
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
If you get tired of your boyfriend's scene
There's always other scenes, there's always other boyfriends

You don't have to deal with the dealers
Let your boyfriend deal with the dealers
It only gets inconvenient
When you wanna get high alone
You don't have to go to the right kind of schools
Let your boyfriend come from the right kind of schools
You can wear his old sweatshirt
You can cover yourself like a bruise
And if you get tired of your boyfriend's things
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
If you get tired of your football friends
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
If you get tired of the car he drives
There's always other boys, you can make him like you
If you get tired of the music he likes
There's always other boys and you can make him like you

They say you don't have a problem until you start to do it alone
They say you don't have a problem until you start bringing it home
They say you don't have a problem until you start sleeping alone

There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys and you can make him like you
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys, you can make him like you
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys, you can make him like you
There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends
There's always other boys, you can make him like youEmbed
