Massive Nights LyricsThe guys were feeling good about their liquor run
The girls were kinda flirting with the setting sun
We all kinda fumbled through the jitterbug
We were all powered up on some new upper drug
And everyone was funny, and everyone was pretty
And everyone was coming towards the center of the city
The dance floor was crowded, the bathrooms were worse
We kissed in your car and we drank from your purse
I had my mouth on her nose
When the chaperone said that we were dancing too close

We had some massive nights
Every song was right
All the wine was tight
And your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool
And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two (Usually one or two)
Some guys, they get a little bit uptight
Some girls, they got something to prove (Usually one or two)
We had some massive highs
We had some crushing lows
We had some lusty little crushes
We had those all ages hardcore matinee shows
And I was down on my knees
When the chaperone said that it was time for me to leave

We had some massive nights
Every song was right
All the wine was tight
And your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool
And there weren't any fights
There's usually one or two (Usually one or two)
Some guys, they get a little bit uptight
Some girls, they got something to prove (Usually one or two)
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights
We had some massive nights

We had some massive nights
Every song was right
All the wine was tight
And your friends were pretty cool
And my friends were acting cool
She had the gun in her mouth, and she was shooting up at her dreams
When the chaperone said that we'd been crowned the king and the queenEmbed
