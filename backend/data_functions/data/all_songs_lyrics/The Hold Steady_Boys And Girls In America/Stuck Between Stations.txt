Stuck Between Stations Lyrics
There are nights when I think that Sal Paradise was right
Boys and girls in America
They have such a sad time together
Sucking off each other at the demonstrations
Making sure their makeup's straight
Crushing one another with colossal expectations
Dependent, undisciplined, sleeping late

She was a really cool kisser
And she wasn't all that strict of a Christian
She was a damn good dancer
But she wasn't all that great of a girlfriend
He likes the warm feeling
But he's tired of all the dehydration
Most nights are crystal clear
But tonight it's like he's stuck between stations
On the radio

The Devil and John Berryman, they took a walk together
And they ended up on Washington, talking to the river
He said, "I surrounded myself with doctors and deep thinkers
But big heads and soft bodies make for lousy lovers"
There was that night that we thought John Berryman could fly
But he didn't, so he died
She said, "You're pretty good with words
But words won't save your life"
And they didn't, so he died
Yeah, he was drunk and exhausted
But he was critically acclaimed and respected
He loved the Golden Gophers
But he hated all the drawn-out winters
He likes the warm feeling
But he's tired of all the dehydration
Most nights were kind of fuzzy
But that last night, he had total retention

Yeah, these Twin City kisses
They sound like clicks and hisses
We all come down and drown
In the Mississippi River

We drink and we dry up and now we crumble into dust
We get wet and we corrode and now we're covered up in rust
We drink and we dry up and now we crumble into dust
We get wet and we corrode and now we're covered up in rust

She was a really cool kisser
And she wasn't all that strict of a Christian
She was a damn good dancer
But she wasn't all that great of a girlfriend
He likes the warm feeling
But he's tired of all the dehydration
Most nights are crystal clear
But tonight it's like he's stuck between stations
These Twin City kisses
They sound like clicks and hisses
We all come down and drown6Embed
