Hot Soft Light Lyrics
I was not involved up at the Northtown Mall
As a matter of fact I didn't even know that that's where it happened
I was France Ave. when they came out dancing
I was Lyndale South, I was kicking it with cousins
We were talking about going clubbin' but instead we just started drinkin'
I've been straight since the Cinco de Mayo
But before that I was blotto
I was blacked out
I was cracked out
I was caved in
You should’ve seen all these portals
That I’ve powered up in

Started recreational
Ended kinda medical
It came on hot and soft
And then it tightened up its tentacles

I wasn't there
I was blind, high, I was scared
I was Lake and Columbus, I was cutting off all my hair
I was unfurling a flag of defiance aimed at my guidance guy
So this is it
This is the end of the session
And I ain't gonna be taking any more questions
I think my attorney's gonna second that notion

Started recreational
Ended kinda medical
And it came on hot and soft
And then it tightened up its tentacles
And the band played "Screaming for Vengeance"
And we agreed, this world is mostly manacled
It started ice cream social nice
It ended up all white and ecumenical

There are guys, there are guys, there are guys, there are guys
With the wild eyes when they ask to get you high
There are girls, there are girls, there are girls, there are girls
That'll come to you with comfort in the night
That's right

Started recreational
Ended kinda medical
It came on hot and soft
And then it tightened up its tentacles
And the band played "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"
You thought it was stormy and adorable
It started in the vestibule
It ended in the hospital

There are guys, there are guys, there are guys, there are guys
With the wild eyes when they ask to get you high
There are girls, there are girls, there are girls, there are girls
That'll come to you with comfort in the night

There are nights, there are nights, there are nights, there are nights
When it all comes on a little bit too bright
There's a cross, there's a cross, there's a cross, there's a cross
And in the center, there is a hot, soft lightEmbed
