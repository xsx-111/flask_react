Last Blues for Bloody Knuckles LyricsMy precious wife, I am in shambles
I am crumbling, I am
Was it something I did
Bid the tide to climb so high that it ripped our shore up
I can fix it, I swear
If you trust me
I am old and I am rusting but I care
I care
My precious wife, we made a promise
Pledged our flesh to be one
How can you doubt a love that stood so proud as we raised our children
I believe in it still
It has faltered and it has faded
But I know it's there
How'd it change
The way you thought of me
How strange to think we once were lovers
Now we've wrapped the past up in broken glass
And when you speak my name you shudder
Oh precious wife, believe I'll save this
I'll revive it, I will
We've built a family from this marriage
Why would you tear it apart
Oh speak now, precious
Your silence screams
You're giving in to failure
Hear me, the promise that you made was meant to live forever
Until our deathbed, you're not allowed to change your mind
Was there nothing in that promise
Are you listening to me
Oh husband, I could not control it
Husband, I could not abstain
One cannot stop the wind from blowing
Nor refuse the falling rain
Love stirred up a storm inside me
Wrapped its arms around my waist
I failed you dear, I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry
There was nothing I could do
No, there was nothing I could
Sure as the rain will fall
Some love just fails without reason
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can doEmbed
