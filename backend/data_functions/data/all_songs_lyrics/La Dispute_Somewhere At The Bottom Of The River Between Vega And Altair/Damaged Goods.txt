Damaged Goods LyricsShe forced a smile, said "Boy, come kiss my mouth
You know that hope you're holding to?
It looks an awful lot like fear
Now, you're so quick to fall on failure
And so quick to raise your voice, like
'If I can't find a mistake to blame
We didn't have a choice.'
Oh, but you had an option
I was your chance to feel complete
But when I leaned in close to you, you
Kissed your fear instead of me
You had my hand in your hand
You had my lip in your teeth
You had my heart on your sleeve
You had a chance to breathe
But, boy, you wouldn't let your fear recede so I moved on
Oh, and it's too late to change your mind now
You got scared, boy, and I got gone
Now you failed, and there's no way to turn back time
You had your chance, boy, I tried."
"You tried?"
I looked her in the eye and smiled
"My girl, you must understand
That fear is not some product that I made
It crept unwelcome in my head the day
They had her torn away
It changed me
Now at the end of every day
I lie awake at night and wait
To feel the wires of my brain
Get cut and quietly rearranged
And hear my beaten heart exclaim
'Still, I refuse to let her go.'"
So we escape to our mistakes
For they wait patiently for us
Oh, how they always wait for me
If my fear has kept me here
Only my fear can set me free
And I'm sorry, dear, but don't you dare speak another word
How could I risk holding your heart in me
While still in love with her?
You were wrong."Embed
