Then Again, Maybe You Were Right LyricsI spoke too soon, it seems
For you made a home in my dreams
While I slept you kept running yourself through my head
Like, "I won't be dead yet."
I said, "You don't understand. We had no control
They stole it; love's been so unfair to me."
"But see, boy, that's my point
You must move on."
Then felt her ghost move in me
I heard her voice call out my name but
This time it faded out—away
"I'll bury it today."
Today
So I breathed her name out into a cold, cold room
Watched her ghost ascend the walls and then dissolve
"This time I choose to let it go."
"This time I choose to let her go
I will not let my fear become the only world I've ever known
I know my heart, kiss my mouth, set me free — I've wounds to mend
And we'll be more than friends, my dear; I fear I've changed my mind again."
"But, boy, you're too late. Oh, God, it's too late."Embed
