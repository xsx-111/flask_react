Such Small Hands Lyrics
I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
I think I saw you in my dreams
You were stitching up the seams
On every broken promise that your body couldn't keep
I think I saw you in my sleep
Oh!

I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
I think I saw you in my dreams
You were stitching up the seams
On every broken promise that your body couldn't keep
I think I saw you in my sleep

I thought I heard the door open, oh no
Thought I heard the door open
But I only heard it close
I thought I heard a plane crashing
But now I think it was your passion snapping

I think you saw me confronting my fear
It went up with a bottle and went down with the beer
And I think you ought to stay away from here
There are ghosts in the walls and they
Crawl in your head through your ear
I think I saw you in my sleep, lover
I think I saw you in my dreams
You were stitching up the seams
On every mangled promise that your body couldn't keep
I think I saw you in my sleep20Embed
