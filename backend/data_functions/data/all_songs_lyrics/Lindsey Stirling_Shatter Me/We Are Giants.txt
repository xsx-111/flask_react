We Are Giants Lyrics
Do you feel like you're secondhand?
Do you feel you're afraid to stand alone?
Cut away every safety net
Live your life so you won't regret the road

Feels like you're standing there so small
Just a space between the stars
Don't be afraid to risk it all
'Cause we are, we are

We are giants
We are giants
We are giants
We are, we are
We are giants
We are giants
We are giants
We are, we are

Raise your flag, let your voice be heard
Put your heart into every word you say
All your failures a cornerstone
Build a house with the things you've thrown away
Feels like you're standing there so small
Just a space between the stars
Don't be afraid to risk it all
'Cause we are, we are

We are giants
We are giants
We are giants
We are, we are
We are giants
We are giants
We are giants
We are, we are

Feels like you're standing there so small
Just a space between the stars
Don't be afraid to risk it all
'Cause we are, we are

We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are, we are
We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are, we are2Embed
