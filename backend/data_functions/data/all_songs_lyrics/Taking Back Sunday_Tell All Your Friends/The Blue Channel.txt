The Blue Channel Lyrics
And I'm not so sure
If I'm sure of anything anymore
Well, this is the last night
Well, this is the last night
That you'll be keeping secrets from me

Hit the lights before you leave, you know of
The million things you "had to say", "sorry" just
Just might have found it's way in there somehow, someway
But don't worry sweetie, 'cause I already know

And I'm not so sure
If I'm sure of anything anymore
Well, this is the last night
Well, this is the last night
That you'll be keeping secrets from me

You're so guilty it's disgusting, he's been
Sneaking underneath your sheets, and your hands
 in places that they probably shouldn't go
But don't worry sweetie, 'cause I already know
So, the fight's on
Regardless, my pictures
Well they don't line your mirror
Regardless you know that
I'm still waiting for your call
Regardless, my pictures
Well they don't line your mirror
Regardless you know that
I'm still waiting for your call
Honestly (They don't line my mirror)
This is the last time that I see you
Regardless, I'm still waiting for your call
Do you know what your girl's been up to?1Embed
