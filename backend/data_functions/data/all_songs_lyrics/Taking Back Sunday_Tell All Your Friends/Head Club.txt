Head Club Lyrics
Well, it's getting colder and you're getting distant
And I just keep thinking
That I never meant it to be like this
To be like this
You know what comes next, so do I
You’re begging for a way to gracefully bow out
And say goodnight

It's worse than you think
On your way home you should have known
You never listen to me
I’m only complaining to keep myself busy, sweetie
I’m only complaining to keep myself busy, sweetie

I can’t say I blame you
But I wish that I could
I’m sick of writing every song about you

Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
I'm sick of writing every song about you
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Should have gone on your way home
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving
Don't call my name out your window, I'm leaving2Embed
