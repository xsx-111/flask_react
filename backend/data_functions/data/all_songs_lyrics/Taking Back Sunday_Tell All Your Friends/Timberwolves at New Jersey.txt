Timberwolves at New Jersey Lyrics
Get up, get up
Come on, come on, let's go
There’s just a few things I think that you should know
Those words at best were worse than teenage poetry
Fragment ideas and too many pronouns
Stop it, come on, you’re not making sense now
You can't make them want you
They're all just laughing

Literate and stylish (Literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet (Kissable and quiet)
Well that's what girls' dreams are made of
And that's all you need to know (And that’s all you need to know)
You have it or you don't (You have it or you)
You have it or you (Don't)

You have it in you
You're sick of my time you're wastin'
Girl, we're just separatin'
Stop it, come on, you know I can’t help it
I got the mic and you got the mosh pit
What will it take to make you admit that you were wrong?
Was his demise so carefully constructed?
Well let's just say I got what I wanted
'Cause in the end it’s always the same (It's justified)
Let's go
Literate and stylish (Literate and stylish)
Kissable and quiet (Kissable and quiet)
Well that's what girls' dreams are made of
And that's all you need to know (And that’s all you need to know)
You have it or you don't (You have it or you)
You have it or you (Don't), you don't

This is me with the words on the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope down the barrel of a gun (gun,gun)
Remind me not to ever act this way again
This is you trying hard to make sure that you're seen
With a girl on your arm and your heart on your sleeve
Remind me not to ever think of you again
This is me with the words on the tip of my tongue
And my eye through the scope down the barrel of a gun
Remind me not to ever act this way again (Again)
Again (Again)
This is me with the words on the tip of my tongue
And my eye on the scope down the barrel of a gun
I'll never act this way again
Rest the weight
(I know something that you don't know)
You've had your chance and folded
Don't hold your breath because you'll only make things worse
Rest the weight
(I know something that you don't know)
You've had your chance and folded
Don't hold your breath because you'll only make things worse
(I know something that you don't know)
This is me with the worst
(I know something that you don't know)
Intentions, don’t
Hold your, hold your breath
(I know something that you don't know)
Because you'll only make things worse
Hold your breath
Because you'll only make things worse
Hold your breath
(I know something that you don't know)
Because you'll only make things worse
Don't hold your breath because you’ll only make things worseEmbed
