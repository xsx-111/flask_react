The Ballad of Sal Villanueva LyricsIt's not that I don't trust you
I just know what you've been up to...
Well this dial tone is agreeing
With everything I've had in mind
And you've got your high as a
Kite tricks in the bag
So as his eyes move past your shoulders
And your shades start movin in the same direction
Don't worry, I... well I won't say a thing
And you can't blame a girl for sticking to what she knows
(You can't blame a girl for sticking to what she knows)
Hope he takes his time and
I hope he keeps your eyes closed tight and
Hope that when he leaves, you still...
You still smell him on your sheets
Cause I can, I can
(Just go...)
Hope he takes his time and
I hope he keeps your eyes closed tight and
Hope that when he leaves, you still...
(Just go...)
You still smell him on your sheets
Cause I can, I can
If I could get to sleep then
I guess you could stop pretending
Cause if I didn't think you loved it
Well then I wouldn't play along and
You've got your high as a kite tricks in the bag
(You've got your high as a kite tricks in the bag)
Hope he takes his time and
I hope he keeps your eyes closed tight and
Hope that when he leaves, you still...
You still smell him on your sheets
Cause I can, I can
(Just go...)
Hope he takes his time and
I hope he keeps your eyes closed tight and
Hope that when he leaves, you still...
(Just go...)
You still smell him on your sheets
Cause I can, I can
You're down for selling me out
While I play dumb
It's cool cause I let you
Thought I'd never catch you...
You'd say "we're only friends"
Yeah, real good friends
I bet, I bet
You're down for selling me out
While I play dumb
It's cool cause I let you
Thought I'd never catch you...
You'd say "we're only friends"
Yeah, real good friends
I bet, I bet
You're down for selling me out
(You're down for selling me out...)
While I played dumb
It's cool cause I let you
Thought I'd never catch you...
(It's cool because I let you...)
You'd say "we're only friends"
(...I let you...I let you...)
Yeah, real good friends
I bet, I bet
Forget your legs around my hips
(You're down for selling me out...)
Forget your hands pressed on my back
Forget the letters that I kept
This is another I won't send
(Just go...)
Forget your lips, your eyes, your thighs
(It's cool because I let you...)
Forget our one last kiss goodbye
(Just go...)
Forget me staking out your house
(Just go...)
That's right I've got you figured out
(Just go...)
Forget your legs around my hips
Forget your hands pressed on my back
(Just go...)
Forget the letters that I kept
This is another I won't send1Embed
