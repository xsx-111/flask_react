Bike Scene Lyrics
I'll leave the lights down low
So she knows I mean business
And maybe we could talk this over
'Cause I could be your best bet
Let alone your worst ex
And let alone your worst...

I wanna hate you so bad
But I can't (but I can't) stop this
Anymore than you can

So honestly, how could you say those things
When you know they don't mean anything
And you know very well
That I can't keep my hands to myself
Hands to myself

I wanna hate you so bad
But I can't (but I can't) stop this
Anymore than you can

This is all wrong and it shows
There's certain things I promised not to let you know
(Like your silly way of keeping me up on the edge of my seat
Like your silly way of keeping me up on the...)
Not to let you know
I never, never...
You've got this silly way
Of keeping me on the edge of my seat
But you're only counting the clock against the train
And I'm miserable
(You've got a silly way of keeping me up on the edge of my seat
You've got a silly way of keeping me up on the...)
And you're just getting started
I'm miserable

You've got me right where you want me
(let's never talk) Let's never talk, let's never
Let's never talk about this again because...
I didn't want it to mean that much to me
I didn't want it to mean that much to me
I didn't want it to mean that much to me
I didn't want it to mean that much to me
Anyway... yeah1Embed
