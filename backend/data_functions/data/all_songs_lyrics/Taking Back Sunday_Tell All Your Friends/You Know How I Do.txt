You Know How I Do LyricsSo sick, so sick of being tired
And oh so tired of being sick
We're both such magnificent liars
So crush me baby, I'm all ears
So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious
I'll give in one more time and feed you stupid lines all about "It's basic"

We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
So sick, so sick of being tired
And oh so tired of being sick
Willing and ready to prove the worst of everything you said about
So obviously desperate, so desperately obvious
So good at setting bad examples
Listen, trick, I've had all I can handle

We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
Think of all the fun you had
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
The finest line divides a night well spent from a waste of time
We won't stand for
Think of all the days you spent alone with just your TV set and I...
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
I can barely smile
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for
The finest line divides a night well spent from a waste of time
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
We won't stand for
Think of all the days you spent alone with just your TV set and I
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
I can barely smile
We won't stand for

Let's go
He's smoked out in the back of the van
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
Says he's held up with holding on and on and on and on and on
He's smoked out in the back of the van
We won't stand for hazy eyes anymore
Says he's held up with holding on and on and on and on and on2Embed
