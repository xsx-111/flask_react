CAROLMART Lyrics
You know, being from Dade County
We do the fly shit naturally, man
We do the stuntin' shit naturally, why?
Huh, 'cause we blendin' in with the environment man, haha
Ayy
FnZ
Oh damn
South Florida might be the most beautifulest place in the land, homie
Look at all these bad bitches
How can you not ride with one in the drop?
How can you not catch a stunt in the most perfectest weather the Earth's got?

I got a pocket full of money and my teeth glitter
It's somethin' 'bout bein' a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh
I'm so fresh

A real-ass nigga from the 305
I was raised off of Trina, Trick, Rick, and Plies
When it comes to that green shit, I am anti
'Cause I'd rather see a man live than a man die
Run down or you run track, oh, that boy cat
Get the gat, make it go brrat, leave that boy flat
All black, make the back block look like Baghdad
Play the track, it's a special way I fold my flag, uh
Pocket full of money and my teeth glitter
Somethin' 'bout bein' a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh
I'm so fresh
I got a pocket full of money and my teeth glitter
It's somethin' 'bout bein' a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh
I'm so fresh

Hear the bass down the block 'cause the trunk keep knockin'
Got them bushid≈ç blades 'cause the rims keep choppin'
UM for the swag to get Miami poppin'
You could smoke a lil' weed long as you ain't flockin'
Put Dade on the map, gotta stay with a strap
Stay away from a roach 'cause they raidin' the trap
I'm the Raiden of rap when they tell that boy, "Finish him"
It's nothin' but fatalities, them crackers gon' sentence 'em, huh

Pocket full of money, and my teeth glitter
Somethin' 'bout bein' a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh
I'm so fresh
I got a pocket full of money, and my teeth glitter
It's somethin' 'bout bein' a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh
I'm so fresh
I got a pocket full of money, and my teeth glitter
It's somethin' 'bout bein' a trill ass nigga
I'm so fresh
I'm so fresh
It depends on if the bitches feel like playin' today
But you know they always with it, Curry, hah
Ayy, I'm out this bitch, man, Yayo5Embed
