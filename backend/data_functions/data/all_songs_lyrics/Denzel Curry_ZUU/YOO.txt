Listen to the nigga talk, just wait

Alright peep, we got to get a few things before we stop by
So, uh, write this shit down for me whenever you get a chance
We need two bottles of Ciroc
Yo
Two bottles Hennessy
Yo
We need a Bailey, uh, for that girl Ashley you used to talk to, but you don't talk to no more
Yo, what's up, my boy?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Listen, listen, my nigga, I don't make the invite list
Go'n on with all that shit, you can bring whoever you want
Good news is lil' baby that you want gon' be there
Yo
Ah, I told you, we got you
Alright
Um, that's all we need for now
Um, how you? You good?"

Yo, yo
Alright, my nigga, we gon' talk

That nigga said one word the whole motherfuckin' time
