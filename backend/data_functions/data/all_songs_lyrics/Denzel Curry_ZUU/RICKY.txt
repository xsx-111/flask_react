RICKY Lyrics
FnZ
Oh, damn

First they mockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave, 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"

I'ma act, one, two, stop the track
Bring it back, what it do?
See, Ricky said, "Never let nobody get the one up on you
If they run up on you, hit 'em with a one, two or a bitch slap
Leave the cul-de-sac, your brothers gon' have your back regardless
And stick with your day one homies that was here before you started
And fear no man but the man above your head"
"Pray before you go to bed," every day my mama said
First they mockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave, 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"
My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"

And your mama ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit
And I been makin' waves way before Nostalgic
That was back in Carol City, yeah, when I was just a jit
With the all-black faded Dickie with the Raider fit
That was it, we was lit, y'all wasn't even shit yet (Yeah, ho)
We was Three 6, Wu-Tang mixed with Dipset
Ricky used to take me to my first shows ever
Would only drop jewels way before they dropped cheddar
First they mockin', now they hoppin'
All on the wave, 'cause they see me poppin'
Big-big-big large pockets, they start flockin'
Here's what I say when they ass keep knockin'

My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"
My daddy said, "Trust no man but your brothers
And never leave your day ones in the gutter"
My daddy said, "Treat young girls like your mother"
My mama said, "Trust no ho, use a rubber"55Embed
