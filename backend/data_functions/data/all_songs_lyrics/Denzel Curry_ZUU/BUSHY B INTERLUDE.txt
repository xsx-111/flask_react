BUSHY B INTERLUDE Lyrics
Poppin' (Poppin'), poppin', poppin' (Poppin'), poppin'
I'm drippin', so faded, I'm drippin', so faded
Poppin' (Poppin'), poppin', poppin' (Poppin'), poppin'
I'm drippin', so faded, I'm drippin', so faded

Now you wanna fuck at the wrong timin'
But you wasn't here when I was grindin'
Now you wanna talk 'cause the boy shinin'
Just because you fine, you don't get the finest
Me gettin' money, what I understood
You was doing nothin', I did what I could
At first, you was saying that I wasn't hood
Since a nigga moved, now I'm Hollywood
Poppin' (Poppin'), poppin' (Poppin')
Pop the bra, she topless (Uh)
And the drop is topless (Uh)
Bands and panties droppin'
Poppin' (Poppin'), poppin' (Poppin')
Pop the bra, she topless (Uh)
And the drop is topless (Uh)
Bands and panties droppin'1Embed
