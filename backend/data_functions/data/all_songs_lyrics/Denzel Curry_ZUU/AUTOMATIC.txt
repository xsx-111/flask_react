AUTOMATIC Lyrics
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Tay Keith, hey

Automatic (Automatic), gotta have it (Gotta have it)
All my niggas runnin' shit like it was Madden (Like it was Madden)
Automatic (Automatic), I gotta have it (I gotta have it)
I just took a nigga bitch 'cause it's a habit ('Cause it's a habit)
Oh, you mad? Now you amped, huh, fade, but you can't, huh
Word around town you a lick like a stamp, huh
You don't wanna go round for round with the champ, huh
Niggas throwin' shade on my light, that's a lamp, huh

Way back then I wasn't fresh, wasn't so clean
I ain't had no dough, I was broke, I had no green (No)
It's my time to blow, now I got me a whole team (Woo)
Don't sleep on me, ho (Yeah, ho), guarantee it'll be a bad dream
I don't wanna go back bein' broke 'cause mama need a crib (Okay)
I got a gold plaque (Yeah), shit I came from dodgin' hollow tips (Ooh)
Used to be on LSD, but now my life is all a trip
Never went to college, at my shows I make a scholarship
P Diddy makin' bands, see 50s in my hands (Mhm)
I remember walking 'round the hood in some holy Vans (Woo)
Step inside the club, you in the line, like, "I know the man"
Way back in the day, you would say that I don't know the man
Automatic (Automatic), gotta have it (Gotta have it)
All my niggas runnin' shit like it was Madden (Like it was Madden)
Automatic (Automatic), I gotta have it (I gotta have it)
I just took a nigga bitch 'cause it's a habit ('Cause it's a habit)
Oh, you mad? Now you amped, huh, fade, but you can't, huh
Word around town you a lick like a stamp, huh
You don't wanna go round for round with the champ, huh
Niggas throwin' shade on my light, that's a lamp, huh

On the road to riches, gotta look out for the serpents (Uh)
Watch 'em slither to the surface when they see your plan is workin' (Uh)
When I started, they deserted
Now they back because I'm earnin' (Uh)
My response, "Where the fuck was you when Tree was CD burnin'?" (Yeah)
You ain't Shane, you ain't Mook (Yeah)
You ain't gang, you ain't crew (Yeah)
See my ways hella strange 'cause I'm raised in the Zuu
We don't bang red or blue (No)
In Zone Four niggas yell, "Woo, woo" (Uh)
All camo to the head, to the shoe
Way back at Z3 when the shots got loose
All I heard when they shootin' out, now I'm movin' out
Use a pen, what I knew about, to make a newer route (Skrr)
See, the gutter was the sewer route, made a new account (Yeah)
All this paper, I can't do without, so give me large amounts
Automatic (Automatic), gotta have it (Gotta have it)
All my niggas runnin' shit like it was Madden (Like it was Madden)
Automatic (Automatic), I gotta have it (I gotta have it)
I just took a nigga bitch 'cause it's a habit ('Cause it's a habit)
Oh, you mad? Now you amped, huh, fade, but you can't, huh
Word around town you a lick like a stamp, huh
You don't wanna go round for round with the champ, huh
Niggas throwin' shade on my light, that's a lamp, huh7Embed
