P.A.T. Lyrics
I'm finna show you fuck niggas how Florida go H.A.M., nigga
Straight like that, fuck nigga
FnZ
Oh damn
Ronny J, please turn me up

Contact, sit out, I’ma hold the fort
All black, sticks out like I'm Voldemort
Lights out, stomped out like Columbus Short
This ain't what you want, better teleport
Instant transmission, have your mans missing, plans thicken
While my bands thicken, have your clan stricken, hands itchin’
That's the trigger finger, uh, now your spirit linger, uh
Get my Stanley Steamer on, sniper with the beamer on

Cut your line like I'm Hercules, leave you in surgery
Beef is a wad of meat, bitch, this ain't Aqua Teen
Fuck a gun, I'ma go whip his ass
Fuck around, have you spinnin' like Taz
All you niggas quick to pick up a strap
Everlast make a nigga take naps
Used to go to sleep, I would hear the blocka, blocka
Think it's fireworks but I assume it's a chopper
Why they hit that man with the boom-shaka-laka?
If he got the scope with the zoom, shotta, shotta
I grew up in a city where most people have no goals
Just cold-blooded niggas in a place that never snow
We’ll rob you for your chain, probably pistol whip your ho
We carry hollow tips ’cause it reflects what's in my soul, damn
Contact, sit out, I’ma hold the fort
All black, sticks out like I'm Voldemort
Lights out, stomped out like Columbus Short
This ain't what you want, better teleport
Instant transmission, have your mans missing, plans thicken
While my bands thicken, have your clan stricken, hands itchin'
That’s the trigger finger, uh, now your spirit linger, uh
Get my Stanley Steamer on, sniper with the beamer on

Blood on my shoes, these ain't red bottoms, headshot 'em
Fly in the night with my bats, Gotham, feds watching
Bitch, I'm from Dade, I do no cappin', no lackin'
Once you get hit, don't know what happened, no flapping
Free Ted, nigga, fuck all my enemies
Fuck nigga run up, catchin' felonies
Get the racks, flip the pack, that's my specialty
Hundred round hit your block, I got seventy
Riot, riot, you don't want no violence
Silence, silence, tell that boy be quiet
Riot, riot, don't make me start a riot
Silence, silence, put that boy in silence
Riot, riot, don't make me start a riot
Silence, silence, put that boy in silence
Oh damn
Ronny J, please turn me up
Blackland, nigga, 66.-motherfuckin'-69Embed
