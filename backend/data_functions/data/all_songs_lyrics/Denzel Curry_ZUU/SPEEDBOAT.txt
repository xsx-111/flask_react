SPEEDBOAT Lyrics
I went from stickin' pennies in the jar to offshore bank accounts
See me and my conglomerates is lucrative
I'm talkin' big money, big chains, big guns, nigga
More power

Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24
Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24

Put a red beam to your head like Arby's
Either go to school, go to jail or the army
Keep a close eye on the things tryna harm me
Warn me if anybody try to swarm me, uh
Invest in the rock and a Rottweiler
Pile up hella stacks when the bills pile up
Dollar is the only way to get the style up
Riled up, catchin' motherfuckers usin' dial-up
My dawg is gone and the result is to have my teflon
Christian Dior and the fashion beyond
Talkin' Polo, call me Polow da Don
Throw some D's on the donk
I got hella keys and the funk
I put hella Gs in the vault
It took only three to assault, damn
Jesus, please deliver us from evil
Please pray over all my people
What you see in life's illegal
I don't wanna use my Desert Eagle

Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24
Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24

Pourin' out scotch
Gas, all in my brain, it fumigated my thoughts
Thinking 'bout intricate plots
To get out the hood, that's when I started to jot
Not givin' the opportunity to let the devil ruin me, no
Even though the jewelry froze, ice cubes get Deeboed
Word on the street, everything heat
Everything hot boy, Texas Pete
Pulled up in a Lexus and a Jeep
All black, no tag, time for the sweep
Too many guns, too many sons
Lost in the river of blood in these streets
Master of none, pastors and nuns
Let's bow our heads for the ceremony
Jesus, please deliver us from evil
Please pray over all my people
What you see in life's illegal
I don't wanna use my desert eagle

Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24
Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24

Fo', fo', fo', fo'
Fo', fo', fo', fo'
