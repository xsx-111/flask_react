ZUU Lyrics
305, we in the house

M's all on my belt, I'm feelin' like I'm Majin Buu
Pocket full of ivy and you know the faces blue
Shoe game sick as fuck, it's like I'm walkin' on the flu
Carol City, nigga, boy, I'm comin' out the
Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, we comin' out the Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, we comin' out the Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, we comin' out the Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, I'm comin' out the...

Rep your set, grab a TEC
Leave you wet in project
In the cut like Gillette
Where they serve and don't protect
Place a bet on your head
Call your bluff and make a check
Guilty until innocent
Far as I know, I'm heaven-sent
Glock, nine by nine, blow your mind, now you Einstein
Design, in my prime, to do time, bitch, I'm Frankenstein
This what you made me, Carol City raised me
Trick said "I'm a Thug," that's the hate you gave me (Ooh)
M's all on my belt, I'm feelin' like I'm Majin Buu
Pocket full of ivy and you know the faces blue
Shoe game sick as fuck, it's like I'm walkin' on the flu
Carol City, nigga, boy, I'm comin' out the
Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, we comin' out the Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, we comin' out the Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, we comin' out the Zuu, Zuu, Zuu
Boy, I'm comin' out the Zuu

Oh damn
Ayy, yo, Rick, man
What's good, man? What's happenin', man?
I ain't seen you in a minute
What's goin' on?
Nah, holmes, it's Mr. Rick
We don't kick it like that, fool
We don't hang at the club together, dawg
It's Mr. Rick12Embed
