San Geronimo LyricsSomewhere up fifteen miles
Sifting through crackling vinyl
Lost memories of my youth
Are coming into view
Between lost hills divide
Quietly we sleep inside
Lost summers of my youth
I spent them all with you
Take ways by withered creeks
Lizards sunning in the streets
Small kitten stretches through
Green empty yards you knew
Weekend in san geronimo
Love how the starlit skies show
Weekend in san geronimo
Sentiment within me glows
Somewhere up fifteen miles
Barefoot on kitchen tile
Where nights are warm and true
I'll spend them all with you
Weekend in san geronimo
Love how the starlit skies show
Weekend in san geronimo
Sentiment within me glowsEmbed
