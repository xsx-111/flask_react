Moments LyricsGently in these ragged folds
Curled up and warm like Easter's child
A breath so faint
Angelic weight
I can't deny
That I drift sometimes
Even in these loving moments
To summery fields I call my own
Where I can lie and in them feel
At one with my death
With limbs outstretched
I can't deny
That I'm weak sometimes
Even in my strongest moments
And the way you cry at me
I don't know why
You stay1Embed
