Shadows LyricsCoarse and white coat of your skin
Blends with the state you're in
And the redness of your eyes
Against a sun that clouds blind

You ain't saying nothing, that I don't already know
When you say "Love's dimming light, won't shine on tomorrow"
You ain't saying nothing, that I don't already know
When you say "Love's dimming light, won't shine on tomorrow"
Chalk white apartment walls
Surfaces my every flaw
And the naked instill in here
Brings surreal life
Into clear

You ain't doing nothing, that I don't already know
When you hide your sorry head in pillows
And you ain't doing nothing, that I don't already know
When you hide your sorry head in
When you hide your sorry head in pillows

Fake a strange sort of grin
It matches the shape you're in
And accept any lies or truth
After the long year that we've been through

And you ain't saying nothing, that I don't already know
When you say "Life takes turns like fiery shadows"
And you ain't saying nothing that I don't already know
When you say "Life takes turns like fiery..."
When you say "Life takes turns like fiery shadows"Embed
