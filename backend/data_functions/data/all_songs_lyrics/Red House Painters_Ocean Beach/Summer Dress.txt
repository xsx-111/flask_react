Summer Dress LyricsSummer dress makes you more beautiful than the rest
Loveliest girl that I know, and the sweetest
Spends her life inside, she thinks she isn't blessed
Summer dress separates you from the rest
Easiest days of her life have been spent
Wonders if she is loved, if she is missed
Says a prayer as she's kissed by ocean mist
Takes herself to the sand and dreams
Says a prayer as she's kissed by ocean mist
Takes herself to the sand and dreamsEmbed
