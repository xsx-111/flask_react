Without Me Lyrics
Will she love me again tomorrow
I don't know, don't think so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me

Will she find love again tomorrow
I don't know, I hope so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

Without me
Without me
Without me
