A Heart Like Hers Lyrics
Done, done is all the love, love that I had saved for you
Gone, gone with my heart, locked inside a cage for you
And what's this that has become, has become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a  heart like hers again
Never believe

All, all that I could give, all I had to offer her
Is gone, simply locked away, no longer there to bother her
Now look, look at what's become, what's become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a  heart like hers again
Never believe
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
