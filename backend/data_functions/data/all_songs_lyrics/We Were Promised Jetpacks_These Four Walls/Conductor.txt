Conductor Lyrics
Just a come back, another come back
Far too orchestrated, far too calculated
A conductor, just a conductor
Pointin' at me and hearin' me speak

'Cause I'm a conductor, a simple conductor
With electricity just pouring through me
You're a habit, another bad habit
Keep biting my nails in case all else fails for us

'Cause you are a fine wine, another fine, fine wine
Pointin' at me and hearin' me speak
You're a conductor, a simple conductor
With electricity just pouring through me

Woah, woah

Like electricity, you keep pouring through me
Like electricity, you keep pouring through me
Like electricity, you keep pouring through me
Like electricity, you keep pouring through meEmbed
