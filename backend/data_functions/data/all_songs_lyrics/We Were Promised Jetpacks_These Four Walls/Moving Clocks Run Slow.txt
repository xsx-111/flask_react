Moving Clocks Run Slow Lyrics
Moving clocks run so slow
I can't take my eyes off you
There's too many hands to keep my eyes on
Looking towards the light
I look a little tongue-tied
I sound a little cross-eyed

Fast approaching midnight
We're locked out
We're fast approaching midnight
So, you know you take a little me
And I take a little you
We're all part of the century

Hold me down now, hold me down
A bitter disappointment
And I was restless, I was restless
You're winning me over, you're winning me over
Can't take my eyes off you
There's too many hands to keep my eye on

Fast approaching midnight
We're locked out
We're fast approaching midnight (woah)
So, you know you take a little me
And I take a little you
We're all part of the centuryEmbed
