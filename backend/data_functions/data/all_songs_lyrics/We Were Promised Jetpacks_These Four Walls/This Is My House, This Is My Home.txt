This Is My House, This Is My Home Lyrics
Woke when it was dark
Wait for day to start before you leave
Turned on both the lights
What we found we didn't like so we turned our back

Oh no you found me
Oh no you found me, here

Something's happened in the attic
There's no way I am going up there
Something's happened in the attic
We both know I'm not going up there

Oh no they found me
Oh no they found me, here

Something's happened in the attic
There's no way I am going up there
Something's happened in the attic
We both know I'm not going up there
Something's happened in the attic
This is my house, this is my homeEmbed
