Keeping Warm Lyrics
The chances of being born are so slim
So keep warm, so keep warm
And take some heart at being born at quite so young
You can learn to talk, and learn to walk in your own time
You're so young...

So take heart in being born
Making plans that you can't keep, that you've outgrown
You've taken this too far now take me home
There's nothing to eat and there's nowhere to sleep in these four walls
You're so young...

The chances of being born are so slim
So keep warm, so keep warm
And take some heart at being born at quite so young
You can learn to talk and learn to walk in your own time
You're so young...2Embed
