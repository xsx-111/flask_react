An Almighty Thud Lyrics
I lost my crown
When it hit the ground
With an almighty thud
I went to pick it up
But revealed my weaknesses to the crowd

And I lost my home
When I lost my throne
To a successor
With far more expansive plans
Than I ever did
I abdicated

You're the last thing I want
I'd love to stay here
You're the last thing I want
I'd love to live here

I sat in my castle
And I waited on news
From one final battle
That we couldn't afford to lose
And I whispered suddenly
My greatest fears to anyone that would hear me
I'm going to stay hereEmbed
