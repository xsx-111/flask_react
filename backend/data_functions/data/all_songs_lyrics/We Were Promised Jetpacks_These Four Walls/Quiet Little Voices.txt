Quiet Little Voices Lyrics
Quiet little voices creep into my head
I'm young again, I'm young again, I'm young again
I'm young again
Quiet little monsters creep into my bedroom wall
I'll fall for you, I'll fall for you
I'll fall for you

Quiet words of wisdom creep into your victim's ears
I'll die for you, I'll die for you, I'll die for you
In any which direction, call me
I will run for you, I'll come for you
I'll die for you, I'll come for you

Quiet little voices creep into my head
I'm young again, I'm young again, I'm young again
I'm young again
Quiet little monsters creep into my head
I'll fall for you, I'll fall for you, I'll fall for you
I'll fall

Quiet little voices
Quiet little voi-
Quiet little monsters
Quiet little mo-
Quiet little voices
Quiet little voi-
Quiet little monsters
Quiet little mo-
I'd better start now
I'd better start
Quiet little voices
Quiet little voi-
Quiet little monsters
Quiet little mo2Embed
