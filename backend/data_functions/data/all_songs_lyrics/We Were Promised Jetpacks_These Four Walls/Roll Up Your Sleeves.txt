Roll Up Your Sleeves Lyrics
Roll up your sleeves
We're headin' for winter I know
The nights will get colder
And I'll make my bed
Make sure I'm all fed and asleep
And wake when we're older
It's slower
But I can wait this out
Forming an orderly queue
Outside your house

Roll
Up your sleeves for winter
And I can wait 'till summer
When you're warmer

Roll up your sleeves
We're headin' for winter I know
The nights will get colder
And I'll make my bed
Make sure I'm all fed and asleep
And wake when we're older
It's slower
But I can wait this out
Forming an orderly queue
Outside your house
I'm not even kidding

Roll
Up your sleeves for winter
And I can wait till summer
When you're warmer
Roll
Up your sleeves for winter
And I can wait till summer
When you're warmer

Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm
Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm
Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm
Keep warm
Keep warm1Embed
