Short Bursts Lyrics
You looked at me
My blood went cold
You said come on
Who cares, be bold
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

You looked at me
My lips went dry
You said come on
Who cares, we'll die
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

You looked at me
My blood turned red
You said come on
Who cares, you'll be dead
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

So come on in
You're looking rough
You're telling me you've had it tough
So take your hands
So take your hands off my chest
Sit back, sit back
Loosen your ties
Loosen your knots
Sit back, sit back
Loosen your neck
And fill your lungs
Sit back, sit back
Loosen your ties
Loosen your knots
Sit back, sit back
Loosen your neck
And fill your lungs
Sit back, sit back
Loosen your tongue
And loosen your lips
Sit back, sit back
Loosen your tongue
And loosen those lips

Your silence is bearable
But only in short bursts
And then it becomes uncomfortable
Your silence is bearable
But only in short bursts
And then it becomes uncomfortable
You looked at me
My blood went cold
You said come on
Who cares, be bold
We'll leave before our blood will hit the floor

And we'll teach you to dieEmbed
