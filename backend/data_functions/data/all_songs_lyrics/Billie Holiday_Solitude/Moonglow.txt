Moonglow LyricsIt must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you saying
"Dear one, hold me fast"
And I start in praying
Oh lord, please let this last
We seemed to float right thru the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I always remember that moonglow gave me you
It must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you
I still hear you saying
"Dear one, hold me fast"
And I started in praying
Oh lord, please let this last
We seemed to float right thru the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I always remember that moonglow gave me youEmbed
