Blue Moon LyricsBlue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
