East of the Sun (West of the Moon) LyricsEast of the sun
And west of the moon
We'll build a dream house
Of love, dear;
Near to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night;
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Living on love and pale moonlight
Just you and I, forever and a day;
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely, too
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun and west of the moon
Just you and I, forever and a day;
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way
Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely, too
East of the sun, and west of the moon, dear
East of the sun, and west of the moonEmbed
