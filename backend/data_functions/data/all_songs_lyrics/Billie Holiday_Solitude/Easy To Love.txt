Easy To Love Lyrics
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me 'cause you'd be, oh
So easy to love

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me 'cause you'd be, oh
So easy to loveEmbed
