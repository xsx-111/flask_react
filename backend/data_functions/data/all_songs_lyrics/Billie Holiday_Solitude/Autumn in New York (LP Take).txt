Autumn in New York (LP Take) LyricsAutumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel
I'm home
It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands
May sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
Autumn in New York
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you're let down
Jaded roues and gay divorcees
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's
Divine
It's autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York
You'll need no castle in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it againEmbed
