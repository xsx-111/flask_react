If the Moon Turns Green LyricsIf the moon turns green
And shadows get up and walk around
Clouds come tumbling to the ground: I wouldn't be surprised
As didn't you fall in love with me?
If the stars turn blue
And willows that weep began to sing
Winter changes into spring: I wouldn't raise my eyes
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me?
I thought I was foolish to think of romance
With someone as charming as you
I thought I was hoping without any chance
Then every hope came true
If the moon turns green
And rivers began to flow upstream
This is all a crazy dream: I wouldn't be surprised
Anything can happen
If you can fall in love with me
I thought I was foolish to think of romance
With someone as charming as you
I thought I was hoping without any chance
Then every hope came true
If the moon turns green
And rivers began to flow upstream
This is all a crazy dream: I wouldn't be surprised
'Cause anything can happen
If you can fall in love with meEmbed
