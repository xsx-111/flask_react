Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home Lyrics'Cause this music can put a human being in a trance like state and deprive it for the sneaking feeling of existing
'Cause music is bigger than words and wider than pictures
If someone said that Mogwai are the stars, I would not object
If the stars had a sound, it would sound like this
The punishment for these solemn words can be hard
Can blood boil like this at the sound of a noisy tape that I've heard?
I know one thing
On Saturday, the sky will crumble together or something, with a huge bang to fit into the cave


What? start speaking now?
When I shag a bird you'd think Antarctica had defrosted on her bed
Sometimes when I'm puffing hash I get a bird to suck my dong
Often when I don't clean my knob I get my sister to lick the cheese off my helmet
Everytime I put my arse off I smell shite all day
Once I was eating and I had to shoot my spunkhole so show us your head you slag!
I used to run about, you wee guys know that but I never touch him right?!Embed
