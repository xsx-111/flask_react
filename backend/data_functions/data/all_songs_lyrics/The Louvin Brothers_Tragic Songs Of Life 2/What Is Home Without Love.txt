What Is Home Without Love LyricsSad and alone in a mansion
No loving wife to caress
Said a man sad and lonely
No loving wife's lips to kiss
She married him for possession
No love in her heart had she
Sad and alone, in his fine home
He looked all around him and said
What is home without a baby?
To love and to tease and adore?
What is home without a sweet wife?
To kiss you each night at the door?
What is a home without sunshine?
To spread its bright rays from above?
You can have wealth and its pleasures
But what is a home without love?
Walking down the streets one evening
He passed by a cottage so neat
Stopped and looked in the window
He saw there a picture so sweet
A husband, a wife, and a baby
They were hugging and kissing too
He turned aside, his tears to hide
And from his lips came these words
What is home without a baby?
To love and to tease and adore?
What is home without a sweet wife?
To kiss you each night at the door?
What is a home without sunshine?
To spread its bright rays from above?
You can have wealth and its pleasures
But what is a home without love?Embed
