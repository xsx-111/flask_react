A Tiny Broken Heart LyricsHe was just a little farm lad so busy at play
In his little play house down by the gate
He stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door
At the home of his tiny playmate
Then he saw his Daddy watching too
As the man swiftly walked to the cottage door
He knew they were strangers that came from the town
Men he had never seen before
They soon were at their work and he heard his Daddy say
Our neighbors are moving today
Oh no he cried dear God don't let it be
They can't take my sweetheart away
I know Dad that you don't understand
How a heart so young could conceive a plan
I'm only seven now but it's just like you said
Daddy someday I'll be a man
The man who owns the farm where your playmate now lives
He told me it had to be this way
For winter time has come and their work is all done
So now they are moving away
Let us buy the farm so they can stay
Give them all my toys that dear Santy gave
And give him the pennies in my little piggy bank
Pennies that my darling helped me save1Embed
