Let Her Go, God Bless Her Lyrics
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
She's mine everywhere she may be
She may ramble this wide world all over
But she'll never find a friend like me
I went to church last Sunday
I saw my old true love there
And I knew her mind was a'changin'
From the way that she done up her hair

I'm going to the races
To see my pony run
And if I win any green back
We're sure gonna have some fun

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
But sometimes
I take a good notion
To jump in the river and drown
