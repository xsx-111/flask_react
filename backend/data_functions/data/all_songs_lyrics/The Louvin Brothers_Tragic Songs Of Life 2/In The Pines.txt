In The Pines LyricsIn the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Little girl, little girl, what have I done
Thats made you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
The longest train I ever saw
Was 19 coaches long
The only girl I ever loved
Is on that train and gone
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blowsEmbed
