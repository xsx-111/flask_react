Ronnie Talk to Russia Lyrics
Ronnie talk to Russia, before its too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Ronnie talk to Russia before its too late
Before they blow up the world

You go to the zoo, but you can't feed guerrillas
Can't feed guerrillas
Left-wing guerrillas
You can go to the zoo, but you can't feed guerrillas
Who want to blow up the world

Ronnie if you're dead, before I get to meet you
Before I get to meet you
Before I get to meet you
Ronnie if you're dead, before I get to meet you
Don't say I didn't warn you
Ronnie talk to Russia, before its too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Ronnie talk to Russia before its too late
Before they blow up the world
Don't you blow up my world1Embed
