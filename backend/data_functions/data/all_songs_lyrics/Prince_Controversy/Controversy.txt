Controversy Lyrics
I just can't believe all the things people say
Controversy
Am I black or white? Am I straight or gay?
Controversy
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me?
Yeah, uh, uh, controversy
Controversy
Controversy
I can't understand human curiosity
Controversy
Was it good for you? Was I what you wanted me to be? Controversy
Do you get high? Does your daddy cry?
Uh, uh, controversy
Controversy, controversy

Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? (Yeah, ooh yeah)
Some people wanna die so they can be free
I said life is just a game, we're all just the same (Do you wanna play?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Controversy, ooh yeah controversy, controversy
Controversy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Controversy, controversy
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever

Controversy, controversy, controversy
Love him, love him baby
Controversy, controversy, controversy
Oh, yeah, yeah, controversy
Everybody, controversy, oh yeah

I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules
People call me rude, I wish we all were nude
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules
People call me rude, I wish we all were nude
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules (Yeah)
