Sexuality Lyrics
Stand up everybody, this is your life
Let me take you to another world, let me take you tonight
You don't need no money, you don't need no clothes
The Second Coming, anything goes

Sexuality is all you'll ever need
Sexuality, let your body be free

Come on everybody, yeah, this is your life
I'm talking about a revolution we got to organize
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
New age revelation, I think we got a case

I'm OK as long as you are here with me
Sexuality is all we ever need
Oh baby

Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Everybody
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
One time say
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
We live in a world overrun by tourists
Tourists, 89 flowers on their back
Inventors of the Accu-jack
They look at life through a pocket camera
What? No flash again?
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are you listening?
We need a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight, and bleed
No child is bad from the beginning
They only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol, and US history
What's to be expected is 3 minus 3
Absolutely nothing

Stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
I want to be in the new breed, stand up, organize

Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm going to let my body be free
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm going to let my body be free
