Do Me, Baby Lyrics
Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around
Take me baby, kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of

Do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Come on and do me, baby
Like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait, oh

Here we are looking for a reason
You to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season
So baby please stop teasing me
(Ooh) What you do, I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad
So...
Do me, baby
Like you never done before
(No, no)
Ooh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Come on, do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oooh, I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait
I said

Do, do, do, do me, baby
(Do me, baby)
Yeah
Do me baby all night long
(Oooh, give it to me)
Oh, oh, oh
Do me, baby
I want you now
Oooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Do me, baby
Oh give it to me
(Do me, baby)
Do me, baby, don't want to do it all alone
I want your love
Yeah
Do me, baby
Oooh, give it to me
(Do me, baby)
This feeling is too strong, make me wait too long
(I want you now)
Baby, you're leaving me no choice
Okay, what are you going to do, you just going to sit there and watch?
Alright
Are you sure you don't want to close your eyes?
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not going to stop until the war is over
Help me
There okay, okay
I'm so cold, just hold me3Embed
