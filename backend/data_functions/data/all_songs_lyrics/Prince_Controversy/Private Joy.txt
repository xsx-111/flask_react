Private Joy Lyrics
My little secret, my private joy
I could never let another play with my toy
My little angel from heaven above
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I think I'm falling in love

And I ain't going to tell nobody, nobody about my little pretty toy
All the other kids would love to love you but you're my little private joy
My private joy, you're my private joy
Private joy, such a pretty toy
Joy, you are my private joy

You're my little lover, Orgasmatron
Only I know, only I know, baby, what turns you on
You're my little secret neon light
Girl I want to turn it on, turn it on, turn it on every night

And I ain't going to tell nobody, nobody about my little pretty toy
All the other kids would love to love you but you're my little private joy
My private joy, you're my private joy
Private joy, such a pretty toy
Joy, you are my private joy
Shoot me up baby, let's take a trip
I can't get enough can't get enough of your private, private joy, joy
Joy, such a such a pretty toy
Joy, you are my private joy
Joy, shoot me up baby, let's take a trip
Joy, can't get enough of your private
Joy, come on honey baby get up, get up

I strangled Valentino (He strangled Valentino)
Been mine ever since (Been his ever since)
If anybody asks you (If anybody asks you)
You belong to Prince (You belong to Prince)
Come on baby, get up, get up, get up, get up1Embed
