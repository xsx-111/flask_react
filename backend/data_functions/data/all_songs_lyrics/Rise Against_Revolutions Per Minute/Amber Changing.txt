Amber Changing Lyrics
Information kept to myself and everyone wants to know
I trust the words of no one else cause I've been there before
Your voice is wasted
Cause I'm not listening
The calloused fingers are wrapped around a black ball-point pen
These eyes don't wander as far as they at one time did
I've seen the future
It's fading faster

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now

I'm on the other end begging you
Pick up the phone
A shaking whisper is answering
Don't call anymore your voice is wasted
Cause I'm not listening
Freeze me in this moment
Thaw me in ten years
When the fires burned out and the smoke

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now
Let's just pretend
Let's just pretend
Tonight will never end
Let's just pretend
Let's just pretend
Tonight will never end

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right nowEmbed
