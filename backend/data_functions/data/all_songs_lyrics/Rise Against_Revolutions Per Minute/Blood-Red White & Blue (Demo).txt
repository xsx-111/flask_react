Blood-Red White & Blue (Demo) LyricsSo come test me, so come break me
So come on intoxicate me
With hands tied behind my back I fight
And wait for you to strike
A new problem we cannot stop them
We're outnumbered and uncautioned
A rally cry rings out into the night
So pride yourself on what you are
And hold them all to words they can't take back
I've seen a place (it comes) to me in dreams
Where fires die but light still shines for us to see
What did you have to say?
Give me your logic, your definition
The words you twist to justify your position
Of mass starvation and blind airstrikes
Every problem is solved with a fight
Peace won't be found
Till we're underground
As long as we live without a sound
So pride yourself on what you are
And hold them all to words they can't take back
I've seen a place (it comes) to me in dreams
Where fires die but light still shines for us to see
Would God bless a murder of the innocents?
Would God bless a war based on pride?
Would God bless a money-hungry government? Noooo!
Would God bless our ineffective court system?
God bless the sweatshops we run
God bless America?
God bless America? (Noooo)Embed
