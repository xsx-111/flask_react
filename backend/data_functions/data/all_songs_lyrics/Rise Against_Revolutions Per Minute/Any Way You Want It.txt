Any Way You Want It Lyrics
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

She loves to dance
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the lovin' things

All night
All night
Oh every night
So hold tight
Hold tight
Oh baby hold tight

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Then we touched
And we sang
About the lovin' things

All night
All night
Oh every night
So hold tight
Hold tight
Oh baby hold tight

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said hold
Hold on
Hold on
Hold
Oh baby hold tight

Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh every night

And she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh oh oh oh

She said, any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
About the lovin' things
She said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh, every night
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh, baby hold tight
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh, every nightEmbed
