Halfway There (Demo) LyricsIs this the point where we give up?
Now is this the point where we give in?
Now is this the point where we turn ourselves in?
Or is this the time to ask questions?
Or is this the time to seek answers?
Now is this the time to throw it all in?
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
You're halfway there
That's when you know that you're halfway there
This is the point where we stand up
Now this is the point where we take back
The things that are keeping us from being free
So when enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
When enough is enough that's when you know that you're halfway there
Your voice the airwaves sent you prayed my life would end
The wasted time I spent ashamed I called you friend
Give me one reason, I need a reason
Give me one reason, I need a reason, one reasonEmbed
