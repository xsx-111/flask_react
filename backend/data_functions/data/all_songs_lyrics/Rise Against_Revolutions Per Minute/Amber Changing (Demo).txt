Amber Changing (Demo) LyricsInformation kept to myself and everybody wants to know
I trust the words of no one else cause I've been there before
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening
These callused fingers are wrapped around a black ball-point pen
These eyes don't wander as far as they at one time did
I've seen the future, it's fading faster
No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now
I'm on the other end begging you, pick up the phone
A shaking whisper is answering, don't call anymore
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening
Freeze me in this moment
Thaw me in ten years, (thaw me in ten years)
When the fire's burned out and the smoke (clears)
No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now
Let's just pretend
Let's just pretend
Let's just pretend, let's just pretend
Tonight will never end
Let's just pretend, let's just pretend
Tonight will never end
No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
No time that I'd rather be than right here, right now1Embed
