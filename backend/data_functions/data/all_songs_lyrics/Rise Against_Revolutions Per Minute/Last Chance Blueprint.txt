Last Chance Blueprint Lyrics
Late nights and bloodshot eyes
Clock ticking half past five
We're barely breathing but we're still alive GO
Our plans are all laid out
Take all these unmarked roads
We blaze the trails to places no one goes
Yeah

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
One last chance to go
Let's take it now in for the kill

If in time we find ourselves
Back where we started from
Too weak to fight and much too tired to run
Before you swallow me into your perfect life
I'm not going out without a fight
Yeah

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
One last chance to go
Let's take it now in for the kill
But this blueprints faded grey and here it seems like just yesterday
When we mapped out the details of our great escape
But still these roads all beckon me to uncover their mystery
But I fall like dead autumn leaves and let the jet-stream carry me

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
One last chance to go
Let's take it now in for the killEmbed
