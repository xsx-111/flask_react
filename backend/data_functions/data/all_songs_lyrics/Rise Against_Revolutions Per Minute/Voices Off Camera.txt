Voices Off Camera Lyrics
Can you hear the desperate cries that are calling out your name?
Twisting your arms, holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve
Do you feel this underlying sense of urgency or are you as blind as me?

I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere now

I can't bear the thought of losing
I dread the attention winning brings
And ever since the day I came here
I can stand without your strings
I'm so sick of all these people
But I'm scared to be alone
And if this life has taught me anything
I forgot it long ago and so I

I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

The heart is something you can't control
We either choose to follow or be left on our own
So we're leaving here on a less-traveled road
As desperate cries grow louder, I know we're getting close, getting close
I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes4Embed
