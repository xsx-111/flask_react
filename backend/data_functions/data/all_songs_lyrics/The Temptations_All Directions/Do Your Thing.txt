Do Your Thing LyricsIf the music makes you move
'Cause you can't get the groove, then groove on
If you feel like you wanna make love
Under the stars above, then love on girl
Then love on
If it something that you wanna say
And talking is the only way, then rap on
Brother, then rap on
But whatever you wanna do
Oh, you gotta do your thing, yeah, yeah
(Do your thing, do your thing, do your thing)
Do your thing
If you feel like you wanna scream
'Cause that's your way of letting all speak
Scream on, scream on
If you feel like you wanna sing
'Cause singing is your only thing
Sing on, sing on
If you wanna make love all night
And you feel it's right
Ride on, ride on
Oo, 'cause whatever you wanna do
Oh, you gotta do your thing, thing, thing, thing, yeah, yeah
(Do your thing, do your thing)
Do it right, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Do your thing (well do you)
Do it right (oh, do it right, yeah) hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Do your thing
Do it right, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Do your thing (yeah, yeah)
Do it right, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Do your thing (ay, ay)
Do it right (oh, do it, yeah) hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Do your thing (can you do it, can you do it, can you do it?)Embed
