Run Charlie Run Lyrics
Run, Charlie , run
Look, the niggers are coming
Uh, the niggers is coming?!
Run, Charlie , run
Look, the niggers are coming
The niggers is coming?!

I watch you go to church on Sunday
But you forget all you learned on Monday
Well, you see your smiling face can't hide
Well well well, how you hate your brother inside
So I'ma telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers is coming!
(The niggers is coming?!)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

But the greatest wrong you know you've done
Is to pass this sickness onto your son
Your one and only boy
He came into this world with a mind so clean
You took it, molded it, and made it mean
So I'ma telling you
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!
(Don't stop, don't stop now)
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

You built this great big beautiful city
But you ran away and left it to die - oh, what a pity
You could have made friends with your neighbors, yeah
But you are much too prejudiced to try; tell me why

Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

Oh, don't try to leave what's part of you
'Cause it can't be done, yes, that is true
So God bless the hand that's calling you back, brother, well well
Whether it's gonna be red or black, oh
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers is coming!
The niggers is coming?!
Run, Charlie, run
Look! The niggers are coming!
The niggers is coming?!

Run, Charlie, run
Well, now, you better keep on running, Charlie
Run, Charlie, run
Run on, run on now
Run, Charlie, run
Well well, you better keep on running, well
Run, Charlie, run
Run run run run, try again, y'all
Run, Charlie, run
Hey hey hey, you better keep on running
Run, Charlie, runEmbed
