Mother Nature LyricsMother Nature
Go on and take your course
And a-take me with you
Hey, I wanna leave here, oh oh
Mother Nature
Take the chains off me (please)
As long as I'm livin', livin'
Hey, I wanna be free, hey
Come on and let your sweet wine
Rush to my head
And make me feel fine
Let me stand naked in the sun
Hiding from no one
Hey, hey, hey
Mother Nature
Come on and do your thing
(I'm begging you, Mother)
I want to start feeling, hey
All those good things you can bring
Hey, hey
Oh oh, day in, day out, 9 to 5
Leaves me half alive
And I'm going nowhere
I can't live in this classic world
It's killing me
Can't you see
You're the only one to turn to
Mother Nature
Go on and take your course
But take me with you, with you
Hey, I wanna leave here
Mother Nature, I wanna leave here
Oh, MotherEmbed
