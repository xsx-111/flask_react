Love Woke Me Up This Morning LyricsLove woke me up this morning feelin' fine
I had you on my mind, oh oh
Love woke me up this morning
And I haven't had a heartache today
All my little tears are gone away
Skies are blue because I have you, I love you
Love woke me up this morning, oh yes indeed
Thinkin' of last night
You know, you made me feel all right, oh
Love woke me up this morning
I'm so glad, yes I am
Because of you, happiness is mine
All my cloudy days are all behind
Baby, every place I see your face
And now I smile, you made my life worthwhile
Yes you did
I haven't had a heartache today
And all my little tears are gone away
Happiness is really mine
And all my cloudy days are all behindEmbed
