There She Goes Lyrics
There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain

And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
Pulsing through my vein

And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name, pulls my chain
No one else could heal my pain

And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane

And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
There she goes
There she goes again
There she goes
There she goes again8Embed
