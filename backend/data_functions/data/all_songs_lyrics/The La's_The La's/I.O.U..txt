I.O.U. LyricsEveryday there's always
Much to pay, the law says
I owe you, you owe me
I know you can stand on your own two feet
On the street for knowledge
You must eat your porridge
I'll feed you, you'll feed me
I'll see you can stand on your own two feet
I owe you, you owe me
I know you can stand on your own two feet
On the farm
Linking you arm in arm
There's no harm in
Greasing your neighbour's palm
On the street for knowledge
You must eat your porridge
I owe you, you owe me
I know you can stand on your own two feetEmbed
