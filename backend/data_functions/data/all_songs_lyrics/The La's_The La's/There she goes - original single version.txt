There she goes - original single version LyricsThere she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she blows
There she blows again
Pulsing through my veins
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes again
(There she goes again)
Racing through my brain
(There she goes)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
She pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
(She calls my name)
There she goes again
(She calls my name)
Chasing down my lane
(She calls my name)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Pulsing through my veins
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes again
(There she goes again)
Racing through my brain
(There she goes)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
She pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
(She calls my name)
There she goes again
(She calls my name)
Chasing down my lane
(She calls my name)
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goes
(There she goes again)
There she goesEmbed
