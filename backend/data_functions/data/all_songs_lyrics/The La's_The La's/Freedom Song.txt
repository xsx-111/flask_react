Freedom Song LyricsAll this world seems bent upon
Contemplating Babylon
Fate is sealed inside a bomb
Where has all the freedom gone
There's a place for everyone
Live and die our Kingdom Come
But until the web is spun
Everybody must have fun
I'm not scared to die -- God help me
We went to the same school's and we
All learned the same rules of lament
The knot will never come undone
Accidents show mercy none
There isn't anywhere to run
The masterpiece is done
The war has won
There's a place for everyone
Live and die our Kingdom Come
But until the web is spun
Everybody must have funEmbed
