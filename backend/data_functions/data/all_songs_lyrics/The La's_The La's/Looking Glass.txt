Looking Glass LyricsTell me where I'm going...
Tell me where I'm bound...
Turn the pages over
Turn the world around
Open up the broken door for all lost to be found
Walk into the empty room but never make a sound
Oh tell me where I'm going
Tell me why I'm bound to tear the pages open
Turn the world around...
I've seen everybody
Everybody's seen me
In the lookin' glass I'm in everybody
Everybody's in me
In the stone is cast --
The glass is smashed
The past -- it never says it
It never makes a sound
Whispered ways were chosen
Echoes will be found
Mirrors that were broken
Lay there on the ground
Though the way lies open
Will the way be found
Oh tell me where I'm going and
Tell me why I'm bound to tear the pages open
Turn the world around...
So the story goes it
Everybody knows it
Look into the past
We can't live without it
We can't live within it
Everything must pass
The change is cast...
I've seen everybody
Everybody's seen me
In the looking glass
I'm in everybody
Everybody's in me
In the stone is cast --
The glass is smashedEmbed
