Clean Prophet LyricsWild eyes realise this eager dream to prophesise
Everybody’s got a dream show them what you mean
Dramatise underline the route to perfect paradise
And with a missionary zeal you will make it real
The time has come to kneel
Take me, take me, take me by the hand I cannot see
Shake me, shake me, shake me wake me up and set me free
Tired eyes don’t despise I give you all I idolise
I’ll show you everything you've seen
Can’t promise happiness you see
To me it’s all a dreamEmbed
