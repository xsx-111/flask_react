Liberty Ship LyricsI am the toiler the old ship-slave
I stoke that fire that keeps you brave
And this I give for all mankind
Sail away on an ocean wave
I am the voyager of the ocean grey
I wayfarer see fairway
And this I gave for all mankind
Sail away on an ocean wave
I am the sailor â€“ the ocean slave
Fill your sail with the breath I gave
And this I gave for all mankind
Sail away on an ocean wave
I am the captain of the love brigade
With every breath I am your slave
And this I gave for all mankind
Sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on the airwaves...
Sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on the airwaves...
Sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on the airwaves...
Sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on an ocean wave
...sail away on the airwaves...Embed
