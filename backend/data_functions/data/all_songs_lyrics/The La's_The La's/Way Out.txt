Way Out LyricsGive me one last kiss
Before I walk out of this
Give me some money
'Cause I'm right in a hurry
To get away out of his
But I'm telling you this
That I don't aim to miss
To get a way out of this...
Give it all you got now
Give it all you got now -- Yeah give a little
Give it all you got now
Give it all you got now -- Yeah give a little
Let me tell you this
Before I walk out of this
Some say it's sunny but
I don't think that's funny
And I'm telling you this
I'll get away out of this
'Cause I don't aim to miss
To get a way out of this...
Give it all you got now
Give it all you got now -- Yeah give a little
Give it all you got now
Give it all you got now -- Yeah give a little
Bid me one last wish
Before I walk out of this
Give the hammer to shatter the dream
To get away out of this...Embed
