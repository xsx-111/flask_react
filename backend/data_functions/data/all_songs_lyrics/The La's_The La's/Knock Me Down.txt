Knock Me Down LyricsWell I got woke up this morning
By a chimney singing crow
Well who came to tell me that
I've got no-place to go
Well I closed up my suitcase and
I came tumblin down the lane
I'm Jack-n-the-Box by name
A 'bobbin knock-me-down a-gain
Well I went fixin' on upon a
Word o' life savin' drug
Well I've skinned and fell at the bottom of
One long faith called love
Well I paid what it cost me
All it got me was good pain
I'm Jack n' the Box by name
A 'bobbin Knock Me Down AgainEmbed
