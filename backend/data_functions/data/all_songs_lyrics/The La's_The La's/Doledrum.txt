Doledrum LyricsOh no don't go down to Doledrum
Oh no don't go down to Doledrum
If you know what's good for you
Then you know what you can do
Just 'get up a fuss and shout' (Don't go down...)
Get on the bus get out of Doledrum (Don't go down...)
All my life goes by in Doledrum
I'll see 95 in Doledrum
I can't see much down for me
I think I'll run away to sea
But I'll just get on my coat and shout
Get on the boat get out of Doledrum
If you know what's good for you
Then you know what you can do
Just 'get up a fuss and shout' (Don't go down...)
Get on the bus get out of Doledrum (Don't go down...)
Oh no don't go down to Doledrum
Oh no don't go down to Doledrum
If you know what's good for you
Then you know what you can do
Just 'get up a fuss and shout' (Don't go down...)
Get on the bus get out of Doledrum (Don't go down...)Embed
