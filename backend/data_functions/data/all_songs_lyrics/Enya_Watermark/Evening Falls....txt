Evening Falls... Lyrics
When the evening falls and the daylight is fading
From within me calls – could it be I am sleeping?
For a moment I stray, then it holds me completely
Close to home – I cannot say
Close to home – feeling so far away

As I walk the room there before me a shadow
From another world where no other can follow
Carry me to my own, to where I can cross over...
Close to home – I cannot say
Close to home – feeling so far away

Forever searching; never right
I am lost in oceans of night
Forever hoping I can find memories
Those memories I left behind

Even though I leave will I go on believing
That this time is real – am I lost in this feeling?
Like a child passing through, never knowing the reason
I am home – I know the way
I am home - feeling oh, so far awayEmbed
