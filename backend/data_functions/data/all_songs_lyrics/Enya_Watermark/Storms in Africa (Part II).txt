Storms in Africa (Part II) Lyrics
Na-na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na
Na-na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na

Though I walk through
Warm sands in Africa
Winds will grow soon
To storms in Africa

How far to go?
Na-na-na-na
I cannot say
Na-na-na-na
How many more
Na-na-na-na
Will journey this way?

Dark skies fall on
Black earth and ivory
Far from your sun
Clouds now close over me

How far to go?
Na-na-na-na
I cannot say
Na-na-na-na
How many more
Na-na-na-na
Will journey this way?

Storms have come!
Rains wash the earth away
Dark skies fall down
Into another day

Rains have now come
From storms in Africa
Time will go on
Through storms in AfricaEmbed
