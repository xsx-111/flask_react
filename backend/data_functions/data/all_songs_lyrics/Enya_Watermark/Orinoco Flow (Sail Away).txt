Orinoco Flow (Sail Away) Lyrics
Let me sail, let me sail
Let the Orinoco flow
Let me reach, let me beach
On the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail
Let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach
Far beyond the Yellow Sea

De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de

(Ah)
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
From Bissau to Palau
In the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree
And the Isles of Ebony
From Peru to Cebu
Feel the power of Babylon
From Bali to Cali
Far beneath the Coral Sea

De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de
De-da, de-da, de

Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, up
Adieu
(Ooh)
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, up
Adieu
(Ooh)
Turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, up
Adieu
(Ah)

Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away

From the North to the South
Ebud√¶ unto Khartoum
From the deep Sea of Clouds
To the Island of the Moon
Carry me on the waves
To the lands I've never been
Carry me on the waves
To the lands I've never seen
We can sail, we can sail
With the Orinoco flow
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away

We can steer, we can near
With Rob Dickins at the wheel
We can sigh, say goodbye
Ross and his dependency
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away

We can reach, we can beach
On the shores of Tripoli
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
From Bali to Cali
Far beneath the Coral Sea
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away

From Bissau to Palau
In the shade of Avalon
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
We can reach, we can beach
Far beyond the Yellow Sea
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away

From Peru to Cebu
Feel the power of Babylon
We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away

We can sail, we can sail
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Sail away, sail away, sail away
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah
