Dark Places Lyrics
If I thought it would help, I would drive this car into the sea
If the fire and the smoke and explosions could speak for me
If the words that I used to try to explain
How something inside of me started to break
Ah, but one by one my words just got in the way

How many nights did I crash against the waves
With my head going under?
How many days did I spend trying to see it your way?
If you try you'd remember
I changed and changed and kept on saying
"One of these days something inside's gonna break
And we won't get it back now, baby" (something's gonna break.)

If I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart
(If I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart)
And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart
(If I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart)

All of the things that I tried to explain
How something inside of me started to break
We were living proof, one by one we drifted away
One by one we drifted away
Time after time there were things that would scare me to tears
While you called me haunted
I paced around the bed where you laid
One of these days baby, somethingâ€¦ (something's gonna break)

And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart
(If I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart)
And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart
(If I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart)

All of the things that I tried to explain
How something inside of me started to break
We were living proof, one by one we drifted away
Drifted away
One by one and day by day
I became the dark in the places where you live

And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart
(If I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart)
And if I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart
(If I thought it would help I would carve your name into my heart)
And all of the things that I tried to explain
How something inside of me started to break
We were living proof, one by one we drifted away
One by one we drifted away
We were living proof, one by one we drifted awayEmbed
