Sweet Morphine Lyrics
Oh my darling, you are the restless sea
With your black heart raging over me
Has the blue sky seen the same trouble as we?
Tell me true, my love, the restless sea
There are three things never satisfied
The grave, your heart, and mine
But I will hold you in my arms, where rust and sorrow lie
Underneath the bounding main tonight

And by now, you must've found better than me
I'm sure Jupiter and Orpheus have charmed you off your feet
By now, I'm sure you've gotten over me
While you're kissing clouds and gods, I'll be crawling on my knees
Sweet morphine
Sweet morphine

And yes, I've come to know you are the endless night
High above my love, and the constellation light
Waving your fingertips of sleep over the dark on the face of the deep
Endless night, I know you well, indeed

By now, you must've found better than me
I'm sure Jupiter and Orpheus have charmed you off your feet
By now, I'm sure you've gotten over me
While you're kissing clouds and gods, I'll be crawling on my knees
Sweet morphine
Sweet morphine
By now, you must've found better than me
I'm sure Jupiter and Orpheus have charmed you off your feet
Oh, by now, I'm sure you've gotten over me
While you're kissing clouds and gods, I'll be crawling on my knees
Sweet morphine
