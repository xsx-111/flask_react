Stay Vicious Lyrics
Now I feel just like a stranger
I don't sleep at all anymore
And the arms that used to hold me
Well, now they've done me harm
And I feel just like a murderer
And I feel just like a gun
And I been shaking in the hands
Of somebody who's finally had enough

As you step out into the city
No one to find you or recognize
As your black heels kick out the beat
Of my heart in perfect time
Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Look at you saving my life
Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Tonight, you're saving my life, yeah

Now I've had the saints and patience
And I wait on the telephone
I have pills for this, tabs for that
And something that used to resemble a soul
So won't anybody take my hand?
And won't anybody ease my ache?
I still love rock 'n' roll
And I still call somebody baby
As you step out into the city
No one to find you recognize
As your black heels kick out the beat
Of my heart in perfect time
Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Look at you saving my life
Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Tonight, you're saving my life, yeah
As you step out into the city
No one to find you recognize
As your black heels kick out the beat
Of my heart in perfect time
Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Look at you saving my life
Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Tonight, you're saving my life, yeah

Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Leave it on the end of the knife
Singing la-la-la-la la-la-la-la
Tonight, you're saving my life, yeah6Embed
