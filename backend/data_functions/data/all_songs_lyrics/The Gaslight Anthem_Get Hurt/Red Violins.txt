Red Violins Lyrics
There is no use to holler, no use to cry
Twenty pounds of curses came to visit me tonight
Salt for all the cuts, blankets for the cold
Prayers to keep the devil far away from those I love
And there were red violins playing in my dreams
One for me and two for me and one at Jesus' feet
And one I only reach to for sympathy

And if you want it then you want it
For when you're falling on your knees
I seen you howling now, you water at the mouth
I've seen you fawn and faint in need
Are there red violins playing you to sleep?

Chariot swing low if you come for me
Ain't it now the strangest sound we call on for relief?
And look at all these people clapping steady to the beat
Of the ambulances on their way to me

So if you wanna then you wanna
Everybody pays the price to feed
And since you're howling now, you're foaming at the mouth
And since you struck right off your feet
I'll play red violins...
And you are now of my existence
You're part of that which still remains
And you're lingering like fingered strings
I seem to call on to feel the pain
On red violins, on red violins
And if you wanna then you wanna
Can't you see me crawling at your feet?
You see me howling now, I'm foaming at the mouth
Come on and grieve for my disease
There were red violins playing in my dreams
There were red violins playing in my dreams
There were red violins, there were red violins
There were red violins, there were red violins playing in my dreamsEmbed
