Underneath the Ground Lyrics
That's enough, my man, it's time to clap our hands
Call the papers up tomorrow, say we did the best we can
Cause our doctor's in the hospital and the poet just laid down
There's one good man I know, he can't talk right now

I’d like to hear what you’d say to me
If I was bulletproof and free again
Or what you’d shout if I was dead in the ground
And buried under another name

Or would you talk about if I loved her now?
Tell my sins to God out loud
Would you cry, cry cause I was gone
Would you spit and hiss and curse my name?
And embarrass me to the other graves?
Would you lay right down with me underneath the ground?

I caution you, to watch out for the wolves
For the mad American weather
I feel the breeze, it warms the cheek, there are ghosts in this house
We imagine ourselves incapable of horror
But the heart is like a viper
Poison, and there are hidden regions in your love
Now who you think I am? Worse than all the rest
That's what I'll be now, just like no one said
Did anybody see that there's a crack right down my head?
Mama how they’ll cheer for us, while the blood drips down our legs

I’d like to know if you could see through the soul like I could see to your soul back then
And reach your hands through all the hurt and defenses, would you still try if you knew I was gone?

Or would you talk about if I loved her now?
Tell my sins to God out loud
Would you cry, cry cause I was gone
Would you spit and hiss and curse my name?
And embarrass me to the other graves?
Would you lay right down with me underneath the ground?

I wanna caution you to watch out for the wolves
And for the mad, mad weather
I wanna caution you to watch out for the wolves
And for someday, when you're older

Or would you talk about if I loved her now?
Tell my sins to God out loud
Would you cry, cry cause I was gone
Would you spit and hiss and curse my name?
And embarrass me to the other graves?
Would you lay right down with me underneath the ground?
I want to thank you all
For your courtesy
I want to thank you all
For watching us bleed
I want to thank you all
For your courtesy
I want to thank you all
For watching us bleed
Underneath the groundEmbed
