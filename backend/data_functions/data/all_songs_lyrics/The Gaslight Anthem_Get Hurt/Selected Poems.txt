Selected Poems Lyrics
Honey bee, she say I got too much sympathy
But I can call her any time
And if you're lost, and you need a little peace from me
Bring all your trouble by
Honey bee, how have I hurt you?
C'mon, tell your blues to me
Maybe I should live up there in the curtains
On the wings of Mercury

I was fortunately desperate
And turbulently innocent
I was living underneath my body weight
My eyes were swollen, green and hazy
Sick from grief and hate and envy
I was crawling up inside my head

And all I seemed to find is that everything has chains
And all this life just feels like a series of dreams
Selected poems and lovers I can't begin to name
And all in all I find that nothing stays the same
And I was crazy like the moon for you
And head over my heels for you
And never would I change or compromise
But something in my mind does things I can't contain for anything
Last night I don't think sleep even touched my eyes


And all I seem to find is how everything has chains
And all this life just feels like an idiot dream
Selected poems and lovers I never seen again
And all in all I find that nothing stays the sameEmbed
