Halloween LyricsSympathy, this is my best disguise
My skin stepped out for my bones to dry up
For the rest of the world outside to see
You see I, bleed on the side
It's a part time thing, a private affair
I try to keep it out of the light
I must confess, I didn't recognize you tonight
Dressed up like my love
And I hate these things but I always attend
A little sip of something to take off the edge
And I make my way through the ghosts in the room
Trying to crack a smile
And who are you supposed to be?
You look like heaven tonight
Me, I'm a tomb, a corpse in a suit
Trying to look a little alive
Are you alright?
Cause I worry sometimes
Are you dressed up to take my life?
Keep it coming, keep it coming
Well I think I saw you for the flash of a moment
Your broken heart and the body that holds it
I lost your scent in the flash of the party
The big bright lights, baby, constantly haunt me
I've never been right, have you ever been lied to?
I think I just saw the same scars upon you
Is this a disguise? Or a masquerade for me?
Keep it coming, keep it coming, keep it coming
Who are you supposed to be?
Yeah, you look just like my love
Who are you supposed to be?
Are you dressed just like my love?
Who are you supposed to be?
Yeah, you look just like my love
Who are you supposed to be?
Are you dressed just like my love for Halloween?Embed
