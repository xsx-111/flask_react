Stray Paper Lyrics
You better never tell nobody but God
All the things I've seen
From high above this haunted city
Under elected thrones of thieves

Where mighty men lay down their hearts
In the service of their queens
And gave their bodies to be burned
Like I did before your feet
Like she always tried for me
Like now she does for me

And underneath the tyranny of August and her sons
Who sent fire from their fingertips
In the holy vow of a teenage kiss
Now we're much too old for this
I don't feel those kinds of things
So don't you cry for me
I used to feel everything

Oh but love... (run, run, run.)
Oh but love
Oh but love
Love, love, love becomes...
Love, love, love becomes
Love, love, love becomes
Love, love, love becomes
And all my love becomes...all my love, my love...
...became blood on stray paper
Became blood on stray paper
Became blood on stray paper
Became blood on stray paper
Became blood on stray paper
Became blood on stray paper
Became blood on stray paperEmbed
