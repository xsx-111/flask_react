1,000 Years Lyrics
With a moon I know in the town I live, steady as she waits
Seems as though she yearns for me, calls me by my name
Sometimes she says, "come to me, kiss me while it's late"
And other nights she's just hangin' with the stars

And I've seen her waitin' from all her mistakes and
What if He never comes when you call?

And ayayay, ayayay, it’s alright she says
Once upon a time I lived the perfect night
Ayayay, ayayay, in another life she says
In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago

Don’t look back, I heard a voice in velvet I couldn't see
The pictures then were black and white and the details were in-between
I heard about a woman once who did everything ever asked of her
She died last week and her last words were
“It wasn’t worth it"

And I’ve seen her patience through all her mistakes and
Who’s gonna save you now?
And ayayay, ayayay, it’s alright she says
Once upon a time I lived the perfect night
Ayayay, ayayay, in another life she says
In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago
And ayayay, ayayay, it’s alright she says
Once upon a time I lived the perfect night
Ayayay, ayayay, in another life she says
In a dream of mine from a thousand years ago
Ayayay, ayayay, it’s alright she says
Ayayay, ayayay, in another life she says

Way back when we became friends
I was you, you were my defense
Quiet was the night
You showed me that bridge and it brought you home
You told me about it and I never let it go
And I guess I might have been doing the same
Anyhow, quiet was the night1Embed
