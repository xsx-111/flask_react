Break Your Heart LyricsIt would break your heart, if you knew me well
See, I have run so far that I've lost myself
There are things I have seen that I never will tell
They drove me out of my mind and inside of myself
And oh, my my, it would break your heart
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars
If I played you my favorite song, lying here in the dark
Oh my my, it would break your heart
It would bring you to tears, if you knew what I know
See, I spent all of my money on secondhand love
But I trusted somebody way and back when
And I loved her like fire until it drove me insane
And oh, my my, it would break your heart
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars
If I played you my favorite song lying here in the dark
Oh my my, it would break your heart
And you can lean on me until your heart don't beat
I'll leave you lying there on the floor
You can lean on me until your heart don't beat
I'll leave you spinning there on the floor
And oh, my my, it would break your heart
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars
If I played you my favorite song lying here in the dark
And oh my my, it would break your heart
And oh, my my, it would break your heart
If you knew how I loved you, if I showed you my scars
If I played you my favorite song lying here in the dark
Oh my my, it would break your heart
Until it breaks your heart1Embed
