Something to Believe In LyricsYou want something constant
And you want something sure
Something you can hold
Something secure
I’ve seen your eyes knocking
And turn from the door
Tell me what it is you’re looking for
If you need something to believe in
You can believe in my love
Your heroes stand tall
And you lean on their strength
When one takes a hard fall
With them you break
Well the rope never mattered
‘Till it was holding your weight
I guess trust is a chance you take
If you need someone to believe in
You can believe in my love
Well I've spent my life looking
For a truth I can bear
But kingdoms are just sand
And a throne is just a chair
Dreams are born to grow up
To die, and tear, and spring again
In the summer air
I’ve needed someone to believe in
I’ve needed someone to believe in
I’ve needed someone to believe in
Can I believe in your love?Embed
