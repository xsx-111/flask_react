Common Language LyricsHere we are once again, Can't get out, Can't get in
We're the same note in different octaves
You see blue I see in turquoise
We're the same note in different octaves
I've been looking for something, a sound or a sentence
I see a thousand doors but I can't find an entrance
You could put it into words and I'd still be confused
I could hold you in my arms and never really know you
Ahhhhhh.. Ahhhhh.. There's something about it
Ahhhhhh.. You and I, We can't live without it
Similar hearts speak dissonant phrases
Differing souls speak a common language
Empires fall by a stone, Hide my hand once it's thrown
Well everything's fine, If nothing is broken
Building a wall of my own, under this flesh, out of this bone
Your word was your word 'till it was broken
I've been looking for something, A break in the static
A reason to wake from these patterns and habits
I can put it into music and never be moved
I can hold you in my arms and never really feel you
Ahhhhhh.. Ahhhhh.. There's something about it
Ahhhhhh.. You and I, We can't live without it
Similar hearts speak dissonant phrases
Differing souls speak a common language
Similar hearts speak dissonant phrases
Beauty and pain are a common language
You and I, We're a common language
Beauty and pain are a common languageEmbed
