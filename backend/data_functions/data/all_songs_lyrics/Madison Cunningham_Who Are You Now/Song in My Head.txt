Song in My Head Lyrics
There’s a song in my head
Oh, a line that never stops playing
I’m not sure how it ends
I can't remember when
I heard what you were saying

I make the best out of the worst
I make up half the words
And wear a t-shirt of a band I’ve never heard
Because it hurts to be on the outside looking in
Well, I do my best to listen
But I’m uncomfortable with too much silence
From the passenger seat, you said, "What does that mean?"
I said I’m learning to live with the violence, violence
But I’m not the kind that

Wants to be lost, I don't wanna be forgotten
I don’t wanna pretend that it's alright
I wanna see these walls crumble and dissolve
Around me

I got my gold-rimmed diploma wearing a square crown
The class of '14 wore their capes like a reverend’s gown
All that education won’t help us now
Attending funerals and watching friends break their vows
Well, there’s not much that I can protect
So I keep my good humor alive
Nothing disturbs your intellect
Like feeling something you can’t deny, justify
I don’t wanna be lost, I don't wanna be forgotten
I don’t wanna pretend that it’s alright
I wanna see these walls crumble and dissolve
Around me

Saturday morning 11 AM
Heard mom and dad talking money again
Fit a seven person family in a five seater van
I guess all you can do is the best that you can
Dad pushed it all down with a Gibson in his hand
To finish that song that never had an end
I can still hear that song in my head
In my head

Information, education, given in love
Questions digest like sugar in my blood
Holding together what’s meant to fall apart
Justify a reason for the way things are

Well, I don’t wanna be lost
I don’t wanna be forgotten
I got reason to believe that I just might
One day see these walls crumble and dissolve
Around me
I’m not afraid, not afraid to lose
It’s a voice that I can’t refuse
Maybe I don’t have a right to choose
When it calls my name1Embed
