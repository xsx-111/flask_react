Trouble Found Me Lyrics
Give me something good to doWrite me a line to say
Just give me someone I could be
If I’m always standing in the way
Or am I just a paper doll
Looking for a pair of scissors?
That won’t cut me into something small
But cut me free from the danger

Sometimes I feel like quitting
And making someone do my bidding
You’re laughing but I'm not kidding

I feel like I’m gonna lose it
God knows I didn’t choose it
Right when I wasn't looking
Trouble found me
Trouble found me

Give me a new condition
Is that too big a favor?
Truth without apprehension
Cuz I’ve been taught good behavior
I don’t care what you want to know
Let me show you to the door
You give me the disease
Now you’re selling me the cure

My affections are too soft
To put a spell on me isn't hard
Good intentions feed the wolves and sharks

Feels like I’m gonna lose it
God know I didn’t choose it
Right when I wasn't looking
Trouble found me
Trouble found me

Everything that I do
I thought I was supposed to
But nothing that I can do
Is enough for you

Gonna leave that trouble behind me
Won’t be the shadow that binds me
Next time I’m gonna be ready
When trouble finds me
When trouble finds me
Trouble finds meEmbed
