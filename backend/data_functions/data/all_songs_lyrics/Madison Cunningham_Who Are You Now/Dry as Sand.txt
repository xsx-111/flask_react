Dry as Sand LyricsSo your heart is inside out
All your friends have let you down
Love slipped out the door without a sound
With every new promise there lies a deeper doubt
You think you see it coming but it turns before it can find you
You stare at what you want for so long it’s starting to blind you
Dark as night and dry as sand
The meaning filters right through your hands
Silence is your dearest friend
With every new beginning there comes a faster end
You think you see it coming but it turns before it can find you
You stare at what you want for so long it’s starting to blind you
I can’t tell you what you’re fighting for
I can only tell you what I see
I wish that I could say it well, like it felt
To watch the evening fall on your face
Your beautiful face
Time and sorrow burn the fuse
You patch the hole with water and it seeps right through
What on earth has been holding you
This time around you just needed proofEmbed
