L.A. (Looking Alive) LyricsTaking a walk down Eagle Rock, wandering
Where the men wear their jeans tight as a bull dog’s skin
Listening to the way people talk and the way people worry
Turn themselves blonde when they get that sick feeling they’re aging
Well I've got a face he has a hard time remembering
And every time that we’ve met he’ll ask
Sorry what’s your name again?
Well the way people talk and the way people hurry
To reach for a card when they think that you might be
Wasting their time
Wide-eyed, looking for something
There’s bound to be something to let you down
Wide-eyed, are you sleep deprived?
Well, if you want to be something, you’re looking alive
Taking a drive down the five, I’m a different man
The drivers have a way of taking the last bit of goodness I had
There’s always something to wake you when you're caught in a dream
Flashing lights in your rearview, the hollowing scream of your own voice
Was that my voice?
Might I suggest something?
There’s bound to be something
To let you down
Wide eyed are you sleep deprived
If you want to be something then
Hey! Look alive
Look alive
Look alive
Look alive
Look alive
Look alive
Well I left for the city with the strength and the will to compete
How quickly you forget that just anyone can fill your seat
Doesn't it feel good to laugh at yourself
Turn your back on the business and leave it to sell its own worry, its own worry
I’ve been looking alive
I've been looking alive1Embed
