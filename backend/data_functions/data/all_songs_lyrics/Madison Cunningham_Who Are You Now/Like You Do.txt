Like You Do LyricsSometimes I want to fade
Into someone familiar
Fill the room up with smoke
And hide in the laughter
No one knows me like you do
No one sees me like you do
I know I’m hard to read
And I’m easy to tear
And I’m unaware
That there’s something in me
Strong enough to kill something in you
No one knows me like you do
No one breaks me like you do
I see the darkness in me
When I try to find it in you
The heart that breaks in two
It breaks for you
Maybe we’re two parts
Bound by the same thread
Was it you who said
There was some good in me
Strong enough to heal some good in you
No one breaks me like you do
No one takes me like you do
I see the darkness in me
When I try to find it in you
The heart that breaks for you
It breaks me through and through
Like you doEmbed
