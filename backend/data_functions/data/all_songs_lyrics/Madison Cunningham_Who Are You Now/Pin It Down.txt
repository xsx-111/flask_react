Pin It Down LyricsWhen I stand back I see a little clearer now
When I’m not staring right at a pixelated picture
When I shut it out it still hurts the same somehow
And I’m standing right where I said I would never be
I can’t pin it
I can’t pin it down
I can’t pin it
But I think we’ve been here once before
I think we’ve been here once before
When you looked at me
Were my defenses drawn?
Was I cutting through the floor
I was standing on?
This cold blooded pride in me
Won't go down quietly
And I’m standing right where I said I could never be
I can’t pin it
I can’t pin it down
I can’t pin it
But I think we’ve been here once before
Yeah I can’t pin it
I can’t pin it down
I can’t pin it
But I think we’ve been here once before
I think we’ve been here once before
When I look into your eyes
There’s nowhere to hide, no edge to hold
Are we so willing to compromise
Every ounce of freedom for some control?
Time and time again, the colors start to blend
And our fury can’t remember its own reason
Maybe it’s time that I take a good a look around
At what we have learned to live with
And what we can’t live without
The pain that we hold so dear
Looks so small and vein from here
When we’re standing right where we said we would never be
I can’t pin it
I can’t pin it down
I can’t pin it
But I think we’ve been here once before
Yeah I’ll admit it
I’ll admit it now
I’ll admit it
I think we’ve been here once before
I think we’ve been here once before
One too many times before
I think we've been here once before
I think we've been here once before
I think we’ve been here once before1Embed
