Styrofoam Lyrics
There are no more races to be run
There are no numbers left to be won
Everybody's down
We pulled each other down

There never was a truth
To be found

We are all bigots
So filled with hatred
We release our poisons
We are all bigots
So full with hatred
We release our poisons

There are no cultures left to slide
No more people
To be tried
We're in our minds
Five billion pieces so defined
We read it in a book, it was underlined
We are all bigots
So filled with hatred
We release our poisons
We are all bigots
So full with hatred
We release our poisons
