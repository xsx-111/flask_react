Sieve-Fisted Find LyricsAnother sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again
Here comes another problem
All wrapped up in solution
It's ugly as it's strapped on
Twice as hard to get behind
Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again
Please
Please let me get my hands on it
Please let me get my, my, my
Please let me get my hands on it
Here comes that self-same problem
All stalled on same self again
It's as ugly as the last one
And twice as far from unwound
By this charged head standing
On this thin base of neck
And now I'm pushing past the red
I said I'm pushing past the red
Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again
Sieve-fisted find
You find nothing
Sieve-fisted find
You find nothing
Another sieve-fisted find
Lost, lost again
Please
Please let me get my hands on it
Please let me get my, my, my, my, my, my
Please let me get my hands on it
My, my, my, my, my, yeah
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got itEmbed
