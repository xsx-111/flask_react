Repeater Lyrics
You say I need a job
I've got my own business
You want to know what I do?
None of your fucking business
But now I'm lying here
And knowing that business
I had a name, but now I'm a number

1-2-3 Repeater
Repeater
Repeater
1, 2, 3
Repeater
Repeater

Down by law
I've got this nasty habit
When I need something
I just reach out and grab it
Once upon a time I had a name and a way
But to you I'm nothing but a number

1-2-3 Repeater
Repeater
Repeater
1, 2, 3
Repeater
Repeater
Did you hear something outside?
It sounded like a gun
Stay away from that window, boy
It's not anyone that we know
Only about ourselves and
What we read in the paper
Don't you know ink washes out
Easier than blood
But we don't have to try it
And we don't have to buy it

You've got
You've got
You've got

1, 2, 3 go!
