Turnover Lyrics
Languor rises reaching
To turn off the alarm
And there's never so much seething
That it can't be disarmed

You just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To leave it off and
Turn over

Lounging against your weapons
Until your muscles find lock
In the ease of that position
A residue of tremor passes
As some cherie amour suggests
Maybe it was time to smash things up

But just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and
Turn over
Stop, turnover
Stop, turn over

Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and
Turn over
To just
Stop it up
Pass it on
Shove it to shelf it
To lead it on and
I'm only
I'm only sleeping

I'm only
I'm only sleeping2Embed
