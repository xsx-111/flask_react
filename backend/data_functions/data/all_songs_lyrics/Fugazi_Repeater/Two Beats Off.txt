Two Beats Off LyricsI cut my nails to the quick
But still I was caught with my hand in the till
Red-handed
Red-handed
Give me something
Give me anything
The threat of everything
Nothing at all
A-fingers reaching
A-trophy swelling
And that's when
Desire trips me up
Got a new technique
Money lets the pieces fit where they fall
And privilege
It sanctions everything
Security
A net under it all
My fingers reaching
The trophy swelling
And that's when
Desire trips me up
Once there was a body to see
Now just the biggest mouth to feed
Of them all
And it
It ain't anything
Up against it all
Fingers 
The trophy swelling
And that's when
Desire trips me up
I cut my nails to the quick
But still I was caught with my hand in the till
Red-handed

Red-handed
Drop with my make out, with my
Drop with my hand in it now
Drop with my make out, with my
Drop hands, yeah
Drop with my make out, with my
Drop with my hand, drop with my hand
Drop with my, drop with myEmbed
