Reprovisional LyricsSomewhere in these private minds
The last one comes just in time to
Clear out the chambers, sew up the lips
That's the price to pay for hoping every slip's not a slide
In other words not to get it wrong
Pointless to walk, past time to run
Secured under the weight of watchful eyes
Lulled to sleep under clear expansive skies
Somewhere in these prying hearts
Conflicting history tear us apart and
We hope we won't get
What we deserve
Behind the targets in front of all the people we serve
Yeah, oh yeah
Hey, hey, shoot, shoot
Somewhere in these private minds
The last one comes just in time to
Clear out the chambers, sew up the lips
The price to pay, hoping every slip's not a slideEmbed
