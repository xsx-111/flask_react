Blueprint LyricsI'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you, yeah, you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you, yeah, you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you, yeah, you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I'm not playing with you
I clean forgot how to play
But you can still come around
In fact I invite you down
Maybe together
We can wipe that smile off your face
'Cause what a difference
What a difference
What a difference
A little difference would make
We'll draw a blueprint
It must be easy
It's just a matter
Of knowing when to say no or yes
Frustrating, frustrating
Always waiting for the bigger axe to fall
A patient game I can't find my way to play
Find my way to play
Not knowing
Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
And receiving undefiled
Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
And receiving undefiled
Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
And receiving undefiled
Never mind what's been selling
It's what you're buying
Receiving undefiled
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Not knowing the way to play
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Not knowing the way to play
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Not knowing the way to play
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Lost the way
Not knowing the way to play
