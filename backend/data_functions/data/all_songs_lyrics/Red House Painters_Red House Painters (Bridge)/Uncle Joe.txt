Uncle Joe LyricsWhere have all the people gone in my life
I'm looking at the ceiling
With an awful feeling of loss
And loneliness
The after late night television pain
I'm running out of strength
And it feels so wonderful
To swim in our fear
And it's unacceptable
The awakening of life
Oh, uncle Joe
Could you tell me what you know?
I've been having mental problems
And the solution is unclear
I'll give anything a try once
I'll try anything three times
I don't care
But there's no company
That I can stand to be with me
So my dependency on you grows
And I am not very well read
And did you say that I will lose my house
And can you spare me of my pain
And can you spare me of my tears
Oh, uncle Joe
It was unintentional
When I spit in your beer
I am over influenced
By movies
Let's all go to the pier tomorrow
The darkest pool
Did you know lies below the sky2Embed
