Evil LyricsSad reminders of
What seems years ago, warm
Southern sun shines through
Station wagon windows
Like solar energy and
When in the night
Your brother turned to me and said
"God, do you look evil in the dark."
"God, do you look evil in the dark."
That made me feel good
Sad reminders of
Midwest winter snow
Cold Catholic church
Heaven, in stained glass windows
Like rock candy and
When on Sunday
The daughter turned at me and said
"Mom and Dad is it a boy or a girl?"
"Mom and Dad is it a he or a she?"
That made me feel goodEmbed
