The Star Spangled Banner LyricsOh, say can you see
By the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
Over the ramparts we watched
Were so gallantly streaming
And the rockets red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave
Over the land of the free
And the home of the braveEmbed
