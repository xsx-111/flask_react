Helicopter LyricsHelicopter falls to my
Calm virgin island
It said I want to show you
New clouds and new sky
From shore to sun
We'll soar like one
Brave martyr pilot
So that I can know you
Outside our cold-winded earth
Feel part of your desolate pain
Taste what has made you grow
At once with your oddness you enlighten
My slow unnurtured brain
Be mine for a day
Let your lids shut out that bad focus
To die in a storm
Holding you in my last hour
Our burning flesh will blow over
Some nightmare sea
Daylight won't find a trace
Where heaven finds us
Living eyes won't find a sign
Where peace will hear our prayersEmbed
