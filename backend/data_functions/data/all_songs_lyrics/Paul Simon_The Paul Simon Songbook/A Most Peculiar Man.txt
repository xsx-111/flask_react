A Most Peculiar Man Lyrics
He was a most peculiar man
That's what Mrs. Reardon says
And she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said

He was a most peculiar man

He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone within a house
Within a room, within himself


He had no friends, he seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
Because he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them
Oh no!

He died last Saturday
He turned on the gas, and he went to sleep
With the windows closed
So he'd never wake up
To his silent world and his tiny room
And Mrs. Reardon says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon

And all the people said
What a shame that he's dead
