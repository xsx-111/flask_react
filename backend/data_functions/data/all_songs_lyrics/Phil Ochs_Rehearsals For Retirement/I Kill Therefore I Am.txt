I Kill Therefore I Am Lyrics
Meet the king of cowboys
He rides a pale pony
He fights the bad boys
Brings them to their knees
He patrols the highways from the air
He keeps the country safe from long hair

I am the masculine American man
I kill therefore I am

I don't like the black man
For he doesn't know his place
Take the back of my hand
Or I'll spray you with my mace
I'm as brave as any man can be
I find my courage through chemistry

I am the masculine American man
I kill therefore I am

I don't like the students now
They don't have no respect
They don't like to work now
I think I'll wring their necks
They call me pig although I'm underpaid
I'll show those faggots that I'm not afraid
I am the masculine American man
I kill therefore I am

Farewell to the gangsters
We don't need them anymore
We've got the police force
They're the ones who break the law
He's got a gun and he's a hater
He shoots first, he shoots later

I am the masculine American man
I kill therefore I amEmbed
