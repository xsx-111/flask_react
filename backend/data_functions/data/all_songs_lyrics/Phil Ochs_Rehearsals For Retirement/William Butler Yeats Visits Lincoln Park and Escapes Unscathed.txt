William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed Lyrics
As I went out one evening
To take the evening air
I was blessed by a blood-red moon
In Lincoln Park the dark was turning
I spied a fair young maiden
And a flame was in her eyes
And on her face lay the steel blue skies
Of Lincoln Park, the dark was turning, turning

They spread their sheets upon the ground
Just like a wandering tribe
And the wise men walked in their Robespierre robes
Through Lincoln Park the dark was turning
The towers trapped and trembling
And the boats were tossed about
When the fog rolled in and the gas rolled out
From Lincoln Park the dark was turning

Like wild horses freed at last
We took the streets of wine
But I searched in vain for she stayed behind
In Lincoln Park the dark was turning, turning
I'll go back to the city
Where I can be alone
And tell my friend she lies in stone
In Lincoln Park the dark was turning
Where were you in Chicago?
You know I didn't see you there
I didn't see them break your head
Or breathe the tear gas air
Oh, where were you in Chicago
When the fight was being fought?
Oh, where were you in Chicago?
'Cause I was in DetroitEmbed
