The World Began in Eden and Ended in Los Angeles Lyrics
Don't you think it's time that we were leaving?
For another chance, another place to start
Desperate ones that went across the ocean
And they wondered how it would all turn out

If you have to beg or steal or borrow
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow

They landed on the coldest of the colonies
But still they wanted better than the rest
They built highways on the houses of the homesteads
It happened that way heading west

If you have to beg or steal or borrow
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow


If you have to beg or steal or borrow
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow
So this is where the Renaissance has led to
And we will be the only ones to know
So take a drive and breathe the air of ashes
That is, if you need a place to go

If you have to beg or steal or borrow
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow
City of Tomorrow, City of TomorrowEmbed
