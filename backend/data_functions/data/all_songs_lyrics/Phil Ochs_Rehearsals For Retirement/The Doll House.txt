The Doll House Lyrics
Lost in the valley of vaults
Fell from the path, it was nobody's fault
That I was alone
Time dripped from the trees
Leapt through a land
Fell to my knees before the throne
And the crown was covered with jewels
Sparkling schools, the beautiful fauns
The magnificent battle was fought
And Cinderella's soldier fish was caught

And the lady from the lake
Helped me to escape
And led me to myself at last
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house

The flower fled from my feet
Tom Sawyer voice through the hole of the key
Landed so gently
The castles cover the cave
I had no choice, the visions were brave
And the phantoms were friendly
And Pirate Jenny was dancing for pennies
The knuckle bones tossed in a spin
There were silver songs on her skin
And she wasn't caring when the ship came in
And the lady from the lake
Helped me to escape
And led me to myself at last, at last
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house

My costume dropped to the floor
Naked at last, couldn't fight any more
And the service was rendered
A poem fell from the wine
Buried the past, the future was mine
And the present surrendered
And the ballet master is beckoning faster
The ballerina was posed
In the fragile beauty we froze
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go

And the lady from the lake
Who helped me to escape
Left me with myself at last
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll houseEmbed
