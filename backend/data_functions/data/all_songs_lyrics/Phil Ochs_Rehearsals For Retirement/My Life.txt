My Life Lyrics
My life was once a joy to me
Never knowing I was growing every day
My life was once a toy to me
And I wound it and I found it ran away
So I raced through the night
With a face at my feet
Like a god I would write
All the melodies were sweet
And the women were white
It was easy to survive
My life was so alive

My life was once a flag to me
And I waved it and behaved like I was told
My life was once a drag to me
And I loudly and I proudly lost control
I was drawn by a dream
I was loved by a lie
Every serf on the scene
Begged me to buy
But I slipped through the scheme
So lucky to fail
My life was not for sale
My life is now a myth to me
Like the drifter, with his laughter in the dawn
My life is now a death to me
So I'll mold it and I'll hold it 'til I'm born
So I turned to the land
Where I'm so out of place
Throw a curse on the plan
In return for the grace
To know where I stand
Take everything I own
Take your tap from my phone
And leave my life alone
My life alone1Embed
