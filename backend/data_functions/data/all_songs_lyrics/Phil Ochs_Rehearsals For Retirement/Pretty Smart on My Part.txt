Pretty Smart on My Part Lyrics
I can see him a-coming
He's a-walking down the highway
With his big boots on
And his big thumb out
He wants to get me
He wants to hurt me
He wants bring me down
Ah, but sometime later
When I'm feel a little straighter
I will come across a stranger
Who'll remind me of the danger
And then I'll run him over

Pretty smart on my part
Find my way in the dark

I can see her coming
And she sure looks pretty
And her breasts are bold
And her mouth is large
She wants to get me
She wants to hurt me
She wants to bring me down
Ah, but sometime later
When I feel a little naked
I will lead her to altar
Then I'll tie her all in leather
And then I'm gonna whip her
Pretty smart on my part
Find my way in the dark

I can see him a-coming
He's a-walking through bedroom
With a switchblade knife
He's looking at my wife
He wants to get me
He wants to hurt me
He wants to bring me down
But sometime later
When I feel a little braver
I'll go hunting with my rifle
Where the wild geese are flying
And then I'm gonna bag one

Pretty smart on my part
Find my way in the dark

I can see them a-coming
They're a-training in the mountains
And they talk Chinese
And they spread disease
They want to get me
They want to hurt me
They want bring me down
But sometime later
When I feel a little safer
We'll assassinate the President
And take over the government
And then we're gonna fry them
Pretty smart on my part
Find my way in the darkEmbed
