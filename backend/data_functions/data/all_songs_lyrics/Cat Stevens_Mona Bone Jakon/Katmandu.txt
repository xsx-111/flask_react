Katmandu LyricsI sit beside the dark
Beneath the mire
Cold grey dusty day
The morning lake
Drinks up the sky
Katmandu I’ll soon be seeing you
And your strange bewildering time
Will hold me down
Chop me some broken wood
We’ll start a fire
White warm light the dawn
And help me see
Old satan’s tree
Katmandu I’ll soon be touching you
And your strange bewildering time
Will hold me down
Pass me my hat and coat
Lock up the cabin
Slow night treat me right
Until I go
Be nice to know
Katmandu I’ll soon be seeing you
And your strange bewildering time
Will keep me homeEmbed
