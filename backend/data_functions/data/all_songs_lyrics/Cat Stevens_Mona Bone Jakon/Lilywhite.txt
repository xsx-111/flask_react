Lilywhite LyricsBack upon the mended road I pause
Taking time to check the dial
And the Lilywhite
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again
I raise my hand and touch the wheel of change
Taking time to check the dial
And the Lilywhite
I never knew her name
But she'll be passing my way sometime again
She'll be passing my way sometime againEmbed
