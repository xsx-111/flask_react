I Wish, I Wish LyricsOuh yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
What makes me, me, what makes you, you
It's just another point of view, (Ooooooh)
A state of mind I'm going through, (Yeaaaaah)
So what I see is never true
(Aaaaaah ah ah ah)
I wish I'll tell, I wish I'll tell
What makes a heaven, what makes a hell
And do I get to ring my bell, (Ooooooh)
Or land up in some dusty cell, (Nooooooo)
While others reach the big hotel
(Yeaaaaaaah eah eah eah)
I wish I had, I wish I had
The secret of good, and the secret of bad
Why does this question drive me mad? (Aaaaaah)
'Cause I was taught when but a lad, (Yeaaaaaah)
That bad was good and good was bad
(Nooooooo oh oh oh)
I wish I knew the mystery of
That thing called hate, and that thing called love
What makes the in-between so rough? (Aaaaaaaah)
Why is it always push and shove? (Aaaaaaaah)
I guess I just don't know enough
(Yeaaaaaaah eah eah eah)
Yeah yeaaaaah, yeah, yeaaaah
Yeah yeaaaaah, yeah, yeaaaah
Yeah, yeaaah, yeah
Yeah, yeaaah, yeah
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
Somebody tell me, (Somebody tell me)
Ohh, ohh
Somebody tell me, (Somebody tell me)Embed
