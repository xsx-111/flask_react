Fill My Eyes LyricsAnd in the morning when you fill my eyes
I knew that day I couldn't do
Ah ah-ah, no wrong, I couldn't do
And so my mind begins to memorize
'Cause time will never seem the same
Ah ah-ah, no more, never again
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go
My legs are weak my heels are low
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll
Can't make no headway on this road
There's an empty space inside me now
A wasteland deep beneath the snow
So cold, nothing will grow
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't go
My legs are weak my heels are low
I'm just a coaster but my wheels won't roll
Can't make no headway on this road
What road?
And in the morning when you fill my eyes
I knew that day I couldn't do
Ah ah-ah, no wrong, I couldn't doEmbed
