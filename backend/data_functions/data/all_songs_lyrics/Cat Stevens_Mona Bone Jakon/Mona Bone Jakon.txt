Mona Bone Jakon LyricsYes I've got a Mona Bone Jakon
But it won't be lonely for long
Yes I've got a Mona Bone Jakon
But it won't be lonely for long
Yes I've got my reasons and to me they're all true
And I wouldn't change them, not even for you
Yes I've got a Mona Bone Jakon
But it won't be lonely for long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeaaaaah
Ooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Yeaah, yeaaah, yeah-yeah-yeaaaaah
Yeaaaaaaaaah
Ooooh wuooooooh now!
Yeeees, so much
Mmmmmmh...
