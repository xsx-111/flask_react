I Think I See the Light LyricsI used to trust nobody
Trusting even less their words
Until I found somebody
There was no one I preferred
My heart was made of stone
My eyes saw only misty grey
Until you came into my life girl
I saw everyone that way
Until I found the one I needed at my side
I think I would have been a sad man all my life
I think I see the light
Coming to me
Coming through me
Giving me a second sight
So shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
I used to walk alone
Every step seemed the same
This world was not my home
So there was nothing much to gain
Look up and see the clouds
Look down and see the cold floor
Until you came into my life girl
I saw nothing, nothing more
Until I found the one I needed at my side
I think I would have been a sad man all my life
I think I see the light
Coming to me
Coming through me
Giving me a second sight
So shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
I think I see the light
Coming to me
Coming through me
Giving me a second sight
So shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shineEmbed
