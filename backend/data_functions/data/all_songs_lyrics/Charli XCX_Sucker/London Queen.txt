London Queen Lyrics:
Ride away from Holloway
I said "Mum, this isn't a holiday
Listen up, I ain't coming back
Till I can fill the shack up with all gold plaques."
Soon come, home run, whack!
Knock it out the park with a baseball bat
:
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know
:
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way, yay yay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London Queen (oi!)
:
Now I live in Hollywood
I can't stop even though I know I should
It feels so good, oh yeah, oh oh

Chorus (2x)
:
Living the dream like a London Queen (oi!)
Living the dream like a London Queen (oi!)
Living the dream like a London Queen (oi!)
Living the dream like a London Queen

Oi, oi, oi (whack)
Oi, oi, oi (whack)
