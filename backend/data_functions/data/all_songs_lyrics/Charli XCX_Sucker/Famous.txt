Famous Lyrics
Bored on Friday night
Spinning 'round just like I'm hypnotised, oh
Need some neon lights
Wanna feel like I'm electrified, so help me out

Get your boyfriend's car
Come and pick me up, oh
Let's take it for a ride
What trouble can we find?

One night, and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Come on, let's lose control!

One night, and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Just like we're famous
Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just like we're famous

Blown up like balloons
Purple glitter flying through the air, oh-oh
Sweat drips from the roof
And you know we're Lucy in this sky of diamonds

Music playing loud
Tripping through the crowd, oh
Put your sunglasses on
Don't care if we look dumb
