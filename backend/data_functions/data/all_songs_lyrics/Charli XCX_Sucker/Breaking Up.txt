Breaking Up Lyrics
You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)
You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

You had an ugly tattoo, and fucking cheap perfume
You couldn't dance, barely moved, I didn't know what to do
You had a friend in a band, but they're not that cool
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Breaking up! (Breaking up)
Breaking up! (Breaking up)


You tried to pull this apart and make a brand new start
You tried to drive me to France, we didn't get very far
You said forever but baby I'm not so sure
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)
