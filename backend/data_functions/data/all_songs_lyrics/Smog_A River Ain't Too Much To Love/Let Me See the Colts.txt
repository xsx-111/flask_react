Let Me See the Colts LyricsKnocked on your door at dawn
With a spark in my heart
Dragged you from your bed
And said let me see the colts
Let me see the colts
That will run next year
Show them to a gambling man
Thinking of the future
Let me see the colts
That will run next year
Show them to a gambling man
Thinking of the future
Have you been drinking?
No, nor sleeping
The all-seeing all-knowing eye is dog tired
And just wants to see the colts
We walked out through
The dew dappled brambles
And sat upon the fence
Is there anything as still as sleeping horses?
Is there anything as still as sleeping horses?Embed
