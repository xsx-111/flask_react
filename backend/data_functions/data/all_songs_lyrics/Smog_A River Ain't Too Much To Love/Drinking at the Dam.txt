Drinking at the Dam LyricsI remember drinking at the dam
With the jarheads on the other side
Warm beer and tearing up the cans
And all of us yelling abuse
Cutting school to go drinking at the dam
Skinmags in the brambles
For the first part of my life
I thought women had orange skin
It was the first part of my life
Second is the rest
And now teenage warchests fill
And do the dirty dirty work
It was the first part of their lives
Drinking at the dam
Holding back what I can
But the power is so much
Drinking at the dam
Holding back what I can
I'm just drinking at the dam
I'm just drinking at the dam
I'm just drinking at the damEmbed
