Rock Bottom Riser LyricsI love my mother
I love my father
I love my sisters too
I bought this guitar
To pledge my love
To pledge my love to you
I am a rock
Bottom riser
And I owe it all to you
I saw a gold ring
At the bottom of the river
Glinting
At my foolish heart
Oh my foolish heart
Had to go diving
Diving diving
Into the murk
And from the bottom of the river
I looked up for the sun
Which had shattered in the water
And the pieces were raining down
Like gold rings
That passed through my hands
As I thrashed and grabbed
I started rising rising
I left my mother
I left my father
Left my sisters too
Left them standing on the banks
And they pulled me out
Of this mighty mighty river
I am a rock
Bottom riser
And I owe it all to you1Embed
