Running the Loping LyricsI lay on the bed in the dark
Laughing at things i think of
Getting off on the pornography of my past
Lighting matches and dropping them
Into a wet glass
It's summer now and it's hot
And the sweat pours out
And the air is the same as my body
And i breathe my body inside out
With sunlight around my skin turns brown
And you wouldn't know me from your pa
Or Adam or Allah
But I haven't changed
No I haven't changed
Day is all that resolves
All we need is here on earth
About every other day
Scratchmarks on my knees since I've been running
The bramble lee
When I'd much rather be wanting to be
Running the loping
Peace on your hand
Don't be silly
But peace on my body
When tired and beaten
All we need is here on earth
About every other day
Oh to live in the country
With a chicken and those other things
Where the hills loping
Where the dress and the hair in the river
Undulating
To take a wife and no paper
Never again to wonder
Did that rapper rape her
All we need is here on earth
About every other dayEmbed
