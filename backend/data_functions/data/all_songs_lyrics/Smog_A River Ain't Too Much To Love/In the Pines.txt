In the Pines LyricsThe longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine went by at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine
In the pines
In the pines
The sun never shines
And we shiver
When the north wind blows
Well I asked the captain
For the time of day
He said he
Threw his watch away
A long steel rail
And a short cross tie
And I'm on my
Way back home
In the pines
In the pines
The sun never shines
And we shiver
When the north wind blows
Little girl
Little girl
What have I done
That makes you treat me this way
Well you have caused
Me to weep
You caused me to moan
You caused me to leave my home
In the pines
In the pines
The sun never shines
And we shiver
When the north wind blowsEmbed
