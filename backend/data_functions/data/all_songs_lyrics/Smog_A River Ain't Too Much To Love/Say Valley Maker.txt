Say Valley Maker LyricsWith the grace of a corpse
In a riptide
I let go
And I slide slide slide
Downriver
With an empty case by my side
An empty case
That's my crime
And I sing (Say Valley Maker)
To keep from cursing
Yes I sing (Say Valley Maker)
To keep from cursing
River Oh
River End
River Oh
River End
River Go
River Bend
Take me through the sweet valley
Where your heart blooms
Take me through the sweet valley
Where your heart is covered in dew
And when the river dries
Will you bury me in wood
Where the river dries
Will you bury me in stone
Oh I never really realized
Death is what it meant
To make it on my own
Because there is no love
Where there is no obstacle
And there is no love
Where there is no bramble
There is no love
On the hacked away plateau
And there is no love
In the unerring
And there is no love
On the one true path
Oh I cantered out here
Now I'm galloping back
So bury me in wood
And I will splinter
Bury me in stone
And I will quake
Bury me in water
And I will geyser
Bury me in fire
And I'm gonna phoenix
I'm gonna phoenixEmbed
