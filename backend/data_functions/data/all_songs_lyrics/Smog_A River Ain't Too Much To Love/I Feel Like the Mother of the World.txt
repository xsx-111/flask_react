I Feel Like the Mother of the World LyricsWhether or not there is any type of god
I'm not supposed to say
And today
I don't really care
God is a word
And the argument ends there
Oh do I feel like the mother of the world
With two children
Oh do I feel like the mother of the world
With two children fighting
When I was a boy I used to get into it bad
With my sister
And when the time came to face the truth
There'd only be tears and sides
Tears and sides
And my mother my poor mother
Would say it does not matter
It does not matter
Just stop fighting
Oh do I feel like the mother of the world
With two childrenEmbed
