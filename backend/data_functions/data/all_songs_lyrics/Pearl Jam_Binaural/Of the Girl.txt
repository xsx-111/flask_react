Of the Girl Lyrics
Oh, he deals them off of the top, ties them off
Fills it up with his past, gets carried away
Oh, half his life a hand me down wasted away
Oh, he fills his night with the thought of a girl
Oh, he left it alone, drilled the pain with money to buy

How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway

Oh, he chose a path, heavy the fall, quarter to four
Fills his nights with the thought of a girl

How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway
How he makes his getaway

Get awayEmbed
