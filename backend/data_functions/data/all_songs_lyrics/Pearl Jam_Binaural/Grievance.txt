Grievance Lyrics
Have a drink they're buying
Bottom of, bottle of denial

Big guy, big eye, watching me
Have to wonder what it sees (sin)
Progress laced with ramifications
Freedom's big plunge

Pull the innocent from a crowd
Raise the stakes, then bring them down
If they fail to obey, oh, if they fail to obey

For every tool they lend us
A loss of independence

I pledge my grievance to the flag
Because you don't give blood to take it back again
Oh, we're all deserving something more

Progress, taste it, invest-it-all
Champagne breakfast for everyone
Break the innocent when they're proud
Raise the stakes, then bring 'em down
If they fail to obey, oh, if they fail to obey

Pledge your grievance to the flag
Because you don't give blood then take it back again
Oh, we're all deserving something more

I want to breathe
Follow the scene
I want to taste
Everyone I see
I want to run when I'm up high
I want to run into the sea
I only want life to be
I just want to be
I will feel alive as long as I am freeEmbed
