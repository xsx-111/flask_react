Parting Ways Lyrics
Behind her eyes there's curtains
And they are closed to hind the flames
Remains
She knows there future's burning
But she can smile just the same
Same

And though her mood is fine today
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Standing like a statue
A chin of stone a heart of clay
Hey

And though he's too big a man to say
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Drifting away
Drifting away
Drifting away, yeah
Drifting away
Drifting away
Drifting away, hey
