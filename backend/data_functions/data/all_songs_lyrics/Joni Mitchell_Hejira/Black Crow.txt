Black Crow Lyrics
There's a crow flying black and ragged, tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down to pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow flying in a blue sky

I took a ferry to the highway then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi and a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How am I ever going to know my home when I see it again?
I'm like a black crow flying in a blue, blue sky

In search of love and music, my whole life has been
Illumination, corruption, and diving, diving, diving, diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying in a blue sky

I looked at the morning after being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window and I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying in a blue sky
Oh, I'm like a black crow flying in a blue skyEmbed
