World-Lock LyricsThey will not introduce
An unconditioned mind
Into their closed network
Pathways strictly defined
Energy siphoned off
Into countless canals
Dividing our power
To irrigate accounts
Plain human behavior upholds
The architects brazen and cold
Who forge a system of control
And stamp their grid upon the soulEmbed
