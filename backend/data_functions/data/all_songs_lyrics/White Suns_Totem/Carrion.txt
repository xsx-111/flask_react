Carrion LyricsThe scavengers are circling
My decay has drawn them in
They are mocking and impatient
Yet safely out of reach
But their laughter fades
And the heat of my fist dissipates
I only hear a sound like the wind
Booming across the earth
I watch the clouds slide across the sky
Soon I will drift away as well
Let flowers burst from my chest
Let roots coil in my skull
Let them grow old and die again
Let me give back all I ever stoleEmbed
