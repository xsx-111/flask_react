Cathexis LyricsGather scorpion's charms
Assemble to circuit
Drawing power from my days
I come wielding an age
My strength is finite
I try to fill the cracks
With an astral substance
Culled from the holy dance
From my corner of sky
I watch myself gesture
And try to draw it out
From within a maze of doubtEmbed
