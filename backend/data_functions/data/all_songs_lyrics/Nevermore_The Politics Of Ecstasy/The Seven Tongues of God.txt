The Seven Tongues of God Lyrics
Every man will ask the questions
And every man will suffer blame and loss
Every day, you die a little, understand the change
And choose your path without disdain

The seven tongues of God are in my mind
They speak to me in ancient DNA design

I have never seen God
You have never seen God

And when they speak to me
And the seven tongues align
Programmed to desecrate
The pretentions in your mind
To further complicate, I will now state
That your convictions lack definition and form

Every day, there is a bleeding
Every time I watch the world slip by
Focus, the blind pretension underscoring pain
The path to solace felt in vain
The seven tongues of God are in my mind
They speak to me in ancient DNA design

I have never seen God
You have never seen God

And when they speak to me
And the seven tongues align
Programmed to desecrate
The pretentions in your mind
To further complicate, I will now state
That your convictions lack definition

And when they speak to me
And the seven tongues align
Programmed to desecrate
The pretentions in your mind
To further complicate, I will now state
That your convictions lack definition and form
To see the light is the purest form of reward

If God did not exist
It would be necessary to invent himEmbed
