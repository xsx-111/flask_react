The Tiananmen Man Lyrics
On June 5th, in the year of '89
He was unarmed with focused mind
Defiance glared down the barrel of the gun
Pointed from a tank in Tiananmen Square
And he stood there...

To control, to manipulate
The media: his power slave

He knew the world was watching
Knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny
In the square of Tiananmen
Ecstatic youth played with fire
Freedom, wash over them
Democracy, their desire
The Tiananmen man had a plan:

Manipulate the media

He used blind faith in the face of anarchy
The cybernetic rapture has begun to envelop me
Freedom is the rush, adrenaline high
Choice of the oppressed, wiling to die
Like a hostage, the government holds your drug
To control, to manipulate
The masses: their power slaves

He knew the world was watching
Knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny
In the square of Tiananmen
Ecstatic youth played with fire
Freedom, wash over them
Democracy, their desire
The Tiananmen man had a plan:

Manipulate the media

His act was a cybernetic gesture
His act was a cybernetic gesture

He knew the world was watching
Knew he had a plan
To confront the powerful tyranny
In the square of Tiananmen
Ecstatic youth played with fire
Freedom, wash over them
Democracy, their desire
The Tiananmen man had a plan:
Manipulate the media
Manipulate the media
Manipulate to controlEmbed
