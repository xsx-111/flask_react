This Sacrament Lyrics
There's no control
In the world today
And there's still no order
To this game we all play

Maybe none of us know
What's real

There's no constraint
When the walls cave in (Cave in)
The neuron turn on
The game begins to fade away

Maybe none of us know
Maybe none of us want to hear
Never push against the flow
Aimlessly

Feel the flow
And let all thought fade
We shall be one
For this sacrament has begun
Lucy in the sky (Lucy in the sky)
With diamond eyes (Her eyes are coals)
Long since dark
I wear her disguise of light

Maybe none of us know
Maybe none of us want to hear
Never push against the flow
Aimlessly

Feel the flow
And let all thought fade
We shall be one
For this sacrament has begun

This sacrament is a state of mind

There's no control
In the world today
And there's still no order
To this game we all play
Called life
Maybe none of us know
Maybe none of us want to hear
Never push against the flow
Aimlessly

Feel the flow
And let all thought fade
We shall be one
Through this sacrament

Feel the flow
(To become one with the flow)
And let all thought fade
(Is to realize purpose)
We shall be one
(To realize purpose
Is to become one with the flow)
For this sacrament has begun
(Become one with the flow)
This sacrament has begun
(Become one with the flow)
This sacrament
(Has begun)Embed
