Lost Lyrics
Who am I?

Learning ways to fly
Just never too high to die
Pushing limits into the ground
Until I never come down

Burning through lifetimes without form
Pure energy, I am the shattered norm

I'm the lost one
Chasing colors to the sun
Colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away

To swim these sentient seas
Windows into eternity
Never afraid to scale the wall
The lunatic never falls

Forfeiture of reality, seeds sown
Constructure of this path is not my own
I'm the lost one
Chasing colors to the sun
Colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away

Why should I come down?
From here, I can see forever...

"LSD is a powerful drug..."
"LSD is a powerful drug
But I definitely recommend it
For people with established mental problems..."

I'm the lost one
Chasing colors to the sun
Colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away

Remember in the end
Such a long, strange trip it's been
So, I sing this song
For the lost one
Why should I come down?
From here, I can see forever
I can see forever
I can see forever
I can see forever
I can see forever
I can see
