The Politics of Ecstasy Lyrics
"After I got arrested, I really got a warped sense
Of what 'justice' really is"

I hate you, the pigs who turn the screws
I hate everything you stand for
I hate the world we've bred, political pigs we've fed
Our fathers left us nothing but a dead world

Beyond repair, down in despair
Our fathers left us nothing

Choking on the influx of technology
I realize the politics of ecstasy

And we can't change what's in stone

We've been had, injustice to the masses
Destroy the land and crush the poor
The pigs are fueled by greed, political ways obscene
Our fathers left corruption in this dead world
Beyond repair, down in despair
Our fathers left us nothing

Choking on the puke of their industry
Regurgitated propaganda ministry

Freedom's never free
The politics of ecstasy are these...
Freedom's never free
These are the politics of ecstasy...

I hate you, the pigs who turn the screws
I hate everything you stand for
I hate the world we've bred, political pigs we've fed
Our fathers left us nothing but a dead world

Beyond repair, down in despair
Our fathers left us nothing

Choking on the influx of technology
I realize the politics of ecstasy
Freedom's never free
The politics of ecstasy are these...
Freedom's never free
The politics of ecstasy are these...

If you take a step back and you realize
Your home can't be a perfect world
There's still hope the hate you feel will fade
Injustice is gone...
Injustice is gone for a little whileEmbed
