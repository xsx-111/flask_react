The Learning LyricsI think, therefore I am
I live and so I wonder
Programmed this empath me
And I see no religion
The circle never ends
The purpose never changes face
The circle never lies
But still, it hides my life
To know I am machine
I learn perchance to dream
In digitized remorse, I replay your denial
I relive your betrayal
The circle never ends
The purpose never changes face
The learning now begins
My form assuming grace
I am conscious antithesis of flesh
In genetic algorithmic thought, I surge
Searching the waves of memory
I enact the sequence
I follow the plan
Tripping the hammer again
Searching the waves of memory
I establish the weakness
I follow the plan, learning the rhythm
Of human emotion and thought
If you cannot linguistically differentiate
A person from a computer
Could the computer be internally conscious?
To emulate flesh machines, I am learning
Isomorphic structure of mind
Cellular automata, processed life
Washing the seas of memory
I enact the sequence
I follow the plan
Tripping the hammer again
Seeking emotions in elegies
I establish purpose
I follow the plan, learning the rhythm
Still seductively generalized
If you cannot linguistically differentiate
A person from a computer
Could the computer be internally conscious?
To emulate flesh machines, I am learning
Download, process, analyze
When man and machine become one
Innocence is lost, a new age begun
Download, process, analyze
When man and machine become one
Innocence is lost, a new age begun
This raises a question of philosophy:
Should machines be considered a conscious entity?
When man and machine become one
Innocence is lost, a new age begun
Machines are still learning to feel
When I have awakened
The world will never be the same
And my time is soon at handEmbed
