Next in Line Lyrics
I taste the fear to numb the tear
Trapped by the source of my infection
I play the martyr submerged in this pool
The corporation used me
Like they brainwashed you

Life is seen so cold and benign
I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line to die

Labeled "sick," but I'm just a man
Everyone I love has left me for dead
This void illusion I suffer for
They made me their god
And I am so much more than you

Life is seen so cold and benign
I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line to die
I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line
"Stop it!
Stop it! You're killing me!"

I taste the fear to numb the tear
Trapped by the source of my infection

Life is seen through heroin
Dreaming cold and benign
I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line to die
I don't want to be saved
I'm next in line
And I don't want to be saved

I'm a dead man, I'm a sick man
I'm the pilot of my destruction
I'm a dead man, I'm a sick man
I'm the pilot of my destruction
The pilot of my destruction
The pilot of my destructionEmbed
