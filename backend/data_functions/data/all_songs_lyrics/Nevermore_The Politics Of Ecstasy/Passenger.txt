Passenger Lyrics
All passengers, prepare for the game ritual...

There once was a man on this train
He was born into this world alone
Hands never laid on the wheel
Content, he will never know more

He was a quiet man in pain
His tears, I fear, are closing in again
What you lose in years
You gain in perspective

And the passenger pauses to see his mistakes
For with nothing to follow
He'd lived all his life in vain
But then, who here among us is without shame?

His way was divergent and cold
Defaced, this mask he must create
And the circle unfolding still
Unscathed, he will turn a blind eye
He will miss the last train home this day
Recycled in the flow, reborn again
The cynic knows the price of everything
And the value of nothing

And the passenger pauses to see his mistakes
For with nothing to follow
He'd let all his will decay
But then, true wisdom comes in learning pain

And I have known pain

And the passenger pauses to see his mistakes
For with nothing to follow
He'd lived all his life in vain
But then, the lesson unlearned, he will begin again...Embed
