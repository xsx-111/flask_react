Deado Lyrics
Deado
Feel the work
Of the tooth-impacting jerks
Seem to measure you for size
They got metal in their eyes (oh yeah)
We're chasin' performance and several moods
Chasin' performance and several moods
Times where easy wages fat
Stumble on inflated stats

Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divine
Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divine

I can't employ the tactics
Already rented them out to my friend Snake
The equinox tail-chaser, super frail
Smoking in the fog
Set a trap in the mirage
Well we'll never see the rights
That won't see the libel till you file the fine
Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divine
Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divine
Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divine
Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divine


Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divine
Jen, you took me far into the long line
Divine, divine, divine, divineEmbed
