Church on White Lyrics
Bleed the pot
When you're hot you're hot
And when enough is enough
Do the fakers drop out?
Promise me
You will always be
Too awake to be famous
Too wired to be safe

But all you really wanted
Was everything
Plus everything
And the truth
I only poured you
Half a lie

Carry on
It's a marathon
Take me off the list
I don't want to be missed
Carrion
Its what we all become
From small minds and tall trees
Away from the action
But all you ever wanted
Was everything
And everything
Plus the truth
I only poured you
Half a lie
Half a lie
I only poured you half a lieEmbed
