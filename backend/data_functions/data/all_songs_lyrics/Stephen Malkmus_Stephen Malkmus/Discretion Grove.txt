Discretion Grove Lyrics
Hate recreated
A revelation
Uh, listen to me
I'll tell you I'm about to run
And the ceilings are undone
Specialized victories
For over-age whores
I felt up your feelings
And they left me no more time
To see what I want to find

(Believe) Let it go
(And leave) The shots enclosing
(Believe) Discretion grove
Well there’s time to go there
Yeah, there's time, there's time, there's time
To go there

A Celt alcoholic
Feeling past blue
I'm tryin to get up
From sending all my selves to you
And in times I tell to you
Major Alfonso
Mined up the gold
The ceremonial dead trees
Told him all that he could do
And it's all we do to run, run, run, run

(Believe) Let it go
(And leave) The shots enclosing
(Believe) Discretion grove
For it's time to go there

You're never gonna run around until the sun is down
You're gonna hear the sound of a crazy ship
On an insane raid
Just crash our wind on a manic bay
You're never gonna run aground until the sun is down
You’re gonna hear the sound of a crazy ship
On an insane raid
Just crash our wind on a manic bay
Just crash our wind on a manic bay
Just crash our wind on a manic bay
Just crash our wind on a manic bayEmbed
