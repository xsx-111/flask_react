Leisurely Poison (Bonus Track) LyricsA cup of leisurely poison a devilish sun
Beat tender on us with a work in leisure glass
Lights come on early don’t lose your batons
Let’s steal the majestic intensive purposes on
Intents and purposes on
I came home early troubles awoke
The poison is plastic in cinema
Well grapes on the
(French)
Things you gotta know about
They tell you that they’re wrong about
The way you tie in things you go and ways to go to the cocktail show
I know that life will tear you from the things you get it down
Dragon to blue dragon to blue dragon to blue
We get neighbor in troubles that rile
And things that get ten from the shavers arrive
And you are the poison from things that we need
And boys that get boisterous are running away shame shameEmbed
