Black Book Lyrics
Offer your trust to a friend who is not what he says
And he knows when you're dry, what you're thinkin'
Trout in the brook, you're about to get hooked
To a greedy false un-Catholic knave

The black book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified
Cousin why? Cousin why? Cousin why?
The Black Book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified
Cousin why? Cousin why? Cousin why?

I took the locomotive to Kreuzberg
I passed through the scenery
And passengers got on that train too
And they really surprised me when they said

The black book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified
Cousin why? Cousin why? Cousin why?
The black book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified
Cousin why? Cousin why? Cousin why?


I've got some friends
But I got some enemies too
And yes I got some people in between
People just like you

The black book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified
Cousin why? Cousin why? Cousin why?
The black book you took
Was permanent-ally diversified

Diversify with your zatch
Diversify with your zatchEmbed
