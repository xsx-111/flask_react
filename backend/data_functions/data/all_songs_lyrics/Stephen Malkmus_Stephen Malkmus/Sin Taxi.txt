Sin Taxi LyricsMake it new the old ones sound like covered wagons over dry ground
The riding crop pains a domestic sin taxi encoded fare
Take your belongings when you go but please don’t for get to have a wonderful day
The room is spotless except for that you wouldn’t know inhabitants inhabited the room
The sin taxi encodes your fare take your belongings when you go
Don’t forget to have a special dayEmbed
