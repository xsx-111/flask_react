Waking Up Lyrics
Is a lie just the truth uncovered and relinquished?
A passion for all young fools
Is a lie more than truth?
A question left unanswered
To feed the failure of our choices

And in my hand our blood recovered
And for our faith we're undeserved
And in my hand our blood recovered
And in your faith completely

Do we wait all this time
And follow blindly hating
Killing all that we survey
Must we hate all this time
And let our anger lead us
Lead us to our bitter end


You're wasting our time
You're wasting our time
When everything's said and done
We're dead and buried
We're dead and buried
We're dead and buried
We're dead and buried
We're dead and buried
And will this never end
I'm tired of all this walking
And if this never ends
I'll walk until my feet are bleeding
Oh until my feet are bleeding
Oh until my feet are bleeding
Oh until my feet are bleeding
Oh until my feet areEmbed
