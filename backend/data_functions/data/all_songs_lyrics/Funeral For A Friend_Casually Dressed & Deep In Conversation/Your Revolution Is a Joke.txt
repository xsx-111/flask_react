Your Revolution Is a Joke LyricsThey stand to fight for nothing
And show how stupid we've become
As fortune favors only
Those who care too much to see
It will never be OK
As some will say
We stand to fight for nothing
So close your eyes and stay away
Don't believe their headlines
They poison our minds everyday
It will never be the same
With purpose buried every day
And lies that lead you to the grave
As some will say
And it will never be OK
As some will say
With purpose buried every day
As some will say
Lies that lead you to the grave
As some will say
Your revolution is a joke
As I will say1Embed
