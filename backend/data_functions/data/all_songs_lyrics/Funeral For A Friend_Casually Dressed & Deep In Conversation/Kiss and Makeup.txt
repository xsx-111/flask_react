Kiss and Makeup LyricsNo matter where you go, they'll fucking tie you down
And bleed you from your wrists, bleed you from your wrists
Well, it's better that we leave
Leave it this way, leave it this way
And just to soften the blow
I'll steal all of your kisses
We sew them up
In the creases of our hearts
No matter where you go, they'll fucking tie you down
And bleed you from your wrists, bleed you from your wrists
Well, it's better that we leave
Leave it this way, leave it this way
And just to soften the blow
I'll steal all of your kisses
We sew them up
In the creases of our hearts
And just to soften the blow
I'll steal all of your kisses
We sew them up
In the creases of our
Hearts, hearts
I never really loved you anyway
Hearts, hearts
I never really loved you anyway
Hearts, hearts
I never really loved you anyway
Hearts, hearts
I never really loved you anyway
And on the one thing, you betted on
Don't ever let them take you down
Oh, on the one thing, you betted on
Don't ever let them take you downEmbed
