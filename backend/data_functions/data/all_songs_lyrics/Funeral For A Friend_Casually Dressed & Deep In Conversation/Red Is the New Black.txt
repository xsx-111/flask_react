Red Is the New Black LyricsCan't pretend that you're nothing special
You've got to look at all of your options
You can't decide what to go for when it's all about trust
It's all about trust
You see yourself on the TV
You read your magazines
You can't explain how it's come to be this
Stop and think
When it's all about trust
It's all about trust
This coverage, your centre spread
Your neon light daydream will shatter and break
And if you think I'm thinking of your value here
You're the one, you're the one who's losing control
Oh, this eventual stop, this break in the mould
I scream down this hotline just to feel something
This eventual stop, this break in the mould
I scream down this hotline just to feel something
This situation isn't getting any better
I see the look in your eyes
You want to see a pretty face?
There isn't anything wrong with giving up
And for what it's worth
I still hate you
Oh, this eventual stop, this break in the mould
I scream down this hotline just to feel something
This eventual stop, this break in the mould
I scream down this hotline just to feel something
Just to feel something
Just to feel something
Just to feel something
Just to feel something
Something, just to feel something
Something, just to feel something
Something, just to feel something
Something, just to feel something
The situation isn't getting any better (losing control)
I see that look in your eyes
The situation isn't getting any better (losing control)
I see that look in your eyes
The situation isn't getting any better (losing control)
I see that look in your eyes
This situation is... it's all fucked1Embed
