Novella Lyrics
Wasting time, it's over and ended
Wasting time, we deserve
Hold that line, they ask us in safety
Hold that line, when we talk

I can see the headlights and pavements
My legs can't carry me that far
If this distance isn't enough they'll cry another river to see you drown (see you drown)

Faceless lies, it's easy to speak when
Every word is your own
Selfish eyes look onward in protest
As we tear down their disguise
Their disguise
(I can see the headlights)

Your days were golden
Your days were golden while we bled...
Your days were golden
Your days were golden while we bled...
While we bled...
While we bled...Embed
