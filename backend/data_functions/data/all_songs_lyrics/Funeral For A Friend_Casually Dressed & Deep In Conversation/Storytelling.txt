Storytelling Lyrics
You say it's not going to work out
Why do you have to tell me now?
Is there a difference in anything you've said and done?
Or is it just the way we've been pretending?

I'm leaving, I'm leaving
Do me a favour; don't even think of me now
Just when you thought this was over
It had only just begun
Just when you thought this was over
It'd only just begun

I'm not going to let this tear me apart
She's not my only reason
"He's not my only reason", she said
You're a weakness to me
You should've sent me a note or wrote me a letter

I wish it was how we planned
"Everything will work out" (x2)
You said I hated you
If only that were true
You should have said that we'd be happy now
You said I hated you
If only that were true
You should have said that we'd be happy now, yeah
I should have said that we'd be happy now
I should have said that we'd be happy now
(I wish it was how we planned)
I should have said that we'd be happy now
(I wish it was how we planned)
I should have said that we'd be happy now
I wish it was...Embed
