Rookie of the Year LyricsThe promise that he made
Left broken on the floor
The bruise left round your heart
Left you begging for more
The promise that he made
Left broken on the floor
The bruise left round your heart
Left you begging for more
Left you begging for more
Thank you for making me worthless in your eyes
In hope and desperation
I'll find my only light
In your white wedding dress
In your white wedding dress
Thank you for making this the best day of my life
In hope and desperation
I'll find my only light
In your white wedding dress
In your white wedding dress
And in the mess of all we've seen
I am open to everything
Hope and desperation
My only light
And time will take us all
And drown us in its wake
And clearly I will stay
And wipe the blood from your
White wedding dress (wipe the blood from your...)
Your white wedding dress (wipe the blood from your...)Embed
