Juneau LyricsTied to the testing of wills, where my heart breaks and spills
Left to the sight of the sky, in your arms I'm
Thrown to the wolves in the minds of your enemies
In the minds of your enemies
And I'm stone in the eyes of your foolishness
If this is what I'm meant for, no longer interesting
Fall forward to even the score
Just a thought to you
Tied to the testing of wills, where my heart breaks and spills
Left to the sight of the sky, in your arms I'm
Thrown to the wolves in the minds of your enemies
In the minds of your enemies
And I'm stone in the eyes of your foolishness
And I'm nothing more than a line in your book
Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book
Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book
Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book
In your book, in your book
If this is what I'm meant for, no longer interesting
Fall forward to even the score
Just a thought to you
(Just a thought to you)
(Just a thought to you)
Yet I'm nothing more
Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book
Yet I'm nothing more than a line in your book3Embed
