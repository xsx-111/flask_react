Bend Your Arms to Look Like Wings LyricsAs the sun sets
On battlefields
I hope you can save me
I hope you can save our wounded hearts
And distance (creation)
Makes my heart (eternity)
Go colder (enough for this to end)
And distance (creation)
Makes my heart (eternity)
Seem older (for you)
It's just enough to cut the air
From your lungs (from your lungs)
As the sun sets (we push and pull apart)
On battlefields (enough for this to end)
I hope you can save me (from ourselves)
I hope you can save us from ourselves
Denial (forever)
In the arms of (we're stuck in here)
Our saviors (enough for this to end)
And my heart (fills up with)
Is torn (into)
Into pieces (for you)
Its just enough to cut the air
From your lungs (from your lungs)
As the sun sets (we push and pull apart)
On battlefields (enough for this to end)
I hope you can save me (from ourselves)
I hope you can save us from ourselves
And paper cuts
And bloody hands
In the middle, they would meet
And paper cuts
And bloody hands
In the middle, they would meet

(as the sun sets)Embed
