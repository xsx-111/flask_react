Hello, There Lyrics
Hooked up on a fishing line
Looking for the break of day
I've never been here before anyway
It's the wine in my feet that's to blame
Settled down in the mud, giving everybody blood
It's not such a beautiful thing to do
Left the castle in Spain in an ambulance all the way
Could it be that the clock's really stopped?

Hello, there everybody
When's the next train out of here?
I'm sorry, but I'm much too young for this
I'll come back again next year

He came to lend a helping hand
To the miller and the butcher's band
Someone took the tuba for a pony ride
And the music sounded so much better
Taking turns having fun when there's not enough sun
It was midnight when the chorus came
Then the piano collapsed in a heap on the grass
And they blamed it on a rock 'n roll song
Hello, there everybody
When's the next train out of here?
I'm sorry, but I'm much too young for this
I'll come back again next year
Yes I'll come back again next year1Embed
