Please Lyrics
Won't you help me please I'm growing old
A million years ago
Won't you help me sneeze I've caught a cold
Another way to go

Just hold on tightly
This show's on nightly
They speak so very slow
It gets so hard to follow
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah

Slowly in the mist of captive eyes
To carry you from home
Hansom cab again from dawn 'til dusk
My power amphibious bride

I'll just leave you here like this
I'm sure you won't be missed
Before this night is done
These words won't seem so wrong
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah

But it can't be that bad
Back up in Trinidad
Come down and see me soon
When you get back from the moon
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah1Embed
