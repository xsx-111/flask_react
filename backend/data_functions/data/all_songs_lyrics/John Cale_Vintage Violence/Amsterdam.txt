Amsterdam Lyrics
She's back from Amsterdam
And I think the journey did her well
Her face has lost its touch
The tell-tale signs of loneliness inside
But I love her still
And need her company still more
Come down, come down
Come down, come down once more
And I think the journey did her well

She says she fell in love
With men who knew the way to treat a lady
Her life has settled for the best of things
That I couldn't give her
And it's not her fault
She's not the one to blame
Come down, come down
Come down, come down once more
And I do believe the journey did her well
Yes I do believe the journey did her well1Embed
