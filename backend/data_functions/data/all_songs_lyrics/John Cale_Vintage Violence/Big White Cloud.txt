Big White Cloud Lyrics
When I stand, my back to the sea
A big white cloud looking right down at me
The sound of the sun piercing my eyes
Everything's clear, everything's bright

Big white cloud, big white cloud
Big white cloud on me
Big white cloud, big white cloud
Big white cloud on me

Time to kill on a hill
Looking at leaves licking the trees
Looking for signs, wind and the rain

Oh I love it, yes I love it
Oh I love it so
Oh I love it, yes I love it
Oh I love it so

After all is said and done
Everything is just like it began
Days that came, years again
Came and went once again
Oh I love it, yes I love it
Oh I love it so
Oh I love it, yes I love it
Oh I love it so
Oh I love it, yes I love it
Oh I love it so1Embed
