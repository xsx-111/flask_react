Adelaide Lyrics
I want to go home, I want to go home
I want to go back to Adelaide
It' s time for a change, don't want to be late
It's probably night in Adelaide

And in a day or two
I'll be there asking for you
To come back to Adelaide with me
The weather there's so good

So pass me the phone, I'll go it alone
I'll whistle my way to Adelaide
There's no time to cry, I'll be there tonight
The trains and the boats and planes are on time

But before I go (I go)
I'm knock-knocking on your front door (your door)
Be sure to say good-bye to your friends
And to all my friends back home
Whoa

But before I go (I go)
I'm knock-knocking on your front door (your door)
Be sure to say good-bye to your friends
And to all my friends back home
Oh Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide, I want you tonight
Adelaide, Adelaide
Adelaide, Adelaide...Embed
