Cleo Lyrics
Cleo, Cleo
Won't you come around and play girl
Cleo, Cleo
Won't you come around and stay girl

You can find the lines to say if you try
(If you try)
Someone else has just confessed
To drinking up all your wine

Cleo, Cleo
There's a way for you to find out
How you should say
What you think is the way out

Will you, won't you
Won't you, will you see me through?
(See me through)
Maybe you could help me find
A thing or two about you

Cleo, Cleo
Now's the time for you to tell me
If you want to
You can leave it up to me girl

After you have told me what you wanna do
(Wanna do)
I could tell you that I loved you
If I thought that it would be true

Cleo, Cleo
Oh Cleo I want you, me oh my
Cleo I want you, me oh my
Cleo I want you, me oh my
Cleo I want you, me oh my
Cleo I want you, me oh myEmbed
