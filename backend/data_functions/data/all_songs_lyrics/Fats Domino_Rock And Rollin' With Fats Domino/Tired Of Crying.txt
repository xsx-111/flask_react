Tired Of Crying LyricsOh baby, I'm tired of crying over you
Oh baby, I'm tired of crying over you
I cried that I love you so
But that's where I ain't gonna cry no more
Yes you went away, now you want to come back
No no no baby, there ain't no day like that
I'm gonna be mean like you wanted to be
As I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry for me
Yes you heard my song, you heard it once before
No matter what you do, you gotta reap what you sow
Yeah baby, that's the way it's gonna be
As I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry for meEmbed
