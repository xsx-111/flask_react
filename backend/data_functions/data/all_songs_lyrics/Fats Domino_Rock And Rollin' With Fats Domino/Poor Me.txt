Poor Me LyricsWoke up this mornin' feelin' low
Where my loved one used to live, she ain't there no more
Poor me, why such bad luck put on me
Poor me, I'm living in misery
What I'm gonna do is hard to tell
I'm not gonna kill myself, though I might as well
Poor me, why such bad luck put on me
Poor me, I'm living in misery
All I do, all day long
Fall down on my knees and pray
She'll come back home
Poor me, why such bad luck put on me
Poor me, I'm living in misery
All I do, all day long
Fall down on my knees and pray
She'll come back home
Poor me, why such bad luck put on me
Poor me, I'm living in miseryEmbed
