Bo Weevil LyricsOn Saturday night
Where I was born
Down on the farm
Guitar plinking
And we started drinking
Til the break of dawn
About twelve o'clock
Everything get hot
Up steps old John
We started clapping
And he started singing
This sweet little country song
Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil
Where've you been all day
Yo mama been looking
Had to stop cooking
Since you went away
Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil
Why did you go and stay
You get a licking
As sure as I'm seated
On this bale of hay
On Saturday night
Where I was born
Down on the farm
Guitar plinking
And we started drinking
Til the break of dawn
About twelve o'clock
Everything get hot
Up steps old John
We started clapping
And he started singing
This sweet little country song
Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil
Where've you been all day
Mama been looking
Had to stop cooking
Since you went away
Bo Weevil, Bo Weevil
Why'd you go and stay
Mama gonna whip you
As sure as I'm sitting
On this bale of hayEmbed
