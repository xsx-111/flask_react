Rose Mary LyricsIf you see Rose Mary
Tell her I'm comin' home to stay
Tell her I'm tired of trav'lin' out here
Can't go on this way
Every night when I'm trav'lin' meet a friend
Tell 'em I'm comin' home to stay
So if you see Rose Mary
Tell her, tell her I'm on my way
When I get back home I'm gonna hold Rose Mary in my arms
Never more to travel, never more to roamEmbed
