All By Myself Lyrics
Little girl, don't you understand?
I wanna be your loving man

All by myself, all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
I wanna love you all by myself

You'll find little girl you know it too
Don't you know I'm in love with you

All by myself, all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
I wanna love you all by myself

Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one
We will go on out and have some fun

All by ourself, all by ourself
We don't need nobody with us
We gonna do it all by ourself

Meet me in the parlor 'bout half past one
We will go on out and have some fun

All by ourself, all by ourself
We don't need nobody with us
We gonna have it all by ourself

Little girl, don't you understand?
I wanna be your loving man

All by myself, all by myself
We don't want no one to love you
We will love you all by myselfEmbed
