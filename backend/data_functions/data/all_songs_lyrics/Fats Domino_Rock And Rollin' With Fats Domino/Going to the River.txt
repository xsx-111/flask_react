Going to the River LyricsI'm goin' to the river
Gonna jump overboard and drown
I'm goin' to the river
Gonna jump overboard and drown
Because the gal I love
She just done let me down
Now when she left me
I bowed my head and cried
When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
I never though I would be
I would be the one to cry
If you see my mama
Tell her good-bye for me
If you see my mama
Tell her good-bye for me
I'm tired of livin'
Livin' in misery
If you see my mama
Tell her good-bye for me
If you see my mama
Tell her good-bye for me
Ya know I'm tired of livin'
Livin' in misery1Embed
