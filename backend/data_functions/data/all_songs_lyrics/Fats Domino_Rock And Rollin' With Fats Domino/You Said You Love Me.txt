You Said You Love Me LyricsYou said you love me
How come you treat me like you do?
You said you love me
How come you treat me like you do?
You're acting, baby
Like you'll find somebody new
I give you all of my money
And all my loving too
I give you all my money
And all my loving too
Now tell me, baby, tell me
What more can I do?
You got me worried
You got me worried over you
Yes, you got me worried
You got me worried over you
If you don't come back to me
I don't know what I'm gonna doEmbed
