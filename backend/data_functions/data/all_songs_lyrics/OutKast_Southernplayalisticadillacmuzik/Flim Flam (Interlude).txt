Flim Flam (Interlude) Lyrics

Ay, J, man, what you wanna drink on?

Shit, man, let's sip on some of that Hennessy

Cool, man
Ay, man, who the fuck is this?

Ay, ay, ay, my nigga, roll your window down, man, roll your window down
Wassup playa, ay, I got these gold chains, 14K, 80 dollars
Got—ay, 'fore you say anything, got 'em off some white folks in Buckhead, 14K

Man, I don't need no chains, man
I don't need nothin', I'm straight

Naw, check game, 80 dollars, bro
14-karat gold is what I'm trying to tell ya now
Look, now, look, check it out...
Man, what? Nigga, you trying to play me some fool or something? This shit ain't real, nigga

I said 14 muthafuckin' K, white folks in Bankhead—Buckhead, man...

Go on, man, go on, go on, nigga...

Oh, that's a muthafuckin' pimp—nigga, what's up?
Man, holla at a nigga, man
80 dollars for this 14-karat gold chain, man—what It is?

Naw, man, ain't got it, Gipp ain't got it
I'll give you a sack, nigga, what's up with that?
I'll give you a fuckin' sack

A what? A sack? Nigga, sack deez
I want greens, bills, dividends is what I'm talkin' 'bout

Fuck that shit then, get the hell on
Recognize, 80 dollars, 14K, what y'all niggas wanna do?

Get the hell on, nigga!

Alright, bro, just give me—hold on, man, just give me a sack, man
I'll just go sell the shit and make about 20 dollars, you know'm'sayin'
Come on up real like that

That bullshit ain't even worth no sack...

Man, fuck y'all...Embed
