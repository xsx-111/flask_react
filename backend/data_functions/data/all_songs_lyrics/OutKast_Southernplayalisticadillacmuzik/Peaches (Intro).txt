Peaches (Intro) Lyrics

Yeah, mm-mm-mm
That shit sure feel good
Hey playa, this Peaches
Coming back at you one mo' 'gain with a big whassup
Break out your black love, and your Boone's Farm
As I send it out one more time
For East Point, College Park, Decatur, and the SWATS
We got that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik for yo' trunk
And it's fat like hambone, and tight like gnat booty
So let me take you deep, straight to the point
Cause it ain't nothing but king shit, all day, everyday1Embed
