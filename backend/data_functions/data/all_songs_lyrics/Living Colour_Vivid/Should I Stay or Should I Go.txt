Should I Stay or Should I Go Lyrics
Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here till the end of time
So, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine, the next it's black
So if you want me off your back
So, come on and let me know
Should I quit or should I blow?

Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
If I quit it will be double
So, come on and let me know

This indecision's buggin' me
If you don't want me, set me free
Exactly who I'm supposed to be
I don't know which clothes even fit me
So, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go, go, go, go, go?
Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go there will be trouble
If I quit it will be double, ha!
So, come on and let me know
Come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I
Go?Embed
