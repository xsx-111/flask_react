Middle Man Lyrics
I don't have a need
To be the best
Don't want to be
Just like the rest
Just stay who I am
Just an ordinary
Middle man

Give me
The happy medium
Don't want to be
The one whose leading them, no, no
I've got no master plan
Just a simple
Middle man

Standing on a fine line between this and that
Just biding my time
Waiting for a sign
To tell me that I'm something special
Well, well

My ideas
Are mine alone
Not yours, not theirs
But I care
I hurt for you
But not with you
I love that thing
That's inside you
But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I am your middle man
But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I am your middle man

Middle man yeah, yeah
I'm not your fan
I'm just a middle man
Yours, theirs, but I care
I've got no master plan
Just be who I am
Just a middle manEmbed
