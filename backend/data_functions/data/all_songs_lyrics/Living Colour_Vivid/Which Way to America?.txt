Which Way to America? Lyrics
I look at the T.V
Your America's doing well
I look out the window
My America's catching hell

I just wanna know
Which way do I go
To get to your America?
I just wanna know
Which way do I go
To get to your America?

I change the channel
Your America's doing fine
I read the headlines
My America's doing time

I just wanna know
Which way do I go
To get to your America?
I just wanna know
Which way do I go
To get to your America?
(Go west young man, go west young man, go west young man, go west)
Don't want to crossover
(Go west young man, go west young man, go west young man, go west)
But how do I keep from going under?
(Where's my picket fence?
My long, tall glass of lemonade?
Where's my VCR, my stereo, my T.V. show?)
(Where's my picket fence?
My long, tall glass of lemonade?
Where's my VCR, my stereo, my T.V. show?)

I look at the T.V
I don't see your America
I look out the window
I don't see your America
I want to know how to get to your America!
I wanna know how to get to your America!
I wanna know how to get to your America!
I want to know how to get to your America!
America!
America!
America!
America!
I!
Yeah!
I!
Whoo!Embed
