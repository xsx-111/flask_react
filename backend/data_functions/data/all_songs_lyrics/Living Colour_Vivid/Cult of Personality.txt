Cult of Personality Lyrics
And during the few moments that we have left, we want to talk, right down to earth, in a language that everybody here can easily understand
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
The cult of personality
I know your anger, I know your dreams
I've been everything you wanna be, oh
I'm the cult of personality
Like Mussolini and Kennedy
I'm the cult of personality, the cult of personality
The cult of personality

Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a mirror speaks, the reflection lies
You won't have to follow me
Only you can set me free

I sell the things you need to be
I'm the smiling face of your TV, oh
I'm the cult of personality
I exploit you, still, you love me
I tell you one and one makes three, oh
I'm the cult of personality
Like Joseph Stalin and Gandhi, oh
I'm the cult of personality, the cult of personality
The cult of personality
Neon lights, Nobel Prize
When a leader speaks, that leader dies
He won't have to follow me
Only you can set you free


You gave me fortune, you gave me fame
You gave me power in your God's name
I'm every person you need to be
Oh, I'm, the, cult, of, per, so, na, lity
I am the cult of, I am the cult of, I am the cult of, I am the cult of
I am the cult of, I am the cult of, I am the cult of, I am the cult of
Personality

Ask not what your country can do for you
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself26Embed
