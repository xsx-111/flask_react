Broken Hearts Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
Put your hands together

I see the fragments of the dreams I used to have
And bits of aspiration lying in the sand
The stained glass wall of love
That I cannot see through
Provides the only light
Here in my lonely room
A breeze reminds me of a changing time and place
A tear that takes forever rolls down your timeless face

I hear they say that broken hearts will mend
But when they do they're never good as new
I wish right now that I could change it back
I never meant to do the things I did to hurt you

I never really thought that it would come to this
Sometimes the things you lose are often the things you miss
I see the reasons for the things I used to do
They're all transparent now and so I see the truth
Hoah, hoah
I hear they say that broken hearts will mend
But when they do they're never good as new
I wish right now that I could change it back
I know you don't believe, but I care about you
And I never meant to do those things I did to hurt you
