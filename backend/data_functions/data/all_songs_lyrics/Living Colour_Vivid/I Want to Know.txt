I Want to Know Lyrics
Hey kids
Let's go!

Baby, you stole my heart
I don't know what to do
Got one problem on my mind
Do you feel the way I do?

I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine

When you walk down the street
The cats don't even make a noise
They worship at your feet
Acting just like little boys
I'm standing in the shadows baby
I got one thing that's on my mind
Gonna make you love me baby
If it takes the rest of my life
I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine

It takes a lot of guts to show you how I feel
Well, about you
Just say the words and let me know that this is real for you
Or is it just a dream
(Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream)

I'm very patient baby
And I've got a lot of time
I can see a clear horizon
You and me standing side by side

I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
I wanna know
Give me a sign, girl
Open your heart and tell me that you're mine
How you feel?
Babe, babe
Let me know!
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna knowEmbed
