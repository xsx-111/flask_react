Desperate People Lyrics
Yeah-eah
Oh, oh, oh, hoah

I see you cryin' in the sunshine
I hear you laughin' in the rain
You say you can't tell any difference
Between the pleasure and the pain
You say you never ever dream at nighttime
You say you only dream when you're awake
And say that T.V. looks like your life
And the life you lead is fake

Desperate people
Desperate people

You get your sunshine from a tab of paper
Then you're sittin' in a spinning room
The clock is tocking, it's laughing at you
Your life's a mystery without a clue
The crowd you're in thinks you're so amusin'
They're oh so flattering and so sincere
They stand and laugh as they watch you crumble
And when you cry for help they don't hear
No
Desperate people
Desperate people

You feel the earth revolving
You see the sun dissolving
You hear the night calling out to you
You have no direction
And you have no protection
What you gonna do when your trip turns blue?
When you come crashing down
And there's no help around
You need friends, you need help
But first you have to help yourself
Yeah
Yeah

The music stops and the party's over
Yeah, the money's gone and your crowd is too
Can't break the chains that have kept you under
Ow, has the monkey got the best of you?
And I see you cryin' in the sunshine
And I hear you laughin' in the rain
You say you can't tell any difference
Between the pleasure and the
Pain
Desperate
Desperate
Desperate
