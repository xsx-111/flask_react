Funny Vibe Lyrics
No, I'm not gonna rob you
No, I'm not gonna beat you
(Beat you)
No, I'm not gonna rape you
So why you wanna give me that funny vibe?
(Funny, funny vi-, funny, funny vibe)
(Funny, funny vi-, funny, funny vibe)

No, I'm not gonna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna harm you
(Harm you)
And I try not to hate you
So why you wanna give me that funny vibe?

Hey, Chuck, we got some non-believers out there

Yeah, Flav, I'm tired of them dissing brothers in the P.E. out there, we got to do something about this
(What-a we do? What-a we do?)
Ya know what I'm sayin'?

Funny vibe
Why you wanna give me that?
(Why you wanna give me that?)
