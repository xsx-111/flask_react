Crystal Gazing Lyrics
Watching for a spot, it's a moonlight show
Reaching through the dark, do you have to go?
Try to put a message through to your sweetheart
Won't you like to know the secrets of the heart?

Crystal gazing, crystal gazing
Whatcha gonna find in crystal gazing?
Crystal gazing, crystal gazing
Whatcha gonna find in crystal gazing?

Voices in the dark and the lights burn low
Teachers of the art that you never know
Try to put a message through to your sweetheart
Won't you like to know the secrets of the heart?

Crystal gazing, crystal gazing
Whatcha gonna find in crystal gazing?
Crystal gazing, crystal gazing
Whatcha gonna find in crystal gazing?

Pictures from the night, won't you be my guide?
What you talk about on the other side?
Carry you a message through from your sweetheart
Won't you like to know the secrets of the heart?
Crystal gazing, crystal gazing
Whatcha gonna find in crystal gazing?
Crystal gazing, crystal gazing
Whatcha gonna find in crystal gazing?

Watching for a spark, it's a moonlight show
Reaching through the dark, do you have to go?
Try to put a message through to your sweetheart
Won't you like to know the secrets of the heart?
Watching for a spark, it's a moonlight show
Reaching through the dark, do you have to go?Embed
