Poison Arrows Lyrics
Silence in the air
Is anybody there?
Searching every sound
Walking on quiet ground

Somebody's out to get you
Hiding in shadows - poison arrows
Somebody's out to break you
Hiding in narrows - poison arrows

When you gonna brake?
Watching every move you make
And every thing you do
Evil eyes'll be on you

Somebody's out to get you
Hiding in shadows - poison arrows
Somebody's out to break you
Hiding in narrows - poison arrows

Don't give in, don't come any closer, no sir
Keep running, coming in closer, closer

Don't give in don't come any closer, no sir
Keep running coming in closer no sir

What you gonna do
Time is running out on you
Anywhere you choose
Anyway you're gonna lose

Somebody's out to get you
Hiding in shadows - poison arrows
Somebody's out to break you
Hiding in narrows - poison arrows
Somebody's out to get you
Hiding in shadows - poison arrows
Somebody's out to break you
Hiding in narrows - poison arrows
Somebody's out to get you...Embed
