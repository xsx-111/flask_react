Saved by a Bell LyricsWould you like to look through my telescope?
The milky way's a fine sight to see
All around our universe, we try so hard to view
What's new
Make a trip down to sagittarius
And take a spin by some nebula
I hope the sky stays clear for us, the night goes on so far
In stars
Saved by a bell
Suffering hell
But you were too blind to tell
Saved by a bell
Suffering hell
And you made it through so well
Shining like bright diamonds, the galaxies
Jupiter and saturn spin by
Passing by companions, they all go drifting by
They fly!
Carry me down to see aquarius
We're hoping to meet a shooting star
I can see there's going to be a message from afar
How close we are
Saved by a bell
Suffering hell
But you were too blind to tell
Saved by a bell
Suffering hell
And you made it through so wellEmbed
