Talk About Your Life Lyrics
Walking out in the street light, midnight
Whispery wind, catch me in the headlight
Talk about your life, I'd like to know
It's not easy going where no-one goes
And no-one knows

Do we have to be so distant?
How can you be so unreal?
What's the reason for hiding, and
How does crying make you feel?

I can see you're talking to me in riddles
Do what you like, you go where the wind blows
Talk about your life, I'd like to know
It's not easy going where no-one goes
And no-one knows

Do we have to be so distant?
How can you be so unreal?
(Talk about your life)
What's the reason for hiding, and
How does crying make you feel?
I reach for certain disguise
That you're weaving
And i can tell by the mist in your eyes
That you're dreaming
Dreaming

Do we have to be so distant?
How can you be so unreal?

In the clouds, running and chasing shadows
In the crowd, frozen in the window
Talk about your life, I'd like to know
It's not easy going where no-one goes
And no-one knows

Do we have to be so distant?
How can you be so unreal?
(Talk about your life)
What's the reason for hiding, and
How does crying make you feel?
(Talk about your life)
Do we have to be so distant?
(Do we have to be so distant?)
How can you be so unreal?
(How can you be so unreal?)
What's the reason for hiding, and
(What's the reason for hiding, and)
How does crying make you feel?
(How does crying make you feel?)

Do we have to be so distant?
(Do we have to be so distant?)
How can you be so unreal?
(How can you be so unreal?)
What's the reason for hiding, and
(What's the reason for hiding, and)
How does crying make you feel?
(How does crying make you feel?)

Do we have to be so distant?
(Do we have to be so distant?)
How can you be so unreal?
(How can you be so unreal?)
What's the reason for hiding, and
(What's the reason for hiding, and)
How does crying make you feel?
(How does crying make you feel?)Embed
