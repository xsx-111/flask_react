Discovery Lyrics
When you want the score
When you need a helping hand
When you find closed doors
When you're back where you began
Keeping those secrets
Telling those lies
Can anybody tell me what's the big surprise?

Discovery
Who has the chance to know it all?
Discovery
Give me some truth, stop making me cry
Discovery


How can you sleep?
How can you turn away?
Thinking so cheap
Someday you're gonna pay
You're keeping secrets
I can see in your eyes
Can anybody tell me why the big disguise?
Discovery
Who has the chance to know it all?
Discovery
Give me some truth, stop making me cry
Discovery


Discovery
Who has the chance to know it all?
Discovery
Give me some truth, now, stop making me cry

Please give me some chance
Give me some confidence
Would you be something free?
Oh, someone deliver me
Who's keeping secrets?
I've got my spies
Does anybody think we live in paradise?

Discovery
Who has the chance to know it all?
Discovery
Give me some truth, now, stop making me cry
Discovery
Who has the chance to know it all?
Discovery
Give me some truth, now, stop making me cry
Discovery
