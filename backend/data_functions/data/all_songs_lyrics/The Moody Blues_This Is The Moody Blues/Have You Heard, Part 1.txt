Have You Heard, Part 1 LyricsNow you know that you are real
Show your friends that you and me
Belong to the same world
Turned on to the same word
Have you heard?
Now you know that you are free
Living all your life at ease
Each day has its always
A look down life's hallways, doorways
To lead you thereEmbed
