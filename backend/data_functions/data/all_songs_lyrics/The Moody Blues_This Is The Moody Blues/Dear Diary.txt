Dear Diary Lyrics
Dear diary, what a day it's been
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream
Woke up too late, wasn't where I should have been
For goodness' sake what's happening to me?

Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary

It was cold outside my door
So many people by the score
Rushing around so senselessly
They don't notice there's people like me

Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary

They don't know what they're playing
No, they've no way of knowing what the game is
Still they carry on doing what they can

Outside me, oh politely, dear diary
It's over, will tomorrow be the same?
I know that they're really not to blame
If they weren't so blind then surely they'd see
There's a much better way for them to be

Inside me, yours truly, dear diary

Dear diary, it was cold today
But the sun came out later
So I went out and strolled about looking at the shops
Didn't really see anything I liked
So I didn't buy anything
On the way home, I posted a letter
Been quite a nice day
Somebody exploded an H-bomb today
But it wasn't anybody I knew3Embed
