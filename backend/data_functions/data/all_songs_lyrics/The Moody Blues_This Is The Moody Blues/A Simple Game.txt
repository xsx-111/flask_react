A Simple Game Lyrics
As time goes by, you will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can you see in your mind's eye?

That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game

There, by your side
I will be when this crazy world is free
Free from doubt when it finds out
Exactly what we're meant to be

That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game

Thoughts of another day
Flashing through my head
Thinking how life could be
All of the things that our great men have said
Be what we want to be
What we deserve to be
What we are meant to be
As time goes by, you will see
That we're going to be free
You and me, we'll touch the sky
Can you see in your mind's eye?

That we are one, we're all the same
And life is just a simple game

We're gonna be free
Ooh, gonna be free
Gonna be free
Free, gonna be free, gonna be free
