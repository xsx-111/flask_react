Nuclear Device (The Wizard of Aus) LyricsI'm the wizard of aus
And I've got it all planned
For my first nuclear device
I don't really care about which way you vote
'Cos my gerrymander works out fine
I sell desert stretches like a big rubber glove
To Japan for a nuclear device
Nuclear device
Nuclear device
Nuclear device
If I could get lucky I'd secede from the states
I'd buy the country at an incredible rate
Brisbane men stay at home at night
'Cos I outlawed all of the vice (outlawed all of the vice)
I'm the wizard of aus
And I've rolled the streets
Dreaming of a nuclear device (nuclear device)
If I could get lucky I'd go out on my own
And sell Australia the rice (rest of aus' their rice)
Nuclear device
Nuclear device
Nuclear device
If I could get lucky I'd secede from the states
I'd buy the country at an incredible rate
If I could get lucky I'd secede from the states
I'd buy the country at an incredible rate
If I could get lucky I'd secede from the states
I'd buy the country at an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
At an incredible rate
Way down under Australia (Australia)
Very different from over here (Australia)
Getting rid of Abo's one by one (Australia)
Buy cheap land for uranium (Australia)
It reminds me of Sweden (Australia)
All the animals look so strange (Australia)
All victims of a testing range (Australia)
Of a testing range (Australia)
Of a testing range (Australia)
Of a testing range (Australia)
Of a testing range (Australia)
Of a testing range (Australia)Embed
