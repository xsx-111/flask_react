Meninblack LyricsWe're not here to destroy
We are here to employ
We have come to make you function
So we can eat at our functions
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
Information can destroy
So we'll treat you just like toys
Healthy livestock so we can eat
Human flesh is porky meat hee hee heeeeeeeeeeeeeee ...
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We don't approve of artificial food
We grow you for our own good
First we gave you the wheel
Then we made you live to kill
So the best stock will survive
We eat you all alive
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblack
We are the meninblackEmbed
