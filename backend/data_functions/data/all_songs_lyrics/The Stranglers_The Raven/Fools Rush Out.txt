Fools Rush Out LyricsFools rush out
Angels got the better of them
Fools rush out
Hope there's a place in heaven for them
One of them wants a home
One of them wants to be left alone
Fools rush out
Fools rush out
They called the wolf out too many times One of them wants
Things to stick on the wall One can't be bothered at all
Fools rush out
Fools rush out
They want to be left alone
One of them wants security
One of them can't tell the wood from the trees
Fools rush out
Fools rush out
They want to be left aloneEmbed
