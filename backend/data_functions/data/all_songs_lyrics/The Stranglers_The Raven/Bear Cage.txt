Bear Cage LyricsI work hard, I'm saving my marks
Watch what I do when I swim with the sharks
A new race and a new way to race
Feel ashamed as I live a disgrace
Gee, (G.) I'm (M.) living (B.H.) in a bear cage
Gee, (G.) I'm (M.) living (B.H.) in a bear cage
They never told me what was the truth
Just a young man losing his youth
Sell cars, sell meat, selling anything
Save up just to live like a king
Gee, (G.) I'm (M.) living (B.H.) in a bear cage
Gee, (G.) I'm (M.) living (B.H.) in a bear cage
Bear cage
Bear cage
Bear cage
Bear cage
You can keep your Brussels and Amsterdam
Give me back my summer in Dresden, man
But they still got peace police over there
Drawing lines on a map just to show I'm there
Gee, (G.) I'm (M.) living (B.H.) in a bear cage
Gee, (G.) I'm (M.) living (B.H.) in a bear cage
Bear cage
Bear cage
Bear cage
Bear cage
