Shah Shah a Go Go LyricsDid you hear about the man
Used to live out in Iran
He was luxury's greatest fan
People ate out of his hand
People ate out of his hand
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Sold the English all their oil
Made the people work the soil
Thought his kind had got it made
But his kind just had to pay to fade
But his kind just had to fade
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Then a priest in Paris France
Made the people get up and da da dance
Sold cassettes for 60p
Said he'd set the people free
We shall see we shall see
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go go
Shah shah a go goEmbed
