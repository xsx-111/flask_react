The Redeemer Lyrics
Bring me closer now
God forsake us now
You try me
You try me
Bring us closer now
God forsake us now
The only embrace

The city brings us down
Ain't nobody from this town, yeah
And I don't know if I'm coming or going
It's time for wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

It's all fucked up now!
What I'mma do now, huh?
What I'mma do now?
It's all fucked up now!Embed
