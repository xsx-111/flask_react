Brutal Lyrics
It has gone away and I’m still here
Said, it has gone away and I’m still here
Now, I can’t do my thing without you near
'Cause you have gone away without me there
Yeah

We’re coming to the end, my friend
Yeah
When you recall my name, I’ll never be there, yeah
You gave your ass to someone else
You think you're better off, yeah
We can't evolve

'Cause you have gone away and I’m still here
Girl if you see my face, I’ll die to be there
You will fall from grace without me there
And I will find my place without you hereEmbed
