Need 2 Let U Go LyricsTalking 'bout complaints
Talking 'bout confusion
Talking 
Looking  yeah
Walking out the gate
Locking up 
Walking on confusion
Staying over late
Working complication
When we were confusion
When we were confusion
 yeah
Working through it everyday, ay
 everyday, ay
I know what I did is wrong
Yeah, I know what I did is wrong
Girl, I know what I did is wrong
Wong, wrong, wrong, wrong
Wong, wrong, wrong, wrongEmbed
