Papi LyricsYou bring out the best in me
Said you'd bring out the best in me
Yeah, yeah
I can never be that!
Cause you bring out the best in me
It's not about the things I did to you
Cause you bring out the best in me
It's not about the possibility for we!
Bring out the best in me
Said you'd bring out the best in me yeah, yeah!
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!Embed
