The Pedigree LyricsFor me to get to know you better
There's something I should let you know
To me you're just another lady
Gonna have to let me go
I realized the thing you gave me
Doesn't do the thing I need
So why we try deny it, baby?
I'll be gone before you sleep
So call me when your heart is empty
So happy we can still be friends
Call me when your heart is empty
Happy we can still be friends
