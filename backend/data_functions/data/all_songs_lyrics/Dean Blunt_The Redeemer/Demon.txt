Demon LyricsI suppose that everybody knows
Seen a horse  about today
I don't suppose that I was meant to know
It was gonna end today
Guns over there, money over there
So I suppose I wasn't meant to know
Bombs in there, change in there
What do you think, girl, I wasn't gonna know?
(So what did you do?)
(What you did was wrong)
I suppose, girl, that everybody knows
Seen a horse  about today
Doesn't seem that anybody cares

I came home late all this week
Only late by fifteen minutes
That's how long it takes to meet me
I'll come home early next week

I'll come home early next week
I'll come home early next weekEmbed
