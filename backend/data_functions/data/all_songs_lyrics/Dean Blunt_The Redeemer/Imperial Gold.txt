Imperial Gold Lyrics
You were working hard baby
Sending me to sleep with your yawns
They were scrapping in the yard
Handing out the jobs
Something I could do to you
Watching as you threw me to them
Severing the dreams of you

Something I could do to you
You make me up a weak-looking blue
Your shoulder isn’t way up high
And friends, they take you on a ride
And show you a good time
And some things get through and I forget how I knew

Salt is in the sink
Shaking like a tear
From your little aching
You’re coming home, you're coming back to me

Something I could do to you
You make me up a weak looking blue
Your shoulder isn’t way up high
And friends they take you on a ride
And show you a good time
And show you a good time
A good time
YeahEmbed
