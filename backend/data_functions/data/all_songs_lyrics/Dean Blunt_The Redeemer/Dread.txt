Dread LyricsHey, um, it's me
Look, uh, can you stop calling me?
You're behaving as if I'm the one who needs
It's like just
You and I both know how bored you get
 getting started 
What was that about?
You said there's not really a middle here?
Remember?
You still 
All you have to do is just say I'm your girl
So
What else do you have to say?Embed
