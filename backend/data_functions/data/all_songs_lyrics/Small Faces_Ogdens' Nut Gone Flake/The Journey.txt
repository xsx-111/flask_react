The Journey Lyrics"Now the fly was overwelmed by this deep generosity of Stan, to give give give of the foodage 'Cause all life lassk ssk suf of the foodage, ha! He look at Stan and said "Is there anything I can reciprocale, or do in the joy of return for your generosity, for giving me food and stuffy?"
Stan: "I'm looking for the other half of the moon and dangly, This is my folly, show me where the missing half of that moon."
"I don't know" said the fly returnly, "but I know someone who know, if only I were big enough to transporty most. I'd take you there myself, I would do this." And Stan, having the possey power of the Magicold, Ah, standed over, roley out the sleevey, wavely hand, hovery hovery hovery hovery and out with these magic wordy. "If all the flys were one fly, what a great enormous flyfelolifer that would bold." Oh, and there, incredible but oh dear, hovery hovery. Now the fly recalled with these wordage
"Not only will I transportnum there, but I will sing it a deep joy of a songload in your eardroves, that I will Do.""
If tomorrow was today
It would yesterday
The sun is surely just a thought away
Where visions that men fail
To put to words to tale
And music that they try but cannot (p)lay
You're right it's just a dream, your company so kind
Hold very tightly please and we shall go outEmbed
