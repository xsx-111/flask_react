Lazy Sunday LyricsWouldn't it be nice to get on wiv me neighbours (da da da do)
But they make it very clear they've got no room for ravers
They stop me from groovin', they bang on me wall
They're doin' me crust in it's no good at all, ah!
Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away
Here we all are sittin' in a rainbow (da da da do)
Gor blimey hello missus Jones, how's your old Bert's lumbago?
He mustn't grumble, Tweedle dee bite
I'll sing you a song with no words and no tune
Tweedle dee bite
To sing on your khazi while you suss out the moon, oh yeah
Lazy Sunday afternoon
I got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away
Aroo dee doo dee doo, aroo dee doo dee die day
Aroo dee doo dee dum, aroo dee doo dee doo dee
There's no one to hear me, there's nothin' to say
And no one can stop me from feelin' this way, yeah
Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift away
Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
Close my eyes and drift a-
Close my mind and drift away
Close my eyes and drift away2Embed
