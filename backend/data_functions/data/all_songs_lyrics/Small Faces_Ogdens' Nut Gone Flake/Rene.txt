Rene Lyrics
Well, there she is parading on the quayside
You can find her every night
Waiting for a stevedore from Tyneside
Why, it's Rene, the docker's delight

And if you just got off an oil tanker
And you've got the readies in the bin
Just make your way down to the crown and anchor
Ask for Rene and you'll be well-in
(Ooh, hello ducks!)

Well she's Rene, the docker's delight
And a ship's in every night
Groping with a stoker
From the coast of Kuala Lumpur

Love is like an 'ole in the wall
A line-up in the warehouse, no trouble at all
If you can spare the money, you'll have a ball
She'll have yours, ah!

Well, there's a kid of every shape and colour
Safely hid in coal sheds, double-locked
Well, it's been said that Rene is the mother
I wonder, well, there you go (Ha!)
She's Rene, the docker's delight
And a ship's in every night
Groping with a stoker
From the coast of Kuala Lumpur1Embed
