Long Agos And Worlds Apart Lyrics
Please don't ask me how I know
The times before I met you long ago
If I could sit quite still
And times could pass me by
I'd sit quite still and pass
The time I'd have with you

A summer evening touches everywhere
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah)

Just like before, we'll meet again
When we can think of long agos
And worlds apart that were
But are no more

(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)
(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)
(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)
(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)
(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)
(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)
(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)
(Hey, doo-waddy-waddy, yeah)â€¦Embed
