Here am I
Tiny Fly
May I share your Shepherd's Pie?
What is this strange voice I hear?
Here I am
Look This Way
In the landscape on your tray
There's no need to ask a silly question

There's no doubt I'd help a hungry fly
To see you in a fix it's really such a shame

And now I'll be a living fly
My name is Stan
I'm on a quest
Take your fill
Take nothing less
I am that
That am I
And now I'll be a living flyEmbed
