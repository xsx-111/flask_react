Don the Armor Lyrics
Yo, we get everybody in the house tonight
I'll wait for my DJ to get ready

Hello boys & girls and welcome to your superhero adventure kit
First, carefully put your mask on
Lock it in place
Second, make sure your armor is superhero tight
Then, put on your big boots
And activate the lasers
Once the lasers are activated
Don that big red cape
And blast off
These aren't comic book pages anymore
This is real life
And remember
Tell a gangster friend to join in because
Every Hero Needs A VillainEmbed
