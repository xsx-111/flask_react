Before LyricsHere we are
Lent to the earth by the stars
But it won't be me
That sets you free
No it won't be me who closes the door on before
Before
Slivers of light hang in the dark
Loving hands place the flowers in the vase
But it won't be me
That sets you free
No it won't be me who closes the door on before
Before
But it won't be me
That sets you free
No it won't be me who closes the door on before
Before
Before
She said don't look at the new moon through the glass
Our eyes on the future that will pass
But it won't be me
That sets you free
No it won't be me who closes the door on before
Before
Before
