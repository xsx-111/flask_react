She Brings the Sunlight LyricsWell I'll ask the life
Lighter beside me
There’s no question why
She's the first, the last and always
With grace she walks
Through my open door
Her perfume reaches
In before her
She brings the sunlight
She makes the world right
And as my love
Slowly undresses
She brings a new need
The need to caress her
Oh and her eyes
They hypnotise me
The feel of her skin
Now there beside me
She brings the sunlight
She makes the world right
And as my heart
Now calm beside hers
The sweat runs dry
Mine and hers always
We'll have a child
To show life’s true meaning
The child runs light
And so forever sees us
She brings the sunlight
She makes the world right
She brings the sun
She brings the sun
She brings the sunlightEmbed
