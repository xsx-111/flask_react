Seek It LyricsI had a dream and, you were in it
We got naked, can't remember what happened next
It was weird
I had my fortune, told and it
Said that I would meet someâ€”body with green eyes
Yours are blue
If you seek it you won't find another's eyes
So, blinded by love
Blinded by love
In your heart lies, long-term loneliness
It sits there like an, unexploded hand-grenade
Time ticks away
Over the hills there, is a valley
In that valley, lies a little tiny house
Unoccupied
If you seek it you won't find another's eyes
So, blinded by love
Blinded by love
Blinded by love
(Break)
If you see your heart's desire laid bare
On a vandalised bus you know I'd sit with you anywhere
I had a dream and, you were in it
We got naked, can't remember what happened next
It was weird
I've got a secret, I don't want you to
Know that you can reach it
If you promise to close your eyes
It's all inside
If you seek it you won't find another's eyes
So, blinded by love
Blinded by love
Blinded by love
Blinded by loveEmbed
