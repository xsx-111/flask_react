Leave Your Body Behind You LyricsChild of Eden your time is short
You can't leave with more than you've brought
Love given lightly can never be owned
A thing we feel but can never hold
You leave your body behind you
When you leave this place
You leave your body behind you
And you make a space
Kindness should be a way of life
Not something you have to think about twice
All you will be remembered for
Is what folks say when you walk out the door
You leave your body behind you
When you leave this place
You leave your body behind you
And you make a space
Is there anyone?
Is there anyone?
Is there anyone?
Is there anyone?
You leave your body behind you
When you leave this place
You leave your body behind you
And you make a space
Leave your body behind you
Leave your body behind you
Leave your body behind you
Unchanged
Is there anyone?
Is there anyone?
Is there anyone?
Is there anyone?
Leave your body behind you
Leave your body behind you
Leave your body behind you
Leave your body behind youâ€¦Embed
