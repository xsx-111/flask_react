You Haunt Me LyricsFaces
In the fog
Howl at the moon like a dog
And you
You haunt me
Oh you
Haunt me
Cracks in the mirror
On the wall
Dust clings to light in the hall
And you
You haunt me
Oh you
Haunt me
Silhouettes framed in smoke and blinding light
My hands sweat and shake so much tonight
And you
You haunt me
Oh you
Haunt me
You haunt meEmbed
