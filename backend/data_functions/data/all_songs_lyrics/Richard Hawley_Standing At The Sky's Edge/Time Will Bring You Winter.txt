Time Will Bring You Winter LyricsTake me back to you
This strange world I've been seeing
The way you hold me like a creature
Brings me back the thirst for freedom
Hollow freedom
Nights are growing cold
Loneliness just makes them colder
All there was is growing older
Creeping back through time
Tries to remember
I try to remember
You may fall into the sea
And you may think while you are sinking
You may feel as tall as trees
But someday time will bring you winter
Grieving by a grove
In the churchyard, beneath the sundial
Amongst the graves with their moss covered names
Sleepy eyes turn in words to the wise
Just be kind
You may fall into the sea
And you may think while you are sinking
You may feel as tall as trees
But someday time will bring you winterEmbed
