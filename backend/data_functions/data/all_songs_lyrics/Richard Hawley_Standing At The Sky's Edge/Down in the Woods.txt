Down in the Woods LyricsThey think TV is the thing
They think cars everything
To kiss your kind, apple cheeks
Stolen love under a canopy of trees
Won't you follow me down
Down into the woods
Won't you follow me down
Come back feeling good
There must be a place for us
For you and I to be as one
Around your shoulders, around your hair
My eyes were blinded by solar flares
Won't you follow me down
Down into the woods
Won't you follow me down
Come back feeling good
Come back feeling good
A fungus grows though the leaf mould
Eat me and you shall hold
A rainbow
A rainbow
There must be a place for us
For you and I to be as one
Around your shoulders, in your hair
My eyes are blinded by solar flares
These seismic moments rare and few
Does this seismic kiss from you
Take all that's bitter, all that's cold
Does the shadow in me show?
Wisen up, she can see, eat me whole and lose your hope
For the days, these woods are sold
I would like you to know
I love you
I love you
Won't you follow me down
Down into the woods
Won't you follow me down
Come back feeling good
Won't you follow me down
Come back feeling good
Come back feeling good
Down into the greenwood
Come back feeling good
Good, good, good, goodEmbed
