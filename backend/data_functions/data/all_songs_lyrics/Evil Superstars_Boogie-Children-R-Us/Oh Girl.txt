Oh Girl LyricsOh girl feel my electric heartache
I don't deserve you
You can pinch my eyeball
Darling sweetheart pain of great art
Oh I cry so much
That I walk with my big red head in a diaper
Baby I love your grandpa
(we had) hot fun in the pet store
With a friendly reptile
Oh girl I feel my eyeball cuz you electric toothpick
You did put in it
Darling sweetheart pain of great art
Two three see me please
Call emergency
Oh I cry so much with my other eye
Oh I walk with my blind head against the closet
Oh girlEmbed
