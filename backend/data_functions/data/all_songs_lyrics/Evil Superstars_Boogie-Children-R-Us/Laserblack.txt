Laserblack LyricsSing sing
Got enlighted a week ago
And I already hate it
People stop sending me money from all over the world
I'm sick cuz I made it
I said no good no why hot bad
But i can't stop now
Can I tell you that they've sent
A hypnotized hamster to assassin me in my sleep
I don't bother to fear or run
Cuz I am a real man and that means
I have no love left to weep
Oh-oh words
All sung with broken glasses in my lung
I said no good...
I been watching, waiting for a curse
But unfortunately things are not getting any worse
Come on kiss with your spidertongue
Oh - oh no good...
Here we come high
On nightmare monster sun blue like corpse
Air people stop spending me
Kids from all over the world
No good...Embed
