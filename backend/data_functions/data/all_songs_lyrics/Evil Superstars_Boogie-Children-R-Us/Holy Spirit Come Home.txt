Holy Spirit Come Home LyricsHoly spirit come home
Holy spirit come home
I still have the rest of my life
Holy spirit come home
Holy spirit come home
Holy spirit come home
The key is under the mat
The food is on the table
Holy spirit come home
Holy spirit come home
Holy spirit come home
The baby is almost born
Holy spirit come home
Holy spirit come home
Holy spirit come home
We promise not to go away
Holy spirit come homeEmbed
