Just A Princess LyricsIn the morning in the cafe
In the evening on the beach
We can start with five lines each
I need just a princess to talk with
I'll wank when I'm home
No music to surround us
Just the melody of your voice
I'm not missing a chat with the boys
I need just a princess to walk with
I'll wank when I'm home
Ooh-oh... we can talk about motorcyclestunts
Or sex of course
I need just a princess to walk with
I'll wank when I'm home all aloneEmbed
