Have Been Wrong Before LyricsOoh ooh...
Maybe it's good to know
That I can do it
Right here again
Believe me if I can prove it to you
Cuz you're my friend
I've been wrong before
Do you want it fast or slow
I'll pop it out anytime by request
Do I have to stand or go
It doesn't matter because I'm the best
I've been wrong before
In the name of rock 'n roll
With blood they wrote it on my door
On my window you knock
You ask does it suck
But excuse me right now
I'm not in the mood to talk
Cuz everywhere I go
The kids wanna rock
I've been wrong before
Maybe it's good to know
I've been wrong before
Buddy do not worry no more
I've been up before
Don't worry
I've been wrong before
In the name of rock 'n roll
I've been wrong before
Don't worry
I've been wrong before
Ready to go for one more
I've been wrong before
Buddy do not worry no more
I've been wrong before
All in the name of rock 'n rollEmbed
