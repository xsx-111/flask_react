First Comes Farewell LyricsThe dream began with death as a closed hotel
And a sign that said gone fishing in hell
When two species meet before
They say hello before there is lover's spell
First comes farewell you shake my hand
With lips like swords
I cough to hide the noise as my guts explode
When two species meet before
They say hello before there is lover's spell
First comes farewell
It's a formality of the soul
A law that's very old
Before there is lover's spell
It's always first farewellEmbed
