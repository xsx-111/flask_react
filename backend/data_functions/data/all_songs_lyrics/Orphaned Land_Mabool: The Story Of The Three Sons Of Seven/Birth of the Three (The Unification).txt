Birth of the Three (The Unification) LyricsThe seventh had seven descendants
The seventh was then devided into three
They were given their first symbols
They bore faces of animals
A Snake
An Eagle
And the Lion
The first was known as magic and he bore an enchanted heart
A Star of David upon his crest was his eternal mark
The second was strength
Half a moon was he
A triangle he adorned
A sword for all to see
The third was lion wisdom
A mind unmatched represented by the cross (by the cross)
The white was his essence a crystal his defense
The three were one, devided at rebirth
Forbidden to unite
For fear of their strength
The divine order was ignored the three then became one
Their punishment was swift they were denied and then cast down
A thousand incarnations passed the time was now at hand
A prophecy fulfilled so he may save this sinful land
As Jobe bore the sins of all men who walk the land
They must bear the cross as was their comands
The second unification of the angel Seven
Three human souls
Merged, as in heaven
The lion's roar was heard by all
The magic and the force have heard
The will to prophesize was theirs
The cross shook the hammering of nails
Omen in the darkened skies above
Thunder, lightning and rain did flow
As the united angel rose
Ice steamed and fire rose
And the three were born...
The seventh had seven descendants
The seventh was then devided into threeEmbed
