Ocean Land (The Revelation) LyricsBefore eyes that are blind no more
A sight unseen that tears the soul
All we ever loved and known
Into mass graves is what we're shown
We see an ocean once was land
And so they come to understand
This place where man used to be born
Will be man's water throne
Will be man's water throne
All that was magical, beautiful, will be gone
(These measures call for divine intervention)
The achievements of man
One will stand all alone
(One the survives the final selection)
The sand in the hourglass
Moves so fast, slow the sand
And nothing that mankind has strived for will be left
In ocean land
The rain will fall then
Filling the dried land
Here are we servants three
Flesh and blood
Poor and weak
Hear thou speak of the blood
It must be a sign
A message from God's hand
Here are we servants three
Flesh and blood
Poor and weak
Hear thou speak of the blood
Here are we servants three
Flesh and blood
Poor and weak
Hear thou speak of the blood
Here are we servants three
Flesh and blood
Poor and weak
Hear thou speak of the blood
Here are we servants three
Flesh and blood
Poor and weak
Hear thou speak of the blood1Embed
