Halo Dies (The Wrath Of God) Lyrics"Vatishachet ha'aretz lifney habore, vetimla ha'aretz chamas"
"Father thou art in heaven
Thy kingdom cried hallow lives
The sacred halo dies
You defied and turned your back
Upon our lord of wrath
All faith you lack
You walk (upon) this beaten path"
All man shall fall as Abel fell to Cain
By fire, by storm, by hail & by rain
The Sacred triad, the three that are one
Shall serve the word, thy will shall be done
Hell hath no fury as a God scorned
Unleash his wrath
He will let death be adorned
"I will cleanse the world with fire
Scorched earth forevermore
Purple tongues that burn
Shall climb higher
Seas of flame will crush ashore
Shed the blood of mortal man
The pains of birth are felt again
Reduce to none, thou art unborn
The end of man, human dethroned
All light is gone..."
The rage of lord is ever true
You have been led by the eternal deciever
He is the life taker, and pain giver
(Who) dwells into the depths of darkened fever
There, as always, he lies, waiting - silent forever at the door
The wrath of God that has befell you
The servant of God - Jobe, the faithful believer
He turned into a shadow, all fear and shiver
Eve he drove astray and Adam to believe her
The serpent coils inside its lair
As if picking at an open sore
Forever man's shins shall
Survive his earthly demise
Wallow in hateful ways & his life of lies
Eternal redemption they do not want nor seek
Short are their days & feeble
Naught but pleasure they adore...
"Vayar Habore ki raba ra'at ha'adam baaretz vekol yetzer
Machshavot libo rak ra kol hayom
Vayenachem habore ki asa et ha'adam baaretz
Veyt'atzev el libo"Embed
