Mabool (The Flood) Lyrics'Hineni mavi et hamabool maimarubot hasham al ha'aretz
Leshachet kol basar asher bo ruach chaim mitachat hashamaim
Kol asher ba'aretz yigva
Vemachiti et kol hayekum asher asiti me'al pney ha'adama'
May the lord eternal save his troubled child
As he passes through rain and storm
Behind the walls of this hallowed ark of wood
Our prophets found a revelation, which they understood
Onto the lands of fearful heaven
Comes a flood earsing all
Landing as if a ruthless bird of prey
To crush all human souls
The lightning
Colors of the sky with flames of light
Hell shines
Above us and the fires bright
Erasing
The works of the common man
All we hold dear is set alight
'Bayom haze nivkeu kol ma'ayanot tehom raba
Ve'arubot hashamaim niftechu
Vemey hamabool hayu al ha'aretz'
Shattered glass reflects this shattered world, barren in the landscape here
Thunder roars as a lion caged, heat that comes like waves of fear
Oceans rise and rage as we watch the world powers fall
Redeeming their sinful ways with their souls
May the truth fill their hearts, let them see the light, when they embrace their gods
'Vehine charvu pney ha'adama'
'Shofech dam ha'adam, ba'adam damo yishapech'
Return all earthly possessions
As ashes yyou return to earth
Child of Godm to face the divine lord who sits upon the throne - eyes sad
Go in peace and find thy faith
Evolve thy self and lose all hate
So a heaven you may create
So a heaven you may create
In this world of sorrowful ways
None shall live to see the light of day
Some may survive to tell the tale
If their belief shall conquer this gale
Damnationis the punishment bestowed
El Norra Alila the vengeful GodEmbed
