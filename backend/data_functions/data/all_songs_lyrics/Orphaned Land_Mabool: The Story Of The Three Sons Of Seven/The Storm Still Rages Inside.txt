The Storm Still Rages Inside LyricsLightning flashes tension's high
Bringing light to darkened skies
Lije Jonah in the belly of the beast
Inside the ark the sound desist
And so the ark swept upon the rising water
Forty days and forty night
There came a mighty flood upon the land
Where once were green pastures teeming with life
Now were oceans deeper than any abyss
Out of depths of sorrow I cry
Before thee I lye
If this world shall inherit the mild
Hear your orphaned child
Hear your orphaned child
Hear your orphaned child
Hear your orphaned child
Hear your orphaned child
Hear your orphaned child
Lord pray tell save thy child, the storm still rages inside
Lord guide them unto dry land
AmenEmbed
