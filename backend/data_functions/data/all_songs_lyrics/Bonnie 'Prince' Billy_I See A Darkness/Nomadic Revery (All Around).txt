Nomadic Revery (All Around) Lyrics
Today was one where, lost in thought
I really feel I am
Losing not an ounce of what
You see in me, my lamb

If you're not with me tomorrow
That would be the worst
I'm glad I dreamed of what I dream of
Today a thing was burst

Oh, all around
Oh, all around
It's kept together
Moving all around
Oh, all around
Oh, all around
It's kept together
Moving all around

My brain it beams, it's here at all
And living, I must work
To make our lives here justified
And not let trouble lurk
Instead of seeing monkeys biting
I lay on the ground
While my hectic travelling partner
Wanders all around

Oh, all around
Oh, all around
It's kept together
Moving all around
Oh, all around
Oh, all around
It's kept together
Moving all around

Oh, all around a left buttock
And all around the right
All around your every curve
I'm going to go tonight
But only hold me, hold me
All the city's on me
And all their wish to scold me
And lay their hands upon me
So only hold me, hold me
And I'll return you baby
I just need an evening
With someone nice to hide me
Oh, all around
Oh, all around
It's kept together
Moving all around
Oh, all around
Oh, all around
It's kept together
Moving all around1Embed
