Death to Everyone LyricsI am here, right here
Where God puts non asunder
And you, in black dress and black shoe
You do invite me under
Go on, go there
You can see me ageing
Stars turn, balls burn
Coming kids are raging
Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun
Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
Every terrible thing is a relief
Even months on end, buried in grief
Our easy lifetimes, which have to end
With the coming of your death friend
Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun
Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
So strap me on, and raise me high
'Cause buddy, I'm not afraid to die
But life is long, and it's tremendous
And we're glad that you're here with us
And since we know an end will come
It makes our living fun
Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun
Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun
Death to me and death to you
Tell me what else can we do-die-do?
Death to all and death to each
Our own God-bottle's within reach
Death to everyone
Is gonna come
And it makes hosing
Much more fun1Embed
