Madeleine Mary LyricsSing a song of madeleine-mary
A tune that all can carry
Burly says if we don't sing
Then we won't have anything
All the boys on ship set sail
And the mate was madeleine-mary
When her eyes did fill with tears
It was extraordinary
It was extraordinary
For we none of us could see it
For she kept herself kept below
And all her feelings private
Sing a song of madeleine-mary
A tune that all can carry
Burly says if we don't sing
Then we won't have anything
None of us could get a glimpse
But all of us did want it
At night, above our sleeping heads
Our sleeping dreams were haunted
So now my kids you'd like to hear
Of one who reached and got her
Well, if there was, well, i think
He sleeps beneath the water
Sing a song of madeleine-mary
A tune that all can carry
Burly says if we don't sing
Then we won't have anything1Embed
