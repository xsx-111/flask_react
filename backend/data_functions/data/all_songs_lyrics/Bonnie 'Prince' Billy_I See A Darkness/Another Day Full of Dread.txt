Another Day Full of Dread LyricsI like to have a good time
Any of my friends will tell you
So if you confront me with stupidity
I'm doubly angry at you

And I say nip-nap, it's all a trap
Bo-bis, and so was this
Whoa whoa, to haiti go
And watch it all come down
Ding dong, a silly song
Sure do say something's wrong
Smile awhile, forget the bile
And watch it all come down
So I become more lively
To bury all of the ugly
Whole persons sometimes
Must be them bodies buried

And I say nip-nap, it's all a trap
Bo-bis, and so was this
Whoa whoa, to haiti go
And watch it all come down
Ding dong, a silly song
Sure do say something's wrong
Smile awhile, forget the bile
And watch it all come down
And I toe the water
And an urchin poke me
And I must be godfather
To anyone who'll have me
Today was another day full of dread
But I never said I was afraid
'Cause dread and fear should not be confused
By dread I'm inspired, by fear I'm amused

And I say nip-nap, it's all a trap
Bo-bis, and so was this
Whoa whoa, to haiti go
And watch it all come down
Ding dong, a silly song
Sure do say something's wrong
Smile awhile, forget the bile
And watch it all come down1Embed
