Raining in Darling LyricsDarling
I can stay awake all night
And I will make mistakes, alright
'Cause the body asks so much
Sweet thing
I give you what I reach
Taken what I had to teach
And re-rendered it with such
With such
With such
Oh, it don't rain anymore
I go outdoors
Where it's fun to be
And I know you love me
I know you do1Embed
