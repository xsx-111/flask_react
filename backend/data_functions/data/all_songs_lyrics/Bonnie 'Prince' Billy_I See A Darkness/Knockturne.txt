Knockturne LyricsFire-burned and blew out flowers
Showing me its comely powers
Still and all it would be hours
Before I would get burned
Someone mawed and put my cock in
Corner-eyed I saw it lock in
Twisters rolled but no one walked in
And only love was learned
Now I truly love you wholly
No one else could e'er have stole me
And the world so far below me
For ye and me it turned1Embed
