Song for the New Breed LyricsYour little feet
Your sharp teeth
The way the light hits your eyes
Your scrappy fur
Your fists
The light from the Lord that shines inside
Inside of me
Inside of me
Something is growing
Something is glowing
Someone is showing
Sing a song for the new breed
Inside of me
Your deep growl
Your high whine
The uneven way that you move
Your pure heart
Your love
The Lord made you to prove something
Inside of me
Inside of me
Something is growing
Something is glowing
Someone is showing
Sing a song for the new breed
I could be right
Then you'd be right too1Embed
