But Not For Me LyricsThey're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me (she’s not for me)Embed
