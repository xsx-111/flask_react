Begin the Beguine Lyrics

When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendour
It brings back a memory evergreen

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavour
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapturous 
'Til clouds come along to disperse the joy we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine
Let them play
'Til the stars that were there before return above you
'Til you whisper to me once more darling I love you

And we suddenly know
(And we suddenly know)
What heaven we're in
(What heaven we're in)
When they begin the beguineEmbed
