Where or When Lyrics
It seemed we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling, you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened
For thе first time
Seem to be happening again

Thеn, so it seems
We've met before
And loved before
And loved before
But who knows where or when?
Where or when?Embed
