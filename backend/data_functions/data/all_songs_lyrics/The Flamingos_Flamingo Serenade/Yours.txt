Yours Lyrics(Yours, yours)
(Yours)
Yours 'til the stars
Lose their glory
Yours 'til the birds
Fail to sing
Yours 'til the end
Of life's story
This pledge to you
I bring
I'm
Yours In the gray
Of December
Here or on far distant shores
I've never loved anyone the way I love you
How could I?
When I was born
To be only
Yours?Embed
