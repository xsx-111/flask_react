I Only Have Eyes for You LyricsMy love must be a kind of blind love;
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Sha bop sha bop
Are the stars out tonight
(Sha bop sha bop)
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you, dear
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
The moon may be high
(Sha bop sha bop)
But I can't see a thing in the sky
(Sha bop sha bop)
I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
(Sha bop sha bop)
You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)
(Sha bop sha bop)3Embed
