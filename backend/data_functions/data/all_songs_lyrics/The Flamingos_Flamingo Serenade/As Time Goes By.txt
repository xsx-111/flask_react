As Time Goes By Lyrics
You must remember this:
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental
Things apply
As time goes by (as time goes by)
(As time goes by)

And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that, you can rely
No matter what
The future brings
As time goes by (as time goes by)

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his maid
That, no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
As time goes
By (goes by)
(goes by)
(goes by)Embed
