Music Maestro Please Lyrics

Tonight
I mustn't think of her
Music maestro please

Tonight
Tonight I must forget
How much I need her
So mister leader

Play
Your  melodies
Ragtime, jazztime, swing

Any old thing
To help me ease the pain
That solitude
Solitude can bring

She used to like waltzes
So please don't play a waltz
She danced divinely
And I love her so
But there I go
Tonight I mustn't think of her
No more memories
Swing out
Tonight I must forget

Music
(Music)
Maestro
(Maestro)
