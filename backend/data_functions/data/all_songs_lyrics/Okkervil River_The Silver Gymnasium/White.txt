White Lyrics
We crashed through crazed glass
In the white-hot burst of the firey blast
We flared through choked air
In the deafening blare, in the scattering ash

"Summer's here, and I'm gonna crack, crack, crack
Summer's here, and I'm gonna crack"

We sort through shocked quartz in a jewelry store
Watch your sister and dad
Consort with kept courtesans
While the whole world is in ruins and black

"Summer's here, and I'm gonna crack, crack, crack!
Summer's here, and I'm gonna crack
Summer's here and I'm near a heart attack
Or flash of real feeling, teeth gnashing
And blasting and reeling through black"
'Cause kids
When I first saw your mom
Well, I was right and she was wrong
'Bout just the type of man she was bringing back
And when I first met her dad
Well, I felt good and he felt bad
But, kids, you'll find that over time, you're just trapped
Spring is gone, and you're gonna gasp, gasp, gasp
Spring is gone, and you're gonna gasp
Gasp

And friends: When I first saw the groom
Rise from the darkness of the tomb
I was unnerved, though, overall, I was wowed
When I first saw the bride
The look inside her eyes just cried
"If someone has some cause to stop, say it now!"

But fall is here, and the leaves all come down, down, down
Fall is here, and the leaves all come down, down, down

And then winter's here, it's too cold to drown, drown, drown
Winter's here, it's too cold to drown, drown, drown
Winter's here, it's too cold to drown, drown, drown
Winter's here, it's too cold to drown, drown, drown
Winter's here, it's too cold to drown, drown, drown
Winter's here, it's too cold to drown, drown, drown
Winter's here, snow's on the ground
Winter's here, and I'm nearly whited-out, snowblind
Like it's no business of mine
If life doesn't want me aroundEmbed
