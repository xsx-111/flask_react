All the Time Every Day LyricsDo you stop and stare, struck dumb, hands shaking, washed
By this constant, panicked wishing for what's lost?
As you're standing on some curb waiting to cross
Would you say you feel like some weak leaf, wind-turned and tossed?
All the time, every day, every day, all the time
All the time, every day
Every day
As the streets sail by the seats inside your car
Does each face outside collide against your heart?
As you watch them blaze or fade into the dark
Do you want to scream that you're so pleased with who they are?
Every day, all the time
All the time, every day
Every day, all the time
Every day
When that moment arrives (oh, that sweet and tender pain)
Do you think how there'll come a time when you'll never feel it again?
Do you try to make it right by thinking if someone else feels it
It's real and it won't go away?
Do you?
Do you fall so short of all that's in your heart?
When your friends, that you should pull up, you instead pick apart?
Do you watch the world get cold, and crushed, and small?
And when you could do so much, you do fuck all?
All the time, every day
Every day, all the time
All the time, every day
Every day
And considering all this, and agreeing that it's true
Is it harder each time just to feel something new?
But do you sometimes wish not to feel anymore?
To wall it off? To make it all go away?
To just put it to an end?
No question, any day
All the way, every time
Any day, any time, all the way
When you pray for grace to come
Were you born yesterday, are you dumb? Are you insane?
Don't be ashamed, I'm the same
Yeah, I'm that way
But I try, every day and all the timeEmbed
