Stay Young LyricsYoung, stay young
Stay strong, don't get on with it
Gone, way gone
One day it’s all gone and you’re all done
All my friends are running to live on corners
The hurters and the haters and the faders and the mourners
The world goes to its work and it is not gentle
In what it breaks you down into
All my friends are looking at life
And it’s a long, long, long, long, lonely time
I said that when you met me I was just dying
I said it to no one, I said it in silence
Young, stay young
Face dawn, all talk and quick
Stunned, stay stunned, mind blown, and your jaw drops
And all these hateful people judging and hand-wringing
Oh, lord, why don’t you bury me in all they call sinning?
Open up your heart, show me the place where love is missing
How long have you been missing love?
I see all creation pulsing and divided up between it
Now you have to lay me down because my head is spinning
Try, try hard
To drop fear and to drop your guard
Off, off of love, off drugs
Just feel it in your blood
And I call to all my friends:
All the cracked-cassette-tape-thrillers
All the hand-inside-the-tillers, and the hundred-dollar-billers
Standing by the stone that was rejected by the builders
There was drinking at the bar
They carried from the burning building
Never let it be said that he wasn’t willing
Well no shit, I know you miss him, girl
And out past the edges off the earth, you're make it wider
When I see you're crying, don’t you know it’s killing me?
Now climb, climb up
Way up to see the sun
One, one draw
One life, one love
'Cause you’ve only got one
Young, stay young
Don't get tough, don't get on with it
On, stay on
It’s heartbreaking, step with it
Stay youngEmbed
