Down Down the Deep River Lyrics
Spit into the center of your home town
There is leaves in the street and there are friends around you now
All the days of your life in a line
All the way that it seemed by '89

But it's not all right
It's not even close to all right

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)

We lie awake at night in a tent and I say
"Tell me about your uncle and his friend
Cause they seem like very bad men
Well, we wanna keep away from them."
Bend in the road back there, we saw the place they go
Tell me about the greatest show or the greatest movie you know
Or the greatest song that you taped from off the radio
You're gonna play it again and again, it cuts off at the ending, though
Tell me I'm always gonna be your best friend
Now you said it one time, why don't you say it again?
All the way down the line to where the telephone ends
Come on and shout it on down the wire
But it's not all right
Not even close to all right

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)

And as the rescue party, the volunteer team
Ah, they're just kids of eighteen, and it's the worst thing they've seen
And they're standing all around that tree
And I'm so sorry that I can't stop crying
(Oh, I know.)

Shivering from the late fall cold
I felt like a solid ghost
I ran and then I couldn't slow
My father found me though, my father took me home
He said, "Oh, son, I saw you get knocked down
And I ran out. I bet your head was spinning
With that bright pain you stunned
When you've only just begun to be only just beginning."
Tossed in the viper pit, all those feelings and fears
And all that difficult shit in all those tender years
There was something in the air, something gathered in the air
Something singing in the wind
Oh, I'll be your fighter and you'll be my mirror
And you'll be all right because I'll be right here
Oh kid, now I'm not going anywhere
I swear I'll try to not be going anywhere
Though it's not all right. It's so far from all right
We'll make it into a choice somehow
I don't know, but you'll have a choice somehow

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
We can never go back; we can only remember
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)

Maybe they told you about the summer sky
Maybe said there's a great gold spirit in the summer sky
All your friends (all your best, best friends)
Are gonna gather around your bed at night

Well that'll make it all right because it is still so far from all right
Oh, kid, I know

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Up the stairs four flights up; can you feel my heart shiver?
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Waking in the dawn with that dream getting dimmer and dimmer
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
I said, "Are we going down, are we going down, are we going down the deep river? Oh, down the deep river?"
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Down down, down down, down the deep river. Down, down the deep river
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Why don't you, why don't you say you still see it, say you remember?
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down?
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down, are we going down the deep river?
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Because I know it's scary, baby
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)2Embed
