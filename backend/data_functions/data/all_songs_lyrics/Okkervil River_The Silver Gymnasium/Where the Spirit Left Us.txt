Where the Spirit Left Us Lyrics
Through the wall
In a soft spring rustle
Street-side selling
Some summer hustle
Across the Maple Street Bridge
In a bristling fall
Just whistling all's
A balled up riddle
Just a high snowball
On a curve-and-fall
Through a parking lot
At Christmas
I heard her whisper
I heard him call
Here's what the gist was:

Only wary in our lives
Open-eyed and half-ashamed
That is to say
Afloat on a ferry, freezing, tired
Fully wired, a total waste
That's where the spirit left us

Underneath the house
Just like a flame-out teen
Who smells like sweat
And gasoline
(Kid, I stand with you)
And when you get hard
And your eyes get mean
'Cause you're on the march
Well, I could almost kiss you
Don't let them twist you
Here, have this song
You can take it with you
Stay lonely, open wide
Your eyes on fire, your mind aflame
Don't be disgraced
Loose of limb, unlionized
While all liars fade to gray
I know you feel detested

Did a silence drop?
Did your Walkman stop?
Did the air turn cold?
Was the message just so close?
Ah, but did you choke it?
Oh, kid, I know
I know where this is going
Because we always blow it

Only wary in our lives
Open-eyed and half-ashamed
It's just that way
Afloat down that river, freezing, tired
Fully wired, a total waste
That's where the spirit left us
Only wary in our lives
Your eyes all fire, your mind aflame
And don't be dismayed
When this sobbing world goes screaming by
I swear that if I had my way
You know I would have blessed itEmbed
