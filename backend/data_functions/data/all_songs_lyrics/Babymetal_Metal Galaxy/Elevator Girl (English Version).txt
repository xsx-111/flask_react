Elevator Girl (English Version) Lyrics
Hey lady, are you going up da da da da da down?

Hey lady, are you going up da da da da da down?
No matter what you say or what you do
You’re going da da da da da down
Are you going up or going down?
Hey lady, are you going up da da da da da down?

Girl, we're going up
Girl, we're going down
See the whole world spin spin spin around
Life can be such a pain in the butt
Going up, going down
Going up, going to Hell, yeah
Its like, oh my gosh
Life's so scandalous
One day I’m happy, one day I’m a mess
Hang on cause I will never give up
Going up, going down
Going up, going to Hell, yeah

Hey lady, are you going up da da da da da down?
No matter what you say or what you do
You’re going da da da da da down
Girl, we're going up

See the whole world spin spin spin around
Life can be such a pain in the butt
Going up, going down
Going up, going to Hell, yeah
Its like, oh my gosh
Life's so scandalous
One day I’m happy, one day I’m a mess
Hang on cause I’ll never give up
Going up, going down
Going up, going to Hell, yeah
