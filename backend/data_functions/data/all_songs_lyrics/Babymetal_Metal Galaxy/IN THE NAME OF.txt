IN THE NAME OF Lyrics
Night and Day
Heaven and Hell
Joy and Sorrow
Light and Shadow
Praise be to fire
Praise be to light
Praise be to hope
Praise be to dark
What is dead may never die
What is dead may never die (die)
In danger, in danger, in danger, in danger
In danger, in danger, in danger, in danger
Night and Day
Heaven and Hell
Joy and Sorrow
Light and Shadow
Praise be to fire
Praise be to light
Praise be to hope
Praise be to dark
What is dead may never die
But rises again
Harder and stronger
Death, Queen
God, Devil

In the name of Goddess
In the name of Justice
In the name of Metal
In the name of The Fox God
In danger, in danger, in danger, in danger
In danger, in danger, in danger, in danger
The Fox God  me
The gift you hold is 
This is your faith, this is your destiny
And this is  to The Fox GodEmbed
