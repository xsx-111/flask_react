HEAL LyricsBlack boots, black jeans, black beard
Walking down the street in the morning air
Then I lite up a cigarette and put my headphones on
And I listend to Van Etten Sing
You gotta give out, give up, give out, give up, give out, give up give in, give out, give up give in
Give in, give in, give in
I was better than I felt in years
Then I looked to the streets and I looked to my fears
I know the something was going round these tears
I was hurting people, so close to me
I spent ten long years feeling so fucking bad
I know you cheated on me but I cheated on myself
I was falling way out when she sent those pictures off
And I knew it wasn’t me and I knew it wasn’t her
And I knew it wasn’t me and I knew it wasn’t her
And I knew it wasn’t me and I knew it wasn’t her
You gotta give up, give out, give in, give up, give out, give in, give up, give out, give in, give in
You gotta heal, you gotta heal, you gotta heal, you gotta heal
Take it even further back to darker times
When I drank too much and I took too much
I lied to all my friends about who I was
But Caitlin listen to me now I’m all grown up
I spent two long years just losing my mind
Thank you Kristian for keeping me clean
And we’re painted like the warriors
And we’re painted like the warriors
And we’re painted like the warriors
And we’re painted like the warriors
You gotta heal…Embed
