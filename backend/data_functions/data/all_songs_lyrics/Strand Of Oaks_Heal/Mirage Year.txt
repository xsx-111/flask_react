Mirage Year LyricsI was in a haze, and you were in the hall
I was a fool swimming in the dark
There was one for me and many more for you
The number was a fight I couldn’t lose
There were tours and songs and future plans ahead
I wasn’t there I wasn’t there I admit
He asked you about movies, he asked about your day
You showed him in the mirror what was ours
I was in love, but it was changing
I was in love, but it was changing
Oh, life can bring you down
Oh, life will bring you down
That winter when you took my love
And that fucker was having his fun
But my hands are worth more than your bloodEmbed
