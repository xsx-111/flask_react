Plymouth LyricsSometimes I move like shadows, sometimes I move like wind
But most days I start where I begin
Naked in the great lakes, underneath the shine of Mars
I begged my friend to just let me drift off
Shower your loves in kisses, shower the world with tears
Take advantage of those who got you here
Let me roll, let me go
Let me roll, let me go
I’m bound to lose control
I stopped listening to music, I kept writing the same songs
Comfort doesn’t mean your better off
I met you when your hair was short and my ego had barely formed
It took a jug of wine just to ask you home
We took black and white pictures, with your hooded sweatshirt on
We were beautiful, broken, and young
Let me roll, let me go
Let me roll, let me go
I’m bound to lose controlEmbed
