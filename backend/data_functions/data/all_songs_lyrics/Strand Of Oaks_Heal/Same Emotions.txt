Same Emotions LyricsStep into the light here
I wanna see you under better light here
I wanna know this isn’t what I feared
I wasn’t feeling all alone again
I wasn’t feeling all alone again
Oh I waited you are here, and I…
Oh I waited you are here, and I…
My love, my life
I was living in the same emotion
And you called my name
I was living in the same, living in the same emotion
Living in the same emotion, living in the same emotion
Leave it underwater
I know you’re thinking we shouldn’t go there
Let’s just believe in what we have here
I wasn’t feeling all alone again
I wasn’t feeling all alone again
I wasn’t feeling all alone again
Oh I waited you are here, and I…
Oh I waited you are here, and I…
My love, my life
I was living in the same emotion
And you called my name
I was living in the same, living in the same emotion
Living in the same emotion, living in the same emotion…Embed
