Wait For Love LyricsAnd all the warnings lights ahead
You hold them up for me
And all the little things I said
Goes away
I wait for love, here
I wait for love
I wait for love, here
I love for love
And you'll find meaning in your life
And complicate it even more
I tried, I tried, I tried
But I wait so long
I wait for love, here
I wait for love
I wait for love
Wait for love
Wait for love
Yeah, that's you rotting in your room
I wasn't in love, I was here, I was an abomination
And there was a call, there was a high, there was a heaven dawned in roses
I'm giving up getting over you
I'm giving up getting over you
I wait for love, here
I wait for love
I wait for love
Wait for love
Wait for loveEmbed
