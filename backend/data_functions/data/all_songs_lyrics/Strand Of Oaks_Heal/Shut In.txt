Shut In LyricsI was born in the middle
Maybe too late
Everything good had been made
So I just get loaded
And never leave my house
It’s taken way too long to figure this out
Know my name, know I mean it
It’s not as bad as it seems
And we try, in our own way, to get better
Even if we’re alone
I hate talkin’ about money
I don’t wanna talk about luck
I hate thinkin’ I’m not the same I was
I lose my faith in people
Why even take the time?
You’ve got your problems
I’ve got mine
Know my name, know I mean it
It’s not as bad as it seems
And we try in our own way to get better
Even if we’re alone
The night was cold and black
But the sun was in my eyesEmbed
