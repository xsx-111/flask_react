For Me LyricsWaiting, waiting hoping you
I would love you to, I wouldn’t hold you back
And you go home, then I go away
And you go home, then I go away
I did it all for me, I did it all for me
I wait, I wait for you here
Where I’m always good, and my mind is clear
And the sun fell right out of the sky…
For me…Embed
