Woke Up To The Light LyricsI woke up to the light
You woke up to my hand
Reaching for the night
We ran
If the morning comes
I will still be here
Holding off the lines of our fears
Save the dawn’s light shine
Save the moon, save the night
And I call you by name
I call you here
In the distance we will find
Heaven lies in waiting
Keep the light on for me
Keep the light on for me
We woke up to the sun
And neighbors looking in
We fit so well so lonely and sad
Your eyes looking back
We do not know our home
Just long enough to hold me here
And listen
Save the dawn’s light shine (I won’t look behind)
Save the moon, save the night (We all get lost sometime)
And I call you name
I call you here (All of the bad years fall out of your mind)
In the distance we will find (Everything lies ahead)
Heaven lies in waiting (Something to keep us hungry)
Heaven lies in waiting
Keep the light on for me
Keep the light on for me
We woke up to the light
And felt no warmth behindEmbed
