Valerian (Her Voice Honeyed) LyricsValerian loves me
Valerian loves me
Valerian loves me
Valerian loves me
Valerian loves me
Valerian loves me
Valerian loves me
Valerian loves me
I am standing here
It will enter
Standing at it
I am standing here
Would it enter
I am standing here
Touch, touch
Open
Would it open
Would it open
I am standing here
Would it open it
You can scar me
Would it lose it
Open it, open itEmbed
