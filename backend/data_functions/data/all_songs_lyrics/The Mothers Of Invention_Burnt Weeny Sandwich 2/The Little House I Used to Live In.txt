The Little House I Used to Live In LyricsThank you, good night... Thank you, if you'll... if you sit down and be quiet, we'll make an attempt to, ah, perform Brown Shoes Don't Make It
Man in uniform: Back on your seats, come on, we'll help you back to your seats, come on...
Guy in the audience: Take that man out of here! Oh! Go away! Take that uniform off man! Take that bloody uniform before it's fuckin' too late, man!
Everybody in this room is wearing a uniform, and don't kid yourself
Guy in the audience:  man!
You'll hurt your throat, stop it!Embed
