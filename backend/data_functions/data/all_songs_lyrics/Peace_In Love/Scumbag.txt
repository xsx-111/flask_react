Scumbag Lyrics
I'm a scumbag
I'm a weirdo, baby
I know you're not that
But you've been trying lately

Yeah, I'm so good for
I'm so good for
I'm so good for you

I'm not a waster
I just see things in my sleep
And you'd be safer
Around the cleaness that you keep

Yeah,  I'm so good for
I'm so good for
I'm so good for you
I know I'm so good for
I'm so good for
I'm so good for you

Yeah, I'm so good for
I'm so good for
I'm so good for youEmbed
