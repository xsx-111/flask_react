Lovesick Lyrics
I don't wanna go to school
I don't wanna take the call
I just wanna be a fool
And get lovesick with you
I don't wanna move my head
Laying round a dying bed
I don't wanna listen
I wanna get lovesick with you

I wanna get lovesick
I wanna get lovesick with you
I wanna get lovesick
I wanna get lovesick with you

I don't wanna make no sense
I don't wanna pay the rent
I just wanna lay down dead
And get lovesick with you

I wanna get lovesick
I wanna get lovesick with you
I wanna get lovesick
I wanna get lovesick with you
You don't need to drink or eat
Stay awake or go to sleep
Trust me baby, I'm a creep and I'm lovesick with you
And I'm love sick with you

I wanna get lovesick (I don't wanna make no sense)
I wanna get lovesick with you (I don't wanna pay the rent)
I wanna get lovesick (I just wanna lay down dead)
I wanna get lovesick with you
I wanna get lovesick
I wanna get lovesick with you
I wanna get lovesick
I wanna get lovesick with you1Embed
