Bloodshake Lyrics
From the belly of the jungle
To the bottom of the sea
You're a river in bongo
Just a heart in ecstasy
From the forest in Arden
Where I reside
Blood will be blood
Back in Arden, you twist and thrive
For blood to be

(Ooooo-ooh) You vibe so hard
(Ooooo-ooh) And you live in this forever

We spit blood in the sun
We spit blood in the ocean
We spit blood in the sun
We spit blood in the ocean

As we plunge into the ocean
The waves, they pull us down
For a moment I'm open
For blood to be
(Ooooo-ooh) You vibe so hard
(Ooooo-ooh) And you live in this forever

We spit blood in the sun
We spit blood in the ocean
We spit blood in the sun
We spit blood in the ocean4Embed
