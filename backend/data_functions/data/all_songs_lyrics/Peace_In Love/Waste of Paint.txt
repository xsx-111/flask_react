Waste of Paint Lyrics
This feels like your last chance
To ever make the leap
Or hold on here forever
Or dive into the sea
It feels like your mother
Has gone to set you free
You're loving every minute
It's chemical, a pesticide, a cannonball
You're lost in time

You're such an animal
A filthy, a filthy animal
You're electric honey
You blow my brain
Face to face, we're all the same
You and me we're a waste of a paint
You're electric honey, electric

Baby put your fists down
Throw away your sword
We never beg or bother
To open up the door
Pieces come together
(Something in the way)
Slowly feeling better
(Die another day)
You've never been a quitter
(Everything's okay)
Living for whatever
(It's the end of)
You're a filthy animal
A filthy, a filthy animal

You're electric honey
You blow my brain
Face to face, we're all the same
You and me we're a waste of a paint
You're electric honey, electric
Electric honey, you blow my brain
Face to face, we're all the same
You and me we're a waste of a paint
You're electric honey, electric

You're such an animal
A filthy, a filthy animalEmbed
