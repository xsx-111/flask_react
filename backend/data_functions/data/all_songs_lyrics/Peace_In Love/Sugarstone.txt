Sugarstone Lyrics
Little brick brain, are you okay?
Cause the world don't wanna spin today
There's a change in the order
Must be something in the water
Cause nothing really tastes the same

It's not about the generation
It's not about an education
We don't need to think today
Cause you and me can slip away
You know, you're my sugar
You're my sugarstone

I hurt your soul
Kinda lost control
But you're here now and you never wanna go
Cause baby in the dark
You vibe too hard
And it feels as though you're steaming in the snow

It's not about the generation
It's not about an education
We don't need to think today
Cause you and me can slip away
You know, you're my sugar
You're my sugar
You feel it in your brittle bones
You feel alive or feel alone
I really really need you to know
I heard you got a heavy little heart
And it seems as though your future is the past
And though your feet are made of lead
You've always had a feather head
You know, you know

It's not about the generation
(You're my sugarstone)
Cause noone needs an education
(You're my sugarstone)
We don't need to think today
Cause you and me will wash away
You know, you're my sugarstone
(You're my sugarstone)
(You're my sugarstone)
(You're my sugarstone)Embed
