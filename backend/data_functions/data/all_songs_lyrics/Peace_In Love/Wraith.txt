Wraith Lyrics
You close your eyes, on leather hearted boys
It's such a waste, cut your silky noise
(Ooooooooh) I don't wanna see you
(Ooooooooh) I don't wanna see you

You could be my ice age sugar
You lay me down and make me shiver
Blow me like a floating feather
And we'll be dark, we'll be dark, we'll be dark forever

It's no surprise, she'd spike ya with jagged claws
She's such a wraith, a lady of the sword
(Ooooooooh) I don't wanna see you
(Ooooooooh) 'cause I don't wanna see you
(Ooooooooh) I don't wanna see you
Cause baby, I don't wanna hear you

You could be my ice age sugar
You lay me down and make me shiver
Blow me like a floating feather
And we'll be dark, we'll be dark, we'll be dark
You could be my ice age sugar
You lay me down and make me shiver
Blow me like a floating feather
And we'll be dark, we'll be dark, we'll be dark forever2Embed
