Drain Lyrics
Feel it in your bone
Feels as though the sun sets slower
It turns me into stone
Perforates my ozone layer
Say you feel drained
Say you never felt so empty
Never leave a stain
You're only young
You're only numb

Drain
Drain

Swear you're having fun
Swear you never peaked at 20
Loaded like a gun
Your ocean doesn't seem so empty
Take me to the stars
Take me on a road trip baby
Take me in your car
You're only young
You only feel
Drain
Drain
Drain
Drain
Drain
Drain
