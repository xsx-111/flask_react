Toxic Lyrics
Yesterday I woke up on the wrong side of your bed
I kept my eyes shut, but I saw you in my head
Time isn't frozen, it's melted in the sun
You're like a poison, you linger in my lungs

Tell me things about you
Like you're toxic, it's no good
I never wanna break that daze
So cut loose and blow away

All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you

Take it or leave it
We're all gonna hurt our friends
Want it or need it
Some good things never end

Tell me things about you
Like you're toxic, it's no good
I never wanna break that daze
So cut loose and blow away
All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you

I wanna blow away and sleep until we're dead
Stop tryna fill the heart shaped hole left in your chest
I wanna hesitate, run away and celebrate
All around the world, people seem to've heard

All I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget you
Yeah, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is forget youEmbed
