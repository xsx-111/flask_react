California Daze Lyrics
Here's one for the diamonds in the dark
(California daze)
And all the people in the park
(Never feels the same)
Especially for the amblers in the gloom
(It's the darkest gloom)
And all the feathers feeling blue

She tastes like sunlight
And she's always gonna be there in the back of your mind
Is there time to rewind?
Were you born to live or born to die?
Forget and forgive, there's a place you can live

Go and watch the pretty girls in town
(California daze)
When you're feeling kinda down
(Never feels the same)
Lean into a California daze
(It's the darkest gloom)
Has always been the fastest way

She tastes like sunlight
And she's always gonna be there in the back of your mind
Is there time to rewind?
Were you born to live or born to die?
Forget and forgive, there's a place you can live
Oh, she tastes like sunlight
And she's always gonna be there in the back of your mind
Oh, is there time to rewind?
Were you born to live or born to die?
Forget and forgive, there's a place you can live4Embed
