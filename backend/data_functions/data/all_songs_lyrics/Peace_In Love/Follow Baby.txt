Follow Baby Lyrics
I'm scared to death that maybe
A baby's breath could save me
A touch of blue's too easy
She stole the seas to see me
Her hair, it bleeds and bleeds for you
As blood runs east
She'd lay the feast and offers peace, she offers

Follow baby
We're gonna live forever maybe
Follow baby
We'll go deep, deep, deep, deep
Follow baby
We're gonna live forever baby
Follow baby
We'll go deep, deep, deep, deep

She scared us east to rumble
No food to eat, we follow
The river's deep into the
The forest feast, she said

Follow baby
We're gonna live forever maybe
Follow baby
We'll go deep, deep, deep, deep
Follow baby
We're gonna live forever baby
Follow baby
We'll go deep, deep, deep, deep
Follow
Follow
Follow
Follow

Follow baby
We're gonna live forever maybe
Follow baby
We'll go deep, deep, deep, deep
Follow baby
We're gonna live forever baby
Follow baby
We'll go deep, deep, deep, deep1Embed
