Step a Lil Closer Lyrics
Step a lil closer
Pass up the potion
Got it a lil open
Feel a little broken

Step a lil closer
Step a lil closer
Step a lil closer
It'll feel alright

Feels like it's over
It gets a lil better
Tastes like leather
You're lighter than a feather

Step a lil closer
Step a lil closer
Step a lil closer
It'll feel alright

Step a lil closer
Step a lil closer
Stand a lil closer
Step a lil closer
Step a lil closerEmbed
