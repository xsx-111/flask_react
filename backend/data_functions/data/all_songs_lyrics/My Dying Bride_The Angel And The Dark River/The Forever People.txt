The Forever People LyricsRead to me
Make your words as pictures
Reveal to me
The forever people
Names become more
More than words
In foreign tongue
Universal doctrine
Remember each one
Named even this day
We'll never forget
Like it or not
Their beloved is theirs
And they are his
Praise the Lord?
Hail the King?
This to me
A figure of tragedy
They are trivial
They are forgettable
A sombre tale
Of mankind's hope
Show me its truth
And with joy
I will followEmbed
