Anna Lee, The Healer Lyrics
Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
Healer with the healin' hands
Makes you well as quick as she can
You'd love to see those smilin' eyes
Of Anna Lee

From a Himalayan mountainside
Up in Rishikesh
To a California beach house
Facin' towards the sea
Goes a gal who got her fame
By goin' 'round a-healin' folks

Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
Healer with the healin' hands
Makes you well as quick as she can
You'd love to feel those healin' hands
Of Anna Lee

When she gets a chance to help someone, she's really happy
If you trust her with your ill, she'll quickly make you see
She can fix things up for you just like she did for me
Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
She cures people with her hands
I'm just one of her many fans
You'd love to feel those healin' hands
Of Anna Lee
The healer, the healer, the healer, the healerEmbed
