Little Bird Lyrics
Little bird up in a tree
Looked down and sang a song to me
Of how it began

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na

The trout in the shiny brook
Gave a worm another look
And told me not to worry
About my life

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na

The tree in my own backyard
Stands all alone, bears fruit for me
And it tastes so good
Where's my pretty bird?
He must have flown away
If I keep singing
He'll come back someday

At dawn, the bird's still gone
Guess I'll go mow the lawn
What a day, what a day
Oh, what a beautiful day this is

Little bird up in a tree
Looked down and sang a song to me
The trout in the shiny brook
Gave a worm another look
And told me not to worry about my life

A little bird looked down
And sang a song-ah! To me!
A little bird looked down
And sang a song-ah! To me!
A little bird looked down
And sang a song-ah! To me!Embed
