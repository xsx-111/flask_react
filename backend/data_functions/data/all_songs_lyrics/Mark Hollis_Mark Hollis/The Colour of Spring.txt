The Colour of Spring Lyrics
"Forget our fate"
The peddler sings
Set up to sell my soul
I've lived a life for wealth to bring
And yet I'll gaze
At the colour of spring
Immerse in that one moment
Left in love with everything

Soar the bridges that I burnt before
One song among us all


Soar the bridges that I burnt before
One song among us allEmbed
