A New Jerusalem Lyrics
And I'm home again
But alone, my child
For the emptiness of war
Remains
One among five
But I'm dead to love
A pawn the same
And I'm home again
Run along, my child
For the water's blood
And so the sea
Summer unwinds
But no longer kind
Heaven, burn me
Should I swear to fight
Once more
D'you see?
Wise words
Wild words
D'you see?Embed
