The Daily Planet Lyrics
Come far, compared to who
Scoop the life you leech
Immune to ruse or rape's heredity

News first
Shall I grow no more than I'm bound?
Enough of the pain

Come far, compared to who
Fuel for the lies you read
Future depths, collective leash

Who's first?
Shall I grow no more than I'm bound?
Enough of the pain
Whose curse?
Shall I grow no more than I'm bound?

Hurts to see over undertone
Shame, last to laugh, noEmbed
