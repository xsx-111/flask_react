Watershed Lyrics
Come my love
Kick the line
Afield lies nothing
But squalor to turn on
A song asale

Should have said so much
Makes it harder
The more you love

Gladdening eyes
Through slur
Emerge crucified
So frail

Should have said so much
Makes it harder
The more you love

A song asale, sold heart

Should have said so much
Makes it harder
The more you love

A song asale
For the good has bled to dust
Departed, the morning sun
For the good has bled to dust
Departed, the morning sunEmbed
