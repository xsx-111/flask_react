Wait a Minute LyricsLet's get just a little too proud
That's the way it seems in the crowd
But it's not quite the same
So you think that you'll never get burned
But you do waiting for your turn
Wait a minute
Let's get just a little too loud
That's the way I see you hidden in the crowds
But it's so far away
But you said I would never get hurt
And I'm here crawling in the dirt
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
So is it that we're really on trial?
Nothing's ever gonna change our style
So you thought you'll never get burned
And I'm here waiting for your turn
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
So give me just a little smile
Cos nothing's ever gonna change for a while
Nothing's ever gonna change for a whileEmbed
