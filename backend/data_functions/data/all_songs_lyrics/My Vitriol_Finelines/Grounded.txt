Grounded Lyrics
Listen to the man
He wants to be your friend
Listen to them all
The voices in your head
And I don't think I know
What everyone else knows
But I don't seem to care

The situation's grounded
Some of us and everyone is grounded
It's too late to go

Listen to the man
His words were never read
Listen to them all
The voices in your head
And I don't think I know
What everyone else knows
But I don't seem to care

The situation's grounded
Some of us and everyone is grounded
It's too late to go

Grounded
Some of us and everyone is grounded
It's too late to goEmbed
