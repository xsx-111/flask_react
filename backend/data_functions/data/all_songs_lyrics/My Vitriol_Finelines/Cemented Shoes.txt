Cemented Shoes Lyrics
Big mouth strikes again at last
When I thought that all was ended

Gratitude for your attitude
But I'm falling at your feet
And I'm crawling at your feet
Conscience is my greatest curse
The fridge is full of just deserts

Fall into all your avenues
And I'm falling at your feet
And I'm crawling at your feet
Big mouth strikes again at last
When I thought that all was at my back

And I'm falling at your feet
And I'm crawling at your feet
And I'm falling on my knees
And I'm crawling on my knees

Have my gratitude for your attitude
And I'm falling at your feet
And I'm crawling at your feet
And I'm falling on my knees
And I'm crawling on my kneesEmbed
