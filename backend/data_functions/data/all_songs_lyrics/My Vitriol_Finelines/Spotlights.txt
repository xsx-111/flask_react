Spotlights LyricsYesterday they came
And took you away
Waiting for a change
They walk the alien lanes
Into outer space
I know the time will change
You're turning round
But the spotlights will follow you round
Yesterday's the day
They took you away
It all seems so strange
You look the other way
Cos they're playing their games
All the same again
You're turning round
But the spotlights will follow you round
You're running out now
But the spotlights will follow you round
The spotlights will follow you round
You're coming down
You're only light years away
You're falling down
You're only light years away
But you were always light years away
You were always light years awayEmbed
