Falling Off the Floor LyricsIt's just as empty as it seems
Is there something to believe, my friend?
I know they'll hurt you once again
But I'll give you something for the pain
I'm spinning round
Falling through the ground
What time will mend
They'll put back again
Always one to ask for more
This time you are ending up like before
Nothing's left but you alone
And you know they'll never be on their own
I'm spinning round
Falling through the ground
What time will mend
They'll put back again
I'm spinning round
Falling through the ground
What time will mend...
They'll hunt you down, you down, down
They'll drag you downEmbed
