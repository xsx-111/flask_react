Infantile Lyrics
Half the girl I used to be
She's still dressing up inside of me
Not everything is so pink and blue
But that's the way it seems to you

Lying in a darkened room
Trying to re-write the rules
I'm falling in, I'm falling out
I guess that's what it's all about

If only all the world could see
But they're not like you or me
But I don't mind
I don't mind

I know today that you will see
Your equations splitting at the seams
The pavement cracks to fuck you up
False sympathy to shut you up

Perverted for your right to preach
I'm slipping slowly from your reach
I'm falling in, I'm falling out
I guess that's what you're all about
And if all the worlds a stage
Count me out of this play
But I don't mind
I don't mind

'Cause you've been locked inside a day
You're going out of your way
And so am I
So am IEmbed
