It Came Crashing LyricsAnd it's only a thousand miles away
But I'm coming and I'm taking you away
And she's trying to find the words
As she's turning off the waterworks
For a while
And I'm trying to get a hold
But it feels like we are getting old
Before we know
And it's early for the coming of your age
And it breaks me, the decisions that we'll make
And she's trying to find the words
As she's turning off the waterworks
For a while
And I'm trying to find a way
But they came crashing all the way
But still, baby, what can I say?
And she's trying to find the words
As she's turning off the waterworks
For a while
And I'm trying to find a way
But they came crashing all the way
But still, baby, what can I say?Embed
