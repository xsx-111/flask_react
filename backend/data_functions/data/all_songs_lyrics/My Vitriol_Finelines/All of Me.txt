All of Me LyricsIt's gone on far too long
Why are you never wrong?
And I'm a foreigner at home
Before you know it I'll be gone
Me, yeah, it's all of me
Yeah, it's all of me, yeah
Can't you see?
You've taken all the life that's left in me
And what for?
Please don't ask me
I don't really know
I don't know
And everything I've done
Feels like I'm the only one
And I'm a foreigner at home
Before you know it I'll be gone
Me, yeah, it's all of me, yeah
It's all of me, yeah
Can't you see?
You've taken all the life that's left in me
And what for?
Please don't ask me
I don't really know
I don't know
Can't you see?
You've taken all the life that's left in me
And what for?
Please don't ask me
I don't really know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't knowEmbed
