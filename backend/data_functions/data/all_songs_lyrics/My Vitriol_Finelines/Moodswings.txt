Moodswings LyricsYou're breaking down inside
You're breaking down inside
It's just a matter of time
And you're wasting mine
You're spitting at the sky
You're spitting at the sky
Cos it's raining on you
But what else can you do?
Spring time pulls you away
And there's nothing left here to say
They're trying to tell you
They're trying to tell you
What you always knew
Yeah, you knew right from the start
You abdicate your throne
You abdicate your throne
And now you're all alone
Yeah, you're all alone
Your conscience nags you again
But the time has gone for amends
Your conscience kills you again
And there's no one left to blame
But there's no one to blame
And they're trying to get you down
And they're trying to get you down
Spring time drags you away
And there's nothing left here to say
Spring time pulls you away
Cos there ain't much more that I can take
Fuck you!
Ahhhhhhh
AhhhhhhhhhhhEmbed
