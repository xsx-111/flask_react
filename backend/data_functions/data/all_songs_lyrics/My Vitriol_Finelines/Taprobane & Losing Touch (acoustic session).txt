Taprobane & Losing Touch (acoustic session) LyricsIt's your finest day
And I'm gonna do everything to hurt you, my love
I'm running out of power
It's only you now and your holy water, water
I'm losing touch
I guess you lost your flower
Funny how you couldn't find another, another
Glad that it's all over
Cos I'm really sick of falling over, over
I'm losing touch
Last chance for the modern man
Stay silent if you can, but everything's okay
And I knew it'd come to this
When everything had ended, but everything's okay
And everything's okayEmbed
