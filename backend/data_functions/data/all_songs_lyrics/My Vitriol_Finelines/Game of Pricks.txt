Game of Pricks LyricsI've waited too long to have you
Hide in the back of me
I've cheated so long I wonder
How you keep track of me
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
I entered the game of pricks
With knives in the back of me
Can't call you or on you no more
When they're attacking me
I'll climb up on the house
Weep to water the trees
And when you come calling me down
I'll put on my disease
You could never be strong
You can only be free
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to me
And I never asked for the truth
But you owe that to meEmbed
