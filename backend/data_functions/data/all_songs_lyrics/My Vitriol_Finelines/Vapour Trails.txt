Vapour Trails LyricsThey're taking over
They're taking root inside your head, yeah
Them up above you
They'll take advantage till the end, yeah
And it's all the same
In every way
Just for a moment
You thought that everything would end, yeah
You're falling over
You're tripping every step of the way, yeah
And it's all the same
In every wayEmbed
