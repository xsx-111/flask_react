Static LyricsI sunk my eyes in static
You taught me how to see it
Now there's no sign of her at hand
So I'm through looking at it
My head is splitting trying
To read the name that you abandoned
Congratulations sister
You put yourself right over
Though you don't think I understand
Pinned down but unexamined
Though you keep right on looking
At static there behind my eyes
But I'd never say
It didn't mean that much to me
But I'm glad anyway
Just to see you struggle free
But I'd never say
It didn't mean that much to me
And I'm glad anyway
Just to see you struggle freeEmbed
