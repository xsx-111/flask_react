Ode to the Red Queen LyricsHere we are again
Finding ourselves at the end
Of the wrong stick
I guess it's far too late
I'm building up the barricades
In my head
And I guess you'll learn soon
She said, someday
They're swallowing you whole
You're waiting for them all to choke
On the bones
Another sorry case
The surgeons trying to save his face
From the clones
And I guess you'll learn soon
She said
And I guess you'll learn soon
And I'm trying hard to
Understand your ways
And I guess you'll learn soon
She said, somedayEmbed
