Another Lie LyricsWhy are the stories all the same?
Seems like they always end this way
I feel so lonely and confused
And all those things I miss of you
I thought we had more
I thought we had more
Was there something I didn't know?
You lied to me
You lied to me
You don't care if you're hurting me
I guess I'm not just sad in a way
What we never saw in a day
It feels like hell to be alone
I guess I'm back on my own
I thought we had more
I thought we had more
Was there something I didn't know?
You lied to me
You lied to me
You don't care if you're hurting me
Is there anyone out there?
Is there anyone out there?
Is there anyone out there?
At allEmbed
