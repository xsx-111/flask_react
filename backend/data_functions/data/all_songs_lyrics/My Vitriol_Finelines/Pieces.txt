Pieces LyricsGive me a sign
Am I wasting your time?
I wanted you to run out
I wanted you to run
This time
Give me a heart
Cos I'm falling apart
I'm turning back the hands now
I'm turning back the hands
I'm coming back with all the pieces
But I'm coming back with all the pieces
All the pieces
All the pieces
Lend me your eyes
Cos I'm losing my sight
From all the crooked faces
From all the twisted fate
I'm coming back with all the pieces
But I'm coming back with all the pieces
All the pieces
All the pieces
And I'm turning away...Embed
