The Gentle Art of Choking LyricsDon't look at me that way
I know what you're gonna say
It's on your face
The scars went up in flames
While we waited for the rain
That never came
They tried to follow you
Yeah I always wanted to
Through black and blue
But how can I explain
When you're taking all the blame
Until the end
They've left you out on your own
And they've broken all of your bones
And I'm turning
And I'm walking away
Don't look at me that way
I heard what you had to say
It's not your place
The feelings are replaced
And the words have all decayed
And it's another day
And it's another day
And it's another day
They've left you out on your own
And they've broken all of your bones
And they're turning
And they're walking away
And they're turning
And they're walking awayEmbed
