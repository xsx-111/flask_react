Always: Your Way Lyrics
Another day has gone
Some other time maybe
I'll come out
I'll step into the sun
A little time ago
I didn't want to see
Us falling out
But everything has gone

I wish I could
Sometimes I wish I would
Always your way
You want it all
I did everything I could
Always your way

I'm talking to the walls
I guess it seems that all the weight is gone
Like everything else now
And in my broken jar
All the remains are watered down
And I'm starting to drown
I wish I could
Sometimes I wish I would
Always your way
You want it all
I did everything I could
Always your way


I wish I could
Sometimes I wish I would
Always your way
You want it all
I did everything I could
Always your way

Always your way
Always your way
Always your way
