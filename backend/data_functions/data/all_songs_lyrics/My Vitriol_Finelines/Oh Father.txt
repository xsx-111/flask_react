Oh Father LyricsIt's funny the way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you once had the power
I never felt so good about myself
Oh father, you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Oh father...Embed
