Safety Zones & Crumple Zones LyricsShe'd turned away for the day
She's showing them now
They're looking for tags on their toes
On their toes...
Blood, taken in...
And the walls are closing in
Won't you stay another day, baby?
They're buzzing around this frozen town
They're whispering all the time
You're losing your face
What would they say, would they say...
Blood, taken in...
And the walls are closing in
Won't you stay another day, baby?
If you could face another day, babyEmbed
