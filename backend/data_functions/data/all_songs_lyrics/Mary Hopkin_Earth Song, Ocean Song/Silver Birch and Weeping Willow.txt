Silver Birch and Weeping Willow Lyrics
Silver birch and weepin' willow
Glidin' swan and circlin' swallow
I'm standin' here watching the sun go down
And I'm wond'rin' if he will come

Silver birch and weepin' willow
Heather bed and bracken pillow
I'm sittin' here watchin' the sun go down
And I don't think that he will come


Lyin' here watchin' the sun sink
Change the river, turn the swans pink
Lyin' here watchin' the sun go down
And I don't care at all if he don't come

Silver birch and weepin' willow
Mm-mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm, mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm, la-la, laEmbed
