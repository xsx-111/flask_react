International LyricsHey
Jesus, hey, it's me
Well, I’ve gone international
And become very rational
As you decreed
Hey
Jesus, it's our day
Now, I can bring them home to you
Though I may lose out on a few who care to stray
We'll make them see international
We’ll make them be international
Like you and me
Hey
Jesus, it's okay
Now, we have common interests
And we can help along the rest
To be like we
We'll make them see international
We'll make them be international
Like you and me
Hey
Jesus, you'll agree
They're going downhill very fast
And it don't look as though they last
'Til Judgement Day
We’ll make them see international
We’ll make them be international
Like you and me
Hey
Jesus, hey, it's me
Well, I’ve gone international
And become very rational
As you decreedEmbed
