Water, Paper and Clay Lyrics
Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the way

Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the way

Water to bless the child
Drink the holy wine
Rain and sea
The berry tree
Storm and calm
The will to be kind

Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the way

Bright paper leaves we'll throw
Dream of your wedding day
Ashes and pens
A confession to cleanse
The printed vow
And the unwritten way
Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the way

Cold clay to bury you
Bring you safe to ground
Salt and sand
The practical hand
The pull of the earth
And the world going round

Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the way

Fire to burn and prove the clay
Fire to turn the ground
From the flames you'll fly
And feel the air
And the rush of the wind
Will bear you down
Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the way

Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the way

Water, paper and clay
Air to carry you
And fire to burn the wayEmbed
