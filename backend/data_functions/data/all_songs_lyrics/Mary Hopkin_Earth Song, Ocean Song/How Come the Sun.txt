How Come the Sun LyricsHow come the sun didn't make it today?
Is it tired of what it's been shining down on?
Could it be God didn't wake it today?
You couldn't blame Him
Sometimes it feels like the sun just comes up out of habit
And goes down as quick as it can
These days you just have to grab it as it goes by
How come the stars didn't come out tonight?
Are they tired of what they've been shining down on?
Could it be God had a few doubts tonight?
You couldn't blame Him
Sometimes it seems like the stars are just going through motions
They don't see the point of it all
They shine, shine, but you get the notion they wonder why
Maybe the sun saw everyone pulling his neighbour's hair
He couldn't rise without the skies filling with filthy air
Do you suppose that he knows
That he knows, but he won't tell us?
How come the moon just won't rise up and shine?
Is it tired of what it's been shining down on?
Could it be God couldn't make up His mind?
You couldn't blame Him
Sometimes it feels like the moon's heart just isn't in it
It gives less than all of its light
It shines, shines, but just when it's greatest it starts to die
How come the sun didn't make it today?
Is it tired of what it's been shining down on?
Could it be God didn't wake it today?
You couldn't blame Him
Sometimes it feels like the sun just comes up out of habit
And goes down as quick as it can
These days you just have to grab it as it goes byEmbed
