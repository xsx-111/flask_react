The Wind LyricsI listen to the wind
To the wind of my soul
Where I'll end up well, I think
Only God really knows
I've sat upon the setting sun
But never, never, never, never
I never wanted water once
No, never, never, never
I listen to my words
But they fall far below
I let my music take me
Where my heart wants to go
I swam upon the devil's lake
But never, never, never, never
I never make the same mistake
No, never, never, neverEmbed
