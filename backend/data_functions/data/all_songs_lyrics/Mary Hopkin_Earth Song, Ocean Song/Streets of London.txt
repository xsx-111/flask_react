Streets of London Lyrics
Have you seen the old man in the closed down market
Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
And held loosely by his side
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking
Just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind
In the all-night caf√© at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an hour
And he wanders home alone

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seamen's mission?
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city
The rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero and a world that doesn't care

So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun dont shine?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mindEmbed
