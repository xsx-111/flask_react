Martha LyricsMartha sits by the telephone
Hoping someone will call, she's on her own again
She has so much she can talk about
And there'll be gossip she can hawk about again
Did you stumble home drunk and loud
To an empty room with no one waiting there?
Is your life a black and broken cloud?
Then Martha will feed upon your despair
See the curtain move, she watches you
Listening through the broken walls and rotting floors
Don't make a slip, Martha catches you
Hiding on landings and peering 'round the doors
Did you enjoy yourself and laugh and sing?
Then Martha will disapprove and shake her head
No matter what the day ahead will bring
Martha will circulate each word you said
Like the vulture Martha hovers high
Waiting to pounce upon your shattered dreams
Her twisted smile and her nodding head
Disguise her haggard world of lies and schemes
Who was it took and broke her young girl's heart
And branded it and burned her mind?
Who was it tore her life apart
And left it for the rats to find?
Martha sits by the telephone
Hoping someone will call, she's on her own again
She has so much that she can talk about
And there'll be gossip she can hawk about againEmbed
