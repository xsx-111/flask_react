Earth Song LyricsI have climbed your crystal mountain
And I have walked up and down your highways
I have walked up and down your highways
And it's a long, long time I've been wonderin'
Where it is that I am goin'
I have seen your sun's reflection
And I have built a boat to catch it on the water
To catch it on the water
And it's a long, long time I've been wonderin'
What it is that I resemble
We have gathered all together
And we have surely loved one another
We have surely loved one another
And it's a long, long time we've been waitin'
For your secret night song
Oh, show me your simplicity
And I may find you are a part of me
And I am a part of you
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of your big white rollin' ocean
Oh, but I want to be invisible
I have climbed your crystal mountain
And I have walked up and down your highways
I have walked up and down your highways
And it's a long, long time I've been wonderin'
Where it is that I am goin'Embed
