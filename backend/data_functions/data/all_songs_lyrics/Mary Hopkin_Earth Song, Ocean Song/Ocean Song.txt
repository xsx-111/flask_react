Ocean Song Lyrics
When you're alone there's no one to forgive or mend
Your mind is blind, your senses will not blend
You feel the strain, you see the stain
And you can't get back again
Got to hitch a ride with a friend to the end of the ocean

Your wisdom hides you from your fate sometimes
Looking into mirrors for signs of nursery rhymes
You hear the call, tear down the wall
But there's one more flight of stairs to climb
Got to give a ride to a friend to the end of the ocean

If sorrow's spiral leaves you looking down
Calling like some madman on the sleeping town
Don't look back, you can't turn back
Give bread to all who ask
'Cause you found a friend to take you to the end of the ocean
Oh, you found a friend to take you to the end of the ocean

Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ah
Ahhh, ah, ahEmbed
