Out in the Street Lyrics
Out in the street
I'm talking about slowly
I'm not going to rest
Woman, you don't know me

Yeah, you don't know me, no
Know me, no
Know me, no
Yeah, but I'm a-going to know you

Hey listen, woman
You just can't throw me
I won't stand it
If you don't know me


Listen to me
I'm telling you
You look at me, woman
Yeah, tell the truth
I know your mind
I can see that you're in need
I'll show you woman
Yeah, that you belong to me

Give me no reasons
Said you'd go free
It's not going to be now
If you got to know me
