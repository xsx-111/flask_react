Much Too Much LyricsMuch too much to bear
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bear
If I ever leave you, darlin'
I hope you see
That I really love you
But your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bear
When I make love to you
Do all the things you want me to do
You never think of me
Always cry a bevy
Bevy of tears
'Cause your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bear
There was a time I could give all I had to you
But my enthusiasm waned, and I can't bear the pain
Of doing what I don't want to do
Much too much to bear
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bearEmbed
