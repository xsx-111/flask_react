Buckingham Rabbit LyricsBack then, I had a Buckingham rabbit
I'd been lonely since she found Christ
Now is the time to depend on the law
The nights of my professional life
It's the nights of my professional life
I was living in a very young city
Grand piano, great lakes, goodbye
If you ask me my name, it's high-low-jack in the game
I can track a single bee to the hive
Every single game was a blowout
And the NASCAR blurred into porn
Scenic this, scenic that, don't fall for the traps
Of a man who was never born
A man who was never born
So the rent became whiskey
And then my life became risky
And so the rent became whiskey, whiskey
Shattered dogs on the rocks
At the back of the bar, there's a couch
Where the lonely people go and lie
They talk to the honky tonk psychiatrist
Into the wee hours of the night
Into the wee hours of the night
The factory's on muscle relaxers
The pine perfume of hilltown floors
The lover, the thinker, the talker, the singer
Won't be lucid for her anymore
They won't be lucid for her anymore
And so the rent became whiskey
And then my life became risky
And so the rent became whiskey, whiskey
Shattered dogs on the rocks, shattered dogs on the rocks
When you know how I feel, I feel better
When you're fifteen, you wanna look poor
You do unto others and run like a mother
I don't wanna look poor anymore
No, I don't wanna look poor anymore
Jesus in a runaway shelter
Said, "The deaf have pictures of you"
From the digital fountains to the analog mountains
Let the mirror express the room
Let the mirror express the room2Embed
