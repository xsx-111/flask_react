Federal Dust LyricsThey don't walk
They don't talk in Malibu
They don't vote
They don't even smoke, I know you're blue
I know you're blue
I know you're blue
They don't cream
And they don't dream in Kansas City
They don't cry
They don't, they never act, I know you're ready
I know you're ready
I know you're ready
They don't cry
And they don't die in South Dakota, just like a seagull
They don't mash
They don't hatch in South Dakota
In South Dakota
Here comes the coda
Not much water coming over the hill
Not much, not much, not much
Not much water coming over the hill
Not much, not much, not much
Not much water coming over the hill
Not much, not much, not much
Not much water coming over the hill
Not much, not much, not muchEmbed
