Like Like the the the Death LyricsLike, like the, the, the death
Air crickets, air crickets, air crickets, air crickets, air
Mother and child with magazine
Into a story, into a dream
Why is there something instead of nothing?
And how is the asking built into the hunting?
Do you believe in MGM endings?
Everybody's coming back to Christmas for Texas
Folks who've watched their mother kill an animal know that their home is surrounded by places to go
And the west has made a deal with the sun
My life at home every day
Drinking coke in a kitchen with a dog who doesn't know his name
Oh, right, it could have been anyone
Grass rabbits, grass rabbits, grass rabbits, grass rabbits, grass
Nobody cares about a dead hooker
Looking like one, standing for many
Life finds a limit at the edge of our bodies
A stranger begins wherever I see 'em
Let's live where the indoors and the outdoors meet
All the kids in the commonwealth are free
Every morning you forgive me, every evening you relive me and the thing itself is what you give me
And the morning has cut a deal with the east
Like, like the, the, the death
Air crickets, air crickets, air crickets, air crickets, airEmbed
