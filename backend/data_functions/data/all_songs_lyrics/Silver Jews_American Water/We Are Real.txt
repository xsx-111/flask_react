We Are Real LyricsUp the hill past 694, at the stone wall make a left
And I will see you soon, my friend
If these old directions still direct, oh yeah
If these old directions still direct
Is the problem that we can't see, or is it that the problem is beautiful to me?
Birds of Virginia are flying within you
Like background singers, they all come in threes
Like background singers, they all come in threes
Won't soul music change now that our souls have turned strange?
Once a day, twice a day
When on and off collide
We'll set our souls aside and walk away
We've been raised on replicas
Of fake and winding roads
And day after day, up on this beautiful stage
We've been playing tambourine for minimum wage
But we are real, real
I know we are real
Repair is the dream of the broken thing
Like a message broadcast on an overpass
All my favorite singers couldn't sing
All my favorite singers couldn't sing
My ski vest has buttons like convenience store mirrors
And they help me see
That everything in this room right now is a part of me
Oh yeah, is a part of me
Won't soul music change now that our souls have turned strange?
Once a day, twice a day
When on and off collide
We'll set our souls aside and walk away
Realizing is how it feels
Inside when it happens to you
So I took a shot of sugar like snow dumped into the blood
And children wander off into the ultra-economic
But we're real
We are real
I know we are real
I know we are real
I know we are real, real, real, real, real1Embed
