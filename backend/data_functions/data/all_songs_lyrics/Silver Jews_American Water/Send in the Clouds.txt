Send in the Clouds LyricsSend in the clouds and bring down the rain
Shut all the blinds, and turn out the lights
I feel insane when you get in my bed
I am the trick my mother played on the world
Seventeen doctors couldn't decide
Whether I should be allowed in the game
Why can't monsters get along with other monsters?
Soi disantra

I know a puppy who walked from Kentucky
Made it to East Virginia by dawn
He had seventeen ideas in his head
Windex tears flow down the robot's face
He'd never felt a mother's embrace
My momma named me after a king
I'm gonna bury my name in you
Why can't monsters get along with other monsters?
Soi disantra
Soi disantra
They don't want t'ah
Why can't monsters get along with other monsters?
Soi disantra
Soi disantra, yeah
Soi disantra
Soi disantra
Soi disantra
Whoa, soi disantra
Soi disantra
Whoa, whoa1Embed
