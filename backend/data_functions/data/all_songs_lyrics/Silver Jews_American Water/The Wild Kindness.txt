The Wild Kindness LyricsI wrote a letter to a wildflower
On a classic nitrogen afternoon
Some power that hardly looked like power
Said I'm perfect in an empty room
Four dogs in the distance
Each stands for a kindness, yeah
Bluebirds lodged in an evergreen altar
I'm gonna shine out in the wild silence
I'm gonna shine out in the wild silence
I'm gonna shine out in the wild silence
And spurn the sin of giving in
Oil paintings of x-rated picnics
Behind the walls of medication, I'm free
Every leaf in a compact mirror
Hits a target that we can't see
Grass grows in the icebox
The year ends in the next room
It is autumn and my camouflage is dying
Instead of time, there will be lateness
Instead of time, there will be lateness
Instead of time, there will be lateness
And let forever be delayed
I dyed my hair in a motel void
Met the coroner at the Dreamgate Frontier
He took my hand, and said, "I'll help you, boy
If you really want to disappear"
Four dogs in the distance
Each stands for a silence, yeah
Bluebirds lodged in an evergreen altar
I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness
I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness
I'm gonna shine out in the wild kindness
And hold the world to its word1Embed
