People Lyrics
Moments can be monuments to you
If your life is interesting and true
It's just the same for a man or a girl
The meaning of the world lies outside the world
People love people and they understand
If you want to renovate your background mind
A federal woman needs municipal man
People gotta synchronize to animal time

You can't change the feeling
But you can change your feeling about the feelings in a second or two, uh huh
People always come around
I'm studying the ceiling on a little afternoon
And when I paint my dining room, uh huh
People gonna come around

I love to see a rainbow from a garden hose
Lit up like the blood of a centerfold
I love the city and the city rain
Suburban kids with biblical names
People ask people to watch their scotch
People send people up to the moon
When they return, well, there isn't much
People be careful not to crest too soon
The drums march along at the clip of an I.V. drip
Like sparks from a muffler dragged down the strip, uh huh
I really hope you'll come around
It's sunny and 75
It feels so good to be alive
Come on, baby, don't stay inside
Everybody's coming out tonightEmbed
