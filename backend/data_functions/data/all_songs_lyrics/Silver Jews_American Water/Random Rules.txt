Random Rules Lyrics
In 1984, I was hospitalized for approaching perfection
Slowly screwing my way across Europe, they had to make a correction
Broken and smokin' where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake
I tell you, they make it so you can't shake hands when they make your hands shake

I know you like to line dance
Everything so democratic and cool
But, baby, there's no guidance when random rules

I know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men's room walls
Maybe I've crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls
But nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed
And that's why it scared me so when you turned to me and said:

"Yeah, you look like someone
Yeah, you look like someone who up and left me low
Boy, you look like someone I used to know"

I know you'd like to line dance
With everything so democratic and cool
But, baby, there's no guidance when random rules
I asked the painter why the roads are colored black
He said, "Steve, it's because people leave
And no highway will bring them back"
So if you don't want me, I promise not to linger
But before I go, I've gotta ask you, dear, about that tan line on your ring finger

No one should have two lives
Now you know my middle names are Wrong and Right
Honey, we've got two lives to give tonight
To give tonight
To give tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh7Embed
