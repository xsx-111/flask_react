Smith & Jones Forever LyricsAre you honest when no one's looking?
Can you summon honey from a telephone?
They sat there with their hooks in the water
And their mustaches caked with airplane glue
O come let us adore them
California overboard
When the sun sets on the ghetto
All the broken stuff gets cold
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever, together forever and ever
Build a stage for Autumn's bitch
They walk the alleys in duct tape shoes
They see the things they need through the windows of a hatchback
The alleys are the footnotes of the avenues
O come let us adore them
California overboard
Holding up their trousers with extension cords
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever, together forever and ever
I've got two tickets to a midnight execution
We'll hitchhike our way from Odessa to Houston
And when they turn on the chair
Something's added to the air
When they turn on the chair
Something's added to the air forever
To the air forever!
Smith and Jones forever!
Smith and Jones forever, together forever and everEmbed
