Midway Lyrics
Send them over the waves
Our sentinels
They report in the news
Position of our foes
This battlefieldÂ´s been chosen, tactically in advance
Time to alert our fighters
We're soon in range

Midway
We meet at Midway
Naval War

Calling all men to deck
Got to be airborne
Head out into the sun
Descending on our foes
This is the crucial moment, in the heat of the war
To fly and hit our targets
Down in the waves
Midway
Display their might, ordering carriers, admirals at war
We meet at Midway
To win the fight, tactics are crucial, naval war
Far from shore, a Pacific war
Bombs are falling from the skies
It's a bomb run day, it's the naval way
A blood-red sun is on the rise


Far from shore, a Pacific war
Bombs are falling from the skies
It's a bomb run day, it the naval way
A blood-red sun is on the rise

Midway
Display their might, ordering carriers, admirals at war
We meet at Midway
To win the fight, tactics are crucial, naval war
Midway
Display their might, ordering carriers, admirals at war
We meet at Midway
To win the fight, tactics are crucial, naval war
Midway!1Embed
