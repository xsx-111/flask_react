Saboteurs LyricsDropped down to a world of ice
A plateau of frozen lakes
A Nazi place of doom in their sights
Training camps on Scottish Heights
To commando saboteurs
A mission of their lives lies ahead
Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold
Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war
Allied time was running short
They would race against the bomb
And hours turned to days, time passed on
As the nature test their strength
They would fight through night and day
To live amongst the wild, stay alive
Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold
Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war
Heroes of the Telemark
Carry Viking blood in veins
Warriors of the northern land
They live forever more
Heroes of the Telemark
Carry Viking blood in veins
Warriors of the northern land
They live forever more

Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold
Warrior soul!
Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war
Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war1Embed
