White Death Lyrics
Almost night, a crimson horizon
Painting thousand lakes red
As your army approach in the east
A hunter is switching his prey
All alone, a man with his gun
Wanders into the wild
Tracks you down, you cannot hide
Once he's onto your trail

Enter the night, a flash in the darkness
White Death is heading your way
The fear of his foes, a hero at home
Hundreds will fall by his gun

You're in the sniper's sight
The first kill tonight
Time to die
You're in the bullet's way
The White Death's prey
Say goodbye

After the dawn when morning is broken
Snow once white turn to red
Blood red snow tells what happened last night
A tale of a sniper is born
Snow in mouth hiding his breath
He is steady at hand
Eye to eye target in sight
The moment to fire has come
Hundreds of kills, a man and his rifle
Embody the sisu of Finns
Stay out of sight and cover your head
When he pulls the trigger, you're dead

You're in the sniper's sight
The first kill tonight
Time to die
You're in the bullet's way
The White Death's prey
Say goodbye


You're in the sniper's sight
The first kill tonight
Time to die
You're in the bullet's way
The White Death's prey
Say goodbye

(You're in the snipers sight)
Snipers sight
(You're his first kill tonight)
First kill tonight
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)
Say goodbye
(You will fall by his gun)
(You're in the snipers sight)
Snipers sight
(You're his first kill tonight)
First kill tonight
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)
Say goodbye
(White death is coming for you)5Embed
