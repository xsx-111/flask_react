Screaming Eagles Lyrics
Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazis cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone
Alone!
Alone!

Sent from the skies jumped into the unknown
The march to Berlin has begun
Spearhead the charge surrounded by foes
Eagles are leading the way

France is still under enemy rule
Push Axis retreat

Thrown towards Arnhem a bitter defeat
They're stretched out just one bridge too far
Turn of the tide it's breaking away
Losing momentum retreat

Go to Bastogne the crossroads must hold
Stand alone in the cold
Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazis cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone
Alone!
Alone!

Dig your own foxholes or dig your own grave
The storm is about to begin
The siege has begun there's nowhere to run
Panzerkampfwagen emerge

Tanks and mortars are shaking the ground
Prey of man and machine

Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazis cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone

Chill of the winter bite to the bone and Christmas is drawing near
Soldiers are freezing
The death toll increasing
They're dying in their holes
There's no surrender, there's no retreat, the Wehrmacht is drawing near
There's no reinforcements they're fighting all alone

Sent from the skies ended up in Bastogne
As Easy as hard as they get
Nazi command request and demand
Offer surrender declined

Nuts
The general's word echo clear
Nuts
The Nazis shall hear

Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazis cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone

Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazis cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone3Embed
