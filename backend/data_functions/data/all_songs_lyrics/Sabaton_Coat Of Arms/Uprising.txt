Uprising Lyrics
Warsaw, rise!

Do you remember when, when the Nazis forced their rule on Poland?
1939 and the Allies turned away
From the underground rose the hope of freedom as a whisper
City in despair - but they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
They were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
Was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw, city at war!
Voices from underground whispers of freedom
1944, help that never came.
Calling Warsaw, city at war!
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you, Warszawo Walcz!

Spirit, soul and heart
In accordance with the old traditions
1944, still the Allies turned away
Fighting street to street in a time of hope and desperation
Did it on their own and they never lost their faith
Women, men and children fight
They were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
Was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw, city at war!
Voices from underground whispers of freedom
1944, help that never came
Calling Warsaw, city at war!
Voices from underground, whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you, Warszawo Walcz!


All the streetlights in the city
Broken many years ago
Break the curfew, hide in the sewers
Warsaw, it's time to rise now!
All the streetlights in the city
Broken many years ago
Break the curfew, hide in the sewers
Warsaw, it's time to rise now!
Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground
Whispers of freedom
1944 help that never came
Calling Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground
Whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
‘Warszawa, walcz!’3Embed
