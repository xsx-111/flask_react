The Final Solution Lyrics
Country in depression, nation in despair
One man seeking reasons everywhere
Growing hate and anger, the Führer's orders were precise
Who was to be blamed and pay the price

Wicked propaganda turning neighbors into foes
Soldiers of the Third Reich searching homes
And then their former friends are watching as they are round up one by one
Times of persecution’s just begun

Ever since it started on Kristallnacht ‘38
When liberty died and truth was denied
Sent away on trains, set on a one-way trip to hell
Enter the gates, Auschwitz awaits

When freedom burns, the final solution
Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust
When millions burn, the curtain has fallen
Lost to the world as they perish in flames

There was a country in depression, there was a nation in despair
One man finding reasons everywhere
Then there was raising hate and anger, the Führer's orders still apply
Who was to be blamed and sent to die
Ever since it started on Kristallnacht '38
When liberty died and truth was denied
Sent away on trains, sent on a one-way trip to Hell
Enter the gates, Auschwitz awaits!

When freedom burns, the final solution
Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust
When millions burn, the curtain has fallen
Lost to the world as they perish in flames

When freedom burns, the final solution
Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust
When millions burn, the curtain has fallen
Lost to the world as they perish in flames5Embed
