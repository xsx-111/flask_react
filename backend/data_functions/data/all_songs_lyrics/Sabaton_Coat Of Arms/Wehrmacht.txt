Wehrmacht Lyrics
Pulled into war to serve a vision
That's supposed to last a thousand years
Part of a machine unstoppable
As merciless as tidal waves
Were they the victims of the time
Or proud parts of larger goals?
Propaganda of the Reich
Masterful machine
Time and again the battle rages on
Beyond the gates of misery
As casualties rise and millions die around them
Did they see it all?
Crazy madmen on a leash
Or young men who lost their way?
Grand illusions of the Reich
May seem real at times

Panzers on a line
Form the Wehrmacht's spine
Lethal grand design
What about the men executing orders?
Panzers on a line
Form the Wehrmacht's spine
Lethal grand design
What about the men executing orders?

Ad victoriam
Ex machina
Non sibi sed patriae
Ad victoriam
Ex machina
Non sibi sed patriae

Pulled into war to serve a vision
That just didn't last a thousand years
Part of a machine
Though stoppable as merciless as tidal waves
Crazy madmen on a leash
Or young men who lost their way?
Grand illusions of the Reich
May seem real at times

Panzers on a line
Form the Wehrmacht's spine
Lethal grand design
What about the men executing orders?
Panzers on a line
Form the Wehrmacht's spine
Lethal grand design
What about the men?2Embed
