Coat of Arms Lyrics
At dawn, envoy arrives
Morning of October 28th
No-day proven by deed
Descendants of Sparta
Athens, and Crete
Look north, ready to fight
Enemies charge from the hills
True arms facing defeat
There's no surrender, there's no retreat

Time after time, force their enemies back to the line

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of Arms reading "Freedom or Death"
Blood of King Leonidas!

Air raid, pounding the land
Bombers are flying both day and night
Endure, six days of rain
Dropped by invaders
Bomb raid in vain!
Strike hard the tables have turned
Drive them back over the hills
At arms just like before
Soldiers, civilians, Hellas at war

By their own hand forced the enemy out of their land

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of Arms reading "Freedom or Death"
Blood of King Leonidas!

Just like their ancestors ages ago
Fought in the face of defeat
Those 300 men left a pride to uphold:
Freedom or Death in effect


Then, now again
Blood of heroes saving their land
Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of Arms reading "Freedom or Death"
Blood of King Leonidas!

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of Arms reading "Freedom or Death"
Blood of King Leonidas!1Embed
