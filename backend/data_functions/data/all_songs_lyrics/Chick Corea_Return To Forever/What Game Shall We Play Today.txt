What Game Shall We Play Today Lyrics
Look around you,  my people
If you look then you will see how to love
Life is paradise

All together!
What game shall we play today?

Man just wants to be happy
Cast off things that shouldn't be, set him free!
Life is paradise

All together!
What game shall we play today?



There's a way you can find it
It's within you, can't you see? Find the truth!
It's not impossible
All together!
What game shall we play today?

Now, here we are all together
Free to have and do and be, what we see
For the first time

All together!
What game shall we play today?1Embed
