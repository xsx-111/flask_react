Sometime Ago / La Fiesta Lyrics


Sometime ago, I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?

And all the music, it was playing
And all the firelight, it was dancing
And all the children, they were singing
And all the people, they were loving

Sometime ago, I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the morning sun, it was soft and cool
Oh, the evening breeze, it was warm and gold
All together life had started to unfold, sometime ago

Sometime ago, I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the morning sun, it was soft and cool
Oh, the evening breeze, it was warm and gold
All together life had started to unfold, sometime ago
