Quiver a Little Lyrics
Talk to me friend, talk to me, talk to me
I am listening to your advice
Slowly, slowly, please, slowly
We have a lot of time
Sometimes I would wish, I would wish that you were I
To see clearly, not just visualize

Many people said
Oh I’m lost, I’m a bastard, Oh I’m lost
Those same people pray
For the best, for their own brothers
So why would I quiver but quiver a little
Then burst in laughter
Quiver a little

Read all the books and you will find
Nothing new has been hidden underneath the sun
Integrity is sometimes hard to climb
But if I look up, not down, and maybe who knows
I might go a bit further up there, and further up there

Many people will say
Oh you’re lost, you are a bastard, you’re lost
And those same people pray
For the best, for their own sisters
And so I will only just quiver a little
Then burst in laughter
Life is as cold not literally as in Greenland
Where snowfall is the norm
As opposed to the ray of sunlight
But, like the boy who woke up one night
To see his poor mother on the floor
And he screamed, “Mother, mother, wake up, wake up, mother!”
So why would you waste a lot of your energy
On what, what people might say

Just quiver a little
Then burst in laughter
Just quiver a little
Just quiver a little
Just quiver a little
Then burst in laughter
Quiver a little
Then burst in laughter
Quiver a little then get back to your strideEmbed
