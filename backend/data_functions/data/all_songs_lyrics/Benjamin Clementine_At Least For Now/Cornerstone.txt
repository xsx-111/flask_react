Cornerstone Lyrics
I’m alone in a box of stone
When all is said and done
As the wind blows to the East from the West
Unto this bed my tears have their solemn rest

I am lonely, alone in a box of stone
They claimed to love me, but they’re all lying
I've been lonely, alone in a box of my own
And this is the place I now belong

It’s my home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home
It's my home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home

It wasn’t easy getting used to this; I used to scream
That it’s not true, that it’s only when a door is locked
That nobody enters
Cause mine had been opened till your own demise
But none had come, well who am I?
What have I done, what have I done?

I've been lonely, alone in a box of my own
They claim to be near me but they’re all lying, it's not true
I've been lonely, alone in a box of my own
And this is place I now belong
It's my home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home
It's my home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home

Friends I have met, lovers have slept and wept
Promises to stay had never been kept
This bare truth of which most won’t share
I hope you share

Cause I’ve been lonely, alone in a box of my own
They claimed to love me
And be near me, but they’re all lying
I've been lonely, alone in a box of stone
And this is the place I now belong

It’s my home, home, my home, home, home, home, home, home
It's my home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home6Embed
