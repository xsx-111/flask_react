St-Clementine-on-Tea-and-Croissants Lyrics
Where, where is your son?
Where did he go?

This Clementine is on tea and croissants
This Clementine is on tea and croissants

Where, where is your son?
Where did he go?

This Clementine is on tea and croissants
This Clementine is on tea and croissants, leave him alone

Sweet, sweet Sugar Stranger
Where did he go?

This Clementine is on tea and croissants
This Clementine is on tea and croissants, leave him alone

Sweet, sweet Sugar Stranger
Where did he go?
This Clementine wants no more problems
This Clementine wants no more problems

This Clementine is enjoying his tea and croissants
This Clementine is on his tea and croissants todayEmbed
