The People and I Lyrics
Woman, why are you looking at me?
Woman, what are you looking for?
Here the nation’s plea to hear
How our down and fall came about
And woman, don’t close your eyes
Let’s be fair, we stand no more chance
And I am done
And these times are precious times
Only for the people and I

Woman, the truth is here
They ought to see it clear
Excuse me, I’m in a middle of a song
Right after two years long
In between different sheets
Far beyond deceits
Dancing through the streets of infidelity
And oh woman, don’t close your eyes
Let’s be fair, we stand no more chance
And I am done
And these moments are precious moments
Only for the people and I

Oh yes, oh yes
Said I sing for the people and I
And I write for the people and I
I speak for the people and I
Cause they are done
And we are done
And I am done
So these moments and times are precious
For the people and IEmbed
