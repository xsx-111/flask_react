London Lyrics
Now as he sits on the back of this grey caravan
Tomorrow he will probably be
Jumping Parisian metro barriers with
A bottle in his hands

Sparkling, sparkling water mixed with
Peaches and rum
Honestly I don’t drink but if I did this will
Be my favorite punch, he said

Walk out the door with her
And he could see everyone
Dressed in black a class
That seems too far too fetched

She said, “Look at you, look at you, the game is over
The cup is full, your cup is full, stop praying for more exposure”

“It is obvious that you are trying
Dubious stop or you will die here
You’re pretending but no one is buying”
London, London, London is calling you, what are you waiting for
What you searching for?
London, London, London is all in you, why are you denying the truth?
“I might, I might, I might be boring you” he said
“Although it’s not clear as the morning dew
When my preferred ways are not happening
I won’t underestimate whom I am capable of becoming”

History will be made today is written
Boldly on his face
So clear you could hardly miss it
You could hardly miss it

For transcending the barriers of
Yesterday was and is the dream
On a road where Cleopatra comes and goes
Like fishes caught in ponds then thrown back for fun

She said, “look at you, look at you, just pick a fleet
Your cup is full, your cup is full, what have you not yet achieved?”

“It is obvious that you are trying
Dubious stop or you will die here
You’re pretending but no one is buying”
London, London, London is calling you, what are you waiting for
What you searching for?
London, London, London is all in you, why are you in denial of the truth?
“I might, I might, I might be boring you”, he said
“Although it’s not clear as the morning due
When my preferred ways are not happening
I won’t underestimate who I am capable of becoming”2Embed
