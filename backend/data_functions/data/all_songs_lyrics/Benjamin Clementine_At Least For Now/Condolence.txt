Condolence Lyrics
I swear, that you’ve seen me
Yes, you’ve seen me here before, before
And so don’t tell it, don’t tell it otherwise

This voice, this particular voice
Yes, you’ve heard it before, before
And so don’t you dare tell it
Don’t you dare tell it otherwise

No wonder, why the road seems so long
Cause I had done it all before
And I won

You felt this feeling, tell me don’t be ashamed
You felt it before, before
And so don’t tell me
Don’t tell me otherwise

I almost forgot, foolish me, I almost forgot, forgot
That where I am from we see the rain
Before the rain even starts to rain
No wonder why you’ve been buggering me
This walk, it's a previous journey
And I won

Before I was born there was a storm
Before that storm there was fire
Burning everywhere, everywhere
And everything became nothing again
And then out of nothing
Out of absolutely nothing, I, Benjamin, I was born
So that when I become someone one day
I will always remember that I came from nothing

No wonder, why you’ve been buggering me
Cause this walk, it’s a previous journey
And no wonder why the road seems so long
Cause I had done it all before
And I won

I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to fear
I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to insecurities
You should know by now
You should know by now
That I just don’t care
For what you might say
Might bring someone downhill

I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to fear
I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to insecurities6Embed
