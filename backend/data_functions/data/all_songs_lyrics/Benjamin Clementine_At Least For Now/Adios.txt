Adios Lyrics
Adiós
Adiós
Adiós to your afternoon
Cause tonight I will be forever
Following the colosseum moon
Into a certain room

Adiós
Adiós
I am sorry for quickly jumping into the train
I waited but no one came
You’re just too late

The decision is mine
The decision is mine
So let the lesson be mine
Let the lesson be mine
The decision is mine
The decision is mine
Cause the vision is mine
The vision is mine

Adiós
Yes, goodbye, adiós
Adios to the little child in me
Who kept on blaming everyone else
Instead facing his own defeat in Edmonton
After all, I should have no regret
For if it wasn’t for the mistake I made yesterday?
Where would I be by now?
The decision was mine
The decision was mine
So let the lesson be mine
Let the lesson be mine
The decision was hard
The decision was hard
But the vision is mine
The vision is mine

Yes, I've taken my bags and I'm going down service street, taking a train I know very well, and angels, they come in and go
You know last time when that angel had been in, you know, she left, and I don't know other things about angels anyway
You know, sometimes, uh, you think that you know more than you know, but then you actually don't understand
Anyways when they come to me, they sing to me so beautifully
If I can recall their melodies, it goes, excuse me to take your time, but it goes something, something like this:


Lest the trees cease breathing
Lest the bees cease breeding
And all the salts in the dead sea ferments to honey

Until then, I will be forever
Chasing, chasing, chasing it all till the very end
The decision is mine
Let the lesson be mine
Cause the vision is mine
The decision is mine
Let the lesson be mine
Cause the vision is mineEmbed
