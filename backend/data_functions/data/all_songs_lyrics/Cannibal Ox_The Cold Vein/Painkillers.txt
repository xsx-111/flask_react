Painkillers Lyrics
You know we ?rap? drugs and pain kill
Cause life's ill

Yo, some nights we got so drunk, it's like we miss the feeling
Of a never ending headache and a spinning ceiling
The sob story of an alcoholic
On his hands and knees praying to that porcelain toilet
Whether behind bars or in front of scars
We use medicine to numb the rap bar
I might tell you something that'll change your death
Pain kills the life, pleasure loves the breath
Ox a-cappell, I'll spit this in hell
With L's hanging off my body and no ice cooler
Every rhyme I write is civilize my future wife
Breaking her water in a time without order
Yo, chaos is born, a seance is spawned
And I resurrect light beams that resemble the red dawns
I guess that's why I was born
To recognize the beauty of a rose's thorn
And learn from the strife of a soul that's torn
To be forewarned just to be forearmed (forearmed)
So let that thought settle as we backpeddle
Through the seven seas of info that'll crush your ego
Some of us pop pills and snort coke to pain kill
Some of us rap drugs and bear witness that life's ill
Yo, but true happiness comes from within
You can't rely on a substance, look at addiction for instance
And in an instance you'll wake up out of that Requiem
For a Dream but you still caught it in the rectum
Right here trapped in the box
Thinkin', Rap's all I got, Smoke too much pot
Bones with poems twisted in knots
Cold vein with thoughts, bubbling hot
(Stoned in the bedroom), writin' this poem off the phone
Caught a head rush
Smoke clouded my dome at the end of my ropes
Writing these notes, hopin' to float
Above this bullshit, pull spliffs blowin' the ghosts
The sky's the limit, stay high with vision
Visualize the body righteous
Lost cipher, the mind's wisdom
Helped me through life's transitions
I'm in a tight position
Hungry-ass shit flippin'
With no sex or wretch
This stress got my chest a mess, breathless, I'm vexed
Trying to escape out of the depths of hell's nest
So I rest inhale the trauma blessed
And let the stress exhale through clouds of cess
My mind foggy and body wet
Poppin' shotties, shot straight through the nostril
Cloudy with thoughts of ill type menageries
When pops used to tell me "it wasn't like this with drugs and sex
Up in my day" but poppy
Shit really changed, yo, niggas is losing their minds
And I can't really blame them, I'm losing my brain
In these times and I'm angered with hangovers
Ready to ride off a cliff with a Range Rover
Like I was fuckin' Thelma & Louise
And if I had a trigger I would squeeze, believe
Blow my whole head off and bleed
Trying to get that same feeling, every day pain killing1Embed
