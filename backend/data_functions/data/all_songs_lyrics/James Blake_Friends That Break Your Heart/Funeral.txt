Funeral Lyrics
I hold my ear to a shell
I hear somethin' that no one can sell
Y'know, I should’ve lived by the sea
'Cause I feel invisible in every city

And I know this feeling too well (Too well)
Of being alive at your own funeral
Goin', "Don't give up on me"
Goin', "Don't give up on me"
Please, I'll be the best I can be
I'll be the best I can be
Don't give up on me

I'll come out of my shell
'Cause I want the cake, and I wanna eat it as well
I, I would livе in the leaves that crunch undеr your feet
I wanna be heard if I can't be seen

And I know this feeling too well (Too well)
Of being alive at your own funeral
Goin', "Don't give up on me"
Goin', "Don't give up on me"
Please, I'll be the best I can be
I'll be the best I can beEmbed
