Life Is Not the Same Lyrics
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

I played the ones you know
I took you all the way
But that was yesterday
I wore your favorite clothes
I said the things you'd say
That was yesterday

So if you loved me so much
Why'd you go? (Why'd you go?)
Keep yourself back
Keep on lying, oh
I can only be what I am
Dive in, smiling

Life is not the same
If we're miles away
I was your champion
I did everything your way

We both swim out to sea
You lost me willingly
But that was yesterday
(That was yesterday)
You knew it would get dark
You made sure I would need you
In every way
So if you loved me so much
Why'd you go? (Why'd you go?)
Keep yourself back
Keep on lying, oh
I can only be what I am
Dive in, smiling

Life is not the same
If we're miles away
I was your champion
I did everything your way
Life is not the same
If we're miles away
I was your champion
I did everything to help you stay6Embed
