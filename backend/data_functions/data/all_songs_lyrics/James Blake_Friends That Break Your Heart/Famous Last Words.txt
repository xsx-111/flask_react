Famous Last Words Lyrics
And I can't believe I'm still talkin' about you, that feeling
I should have lost it, I should have lost it by now
I can't believe I'm still holding out and seeing signs
I've truly lost it, I've truly lost it this time

Ooh, you're the last
Ooh, you're the last of my old things
Ooh, the cast from my broken limbs

I can't believe I'm still walkin' around a believer
I should have lost it, I should have lost it by now
And I can't believe I'm still makin' excuses for your crimes
I've truly lost it, I've truly lost it this time

Ooh, you're the last
Ooh, you're the last of my old things
Ooh, the cast from my broken limbs

You're the famous last words
I wish I nеver uttered
That I wish I nеver stuttered
But I wish I kept tied to me
Ooh, you're the last
Ooh, you're the last of my old things
Ooh, the cast from my broken limbs
Ooh, you're the last
Ooh, you're the last of my old things
Ooh, the cast from my broken limbsEmbed
