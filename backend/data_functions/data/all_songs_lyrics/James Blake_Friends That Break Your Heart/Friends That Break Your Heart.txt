Friends That Break Your Heart Lyrics
I have haunted many photographs
In the background, in the fore
And as many loves that have crossed my path
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
It was friends who broke my heart

Well fair do's, nobody prepares you
And nobody's prepared, nobody's prepared
And they tell you "Just you wait
It kills you, and only love can break you
More the more you care
And all, and all in love is fair"
But it's not fair

I have haunted many photographs
In the background, in the fore
And as many loves that have crossed my path
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
It was friends who broke my heart
And I've pushed myself to be vulnerable
And then slept with one eye wide
All that pain and nothing gained in the end
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends

In the end, (In the end) it was friends
In the, in the end
In the, in the end
In the, in the end
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
It was friends who broke my heart4Embed
