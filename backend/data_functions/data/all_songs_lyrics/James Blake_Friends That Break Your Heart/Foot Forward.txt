Foot Forward Lyrics
Metro

It was built, in a day
So it fell, in a day
What do you expect?
What do you expect, what do you expect, what do you expect?
At best, we're a stretch
And a leash, won't hold my neck
I'm a mess
What do you expect, what do you expect, what do you expect?

And it's okay, I know I'll be replaced
A bitter aftertaste, but it's not that bad
It's okay, there's nothing to explain
Only yesterday, you weren't so sad

Keep your breath, keep my texts
Who's next? (Who's next?) Who's next?
I hope it connеcts, I'm not at my best
But I put my best foot forward
Foot forward, foot forward
I put my best foot forward
Foot forward, foot forward
What еlse can I do?
Foot forward, foot forward, foot forward
I put my best foot forward
Foot forward, foot forward
And it's okay, I know I'll be replaced
A bitter aftertaste, but it's not that bad
It's okay, there's nothing to explain
Only yesterday, you weren't so sad

Who's next
And it's okay
Who's next? I
Who's next? I
Who's next? I
Who's next? I
And it's okay
Who's next? I
Who's next? I
Who's next? I
Who's next? I

And it's okay, I know I'll be replaced
A bitter after taste, but it's not that bad
It's okay, there's nothing to explain
Only yesterday, you weren't so sad2Embed
