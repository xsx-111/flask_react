Show Me Lyrics
Show me
I wish you'd show me
Show me
I wish you'd show me

I heard you can show love
It's just not come out for me
I heard you had a sweet way
That I have yet to see
I wish you'd show me
I wish you'd show me

Show me
I wish you'd show me
Show me (I wish you'd show)
I wish you'd show me

I heard you know it's over
But you didn't get that from me
I heard you're wearing new colours
That no one has ever seen on you
I wish you'd show me (Mmm)
I wish you'd show me
'Cause there was nothing stopping you before
And nothing I'd have loved more
Than seeing you at your best
And I waited 'til me eyеs were sore
'Causе there's nothing I'd have wanted more
Than to see you at your best

Show me
I wish you'd show me (Ah)
Show me
I wish you'd show me (Ah)

I hope the person after
Gets all that you held from me
They get to be a fresh start
While I'm another casualty
I wish you'd show me
I wish you'd show me (I wish you'd show)Embed
