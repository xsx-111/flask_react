Lost Angel Nights Lyrics
Whatever makes you
Whatever makes you feel

Lost angel nights
Never jaded eyes
Envy is no crime
Away from me's just fine
Lost angel nights
Never jaded eyes
Envy is no crime
Away from me's just fine

Yes, I've been in my own way
But in my own way
I kept it going, I kept it going for us
We had so much going for us
And I been losing my place
And in my place, a thousand imitations rose up
And I hope it's not too late to make up for all those

Lost angel nights
Never jaded eyes
Envy is no crimе
Away from me's just fine
Lost angel nights
Nеver jaded eyes
Envy is no crime
Away from me's just fine
And so you slept all day
The world doesn't wait
And it kept on going, it kept on going around us
We had so much going for us
And I was losing my place
And in my place, a thousand imitations rose up
And I hope it's not too late to make up for all those

Lost angel nights (I know you really had to fight)
Never jaded eyes (I know you really had to lift somebody)
Envy is no crime (Over to the other side)
Away from me's just fine (Over to the other side)
Lost angel nights (I know you really had to fight)
Never jaded eyes (I know you really had to lift somebody)
Envy is no crime (Over to the other side)
Away from me's just fine (Over to the other side)

I fell right in
I fell right in with you
I fell right in
Into the whirlpool with youEmbed
