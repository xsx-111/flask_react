Coming Back Lyrics
Can't stick to that
Can't fade us to black
So I'm coming back, coming back, coming back, coming back
'Cause it hurts, 'cause it hurts like the end of the world
And like betrayal, like betrayal of the soul I'd never thought of before

So I'm coming back, coming back, tail between my legs
Forget what I said, what I said, what I said, what I said
There's a mile between my heart and my head
So I take it all, take it all, take it all back (Take it all back)

You're so down
So down you bring me down
Don't you have a clue about where my mind is right now?
You say you love me, is it real?
What do you fantasize about the things you really wanna feel?
I know you fantasize about that lifе you really wanna build
Know your eyes arе watching God
But baby, my eyes are hidden in the hills
Your first mistake was wanting me when you know I wasn't ready
You put that shit down heavy
Couldn't let you regret me
We memorize about the time we spent when you first met me
I put my shit down heavy (No)
Couldn't let you forget me, mmm (No)
I'll never let you forget me (I)
(I wish I could take you)
Yes I love you and it's real
I went in too soon for the kill (Ooo)
But I really wanna feel
And I think wanna be with you (I wish I could take it)
I couldn't let you reject me (No)
I couldn't let you forget me (No)
I wanted you to respect me
I wanted you to let me in (I wish I could take it)

So I'm coming back, coming back, tail between my legs
Forget what I said, what I said, what I said, what I said (I wish I could take it)
There's a mile between my heart and my head (No, no)
So I take it all, take it all, take it all back (No)

(Ah)
(Take it all back)
(Ah)
I wish I could take it
(Darlin' breathe, simmer)
I wish I could take it
You say you love me, is it real?
You're coming back, coming back, coming back, coming back
Or do you fantasize about the things you really wanna feel?
I know you fantasize about that life you really wanna build
Now your eyes are watching God
But baby, my eyes are hidden in the hills3Embed
