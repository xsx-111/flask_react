Say What You Will Lyrics
Yeah, alright (Woo-hoo)
Two, three

Well, I've been normal, I've been ostracised
I've watched through a window
As my young self died
I've been popular with all the popular guys
I gave them punchlines
They gave me warning signs
I look okay in the magic hour
In the right light with the right amount of power
And I'm okay with the life of the sunflower
And I'm okay with the life of a meteor shower

So, say what you will
Go on, say what you will
You're gonna do it anyway
Go on, just say what you will
You're gonna do it anyway
Go on, just say what you will
Go on, you're gonna do it anyway, say what you will

I can find my way with no superpowers
I can take my place without becoming sour
I might not make all those psychopaths proud
At least I can see the facеs of the smaller crowds
And I'm okay, no, I can drive mysеlf
I've been sobered by my time on the shelf
And I've been normal
And I've been ostracised like a comet
Blazing through an empty sky
So, say what you will
Say what you will (Say what you will)
Say what you will
Say what you will (Say what you will)
So, say what you will
Say what you will (Say what you will)
Say what you will (Say what you will)
(Say what you will)

(Say what you will)
(Say what you will)
(Say what you will)7Embed
