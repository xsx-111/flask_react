Scene One: Regression Lyrics
Close your eyes and begin to relax
Take a deep breath and let it out slowly
Concentrate on your breathing
With each breath you become more relaxed
Imagine a brilliant white light above you
Focus in on this light as it flows through your body
Allow yourself to drift off as you fall
Deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind
Now, as I count back from ten to one
You will feel more peaceful and calm
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
You will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you
Five, four, three, two
If at any time you need to come back
All you need to do is open your eyes
One

Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My subconscious mind starts spinning through time
To rejoin the past once again
Nothing seems real, I'm starting to feel
Lost in the haze of a dream
And as I draw near, the scene becomes clear
Like watching my life on a screen
Hello, Victoria!
So glad to see you, my friendEmbed
