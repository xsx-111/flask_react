Home Lyrics
Shine-lake of fire!
Lines take me higher!
My mind drips desire
Confined and overtired
Living this charade
Is getting me nowhere
I can’t shake this charade
The city’s cold blood calls me home
Home! it’s what I long for
Back home where I belong!
The city, it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow, eternity
My demons are coming to drown me
Help! I’m falling, I’m crawling
I can’t keep away from its clutch
Can’t have it, this habit
It’s calling me back to my home

I remember the first time she came to me
She poured her soul out all night and cried
I remember I was told there’s a new love that’s born
For each one that has died
I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can’t resist myself
No matter how hard I try!
Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I’ll make her my wife!
Her sweet temptation calls me home
Home! It’s what I long for
My home, where she belongs!
Her ecstasy means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
She’s taking me to my home
Help! he’s my brother, but I love her
I can’t keep away from her touch
Deception, dishonor
It’s calling me back to my home
Her story, it holds the key
Unlocking dreams from my memory
Solving this mystery
Is everything that is a part of me
Help! Regression, obsession
I can’t keep away from her touch
Leave no doubt, to find out
It’s calling me back to my home1Embed
