Fatal Tragedy Lyrics
Alone at night, I feel so strange
I need to find all the answers to my dreams
When I sleep at night, I hear the cries
What does this mean?

I shut the door and traveled to another home
I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
I felt that I could trust him, he talked to me that night:

"Lad, did you know a girl was murdered here?
This fatal tragedy was talked about for years!"
Victoria's gone forever, only memories remain!
She passed away, she was so young

Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back!
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind!

As the night went on, I started to find my way
I learned about a tragedy, a mystery still today
I tried to get more answers, but he said, "You're on your own"
Then he turned away and left me as I stood there all alone
He said, "You'll know the truth as your future days unfold"
Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back!
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind!


"Now it's time to see how you died
Remember that death is not the end, but only a transition."2Embed
