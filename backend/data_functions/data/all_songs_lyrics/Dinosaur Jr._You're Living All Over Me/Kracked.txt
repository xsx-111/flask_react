Kracked Lyrics
Come on babe
Come on set me free
I've paid for my crime
Come on babe
Come on, rescue me
Just this last time


I plead the case
I need to space
Don't let it wait
I plead the case
I need to space
Don't let it wait

Come on babe
Come on, set me free
I've paid for my crime
Come on babe
Come on, rescue me
Just this last timeEmbed
