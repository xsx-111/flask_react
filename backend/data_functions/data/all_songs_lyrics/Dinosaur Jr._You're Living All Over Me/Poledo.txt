Poledo LyricsNot an innocent
I've made my place
That subtle turning smirk
That's always fixed upon my face
Walking weakness
Hope I die without a sound
Lonely little boy
With my feet nailed to the ground
I know I'm guilty
My stomach always hurts
Milking your attention
For the little it is worth
I'm turning browner every day
I'm really turning down a stay
Tired of your little man
I've been around too long
Tired of walking, talking with me
Edging me along
Well, I detest your patience
I know you've always known
You know that I'm a thief
So afraid to be alone
Alone
That's that
Nothing's real
I don't care
It's why I know
Darling skip the faith
Only breaks in two
Seem
You don't seem (we don't-- seem)
To care
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Jesus Christ, Christ
In pain
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
I don't see
I don't feel
Like every little moron
I think nothing's real
I don't care
It's the lie I move
Darling skip the faith
That only breaks in two
It's
Good doesn't live and there's no evil hand
Only this great power we misunderstand
So please relax
Take the pain
Laugh out loud
When you forget your name
Please just relax
Take the pain
Laugh out loud
When you forget your name
Please just relax (Jesus)
Take the pain (pain)
Laugh out, out loud
When you forget your name
Good doesn't live
There's no evil hand
Only this great power
We misunderstand (understand, misunderstand, understand)
Let me tell you about everything
Let me tell you about everything
