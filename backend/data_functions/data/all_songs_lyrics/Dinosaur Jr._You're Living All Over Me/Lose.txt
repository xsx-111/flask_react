Lose Lyrics
Can't believe a single word I've said
And every subject's the only one that's dead
And there's nothing from my side
Just yourself
You'll split
I'll begin
'Bout to fight

Greatest stories pass, in my mind
Must be a better way to pass my time
To think the focus just belongs to me
Selfish man, I know I'm nothing to me

So when I thought I had more to say
Swimming in my head
Chained to this corpse for one more day

Little lies start around
Not a show, feel so down
And I struggle right inside out
Reach the wall, and spiral down
Wretchedness and I'm hardly (burning) standing still
I'll be there
Sometimes thinking right
I can't believe I was chosen to exist
Because only Jesus Christ himself can even exist, he says
So though we kill this need to always understand
Cut the world and tell me it fits on the back of your hand1Embed
