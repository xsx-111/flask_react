Just Like Heaven Lyrics
"Show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream," she said
"The one that makes me laugh," she said
And threw her arms around my neck
"Show me how you do it, and I promise you
Promise that I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you"

Spinning on that dizzy air
I kissed her face, I kissed her hair
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make her glow
"Why are you so far away?" she said
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you"

(You) Soft and only
(You) Lost and lonely
(You) Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Sitting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight whipped me into shape
I must've been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

(You)Embed
