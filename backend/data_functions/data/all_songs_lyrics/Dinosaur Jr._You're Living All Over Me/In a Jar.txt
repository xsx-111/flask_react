In a Jar Lyrics
I'll be grazing by your window
Please come pat me on the head
Just want to find out what you're nice to me for
When I look up, don't think I don't know about all the scabs you dread
It's hard to stomach the gore
I know you don't have the patience
To peel 'em off no more

In a jar where you fed me
All I could do was lick your hand
In a jar the scars are plain to see
I hope somehow you'll know I understand

I'll be grazing by your window
Please come pat me on the head
I just wanna  find out what you're nice to me for
Then you smile and decide to take me in
'Cause I look cute by your bed
But I can feel it's just a little more

I'll watch you fall apart, babe, you know it
You know I'm young and stuff, babe, don't blow it
Just unscrew the top, yeah
Pick me up now, just can't stop
In a jar where you fed me
All I could do was lick your hand
In a jar the scars are plain to see
I hope somehow you'll know I understand

Scabs collect beneath your bureau
From the knifings you got1Embed
