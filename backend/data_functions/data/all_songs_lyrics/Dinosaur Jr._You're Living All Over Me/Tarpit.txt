Tarpit Lyrics
Hey, what's bubbling down under there
Why's it screaming? What's unfair
Please excuse it for getting high
Let the shelter swell inside
How should I know
Watch it squirm
It's asking me, what's that I've learned

Stay inside, pull me out of space
Tread me sprinkling grace
Stay and pave my faith

Thought I knew you, stuck out my hand
You bit, wish I could understand
It's a twisted feeling, staring bored
Now it's time to burn the hope I stored
Wait for me there, dash and run
Still, your righteousness won't be outdone

Stay inside, pull me out of space
Tread me sprinkling grace
Stay and pave my faith
Pave my faith, pave my faith
Pave my faith, and pave my faithEmbed
