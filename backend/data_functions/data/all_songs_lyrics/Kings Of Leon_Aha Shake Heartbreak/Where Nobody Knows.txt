Where Nobody Knows LyricsWith hands in the air you look like the girl at the fair with the bubbly eyes
Stonewashed shoe, pulling at a rock but the rock don't compromise
Come up to me say, why are you so skinny and pretty for a boy
Said thanks for the insult and compliment you'll never forget my face no more
I can't hardly reach you and I know it's getting harder to be you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
City I could take you, it will take a little second to break you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
I'll be driving you where nobody knows
Looking pretty pink sitting on a swing, that don't mean a thing at all
You heads on my feets, you barkin' like a puppy dog, sipping like a drink in the sun
Takin for your word, takin for a ride, take you for the evening, dead or alive
Warming up the car packing us some powder to play
I can't hardly reach you and I know it's getting harder to be you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
City I could take you, it will take a little second to break you
So I'll be driving you where nobody knows
I'll be driving you where nobody knows... Jessica...
We like the stones, stoned like a rock, clogging up your nose again
Papa is a searching, devil is a knocking, juice swimmin up my skin here
Here goes now1Embed
