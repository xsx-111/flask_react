Milk Lyrics
Salty leave, salty leave
Tell me the one about the friend you knew
And the last good night that we toasted too
Salty leave
Stay for me, stay for me
We drank wine in the matinee
And the spotlight showed what it chased away
Stay for me

She saw my comb over, her hourglass body
She has problems with drinking milk
And being school tardy
She'll loan you her toothbrush
She'll bar tend your party

Kill me, kill me
I called and called, but I can't get through
Said he's on his own, but his own is you
Kill me
