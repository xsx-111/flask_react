Velvet Snow Lyrics
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Start in on your story and or go
Oh walking like you're stuck in velvet snow
Going cause you're sweating on our floor
Going cause you're sweating on our floor
Dancin' like you'll never dance no more
Oh going cause you're sweating on our floor

Then you go and when you go
You get to goin' way to fast and not so slow
Turn out the lights cause they're coming up bright
And then you go

Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Showing off you're Sunday shaved and lacy
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face


Little Jo she warned me not to call you
Stoked that you were carrying some bad news
Leave it up to me and I'll just drown you
Out into the city that you came fromEmbed
