Slow Night, So Long Lyrics
Slow night so long, she's frenching out the flavour
She's seventeen but I done went and plum forgot it
No tears are gone they're pooling on the table
No tears are gone they're leaving their mark behind

So far so good, she's absolutely wasted
She's hanging up and changing her story around
I just don't know where these ladies come from
I just don't know where they can be found
She's opened up just like she really knows me
I hate her face but enjoy the company
I'll take you home, or back to Oklahoma
You're not so nice, but sex sells so cheap

Rise and shine all you gold-digging mothers
Are you too good to tango with the poor, poor boys4Embed
