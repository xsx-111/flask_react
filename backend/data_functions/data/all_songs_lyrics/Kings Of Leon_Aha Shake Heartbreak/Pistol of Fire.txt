Pistol of Fire Lyrics
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Pistol of fire
Shattered the frame
Go hug your sister
Go love your sister
Go hug your sister
One in the same

Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, come home before the rooster crows

I feel the water
Out in the cool grass
Down in the meadow
Under the tree
It's going to tickle
You're going to giggle
It's going to tickle
Tickle for free
Ah, where is it you want to take me?
Ah, where is it you want to go?
Ah, wrapping up the morning's coming
Ah, home before the rooster crowsEmbed
