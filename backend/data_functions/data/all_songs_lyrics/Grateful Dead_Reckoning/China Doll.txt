China Doll Lyrics
A pistol shot at 5 o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No, I won't tell you a thing

Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

If you can abide it
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away

I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die

Take up your china doll
It's only fractured
And just a little nervous
From the fallEmbed
