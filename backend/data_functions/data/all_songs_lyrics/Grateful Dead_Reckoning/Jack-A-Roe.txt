Jack-A-Roe LyricsThere was a wealthy merchant
In London he did dwell
He had a beautiful daughter
The truth to you we'll tell
Oh, the truth to you we'll tell
She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
But none but Jack the sailor
Her true love ever be
Oh, her true love ever be
Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
He's left his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind
She went down to a tailor shop
And dressed in man's array
She climbed on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
Before you get on board, sir
Your name we'd like to know
She smiled on her countenance
They called me Jack-a-Roe
Oh, they called me Jack-a-Roe
I see your waist is slender
Your fingers they are small
Your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball
I know my waist's too slender
My fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall
The war soon being over
She went and looked around
Among the dead and wounded
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found
She picked him up on in her arms
And carried him to the town
She sent for a physician
To quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple they got married
So well, they did agree
This couple they got married
So why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?1Embed
