To Lay Me Down Lyrics
To lay me down, once more
To lay me down with my head in sparkling clover
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down
To be with you, once more, to be with you
With our bodies close together
Let the world go by, like the clouds a'streaming
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, one last time
To lay me down
To lie with you, once more, to lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
To wake beside you, my love still sleeping
To tell sweet lies, one last time and say good night
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, one last time
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down
To lay me downEmbed
