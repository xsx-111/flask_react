Rosa Lee McFall Lyrics
Out on the lonely hillside in a cabin low and small
Lived the sweetest rose of color my Rosie McFall
Her eyes were bright and shining and her voice was sweet to me
Knew that I would always love her and I hoped that she loved me
My eyes turned to me, my darlin' and this is what she said:
You know that i would always love you when you and I are wed
Then God way up in heaven one day for her did call
I lost my bride, oh how  loved her, my Rosie McFall
I searched this wide world over through cities great and small
But I never found another like my rosie mcfallEmbed
