The Race Is On Lyrics
I feel tears welling up from down deep inside
Like my heart's got a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that i may never shake
You might think that i'm taking it hard since you broke me off with a call
You might wager that i'll hide in sorrow and i might lay right down and bawl

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartaches a going to the inside, my tears are holding back, trying not to fall
My heart's our of the running, true love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches, and the winner loses all

One day i ventured in love never once suspecting
What the final result would be
Now i live in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you're gone from me
There's an aching pain in my heart for the name of the one that i hated to face
Someone else came out to win her, and i came out in second place
