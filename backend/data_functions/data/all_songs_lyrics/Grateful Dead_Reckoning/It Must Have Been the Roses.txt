It Must Have Been the Roses Lyrics
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
In her long brown hair
I don't know, it must have been the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

Ten years the waves rolled the
Ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow
In all good company
If I tell another what
Your own lips told to me
Let me lay neath the roses
Let my eyes no longer see

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the
Ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one
Comes round anymore

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there

Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons
In her long brown hair
I don't know, it must have been the roses
All I know is I could not leave her there

I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know was I could not leave her there3Embed
