Cassidy Lyrics
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the
Silver stream
I can tell by the mark he left you were in his
Dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me
Cassidy...

Lost now on the country miles in his cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me
Cassidy...

Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts:
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly
Fare thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
(repeat verse)
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly1Embed
