Deep Elem Blues Lyrics
If you go down to Deep Elem put your money in your shoes
The women in Deep Elem they give you the deep elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

Once I knew a preacher, preached the Bible through-and-through
Went down to Deep Elem, now his preachin' days are through
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues


When you go down to Deep Elem put your money in your socks
Getting to Deep Elem will put you on the rocks
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

When you go down to Deep Elem to have a little fun
Have your fifteen dollars when the police man come
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

If you go down to Deep Elem put your money in your shoes
The women in Deep Elem got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem bluesEmbed
