SPRING LyricsMind like a flower, a flower falling
A candle in the basement
Nothing is real, but there is a spring inside
Waves breaking still reflect the moon
I erase myself and songs echo
Mind is an ocean
Thoughts are its waves breaking
Awake at dawn, thoughts unformed
(before I remember where I am)
The clear universe is shown
A spring opens up
Mind like a flower falling blooming only to be blown
Borne across the sky unknown
Living life as if it’s not a passing animal dream, a poem
A brief shelter seen as home
Mind like a falling flower like a wide ocean
Reflecting whatever on its dark waves
In rows, unclear, unending thoughts
Distorting the only moon the light from nowhere
Beneath all this, the liquid stone
Beneath the fountains and the road
All solid things I’m shown
A pool of placid water pours in the windows
And nothing is impermeable
The basement’s flooded
The walls are groaning in the wind
I leap beyond all this into the water at night
The spring keeps opening wideEmbed
