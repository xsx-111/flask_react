THIS Lyrics“I tear in dreams across the north sea or I travel mentally wild
Through all million thoughts the mind sings.”
No
Only THIS and from each “this”
I crawl entangled into this
“Pulled out through window”
I blink and I’m gone again
Leaping beyond this while still alive
“This candle glowing”
Shrieking across the dark sky
“I see you through the snow and I’m gone”
Into the spring, all in my mind
Back to this specific spot
In the river in spring thaw
“With all dreams burning off
As if lightning has struck here
I hold this”Embed
