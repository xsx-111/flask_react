EMPTINESS Lyrics
“More emptiness,” I said, “And more, and more.”
When someone asked me what was in my bag
I said, “More emptiness”
Where the house is not is where the room is
The rest of the volcano is sky

“More emptiness,” again, “And more, and more.”
“But what about the lives that we have lived
And all the buildings and poems we made?”
I see you
We are two black holes in a vast night
A van in neutral rolling down a hill unoccupied

“More emptiness,” again, “And more, and more.”
I stood next to the river and threw a large sheet
Of glass as far as I could in
The way the water was cut in two
The sword in sky was mind only
Forming this one thought: emptinessEmbed
