BOAT LyricsI was born out of nowhere
And back to nowhere I’ll return
But for now the river next to the house
The river inside the house, and a person’s form
Disconnected and drifting in my boat
I built this boat on the shore
Pushed it into the waves and was born
In this boat, blown across the north
Another island appears and then goes
Mind only plus the ocean and my boat
There’s no way I will be able
To ever step outside of my boatEmbed
