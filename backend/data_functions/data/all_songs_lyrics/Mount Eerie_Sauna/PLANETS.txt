PLANETS LyricsAs long as I am drawing breath the world still exists
But when I die everything will vanish
The two of us are planets crashing through separate lives
With my eye, every shape created
I donâ€™t know you and you never will know me
From inside my bubble I think I see you
While you smile and yawnEmbed
