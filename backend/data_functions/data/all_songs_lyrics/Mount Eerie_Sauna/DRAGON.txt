DRAGON LyricsThere is a veil between me
And the bottomless sky
Cloud or a sheet billowing
The edge of my mind
Standing on the street
In the rain
(unnamed and unknown)
Only sound
Assuming nothing
Seeing the echoing shape
Of the mammoth that tore
Through the brush here
(A tractor idling
Two blocks away
In the fog, unseen.)
And the dragon that roars now
For all I know
Lost in the weather
Petals blow. Is this a river?
In a palace of water
Nothing is familiar
And the ground always shakes
I dive into
A pool of uncertainty
Going into the basement again
I reach down
