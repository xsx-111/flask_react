To Be Kind Lyrics
To be kind, to be kind
To be kind, to be kind
To be kind, to be kind
To be real, to be new
To be sung by a song that's untrue
The falling sun, the fallen one
In a bed, painted blue, touching you
Listening, just listening
To the rain, to the wind, in the field
To be kind, to be kind
To be lost, in a bed, touching you
To be lost, to be lost
To be found in the sound of this room
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes
There are millions and millions of stars in your eyes5Embed
