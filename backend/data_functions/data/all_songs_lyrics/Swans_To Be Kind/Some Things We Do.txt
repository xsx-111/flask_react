Some Things We Do Lyrics
We seed, we feel, we need, we fight
We seal, we cut, we seek, we love
We grow, we take, we eat, we break
We hunt, we hurt, we seize, we kneel
We heal, we fuck, we pray, we hate
We reach, we touch, we lose, we taste
We learn, we lie, we wound, we waste
We hold, we kill, we love, we veil
We crawl, we seek, we fail, we rage
We fuck, we come, we love, we work
We search, we share, we wound, we keep
We blind, we take, we hide, we hold
We breathe, we steal, we bind, we build
We seed, we fuck, we rage, we weep
We betray, we serve, we regret, we learn
With tooth and claw, we touch, we teach
We fuck, we love, we forget, we regret
We love, we love, we love, we love
We fuck, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love, we love, we love
We love, we love
We fuck, you fuck2Embed
