Nathalie Neal Lyrics
So the chapper is dance with the partner so you do the part now
And you put your hand on your partnerâ€™s buttock
And then you do very little steps, it is a very very dynamic dance

Hey hey hey, Nathalie
Hey hey hey, Nathalie
Love is strong, love is long
Live forever in this song - Nathalie!
Kill the cruel, heal the blind
Cut your name onto the sky - Nathalie!

Hey hey hey, Nathalie
Hey hey hey, Nathalie
Scatter joy, steal the light
Dance upon a useless lie - Nathalie!
Love is strong, hate is gone
Live forever in this song
