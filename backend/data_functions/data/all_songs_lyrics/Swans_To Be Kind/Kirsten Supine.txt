Kirsten Supine Lyrics
May moonlight fall upon your breast
May god send wind to lick your lips
The river flows beneath your comb
Granite, pines
Silver, shine
Green velvet throne
Folding in, folding in
The water brings
The flower string
Folding in, folding in
The water sings
The black horse scream
May planets crash
May god rain ash
To sear our skin
To fold us in
Kneeling close
Seeking hands
Our blood is warm
But what comes next?

I will let it go, I will let it go
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I will let it go, I will let it go
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I won't let it go, I won't let it go
I will let it go, I will let it go
I can let it go, I won't let it go
I will let it go, I can't let it go
I will let it go, I won't let it go
I will let it go, I can't let it go8Embed
