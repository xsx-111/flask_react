Just a Little Boy (For Chester Burnett) Lyrics
Now I sleep in the belly of a woman
And I sleep in the belly of a man
And I sleep in the belly of rhythm
And I sleep in the belly of love
I sleep in the belly of oceans
I sleep in the belly of truth
I sleep in the belly of kindness
And I sleep in the belly of you

I'm just a little boy
I'm just a little boy (laughter)
I'm just a little boy
Just a - just a little boy
Just a, just a

I need love!
I need love! (laughter)
I need love!

I, I, I, I'm just a, just a, just a, just a, just a

I'm not human
I'm not human (laughter)
I'm not human
I'm not - I'm not human, no
I need love
I need love
I need love
I need love

Shut it!
Shut it!
Shut it!
I'm just a-
