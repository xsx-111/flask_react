Screen Shot Lyrics
Love, child, reach, rise; sight, blind, steal, light
Mind, scar, clear, fire; clean, right, pure, kind
Sun, come, sky, tar; mouth, sand, teeth, tongue
Cut, push, reach, inside; feed, breathe, touch, come

No pain, no death, no fear, no hate
No time, no now, no suffering
No touch, no loss, no hand, no sense
No wound, no waste, no lust, no fear
No mind, no greed, no suffering
No thought, no hurt, no hands to reach
No knife, no words, no lie, no cure
No need, no hate, no will, no speech

No dream, no sleep, no suffering
No dream, no sleep, no suffering
No dream, no sleep, no suffering
No dream, no sleep, no suffering

No pain, no now, no time, no here
No pain, no now, no time, no here
No pain, no now, no time, no here
No pain, no now, no time, no here
No knife, no mind, no hand, no fear
No knife, no mind, no hand, no fear
No knife, no mind, no hand, no fear
No knife, no mind, no hand, no fear
No knife, no mind, no hand, no fear
No knife, no mind, no hand, no here
