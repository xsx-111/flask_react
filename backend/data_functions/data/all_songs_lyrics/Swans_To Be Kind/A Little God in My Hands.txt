A Little God in My Hands Lyrics
Pink little lamb, on a granite slab
Black chasm creeping, forever leaking
Oh universe
Sing in reverse
Oh sucking lung
We'll never come
Forever loving!
Forever waiting!

Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
The universal mind!

Eye full of sun, hand full of mud
Oh universe: you stink of love!
Forever lazy
Forever crazy
Forever holy
Forever hungry
Forever hateful
Forever beautiful
Forever needing
Forever reaching
Forever stinking
Forever breathing
Forever growing
Forever leaving
Oh shit and blood!
Forever love!
No ebb or flood, will ever come!
Oh shit and blood!
Forever love, love, love!
Forever draining
Forever leaving
And what's my name?
And what's my name?

Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
The universal mind!20Embed
