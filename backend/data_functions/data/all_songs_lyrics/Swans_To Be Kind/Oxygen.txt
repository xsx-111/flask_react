Oxygen Lyrics
Oxygen
Should you lose some
Oxygen
Oh, check your lung
Oxygen, Amen
Oxygen, Amen
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
Oxygen, I come in, come in
Oxygen, I am coming

Black oil smoke, thick blue sky
Dead red eye, hear me cry
Eat my throat, feed my mind
Yellow eye: Feel me cry
Take me now, peel my skin
Scrape my vein, seal me in
Break my bone, dance and spin
Cut a hole, feed me now!
I'll steal all the oxygen!
La la la la luh luh luh luh luh

Hey there, Dog Man!
Woof woof woof woof woof!
Now I drink from your bowl, hello!
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!
Hey there, Mr Skull
I'm not scared of your cull!
Oxygen, oxygen
Skin tight, skin tight
Brick house, brick house
Oxygen! Amen! Oxygen! Amen!
Breathe in! Breathe in!18Embed
