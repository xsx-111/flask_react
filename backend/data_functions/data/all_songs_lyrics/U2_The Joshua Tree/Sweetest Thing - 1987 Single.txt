Sweetest Thing - 1987 Single Lyrics
Oooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah

My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
But she won't catch me or break my fall
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
Baby got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she likes a dry kind of love
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)

I'm losin' you, yeah heh heyyy
I'm losin' you, yeahhhh
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

I wanted to run but she made me crawl
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
(Oh oh, the sweetest thing)
You know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
Mine is a blind kind of love
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
I'm losin' you, oh oh oh
I'm losin' you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?

(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
Oh ho ho yeah
Umm mao mao
Umm mao baby
Umm mao mao
Umm mao baby

Blue-eyed boy meets a brown-eyed girl
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
And in this, I'm a rain-cloud
You know we got a stormy kind of love
(Ohohoh, the sweetest thing)

Yeahhhhhh
Yeahhhhhhh
Ohohoh, the sweetest thing
Ohohoh, the sweetest thing
Ohohoh, the sweetest thingEmbed
