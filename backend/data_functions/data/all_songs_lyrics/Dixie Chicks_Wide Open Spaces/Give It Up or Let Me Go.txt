Give It Up or Let Me Go Lyrics
Well I told you, pretty baby
Such a long time ago
If I found you with another
Well, I'd walk right out your door
Woah, you might call me crazy
There's one thing you should know
Oh, honey, if you want me to love
You've got to give it up or let me go

I know it's useless to be jealous
Couldn't tie you if I tried
When I'm thinkin' you're messin' around my back
Brings a pain I just can't hide
Oh, baby, I've been true to you
And if I can make that sacrifice
Honey, you can do it too


Well, you come home drunk and nasty
You won't tell me where you've been
Just when things are nice and sweet
Your goin' back out again
Why do you want to mess up a good thing?
I'm gonna find me another man
One that wants to give me everything


Well, I told you, pretty baby
Such a long time ago
If I found you with another
Well, I'd walk right out your door
Woah, you might call me crazy
One thing you should know
Oh, honey, if you want me to love
You've got to give it up or let me go
Give it up or let me goEmbed
