Loving Arms Lyrics
If you could see me now
The one who said that she'd rather roam
The one who said she'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now

If I could hold you now
Just for a moment, if I could really make you mine
Just for a while, turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now

I've been too long in the wind and too long in the rain
Takin' any comfort that I can
Lookin' back and longin' for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your lovin' arms again

If you could hear me now
Singin' somewhere through the lonely nights
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now

I've been too long in the wind and too long in the rain
Takin' any comfort that I can
Lookin' back and longin' for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your lovin' arms again

I've been too long in the wind and too long in the rain
Takin' any comfort that I can
Lookin' back and longin' for the freedom of my chains
And lying in your lovin' arms again

I can almost feel your lovin' arms again2Embed
