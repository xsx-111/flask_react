He Knows You Know LyricsHe knows, you know
He knows, you know
Problems, problems
Problems, problems
Light switch, yellow fever, crawling up your bathroom wall
Singing psychedelic praises to the depths of a china bowl
You've got venom in your stomach, you've got poison in your head
You should have listened to the priest at the confession
When he offered you the sacred bread
He knows you know, he knows you know
He knows you know, but he's got problems
Fast feed, crystal fever, swarming through a fractured mind
Chilling needles freeze emotion, the blind shall lead the blind
You've got venom in your stomach, you've got poison in your head
When your conscience whispered, the vein lines stiffened
You were walking with the dead
He knows you know, he knows you know, he knows you know
He's got experience, he's got experience, he knows you know
But he's got problems
Problems, problems, problems
Problems
Problems
He knows... slash wrists, scarlet fever, crawled under your bathroom door
Pumping arteries ooze the problem through the gap that the razor tore
You've got venom in your stomach, you've got poison in your head
You should have listened to your analyst's questions
When you lay on his leather bed
He knows you know, he knows you know
He knows you know, but he's got problems
Blank eyes, purple fever, streaming through the frosted pane
You learned your lesson far too late from the links in a chemist chain
You've got venom in your stomach, you've got poison in your head
You should have stayed at home and talked with father
Listen to the lies he fed
He knows you know, he knows you know
He knows you know, but he's got problems
He knows you know, he knows you know, he knows you know
He's got experience, he's got experience, he knows you know
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
Don't give me your problems!1Embed
