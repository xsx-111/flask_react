Heart of Lothian Lyrics
Wide boys, wide boys, wide boys, born with hearts of Lothian
Wide boys, wide boys, born with hearts of Lothian
Wide boys, we were wide boys, born with hearts of Lothian
These hearts of Lothian
It's six o'clock in the tower blocks
Stalagmites of culture shock
And the trippers of the light fantastic, bow down, hoe-down
Spray their pheromones on this perfume uniform
And anarchy smiles in the Royal Mile
And we're waiting on the slyboys, flyboys, wideboys
Rooting, tooting cowboys
Lucky little ladies at the watering holes
They'll score the Friday night goals
I was born with a heart of Lothian
I was born with a heart of Lothian
I was born with a heart of Lothian
With a heart of Lothian

And the man from the magazine wants another shot of you all curled up
Cause you look like an actor in a movie shot
But you're feeling like a wino in a parking lot
How did I get in here anyway?
Do we really need a playback of the show?
Cause the wide boy wants to head for the watering hole
Let's go
And the man in the mirror has sad eyesEmbed
