Lavender LyricsI was walking in the park
Dreaming of a spark
When I heard the sprinklers whisper, shimmer
In the haze of summer lawns
Then I heard the children singing
They were running through the rainbows
They were singing a song for you
Well it seemed to be a song for you
The one I wanted to write for you, for you, you
Lavender's blue, dilly dilly, lavender's green
When I am King, dilly dilly, you will be Queen
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love
I.O.U. for your love
Lavender's green, dilly dilly, lavender's blue
When you love me, dilly dilly, I will love you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I.O.U. for your love
I.O.U. for your love
Lavender dreams dilly, dilly, lavender's true
When you miss me dilly dilly, I did miss you
A penny for your thoughts my dear
A penny for your thoughts my dear
I O U for your love
I O U for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
Oh I´m gonna turn back to you
Gonna find my way back to you
For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love
I´m always walking in the park
Always dreaming of a spark
For you1Embed
