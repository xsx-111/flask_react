Waterhole (Expresso Bongo) LyricsWhen the taxis gather in mock solemnity
Funeral hearses court the death of virginity
Was it paradise lost or paradise found?
Did we gain respect or were we holding ground?
You had found true love, or so you believed
And the wideboys tattooed your hearts upon their sleeves
So when you think it's time to go, when you think it's time to go
Don't be surprised, the heroes never show
And the patter merchants selling false impressions
Tipping eyes at the waitress with American expressions
Tie angels to the bar with sweet martini's and their charms
They're lying on every word and every arm
They're turning down their noses to the best lines
And the cheap wines
And the wideboys
They wear their lovebites for their crimes
So when you think it's time to go, when you think it's time to go
Don't be surprised, the heroes never show1Embed
