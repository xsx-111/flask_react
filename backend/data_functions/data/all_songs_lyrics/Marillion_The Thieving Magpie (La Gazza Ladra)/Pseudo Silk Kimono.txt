Pseudo Silk Kimono LyricsHuddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono
Wearing bracelets of smoke, naked of understanding
Nicotine smears, long, long dried tears, and invisible tears
Safe in my own words, learning from my own world's
Cruel joke, cruel joke
Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono
A morning mare rides, in the starless shutters of my eyes
The spirit of a misplaced childhood is rising to speak his mind
To this orphan of heartbreak, disillusioned and scorned
A refugee, refugee
(Safe in the sanctuary, safe)Embed
