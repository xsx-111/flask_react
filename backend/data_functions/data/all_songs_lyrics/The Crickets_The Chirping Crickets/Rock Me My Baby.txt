Rock Me My Baby LyricsPut your arms around me now
And try your best to squeeze me
Love me baby - you know how
Yes, a-rock me my baby
Well, rock a-lock-a hickory-dickery-dock
Rock-a-bye my baby
Up and down - around the clock
Well, a-rock me my baby
Plant your kisses on my lips
And make me bubble brightly
Thrill me to my fingertips
Well, a-rock me my baby
Tell me that you love me too
And say you'll never leave me
No one loves you like I do
So rock me my babyEmbed
