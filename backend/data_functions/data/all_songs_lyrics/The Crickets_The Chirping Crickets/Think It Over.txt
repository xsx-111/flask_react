Think It Over LyricsThink it over, what you've just said
Think it over in your pretty little head
Are you sure think I'm not the one
Is your love real or only fun?
Think it over
Yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old
Think it over and let me know
Think it over, but don't be slow
Just remember all birds and bees
Go by two thro' life's mysteries
Think it over
Yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old
Think it over, an think of me
Think it over and you will see
Happy days when you and I
Think as one and kiss the blues goodbye
Think it over
Yes, think it over
A lonely heart grows cold and old
Think it over, over and over
Think it over, over and overEmbed
