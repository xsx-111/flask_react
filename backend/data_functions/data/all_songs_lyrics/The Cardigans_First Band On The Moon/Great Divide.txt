Great Divide Lyrics
There's a monster growing in our heads
Raised up on the wicked things we've said

A great divide between us now
Something we should know

There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
Something we should know

There's a mountain higher than we knew
It's high but such a bitter view

A great divide between us now
Something we should know

There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
A great divide between us now
On different sides of a great divide

There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
Something we should know1Embed
