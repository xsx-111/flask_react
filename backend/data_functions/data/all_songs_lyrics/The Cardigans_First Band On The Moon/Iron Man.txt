Iron Man Lyrics
I am iron man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all?
Or if he moves will he fall?

Is he live or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

Oh, iron man

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Plan his vengeance
That he will soon unfold
No, nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
And nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Oh

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron man lives again

Oh, iron man

Boop, boo-bee doop, boo-bee doop
Boo-bee doo-bee doo-bee doop
Boo-bee doop, boo-bee doo
Beep, bee-ba deep, bee-ba dee-ba dee-ba dee-ba dee-ba deep
Bee-ba deep bee-deep bee
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ba, ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da
Ba-ba-doo-ba doo-ba ba, ba-baEmbed
