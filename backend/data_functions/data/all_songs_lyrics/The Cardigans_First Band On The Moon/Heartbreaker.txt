Heartbreaker Lyrics
No, not again
Oh, what a man
Just who I thought that I wanted to have
Oh, don't do that
Don't use that bat
That's all it takes to make me falling flat

No, not again
A loser I am

I love you tonight
You are my knight
Cure and assure and make me feel alright
Tomorrow you'll find
I'm not around
But don't be uptight 'cause I loved you last night

Vacant and free
Yeah, that is me
Just tell me how and I'll please you for free
Tell me I'm good
I know I'm bad
Lies make me feel fine although it is sad
No, not again
Not one more man

I love you tonight
You are my knight
Cure and assure and make me feel alright
Tomorrow you'll find
I'm not around
But don't be uptight 'cause I loved you last night
