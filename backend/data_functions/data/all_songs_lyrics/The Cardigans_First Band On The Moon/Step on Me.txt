Step on Me Lyrics
Oh, I think you're standing on my left foot
It's hurting but that's okay
'Cause I'm in your way
You'll break that foot that you're standing on
I'll walk with the other one

Do what you want to do what you want to
Be what you want to be what you want to
Go on and step on me

You're free to have everything you can see
All that you want from me
Free to be all that you want to be
Do what you want with me

Oh, I think you're spinning inside my head
I think of you all the day
'Cause you're in my way
Oh, I think you're holding the heart of mine
Squeeze it apart, that's fine

Do what you want to do what you want to
Be what you want to be what you want to
Go on and step on me
You're free to have everything you can see
All that you want from me
You're free to be all that you want to be
Do what you want with me
Go on and step on me
Go on and step on me
Go ahead and step on me2Embed
