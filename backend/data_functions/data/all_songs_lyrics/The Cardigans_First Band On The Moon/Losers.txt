Losers Lyrics
Close your eyes

Look at all these losers, you find them everywhere
They're fucked up and annoying but somehow you seem to care
It's easier to laugh but something makes you stick around
You can't watch from above and keep your ten toes in the sand

You wish that you were special
I'm just like you

Close your eyes
That'll be the day you'll find those lies
Fold your ears
That'll be the day that you will hear
Close your eyes
That'll be the day you'll find those lies
That'll be the day you get back home

It's lonely to be strange and you would never tell
That you're one of these itches you know it much too well
Losers are your weakness, they will always touch your heart
You are touching me as well 'cause I have always been a part
You wish that you were special
I'm just like you
You're just like me
We're just like them
They're just like us

Close your eyes
That'll be the day you'll find those lies
Fold your ears
That'll be the day that you will hear
Close your eyes
That'll be the day you'll find those lies
Fold your ears
That'll be the day that you will hear
That'll be the day you get back homeEmbed
