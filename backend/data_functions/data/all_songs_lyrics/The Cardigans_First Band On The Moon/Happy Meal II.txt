Happy Meal II Lyrics
Arrange my books in order
Make up some nice stories to amuse you
Make things look smart and easy
Shape up the place

Hungry for the meeting
The dinner we'll be eating
Wine that we'll be drinking
And kinky thoughts I'm thinking
All because of you

And now I've found a partner
No one can be happier than I am
And now I've found a new friend
No one can be happier than me

Prepare a meal with candles
Sweet wine and strings chosen for the purpose
Then take a bath with bubbles (bubbles)
Shape up my face

Eager for the meeting
The dinner we'll be eating
Wine that we'll be drinking
And kinky thoughts I'm thinking
All because of you
And now I've found a partner
No one can be happier than I am
And now I've found a new friend
No one can be happier than me

Happier than me
Happier than me
Happier than meEmbed
