Never Recover Lyrics
How I always memorize every single misery
And I seem to glorify everything inside of me

And the hero never dies
If the lover hides between the sheets
There's no escape 'cause you can't sleep
And then you'll see you're just like me

That's what you called waste of time
I'll be waiting down the line
That's what you called waste of time
Waiting for your valentine
That's what you called waste of time
I know where your hero hides
That's why you don't sleep tonight
That's what I call, that's what you call
That's what I call life

With a hero in the past, you hang on to history
Such a loss will always last and there's no recovery

And the hero never dies
If the lover hides between the sheets
There's no escape 'cause you can't sleep
And then you'll see you're just like me
That's what you called waste of time
I'll be waiting down the line
That's what you called waste of time
Waiting for your valentine
That's what you called waste of time
I know where your hero hides
That's why you don't sleep tonight
That's what I call, that's what you call
That's what I call, that's what you call
That's what I call, that's what you call
That's what I
(That's what I call life)

That's what you called waste of time
That's what you called waste of time
That's what you called waste of time
That's why you don't sleep tonight
You're waiting for your valentineEmbed
