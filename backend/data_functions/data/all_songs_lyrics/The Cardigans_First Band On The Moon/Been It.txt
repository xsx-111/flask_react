Been It Lyrics
Baby boy
Your face is pretty and your life's a toy
Master man
I'm never better than your latest plan

Poor donee
What are you gonna try to be?
Where are you gonna go without me now?

I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
Who can ask me for more?

Superstar
I've tried to educate your childish heart
I made your bed
And I was in it when your faith was dead

Poor donee
What are you gonna try to be?
Where are you gonna go without me now?
I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
Who can ask me for more?

Sweetie pie
I'm your personal pro, you know
You know what number to try when to cry

I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
Who can ask me for more?
You can't ask me for more
Ahh-oh, ahh-oh
Ahh-oh, ahh-ohEmbed
