Hard Road Lyrics
Old men crying, young men dying
World still turns as Father Time looks on
On and on
Children playing, dreamers praying
Laughter turns to tear as love has gone
Has it gone?

Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road

Whirlwind churning, lovers learning
On this path of life, we can't back down
Is it wrong?
Widows weeping, babies sleeping
Life becomes the singer and the song
Sing along

Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load!

Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to hurry
We'll meet in the end

Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to worry
Let's sing it again

Brother's sharing, mother's caring
Nighttime falling victim to the dawn
Shadows small
Days are crawling, time is calling
To the Earth, another life is gone
Love line's drawn

Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load!

(Oh, it's a hard road)
(Oh, it's a hard road)
Forget all your sorrow (Oh, it's a hard road)
Don't live in the past
And look to the future (Oh, it's a hard road)
'Cause life goes too fast, you know
Forget all your sorrow (Oh, it's a hard road)
Don't live in the past
And look to the future (Oh, it's a hard road)
'Cause life goes too fast, you know
Forget all your sorrow (Oh, it's a hard road)
Don't live in the past
And look to the future (Oh, it's a hard road)
'Cause life goes too fast, you knowEmbed
